Sterlite is principally a copper smelting and refining business in
India with two small copper mines in Australia. The capacity at
Tuticorin smelter was increased in April 2005 from 180,000 tpa
to 300,000 tpa. The output is refined into copper cathode and 
rod at Tuticorin and Silvassa.
KCM is an integrated copper operation based in the heart of the
Zambian copper belt. It was acquired in November 2004, with
capacity for 250,000 tpa of finished copper.
MALCO and BALCO are integrated aluminium producers
with captive bauxite mines. MALCO, in Tamil Nadu, is the only
aluminium producer in southern India with capacity of 35,000 
tpa. The more substantial operations at BALCO, in Chhattisgarh,
are close to major supplies of bauxite and coal. Capacity at
BALCO is being expanded from 100,000 tpa to 350,000 tpa, 
with commissioning expected in March 2006. VAL, in Orissa, is 
a new project which will mine bauxite and refine alumina mainly
for the new aluminium capacity at BALCO.
HZL is India’s only integrated lead and zinc producer and one of
the lowest cost producers in the world. The main operations are
in Rajasthan, north west India. In May 2005 the facilities were
expanded to take capacity from 220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa of
finished zinc.
Vedanta listed on the London Stock
Exchange in December 2003. It is in
the FTSE 250, Metals and Mining
sector. The principal operations are
located in India, with further operations
in Zambia and Australia. Vedanta has a
unique profile of organic growth with
an investment pipeline of $2.2 billion –
expanding production in each of our
metals. Vedanta offers access to the
exceptional opportunities of India,
which combines low metal
consumption with world class but
undeveloped mineral resources. The
Group believes it has the skills and
opportunities to deliver highly cost
effective projects which will secure
Vedanta’s position as a world class,
cost competitive producer.
Optimise the performance of the existing assets
Vedanta’s plans for its Businesses will de-bottleneck plants, improve efficiency, expand output and
drive down unit costs. Major projects include a new power plant and zinc smelter at Chanderiya,
expansion of the Rampura Agucha zinc mine and the expansion of the Tuticorin copper smelter. 
Both of our new projects are now complete. In April 2005, a new copper smelter was
commissioned at Tuticorin increasing capacity from 180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa. In May 2005, 
the new power plant and zinc facilities at Chanderiya were commissioned, taking capacity from 
220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa.

and future growth. 
The project at Korba is on track for commissioning in March 2006. The alumina for this expansion
will come from the new bauxite mine and refinery now under construction at Orissa. Funding is
fully in place for all projects.
Consolidate the Group structure
Vedanta will seek to increase its direct ownership in the underlying Businesses. 
The Group has made significant progress increasing and raising our share of profits from 46% in the
prior year to 52% in the second half of the year. An option over the Government’ s 49% holding in
BALCO is currently in progress. There is an option over the Government’ s 30% holding in HZL
exercisable in 2007 and the potential to take ownership in KCM from 51% to 80%. Opportunities
to consolidate the Group structure will continue to be pursued, where they add value.
Leverage established skills 
Vedanta will seek further growth opportunities in India, including the Government’s privatisation
programmes and also outside its traditional Indian base, in operations where its proven
transactional, operating and turnaround skills can provide a competitive advantage. 
The KCM operation in Zambia was acquired during the year, and expansion and improvement of
this operation is anticipated using the experience developed at our existing operations. We will
take advantage of further opportunities as they arise.

Commentary
The expansion at T uticorin received permission in April
2005 which will take our production of ﬁnished copper
from 180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa. Costs have continued
to be held under control, declining from 7.8 US cents per
pound to 7.1 US cents per pound. With the expanded
capacity we hope to reduce costs toward our target of
6.0 US cents per pound, which will reinforce our status 
as one of the lowest cost operators globally .
Commentary
Vedanta acquired a 51% stake in Konkola Copper
Mines of Zambia in November 2004. This transaction
has been earnings enhancing in its ﬁrst year. The
immediate aim is to stabilise and raise production,
and reduce unit costs. We are pursuing the
development of the Konkola Ore Body Extension
Project, which will dramatically change the output
and life-of-mine at the operations.

The existing assets operated well through the year 
with production at full capacity for the period. Proﬁts
rose sharply, beneﬁting from rising metal prices.
Considerable progress has been made on the 
major expansion at the Korba plant, BALCO with
$562 million of the $900 million budget spent to 
date. The project is on track for commissioning 
in March 2006.
Commentary
The ﬁnancial performance of HZL was exceptional
over the course of the year, beneﬁting from high zinc
prices and strong sales. The expanded smelter was
commissioned in May 2005 and raises the capacity
from 220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa. It was delivered
on schedule and below budget.

Chairman’s Statement
Vedanta is a unique growth story and our proﬁle of
organic growth is unrivalled in the metals and mining
industry. This has been an exciting year for Vedanta.
We have made strong progress and have delivered
on several of our development projects. We continue
to focus on our growth strategy and have moved
forward in all areas. We remain conﬁdent of
continuing to deliver this growth in the year ahead.
At the time of our Listing we set out a four part
strategy. The ﬁrst pillar of our strategy is to optimise
the performance of our existing assets, which
includes the expansions in our copper and zinc
operations. In April 2005, we started commissioning
our copper smelter at Tuticorin and the new 
300,000 tpa facility is producing metal. On 31 May
2005, we announced the commissioning of the new
facilities at Chanderiya, supported by the expanded
output at Rampura Agucha mine. This was
completed around 15% below the forecast budget
of $425 million and well below the benchmark costs
for comparable international projects. We will
continue to look for opportunities to optimise
performance and lower costs in all aspects of 
our operations. 
The second part of our strategy is to complete the
two greenﬁeld projects; the 250,000 tpa aluminium
complex at BALCO, and the new 1 million tpa
alumina plant at Orissa. The facilities at BALCO 
are proceeding on schedule, we are carrying out
technology trials on some of the pots and are
producing metal. The alumina reﬁnery at Orissa 
is also on track and budget. As mentioned in our
April 2005 production report, public interest
submissions regarding environmental clearance are
currently being addressed within a timetable set by
the Supreme Court of India. 
The third pillar of our strategy is the consolidation of
our Group structure and further good progress has
been made over the year. The most signiﬁcant
change came from the $434 million rights issue in
Sterlite which allowed us to increase our Economic
Interest in Sterlite to 81% and to inject funds into
Sterlite for use in our expansion programme. The
exercise of the option in BALCO continues to
proceed with independent valuers having been
appointed by the Government. We will continue to
pursue opportunities to simplify the structure of the
Group where possible.
In November 2004 we completed our acquisition of
Konkola Copper Mines, at a gross cost of
$49.2 million. This forms the fourth pillar of our
strategy; leveraging our existing skills through
investment opportunities. At current high copper
prices Konkola is proﬁtable, but the aim is to place
the operations in a position where they are more
proﬁtable through the commodity cycle and to give
KCM a more solid long-term outlook. Our immediate
focus is to improve processes and stabilise production
levels. There are considerable opportunities for future
development at KCM, including the world class
Konkola Ore Body with resources of 210 million
tonnes containing copper at 3.8%.
During the year the Company received its ﬁrst credit
rating, Baa3/BB, since upgraded to BB+. This placed
us at the Indian sovereign limit, which given the
dominance of Indian assets was as high as could be
expected. We raised $600 million in a bond issue and
the Board believes that we have a well balanced mix
of funding in place for our current expansion
projects. Over the year we have spent $735 million
on our $2.2 billion project pipeline. This brings total
spending to date to $1,029 million. We are conﬁdent
of remaining within our gearing target of under 45%
of Capital Employed throughout our current
spending programme.
We believe that there are several opportunities that
will allow us to develop our growth strategy further
and extend the expansion pipeline. This will take
advantage of the strong cashﬂow that will be
produced as the current projects come into
production and reﬂects the many options that we
have to continue to achieve volume growth in the
long-term.
We are reviewing further aluminium smelting
capacity, to take advantage of the production from
VAL, with the possibility over time of an additional
500,000 tonnes of ﬁnished aluminium per annum.
We also signed a memorandum of understanding
with the State Government of Orissa regarding an
iron ore project with related steel facilities. These are
both at an early stage and any projects will be
pursued on the basis of maintaining positive ﬁnancial
returns. There are opportunities for expansions
elsewhere in our existing operations, and we are
evaluating projects in both zinc and copper. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 5
Chairman’ s Statement continued
This has been an exceptional period for metal prices
driven by strong demand from China. This has also
had an impact on several input prices, particularly
energy related costs such as oil and coal. There has
been much talk of a super cycle and the potential for
a prolonged period of above average commodity
prices. Our policy is to remain focused on delivering
our new projects and lowering our costs, which will
allow us to take advantage of the signiﬁcant growth
opportunities offered within India and to stay proﬁtable
regardless of the commodity market cycles.
A new Government, led by the Congress party, was
elected in India in May 2004. The new Government
has maintained a policy of growth and liberalisation.
Metal use in India continues to grow above global
levels and the long-term attractions of the Indian
economy remain considerable. India has been much
talked about as an attractive investment destination,
attracting growing levels of foreign investment and
the potential to become a major regional
manufacturing hub. I believe we are well placed both
to take advantage of this growth and also to
contribute to the future development of India by
providing vital basic resources.
In March 2005, I took over as Chairman of the Board
and KK Kaura became Chief Executive. I would like
to thank Michael Fowle, my predecessor as
Chairman, and Jean-Pierre Rodier for their guidance
and input during the past year. Sir David Gore-Booth
sadly died during the year and his counsel will be
greatly missed. I am pleased that we have appointed
three new Non-executive Directors with
complementary experience and we intend to appoint
a further senior independent Non-executive Director
in due course.
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend for the year of
11.55 US cents per Ordinary Share, an increase of
5% on last year’s implied ﬁnal dividend of 11.0 US
cents. Last year we paid a single dividend of 5.5 US
cents per Ordinary Share, for the four months for
which we were listed, equivalent to an annual
payment of 16.5 US cents per Ordinary Share. The
total dividend for the year is 17.05 US cents per
Ordinary Share. The increase in dividend at this early
stage reﬂects the Board’s conﬁdence in continued
successful delivery and we remain committed to a
progressive dividend policy.
The delivery of our projects and the growth of our
business could not have been achieved without the
efforts of the Board, management and employees 
of Vedanta, who have shown great commitment to
building this success.
The success in all areas of our strategy over the past
year has been encouraging and in the next twelve
months we will see progressive beneﬁt from the
recently commissioned facilities at Chanderiya and
Tuticorin and a full year’s contribution from KCM. 
We remain focused on completing Korba and Orissa
as well as evaluating opportunities to extend our
unique growth pipeline. We are conﬁdent of
showing good progress over the next twelve 
months and delivering value to all stakeholders.

The copper operations of Sterlite have now been
signiﬁcantly expanded taking total capacity from
180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa. The project included
new acid and oxygen plants and a 22.5 MW power
plant. A new cathode reﬁnery of 120,000 tpa 
and 100,000 tpa rod plant have also been built 
at T uticorin.
The site is well placed for export from the nearby 
port of T uticorin. Anode from T uticorin will continue 
to be reﬁned at the existing plant at Silvassa for the
domestic market. Sterlite is already one of the lowest

The delivery of this expansion programme is transforming our business,
increasing production across all metals and further lowering costs.
Korba power plant
Aluminium is a signiﬁcant user of power 
and the new facilities at Korba are being
accompanied by a 540 MW power plant, 
to be powered with local coal. 
The total expansion is due to be commissioned
in March 2006, but we anticipate starting to
use the power plant in July 2005. 
The plant consists of four units which will 
be introduced in stages as production at the
new smelter is ramped-up.

Chief Executive’s Review
Over the past twelve months, we have shown good
operational delivery on our existing assets and made
excellent progress on our expansion pipeline. The
year was again weighted towards the second half
with production, turnover and proﬁtability rising
through the year in all areas. Zinc and aluminium
both enjoyed signiﬁcant increases in proﬁtability in
comparison to the previous year. The acquisition of
KCM, in November 2004, also contributed to our
turnover and margin. Strong metals prices were a
consistent factor, which more than offset high
energy costs and the impact of tariff cuts.
Group turnover has increased 46% to $1,884
million, compared to last year, and EBITDA has
increased by 41% to $455 million, of which $295
million was in the second half of the year, including
$76 million from KCM. Operating proﬁt has
increased by 40% to $332 million. Strong metals
prices have more than offset rises in some input
costs, such as energy, and reductions in import tariffs
by the Government. EBITDA Margin has remained
consistent at around 24%. Underlying Proﬁt has
increased by 81% to $138 million from $76 million,
and EPS, based on Underlying Proﬁt, by 81% to 48.1
US cents per Ordinary Share. This reﬂects the beneﬁt
of the successful changes in the Group structure,
which has increased the proportion of earnings
retained within the Group.
The expansions at the Tuticorin copper plant and
Chanderiya zinc plant were completed shortly after the
year end and the aluminium expansion at BALCO is in
its ﬁnal phase before commissioning. There are many
opportunities to develop KCM and we have a clear
strategy on how to take these assets forward. These
expansions should result in steadily building production
over the coming year, with the ramp-ups of copper,
zinc and aluminium contributing towards a rise in
production in the second half of the current year.
Tariffs on metal imports into India were cut twice
during the year, at a special post-election budget in
July 2004 and at the annual budget in February
2005. Tariffs now stand at 10% on each of our major
metals, around the level recommended in the report
produced by the Kelkar Committee for the
Government.
Growth in India has continued at a good pace and
this has been reﬂected in demand for metals. The
new Government has continued with policies to
promote growth and development in India. Industrial
production in India has risen by around 8% during
2004 and ofﬁcial Government forecasts anticipate
similar levels for this ﬁnancial year. Metals demand
should also beneﬁt from a targeted rise of 14% in
infrastructure spend by the Government. India is well
placed to play a growing role in the global metals
and minerals markets, both from domestic demand
and the development of resources and facilities.
Our organisation continues to develop and grow. The
use of programmes such as TPM and Six Sigma,
along with the assistance of external consultants and
reviews, help to deliver operational improvements,
utilise our assets better, develop and retain our staff
and, importantly, to improve service to our
customers. 
Aluminium
The existing assets performed well over the year and
the results beneﬁted from the strong increase in the
metal price. The expansion project at Korba is on
track for commissioning in March 2006, taking our
aluminium capacity to around 400,000 tpa and the
new 1.0 million tpa alumina reﬁnery at Orissa is
making good progress.
The total production of ﬁnished aluminium in the
ﬁnancial year was 135,926 tonnes, an increase of
5% on last year, and in line with capacity. The

Chief Executive’ s Review continued
introduction of a ﬁfth boiler at BALCO allowed more
stable power output with fewer interruptions in
power supply, and better control of management
processes at both companies also helped to increase
output. We sold around 35,000 tonnes of rolled
products from BALCO over the year.
Turnover in the Aluminium Business increased by
26% to $282 million, with EBITDA increasing 41% to
$76 million. The increase in turnover and proﬁtability
was principally due to the strength of the price for
aluminium, with aluminium prices, as quoted on the
LME, averaging $1,779 per tonne over the year, an
increase of 24% over the previous year. Tariffs on the
import of aluminium were reduced in February 2005
from 15% to 10% and thus the impact from tariff
changes in the ﬁnancial year was limited.
Unit costs rose to $1,378 per tonne, an increase of
12.5% from the previous ﬁnancial year. This was
primarily caused by the increase in all key input
prices, notably petroleum products, coal and caustic
soda. The expansion planned at BALCO will introduce
more modern 320 KA pre-baked technology, giving
the potential for a signiﬁcant reduction in unit costs,
mainly through lower power consumption and better
heat rate from the new power plant.
We estimate that demand for aluminium in India
increased by around 10% over the year, driven by
strong demand from the power, construction,
automotive and packaging industries. Power
transmission and electrical applications continue to
be the single largest domestic user of aluminium.
The domestic market will see signiﬁcant capacity
expansion over the next three years. Consumption in
the country is still less than 1 kilogram per capita and
we believe that consumption growth over the next
three years should average over 9 to 10% per annum
with demand being driven by the construction,
automotive and power industries.

DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 10
Chief Executive’ s Review continued
The expansion project at Korba has made excellent
progress over the past year. We have invested a
further $431 million over the period, to bring our
total spend to $562 million, against a budget of $900
million. The captive power plant is at an advanced
stage and we anticipate being able to use the ﬁrst of
the four power units in July 2005. The pot rooms are
complete and technology testing on the pots has
been successfully undertaken. We will start bringing
pots into production on a progressive basis as the
power plants are introduced. 
We should, therefore, see some increase in output
towards the end of the year from these ﬁrst pots and
remain on track for our commissioning date of
March 2006. I look forward to reporting next year on
this expansion, which will transform the size,
dynamics and cost of production of this Business.
Alumina
At our major alumina project in Orissa, we have
made substantial progress on the alumina reﬁnery
with all of the civil works and construction well in
hand and around halfway to completion. To date,
approximately $101 million has been invested. There
have been some public interest submissions to a
Supreme Court of India sub-committee, regarding
the environmental clearances for the bauxite mining
and these are currently being addressed. As
mentioned in last year’s annual report, we have
investigated the possibility of introducing a partner in
this project and this option remains under
consideration.
Copper 
The assets in India made limited headway over the
year, given ﬂat TC/RCs and the impact of tariffs. The
new smelter received permission to operate in April
2005 and will take our capacity to 300,000 tpa. In
November 2004 we acquired KCM, making Vedanta
one of the top ﬁve global copper producers.
Copper – India/Australia
Production of copper cathode in India declined by
4% from the previous year to 171,992 tonnes.
Production was lower in the ﬁrst quarter as a result of
a planned shutdown of 20 days at the smelter, after a
long campaign life of 24 months. In the second half
of the year this was almost fully recovered, with the
plant running above capacity through both the third
and fourth quarters.
Turnover increased 29% to $766 million, though
EBITDA declined by 10% to $85 million. The rise in
turnover reﬂects the signiﬁcant increase in the
copper price over the period. The average price on
the LME over the ﬁnancial year was 136 US cents per
pound, an increase of 68% on the previous year.
Around 20% of our copper concentrate was
supplied by our own mines in Australia and these
operations beneﬁted from this rise. 
The average TC/RC we received in the year was 
8.6 US cents per pound, similar to the levels of
2003/04. TC/RC’s in the ﬁrst half were 6.6 US cents
per pound and were improving towards the end of
the year. We anticipate that our TC/RC’s should
increase signiﬁcantly in the current year. We have
made good progress towards our strategy of
obtaining around two-thirds of our concentrate 
on long term contract, having signed some frame
contracts over the year.

Chief Executive’ s Review continued
The impact of tariffs was most signiﬁcant in the
Copper Business. Over the course of the year, 
tariffs on imports of ﬁnished copper were reduced
from 20% to 10%. Duty assistance on exports of
copper was also reduced during the year. On current
prices of copper cathodes this export assistance
broadly offsets the tariff of 5% paid on copper
concentrate imports.
Cash costs were improved from 7.8 US cents per
pound to 7.1 US cents per pound. This was driven by
better recovery of metal and improved by-product
management, notably sulphuric and phosphoric
acids. Our copper operations in India are already in
the ﬁrst quartile of cash costs for copper producers
globally, however we believe we can improve this
further and are targeting a cost of 6.0 US cents 
per pound.
During the year, further drilling was undertaken at
CMT and a further 13.0 million tonnes of ore has
been added to reserves, reﬂecting an extension to
the mine life of around ﬁve years. CMT produced
around 27,600 tonnes of copper in concentrate over
the year and the operation gained substantially from
the increase in the copper price. Production at TCM
was around 12,300 tpa. The operation at TCM is
likely to be closed in the ﬁrst quarter of the 2005/06
ﬁnancial year and closure costs, as estimated, have
been fully provided.
We estimate that growth in demand for copper in
India has grown at around 7% per annum, over the
past two years. This growth rate should beneﬁt from
growing power sector demand, construction, air
conditioning and the automotive sector. At the end
of 2002, India had power generation facilities of
105,000 MW; this is planned to double by 2012.
Shortly after the year end, we started commissioning
the new copper smelter at Tuticorin. This will take
our capacity to around 300,000 tpa of copper anode.
A new reﬁnery of 120,000 tpa and rod plant of
100,000 tpa has also been built at Tuticorin, so that
the additional anode will be processed at Tuticorin.
This will allow production of around 300,000 tpa of
cathode and 240,000 tpa of rod. The expansion also
included a new 22.5 MW power plant, and new acid
and oxygen plants. The smelter is producing metal
and we are moving through the ramp-up phase,
towards full production in the second half of 
the year.
Copper – Zambia
In November 2004 we acquired a 51% holding in
Konkola Copper Mines. KCM is the largest mining
company in Zambia, contributing signiﬁcantly to the
nation’s economy and export earnings. Over the ﬁve
months from the date of acquisition, KCM produced
67,547 tonnes of copper cathode and contributed
$76 million of EBITDA to the Group. The cash cost of
production was 106 US cents per pound.
A new chief executive, Mr CV Krishnan, has been
appointed to KCM. He has extensive experience in
the Copper Business, having worked previously with
the Group at Tuticorin. The immediate aim is for a
substantial improvement in operations and
processes. We are seeking to raise plant availability
and deliver better process management. Training for
staff is taking place along with the transfer of around
15 specialists from elsewhere in the Group.
There are several projects under way at KCM, all with
the aim of enhancing production and reducing costs.
A new 500 tonne per day acid plant is being built to
improve the availability of sulphuric acid and reduce
costs for the leaching plant. We are also moving to
de-bottleneck the smelter and improve recovery in
the smelters and concentrators.
The new copper plant at Tuticorin Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 12
Chief Executive’ s Review continued
The most signiﬁcant project at Konkola is the
Konkola Ore Body Extension Project. This involves
mining the ore below the current depth at Konkola
underground mine and expanding production from 
2 million tpa to 6 million tpa. Our intention is to
make full use of the existing infrastructure and
thereby deliver the project at a lower cost and shorter
timescale than had previously been thought possible.
The project should also have several economic and
environmental beneﬁts for the surrounding area. It is
intended that the additional production of
concentrates from Konkola will be treated in the
smelter at Nkana, producing copper cathodes 
for export. 
Zinc
The Zinc Business performed exceptionally well over
the period, assisted by strong sales and a ﬁrm zinc
price. Our expansion at Chanderiya was completed
and trial production commenced in May 2005 and
this will increase our reﬁned zinc output close to
400,000 tpa of ﬁnished metal.
Mine output has improved considerably and all the
mines have performed well. Rampura Agucha in
particular did better than the previous year due to
de-bottlenecking. This is reﬂected in an increase in
mined metal content of 7% over the year to 354,641
tonnes. Production of reﬁned zinc declined by 4% to
212,445 tonnes due to inconsistent qualities of met
coke, caused by short supply, which impacted the
production process. 
Sales of zinc metal at approximately 289,000 tonnes
are about 12% higher than the prior year, using our
own production of 212,445 tonnes along with
additional tonnage from tolling activities and stocks.
Turnover rose 21% to $486 million and EBITDA rose
22% to $219 million. Both turnover and proﬁtability
were driven by the increase in ﬁnished metal sales
and the strong rise in the zinc price. The average
price for zinc over the period, quoted on the LME,
rose 34% to $1,108 per tonne. This has more than
offset rising costs and tariff reductions. Cash costs of
production rose 22% to $695 per tonne. These were
impacted by rising energy prices and the costs of met
coke. Import tariffs on zinc were reduced in 5%
stages, from 20% to 10% in July 2004 and 
February 2005. 
Zinc demand in India grew at around 10% over the
year. The growth is driven by galvanising, which
protects steel from corrosion, and the end users of
galvanised materials in construction, the automotive
sector, housing and power transmission. About 50%
of zinc demand is driven by sheet galvanising.
There have been focused efforts on expanding new
zinc applications, notably galvanised reinforcement
bars and structures used in construction. These should
beneﬁt from Government infrastructure spend. 
Shortly after the year end, we commissioned the new
facilities at Chanderiya zinc smelter. The ﬁnal cost of
the expansion is around 15% below the budget of
$425 million set out at the time of Listing. First metal
was poured in May 2005, and we will build up
towards full capacity in the second half of the
ﬁnancial year, which will take our total zinc capacity
close to 400,000 tpa. The new facilities should assist
in reducing unit costs in the future towards our
target of $500 per tonne, subject to variations in
energy and coal prices. The operations are already in
the ﬁrst quartile of global costs and reaching our
target will make us one of the lowest cost zinc
producers in the world.

The lead smelting facilities are currently being
increased by 50,000 tpa to take total output to
85,000 tpa. These new facilities should be
commissioned by the end of the ﬁnancial year. The
cost of this will be around $35 million.
Exploration
The replacement and growth of our resource base is
fundamental to our Businesses. During the year, we
appointed a Head of Exploration who will lead a
team responsible for exploration across the Group.
The team is tasked with developing our competence
in this area and producing a meaningful exploration
programme.
The importance of exploration has already been
demonstrated at our zinc operations. The reserves at
Rampura Agucha have been increased to 50.1
million tonnes from 40.1 million tonnes. These
contain zinc at 12.8% and lead at 1.9%. The life of
the mine has increased to well over 15 years, even at
the increased levels of production required by the
expansion at the smelter. We will continue with
further exploration work around the mines.
New Projects
The four projects set out at Listing are around 50%
complete in terms of budget, with two already
commissioned, zinc and copper, and the third,
aluminium, on track for the end of the 2005/06
ﬁnancial year. Costs are within budget, in spite of
input cost pressures such as steel, through a
combination of the timing of the initial contracts and
sound project management. 
We believe that there are some signiﬁcant further
opportunities to expand our production in the future
and this coincides with a unique period in India’s
economic growth and development. There is also the
potential to move our Zambian assets forward
considerably. This will extend our pipeline of growth
into the future and retain our proﬁle of growth led
through projects. We are undertaking a detailed
feasibility study for the development of aluminium
production in the State of Orissa. We are at a
preliminary stage in evaluating the potential for iron
development in the same State. We believe that
there is potential for further additions in other 
areas, particularly aluminium and zinc, and these
possibilities should develop over the year ahead.
Sustainable Development
We believe in sustainable development and are
committed to effective management of health,
safety, environment and community development as
an integral part of our business. 
The acquisition of KCM brings our total workforce to
around 22,500 and as the Group has grown, so have
our responsibilities to our employees and the
communities around us. We have made considerable
progress over the past year with many initiatives
undertaken. We have appointed Group managers for
both HSE and CSR who will further develop tasks and
performance indicators across the Group.

We seek to meet needs in the community by
providing assistance in the three key areas of primary
health, education and distress relief. It is our wish to
assist those around us, far beyond their minimum
needs. Across the Group we undertake considerable
work ranging from funding schools and school
meals, to skill training programmes for adults and the
sponsorship of sports. There is a wide range of
activity in health care, from providing centres and
medicine to extensive treatment programmes. KCM
has a strong track record in malaria and HIV
programmes, the learning from which we can share
across the Group.
Over the year we have undertaken several initiatives
to ensure that we meet environmental requirements
and the use of third party audits by international
specialists has validated our belief in our practices.
The selection of the new technology being
introduced in our expansion programmes will assist
our efforts by improving on energy efﬁciency and
waste recycling. Investment has taken place to
improve air quality well within current permissible
standards, in anticipation of more stringent
legislation that will inevitably be introduced in the
future.
Outlook 
This year will see further delivery of the tasks we set
out at Listing as new production ramps up from our
copper and zinc expansions and our aluminium
project is fully commissioned. I also anticipate
improvements in production and costs at KCM. The
delivery of our strategy will reduce our unit costs
through the increase in volumes, new technology
and greater productivity and take us towards our
goal of being in the top decile of cost of production
in all of our Businesses. Our growth strategy
combined with growing demand for metals in India
gives a positive outlook and I look forward to
reporting on this over the year.

Financial Review
Background
These Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with UK GAAP and the requirements of
the Companies Act 1985. With effect from 1 April
2005, Vedanta will prepare its ﬁnancial results in
accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”). The ﬁrst set of IFRS-compliant
results will be the ﬁrst quarter results to be announced
in July 2005, followed by our interim results in
November 2005.
The consolidated accounts are presented in US
dollars, being the presentational currency adopted by
other international resource companies. Vedanta also
determines and pays its dividends in US dollars,
although shareholders may opt to receive payment in
UK pounds sterling. Subsidiary operating companies
maintain their accounts in local currencies, principally
the Indian rupee, although KCM, acquired on
5 November 2004, uses the US dollar as its functional
currency. The business segments are split between
copper, aluminium and zinc (including lead); in due
course alumina will be reported as a fourth segment.
The Group has signiﬁcant equity partners in its
various businesses, certain of which are listed. For
BALCO, HZL and KCM, the Governments of India
and Zambia have sizeable equity interests and
representation on their respective boards. All
signiﬁcant operating companies are consolidated 
as subsidiaries, with turnover, EBITDA, operating
proﬁt and net debt all shown on a 100% basis.
Minority interests have decreased in the past 
ﬁnancial year as we seek to increase our Economic
Interest, thereby resulting in higher Attributable
Proﬁt available for dividends. The initiatives taken 
in the past year to reduce minority interests are
detailed on page 22.
The ﬁnancial performance of the Group is measured
using four key performance indicators. We judge the
key measures as EBITDA (stated before operating
exceptional items), EPS (stated before exceptional
items), Free Cash Flow and Return on Capital
Employed, net of tax and excluding project capital
work in progress. Further details of these
performance indicators are shown in the box below.

42.4% on the previous year, translating into an EPS
of 41.9 US cents per Ordinary Share, a 66%
improvement. The Directors recommend a ﬁnal
dividend of 11.55 US cents per share, a 5% increase
from prior year on a like-for-like basis.
These results were driven by a strong performance
from the Zinc Business, a maiden ﬁve month
contribution from KCM and improved volumes
across the Group. The results beneﬁted from strong
selling prices offset, in part, by higher energy related
costs and reduced Indian tariff support. Total capital
employed rose by almost 82% to $1.80 billion,
including over $1 billion of project capital work in
progress in our major projects. ROCE fell to 13.7%,
but when excluding the capital work in progress, it
remained comfortably above 30%. At the end of the
year, the balance sheet remained well capitalised
with net debt of only $74.3 million (2004: net cash
of $422.3 million). The outstanding expenditure for 
our major projects at the year end was just over
$1 billion, which was matched by available 
cash resources.
The share price ended the ﬁnancial year at
471 pence, up 21% on our listing price in December
2003. The Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) of
Vedanta in the period from Listing to the year end
was 23%. The market capitalisation of the Group
was $2.5 billion which resulted in Vedanta being
listed at 144 in the FTSE All Share Index.

rose to $101.7 million split $77.5 million from our
existing Businesses and $24.2 million from KCM.
Depreciation is forecast to rise next year with the
commissioning of new plant in our Aluminium, 
Zinc and Copper Businesses and a full year of
depreciation from KCM.
During the year, foreign exchange losses of
$11.2 million in the ﬁrst half were largely reversed in
the second half resulting in a net foreign exchange
loss of $1.6 million in the year. This compared to the
$14.0 million gain arising during the prior year.
Group operating proﬁt, after operating exceptional
items, increased to $331.8 million, a 39.9% increase.
Operating exceptional items were $21.9 million;
these related to a $4.1 million charge arising from
voluntary retirement schemes (2004: $13.3 million)
and a $17.8 million impairment charge recognised
against certain non-core assets identiﬁed in last year’s
annual report. Whilst these non-core assets have
been substantially written down, we are pursuing a
number of opportunities to maximise realisation over
and above their net carrying value of $52 million
(2004: $65 million). Vedanta Resources plc

Foreign Exchange and Net Interest
Net interest income was $3.6 million compared with
a $1.3 million net interest charge in the prior year.
This included a net foreign exchange loss of $7.6
million (2004: $14.1 million gain) arising on foreign
currency funds and borrowings within the Group.
Investment income totalled $41.3 million (2004:
$39.7 million) and interest payable, $37.7 million
(2004: $41.0 million); this excludes net interest
capitalised on our growth projects of $24.2 million
(2004: $4.6 million).
Taxation
The tax rate in the year was 29.4% (2004: 32.6%)
split between current tax of 19.7% (being the cash
rate for the Group) and deferred tax of 9.7%. The tax
rate for the current year beneﬁted from several
factors including the acquisition of KCM with
signiﬁcant tax losses, a 3% reduction in Indian
income tax rates and ﬁscal breaks arising from the
extensive capital expenditure programme. These
mostly occurred in the second half of the ﬁnancial
year reducing the full year tax rate compared to 
that estimated in the interim accounts. The tax 
rate is expected to be moderately higher in the 
future although the capital expenditure ﬁscal breaks
will continue.
Minority Interests
Minority interests have been restated to reﬂect a new
accounting policy, required by UITF Abstract 38
“Accounting for ESOP Trusts”. The SEWT’s holding of
3.2% in the issued share capital of Sterlite is
reclassiﬁed from other investments and instead
recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. From
a Group perspective the shares are effectively treated
as cancelled, which increases Vedanta’s Economic
Interest in Sterlite. As a consequence of this change
in accounting policy, the minority interest reﬂected in
the proﬁt and loss account decreased from 57.7% to
54.1% for the year ended 31 March 2004.
After reﬂecting the change in accounting policy, our
share of post-tax proﬁt absorbed by minority
interests decreased from the restated 54.1% for the
prior year to 48.9% in the current year, split as to
50.6% in the ﬁrst half of the year and then reduced
further to 48.0% in the second half of the year (or
44.5% when excluding operating exceptional items).
This reduction reﬂects the success in implementing
our strategy to increase ownership in subsidiaries,
principally arising from Sterlite’s rights issue
concluded in September 2004. Further details are 
shown on page 22.
Proﬁt for the Year
The proﬁt for the year was $120.0 million, against
$72.3 million in the previous year, an increase of
66.0%. This increase was due to a combination of
the improved results reported across our Businesses
and the reduction in minority interests.
The Underlying Proﬁt was $137.7 million, an
improvement of 80.7% against the prior year.
Underlying Proﬁt excludes the effects of exceptional
items and their tax and minority interest impact, 
and is a more informed measure of the recurring
performance of the Group.

EPS based on proﬁt for the year rose by 65.6% to
41.9 US cents per Ordinary Share whilst EPS based on
Underlying Proﬁt rose by 80.8% to 48.1 US cents per
Ordinary Share. There was no material difference
between basic EPS and diluted EPS as the only effects
on proﬁt after dilutive adjustments are shares to be
issued under the LTIP totalling $0.2 million, and an
adjustment in respect of the convertible bond in
Sterlite totalling $1.9 million.
The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 11.55 
US cents per Ordinary Share in respect of the year
ended 31 March 2005 which, together with the
interim dividend of 5.5 US cents per Ordinary Share
paid in January 2005, gives a total for the year of
17.05 US cents per Ordinary Share. The ﬁnal dividend
is increased by an equivalent of 5% on the previous
year when a ﬁnal dividend of 5.5 US cents per
Ordinary Share was paid for the four month period
to 31 March 2004 following the Company’s Listing in
December 2003. The Company has a progressive
dividend policy but recognises that in the year there
was no beneﬁt from the $2.2 billion growth projects. Vedanta Resources plc

Cash Flow
During the year, there was a decrease in net cash of

$422.3 million, as at 31 March 2004, moving to a net
debt position of $74.3 million, as at 31 March 2005.

treatment of project creditors.
The Free Cash Flow in the year of $204.4 million is
lower than last year’s ﬁgure of $335.4 million, which
had beneﬁted from extended trade credit received of
over $200 million included within the working capital
movement. This year there was a signiﬁcant working
capital outﬂow of $180.2 million due to a
combination of a higher level of copper concentrate
inventory compared to the previous year’s unusually
low level, and increased trade debtors arising from
strong fourth quarter’s sales volumes and selling
prices. Sustaining Capital Expenditure was again
tightly controlled, this year including KCM, increasing
modestly to $67.1 million against $64.5 million in the
previous year.
Tax paid was limited to $65.8 million, equivalent to
19.8% of proﬁt before tax, beneﬁting from the
advantageous ﬁscal breaks noted earlier and tax
losses including ﬁve months of KCM ownership.
After the Group’s expansion projects are
commissioned it is anticipated that the cash tax rate
will remain at these levels in future years.
The main feature of the year was progress with the
$2.2 billion expansion projects with $734.6 million
spent in the year, bringing the total spent at
31 March 2005 to $1.03 billion, approximately 47%
of the planned $2.2 billion programme. A further
$1.2 billion was outstanding at the year end, of
which 40% has been committed.

The most signiﬁcant acquisition expenditure in the
year related to the purchase of a 51% equity interest
in KCM on 5 November 2004 for $28.3 million. 
This acquisition, at a total gross cost of $49.2 million
(including acquisition expenses of $1.0 million), was
implemented through a $25.0 million subscription
for newly issued shares by KCM, which has been
retained in the enlarged group, and agreement to
pay $23.2 million to ZCI, a minority shareholder in
KCM. Of this, an initial payment of $2.3 million was
made at the date of acquisition, with the remaining
$20.9 million payable in equal instalments over four
years from 31 December 2005. 
In accordance with the KCM acquisition agreement
entered into by the Group, it has also agreed to fund
capital expenditure up to a limit of $220 million as
set out in the acquisition agreement, in the event
that internally generated cash ﬂows prove
insufﬁcient. Based on forecast production levels at
KCM and a view of copper prices, it is not expected
that Vedanta will be required to meet any of the
shortfall funding commitment. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 22
Financial Review continued
A major element of the Group’s strategy at the time
of Listing was to consolidate the ownership interests
in subsidiary companies where signiﬁcant minority
interests were present. During the last year the
Group’s Economic Interests in Sterlite, BALCO, 
HZL and VAL all showed signiﬁcant increases as set
out above. 
Sterlite
During the year, substantial progress has been achieved
against this strategic objective as shown below:
• in April 2004, 2.4% of Sterlite’s issued share capital
was purchased from the SEWT for $21.4 million.
As the SEWT is consolidated, this transaction had
no cash impact at a consolidated level, although
cash within the SEWT is restricted. This purchase
was in addition to the acquisition of 4.98% of
Sterlite’s issued share capital from the SEWT in
January 2004 for $58.0 million; and
• in September 2004, the Group completed the Sterlite
rights issue, which raised $434 million in aggregate.
Of this, only $1 million was funded by minority
shareholders with the balance of $433 million being
funded by the Company through the investment of
proceeds raised from the Listing. Subscribing to the
rights issue in this way was a highly tax efﬁcient
manner of remitting funds to our projects in India,
and also ensured the Company’ s Economic Interest in
Sterlite increased substantially.
However, towards the end of the year, $25.8 million
of Sterlite’s convertible bonds issued with a face
value of $50 million were converted into 2.13 million
Sterlite ordinary shares, thereby reducing debt by
$25.8 million, but diluting the Group’s Economic
Interest in Sterlite by 1.4%. Conversions in the period
from 31 March 2005 to 1 June 2005 were minimal at
$1.5 million.
These changes resulted in the Group’s Economic
Interest in Sterlite increasing by 9.1% from 1 April
2004 to 31 March 2005.
If the outstanding convertible bonds were converted
into Sterlite’s ordinary shares, the conversion would
result in dilution of the Group’s Economic Interest by
a further 1.4%.
BALCO
Progress on the exercise of the option to acquire all or
substantially most of the shares in BALCO held by the
Government of India continues. The Group has
conﬁrmed to the Government that it wishes to exercise
its option and consequently a valuation of the shares by
an independent valuer, in accordance with the
shareholder agreement, is in progress. Discussions with
the Government continue on the matter of offering
shares not exceeding 5% of the total to the employees.
MALCO
Whilst we were unsuccessful in our attempt to acquire
the 20% interest in MALCO held by minority interests,
market conditions will be continuously reviewed to
ensure our options are kept open.

Future Initiatives
The Government of India did not exercise the “put”
option of its 3.6% interest in HZL which expired on
11 April 2005. However, the Group has a “call” option
over the Government’ s 29.5% interest in HZL which is
exercisable with effect from 11 April 2007. The
decision to proceed with the exercise of this option will
be taken at that time.
The Group has an option to acquire ZCI’ s 28.5%
interest in KCM; the option period commences on the
earlier of the last day of four consecutive quarters
during which ore is extracted at a rate of 3 million tpa
or more, or an application to proceed with the
development of the Konkola Ore Body Extension
Project is approved by the Government of Zambia. The
option period lasts 24 months. Prior to the exercise of
this option, if at all, the Group will take cognisance of
KCM’ s proﬁtability, including the impact relating to the
development of the “Deeps” project.
Balance Sheet
Capital employed increased in the year to $1.80 billion
from $0.99 billion last year mostly due to $734.6
million of capital expenditure incurred for the major
growth projects. For the year ended 31 March 2005,
ROCE was 13.7% (2004: 16.9%) although $1.03
billion was attributable to the major projects on which
no return was made during the year. Excluding this
capital work in progress, ROCE increased in the year to
32.0% (2004: 24.1%).
Working capital movements have also had an upwards
effect on capital employed as did the acquisition of
KCM where net assets acquired of $201.4 million were
offset in part by provisional negative goodwill on
acquisition of $56.6 million.

The balance sheet is funded by equity shareholders’

minority interests of $681.6 million (2004: $423.2
million) and net debt of $74.3 million (2004: net cash
of $422.3 million). It is expected that based on
current investment plans net debt will peak during
the next two years after which it should decrease as
the major projects become operational.
Provision for liabilities and charges increased to
$424.2 million from $162.9 million from the prior
year, which is largely attributable to the KCM
acquisition. The major components within provisions
are as follows:
• pension and similar obligations of $64.5 million of
which $60.7 million is attributable to KCM. KCM’s
provisions consists of $32.5 million for terminal
beneﬁts payable to speciﬁed employees of KCM
who transferred from ZCCM when KCM was
privatised in 2000 and $28.2 million of other
medical and retirement beneﬁts. The fair value of
KCM’s provisions were determined using actuarial
valuations obtained at the time of acquisition; 
• environmental liabilities of $62.1 million which
represent the estimated future restoration and
rehabilitation obligations caused by mining
operations. These costs are expected to be incurred
over the useful lives of the assets. Environmental
provisions include $51.6 million relating to KCM
and have been determined with reference to the
Development Agreement entered into at the time
of acquisition. A detailed review of this provision
will be performed in the next ﬁnancial year as part
of the fair value exercise; and
• other provisions of $151.3 million are mainly
attributable to other fair value adjustments on 
the acquisition of KCM.
In December 2004, the Company obtained its ﬁrst

was the largest issued to date by a group of Indian
origin. The bond was subscribed by investors in the

Earlier in the ﬁnancial year, the Group re-ﬁnanced
facilities in Sterlite taking advantage of better pricing,
and also obtained an extended ﬁve year loan in
BALCO. Other funding facilities are arranged on a

Risk Management 
Vedanta has well deﬁned risk policies that are
embedded within the organisation. Risks are
identiﬁed through a formal risk management
programme sponsored by the Chief Executive and
rigorously reviewed by internal audit through regular
consultation with business managers. Each signiﬁcant
risk has an “owner” within the Group at a senior
level, and the impact to the Group if a risk
materialises and its likelihood of crystallisation is
regularly updated. A risk register and matrix is
maintained and regularly updated by internal audit
in consultation with business managers.
Business decisions take account of a wide variety of
risks embracing environmental, health and safety,
political, market and ﬁnancial risk. Key business
decisions are discussed at the monthly meetings of
the Executive Committee, and senior managers are
expected to address risk management issues when
presenting initiatives to the Executive Committee.
Financial risk management is embraced through the
following aspects:
Internal control: a strong internal control culture is
pervasive throughout the Group. Regular internal
audit visits to the operations and holding companies
are undertaken to ensure the Group’s high standards
of internal control are maintained. The strength of a
business’s internal control environment is factored
into senior managers’ performance appraisals.
Further details on the Group’s internal control
environment are provided in the Corporate
Governance report.
Board reserved powers: the Board has revised its
reserved powers from those adopted at the time of
Listing to reﬂect more accurately the nature and
structure of the Group, and to include requirements
arising from the revised Combined Code. The
reserved powers set out the Board’s sanction over
treasury and capital expenditure with deﬁned limits
of authority and procedure, and contribute to risk
management by ensuring adherence to Group
policies in these areas. The overall internal control
environment and risk management programme is
reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of 
the Board.
Financial risk and sensitivities: within the areas of
ﬁnancial risk the Board approved policies embrace
liquidity, currency, interest rate, counterparty and
commodity risk. In principle, the Group will not
engage in speculative treasury activity but will 
seek to manage risk and optimise interest and
commodity pricing.
Liquidity: the Group seeks to ensure sufﬁcient
liquidity and bank facilities to fund the investment
programme. As at 31 March 2005 cash and current
asset investments total $1.45 billion which should be
sufﬁcient to meet anticipated requirements. In
addition, undrawn facilities amount to $307.0
million as set out above.
Foreign currency: Vedanta is exposed to currency
movements with the majority of its costs and assets
located in India and denominated in Indian rupees.
Receipts in India are denominated in Indian rupees
but revenues are linked to US dollar commodity prices
derived from the LME. The Indian operating subsidiary
companies maintain their accounts with an Indian
rupee functional currency.
KCM’s cost base is a mix of Zambian kwacha and US
dollar with the functional currency being the US
dollar. KCM earns US dollar denominated revenue. 
The US dollar is also used as the Group’s reporting
currency and to determine the dividend.
Consequently, the Group is subject to currency 
risks affecting the underlying cost base in the
operating subsidiary companies, and also the
translations of proﬁt and the balance sheet (including
non-US dollar denominated borrowings) into the
consolidated accounts, where the functional
currency is not the US dollar. The new zinc facilities at Chanderiya were commissioned on 
31 May 2005, just after the year end. They were completed on 
time and below budget, and signiﬁcantly below international 
bench marks for comparable projects. It will produce 170,000 tpa
raising our total capacity to 390,000 tpa. This shows the new cell
rooms. The hydrometallurgical process is energy efﬁcient and will 
reinforce Hindustan Zinc as one of the most cost competitive 
zinc producers in the world. Vedanta Resources plc

Foreign currency exposures into India are 100%
hedged for raw material purchases and 50% hedged
for committed capital expenditure. It is also policy to
maintain a balance of US dollars and rupee net debt
as a hedge against selling prices largely denominated
in US dollars and assets mostly in Indian rupees. This
policy will be reviewed periodically to manage
foreign currency risk.
Interest risk: at 31 March 2005 the Group’ s net debt
of $74.3 million was split between debt of $1.52
billion and cash and current asset investments of
$1.45 billion. These extensive borrowings and cash
are denominated in both US dollars and Indian rupees
giving rise to interest rate exposures. Our policy is to
maintain a balance of ﬁxed and ﬂoating interest rate
borrowings, with most US dollar denominated debt
being carried at ﬂoating interest rates and Indian

Counterparty risk: cash deposits are primarily
invested in mutual funds, money market funds and
banks with high credit ratings. Board approved limits
are applied to counterparties. The deposits are
carried at ﬂoating interest rates largely with
maturities less than one year to provide a balance
between liquidity and enhanced yield. The Group
adheres to a policy of 100% capital projection
although some investments have been structured to
improve yield but with no risk to the principal.
Commodity risk: the Group is exposed to the
movement of base metal selling prices. In principle,
selling prices are not hedged but sold at prevailing
market prices as derived from the LME. The
exceptions to this policy relate to:
• closing off exposures arising from the purchase of
copper concentrate; and
• at times of favourable commodity prices to secure
the cash ﬂows of higher cost operations and those
with capital expansion programmes, such as the
Zambian operations, where a hedging programme
has been put in place covering a part of the
estimated production volumes over the next 
two years.
The operations in India do not hedge their domestic
commodity positions as this is not permitted under
local regulations. As at 31 March 2005 the Group
had hedged approximately one third of KCM’s
estimated production in the period up to
31 December 2006.

Financial Review continued
Critical Accounting Policies 
The Group’s accounting policies are set out in 
the notes to the Financial Statements on pages 
72 to 77. These include a number of policies 
which the Directors believe may impact the 
ﬁnancial statements signiﬁcantly:
Mining properties and leases: these tangible ﬁxed
assets total $340.2 million and consist of the cost of
acquiring and developing mining properties and
mineral rights. Excess purchase consideration arising
on acquisition is generally attributed to mining
properties and leases and amounts to $265.3 million
as at 31 March 2005. Discounted cash ﬂow models
are used to support the carrying value of mining
properties and leases, and contain a number of
critical assumptions. In the event where the
recoverable amount of mining properties and leases,
as indicated by discounted cash ﬂow models, is less
than their carrying value, a formal impairment review
will be undertaken. The properties are depreciated on
a unit of production basis, which also involves
subjectivity in the assessment of total production over
the lifetime of the mining property.
Impairment: the Group’ s tangible ﬁxed assets of
$2.3 billion are subject to an impairment review
where an indicator of impairment arises, or after the
ﬁrst full year of acquisition. During the year, the
Directors identiﬁed a number of assets as non-core
and following an impairment review of these assets, a
write down of $17.8 million has been recognised. As
part of the KCM fair value exercise, the book values
of the acquired tangible ﬁxed assets are being
reviewed against their recoverable amounts at the
date of acquisition and adjustments will be made if
necessary.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental
costs: these are costs typical to the extractive industry
and total $62.1 million as at 31 March 2005, including
$51.6 million attributable to KCM. The costs are
capitalised when incurred and then charged to the
proﬁt and loss account over the life of the asset through
depreciation and unwinding the discount on the
provision. Our Indian operations under local legislation
are largely exempt from these costs and the Group does
not provide for restoration costs over and above the
statutory requirement. The legal requirement for the
Australian mines has been met and appropriate
provision has been made. KCM’ s environmental
obligations are by reference to the plan agreed with the
Government of Zambia at the time of its privatisation in
April 2000, and pursuant to the acquisition agreement,
appropriate provision is made in KCM’ s accounts.
Contingencies: the accounts set out details of
material contingencies arising from litigation and
other claims. Provision is made where, in the opinion
of Directors, a loss to the Group is likely to crystallise.
For other litigation and claims, appropriate disclosure
of the contingency is provided in the accounts.
Pensions: the Group’ s pension liability consists of
deﬁned contribution schemes and deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes. The deﬁcit in the Group’ s deﬁned beneﬁt
scheme is limited to $6.6 million for the Indian
operations. In respect of KCM, the deﬁned 
beneﬁt schemes have been fully provided in 
the balance sheet. 
Fair value adjustments on acquisition: on the
acquisition of KCM, a fair value exercise was
undertaken resulting in adjustments to the book
values of the balance sheet of $127.2 million. The
Directors are of the opinion that the adjusted balance
sheet reﬂects the fair value of the underlying assets
and liabilities of the acquired company. The
provisional fair values of the tangible ﬁxed assets and
the environmental liabilities are being reviewed and
further adjustments, if any, will be carried out in next
year’ s ﬁnancial statements.
Transition to International Financial 
Reporting Standards
All companies listed in the European Union are
required to present consolidated ﬁnancial statements
for accounting periods commencing from 1 January
2005 that comply with IFRS. Vedanta’ s ﬁrst set of
IFRS-compliant results will be the ﬁrst quarter results
to be announced in July 2005, followed by its interim
results for the six months ending 30 September 2005,
to be announced in November 2005. Vedanta will
prepare its ﬁrst full year IFRS-compliant consolidated
ﬁnancial statements for the year ending 31 March
2006. The IFRS transition project is well advanced and
the Group is on course to meet its reporting deadlines. Vedanta Resources plc

Financial Review continued
Management of IFRS Implementation
The Group has established a formal project team for
the transition to IFRS, which includes members of
senior management. The project is broadly classiﬁed
into four phases:
1. Impact assessment: the impact assessment phase
was undertaken at all operating units within the
Group. During this phase all material differences
between the Group’ s current UK GAAP accounting
policies and those likely to be required under IFRS
were identiﬁed. Consequential changes to
reporting and information systems and business
processes were also highlighted. A training
programme was held during the impact
assessment phase for the Group’ s ﬁnance staff.
2. Evaluation and project planning: during this
phase, policy options available for the ﬁrst time
adoption of IFRS required under IFRS 1 “First-time
adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards” were evaluated by the project team.
Thereafter, these choices were recommended to the
Audit Committee for approval in February 2005.
Concurrently, a detailed IFRS transition project was
planned and scoped out with clear time lines,
responsibilities and deliverables. The project 
was designed to be ﬂexible in order to react to
updates or developments arising during the
implementation phase.
3. Implementation and review: a substantial part
of this phase is nearing completion within the
time frame as originally envisaged. During this
phase, changes to the reporting and information
systems were made in order to prepare IFRS-
compliant information. This phase is expected to
be completed before the Company announces its
ﬁrst quarter results in July 2005. It is also planned
that a broad based training programme will be
conducted across the Group for senior
management and those people affected by IFRS
reporting outside of the ﬁnance teams.
4. Group accounting manual: this phase runs in
parallel to the implementation and review stage,
and involves the preparation of an IFRS-compliant
Group accounting manual, setting out the
accounting policies of the Company. The purpose
of the manual is to communicate a common
understanding of Vedanta’ s accounting policies
across the Group and to minimise possible conﬂict
of views between units.
Key Differences in Accounting Policies
The major differences between UK GAAP and IFRS
reporting which are likely to impact the Group’ s
ﬁnancial performance and position are summarised
below. The summary should not be taken as an
exhaustive list of all differences that may impact 
the Group.
1. Hedge accounting: IAS 39 “Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” sets
out rules that must be complied with in order for
an entity to achieve hedge accounting. As part of
its risk management programme, the Group enters
into a number of derivatives that mitigate foreign
exchange, interest rate and commodity price
exposures. Under UK GAAP , such derivatives are
accounted for as hedges, and gains and losses are
deferred until the transaction to which the hedge
is attached occurs. However, under IFRS these
contracts have to be marked-to-market (“MTM”)
and MTM ﬂuctuations may be recognised in the
income statement or equity, depending upon the
nature of the derivative.
2. Foreign exchange gain/losses: IAS 21 “The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”
stipulates that certain exchange differences cannot
be capitalised as part of tangible ﬁxed assets and
instead must be charged to the income statement
when recognised. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 29
Financial Review continued
3. Property, plant and equipment – major
overhauling expenses: in accordance with IAS
16 “Property, Plant and Equipment”, major
overhauling expenses which are recurring in
nature over a period of more than a year must be
capitalised. These costs are then depreciated over
the period until such time as the next overhaul is
planned. These expenses are currently charged to
the proﬁt and loss account as repairs and
maintenance expenses.
4. Long term incentive plan: in accordance with
IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment”, the fair value of
awards granted under the LTIP need to be fair
valued and recognised in the income statement
over the vesting period of the award. Currently,
the cost of LTIP awards is based on the cost of the
Company’ s share price prevailing at the date of
award, less the applicable option price. The LTIP
charge in respect of the year ended 31 March
2005 amounted to $0.9 million, although only one
year’ s worth of awards have been granted to date.
5. Negative goodwill: under IFRS “Business
Combinations”, negative goodwill is recognised
within reserves whereas under UK GAAP it is
credited to the proﬁt and loss account over the
depreciable period of the non-monetary assets to
which the negative goodwill is attached.
6. Dividends declared after reporting date:
under IFRS 10 “Contingencies and Events After
the Balance Sheet Date”, dividends are not
accrued until they have been declared and
approved by members in general meeting.
Accordingly, proposed dividends will not be
recognised in the Group accounts until the period
in which they become payable.
7. Deferred tax: deferred tax under IFRS 12
“Income T axes” is calculated using the balance
sheet liability approach, which recognises deferred
tax assets and liabilities by reference to differences
between the carrying values for accounting and
tax purposes, rather than accounting and tax
values of items recognised in the proﬁt and loss
account. Also, differences exist between the UK
GAAP and IFRS calculation of deferred tax arising
on fair value adjustments, which may be
signiﬁcant for the KCM acquisition. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 30
Major First Time Adoption Choices
The major ﬁrst time adoption choices selected by the
Group are as follows:
1. Property, plant and equipment – fair value as
deemed cost: IFRS 1 permits the use of fair value
measurement as at the date of transition on an
item-by-item basis. The Group has opted to
continue to carry assets at historical cost so that
the ﬁnancial results of prior years are comparable
with results prepared in future years. 
2. IAS 39: IFRS 1 does not permit retrospective
designation of hedge relationships. The
designation and documentation of a hedge
relationship must be completed on or before the
date of transition to IFRS if the hedge relationship
is to qualify for hedge accounting from that date.
Hedge accounting can be applied prospectively
only from the date that the hedge relationship is
fully designated and documented. The Group will
apply IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure
and Presentation” and IAS 39 with effect from
1 April 2005 and not at the date of transition to
IFRS. The Group would not qualify for hedge
accounting prior to this date as hedges were not
designated and documented.
3. Employee beneﬁts – full recognition of
surplus/deﬁcits at date of transition: the deﬁcit
prevailing in the Group’ s pension and related
employee schemes will be fully provided in the
opening balance sheet as at the date of transition,
and the liability will be recognised in full in
accordance with IAS 19 (revised) “Employee
Beneﬁts.”
4. IAS 23 – Expense or capitalise certain
borrowing costs: the Group will continue to
capitalise interest and foreign exchange gains and
losses where appropriate under IAS 23 “Borrowing
Costs”.
5. IFRS 6 – Date of adoption: IFRS 6 “Exploration
and Evaluation of Mineral Resources”, which was
issued in December 2004, is applicable for
accounting periods commencing on or after
1 January 2006. Although the impact of IFRS 6 is
expected to be limited, the standard is relevant to
the nature of the Group’ s operations.
Consequently, the Group has opted to defer
adoption of IFRS 6 until 1 April 2006.

Our Approach to Sustainable Development 
Vedanta aims to develop and manage a diverse
portfolio of mining and metals businesses to
provide attractive returns to our shareholders 
whilst carrying out our activities in a socially and
environmentally responsible manner and creating
value for the communities where we operate.
Sustainable development principles are
fundamental to our approach. These principles
require us to monitor and reduce social and
environmental risks, to improve efficiencies in 
the use of resources, to minimise pollution and to
create partnerships with our local communities. 
Governance Structure and 
Management Systems
The Group is committed to ensuring that the
health, safety, environmental and social
commitments of its Businesses are managed
appropriately and to a high standard. To oversee
this, an HSE Committee (the “Committee”) was
established in June 2004 comprising the Chief
Executive of the Group, Mr KK Kaura, and the chief
executives of the Zinc, Copper and Aluminum
Businesses. A Non-executive Director, Dr SK
Tamotia, is the Chairman of the Committee. The
Committee monitors HSE performance of the
Group’s Businesses and provides advice and
guidance to the Board and management in
achieving continuous improvements in HSE. The
Committee met three times during the year ended
31 March 2005.
A Group HSE manager was appointed during the
year, reporting to the Chief Executive of Vedanta.
The manager is responsible for convening the
meetings of the Committee and providing a flow 
of information between the Board, the Committee
and the operations, as well as ensuring the
implementation of policy and the transfer of best
practice across the Group.
The majority of the Group’s operations have their
own HSE policies appropriate to the characteristics of
their business. However, the broad principles upon
which Vedanta engages in HSE activities across units
are similar. The Board has recently adopted the HSE
Policy, as recommended by the Committee and
shown on page 32, to provide a uniform basis for
implementation of HSE policies across Group
operations in the future.
It is the responsibility of operational managers
throughout the Group to ensure implementation of 
the HSE policies and systems, and to monitor
operational performance against these policies. All
individual units have qualiﬁed and experienced HSE
specialists to assist management in implementing HSE
policies and management systems. They undertake
compliance management, impact assessment,
measurement and monitoring, and continuous
improvement programmes. The operations are also
guided by the regulatory framework in terms of HSE
matters prevalent in that country and work closely with
the authorities to identify and resolve any problems.
All signiﬁcant Indian operations have their
Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety
Management Systems certiﬁed in accordance with
the international standards ISO:14001 and
OHSAS:18001, respectively (see table on page 33).
The Korba complex at BALCO obtained its
certiﬁcation in accordance with ISO:14001 and
OHSAS:18001 during the year, and the
Visakhapatnam zinc smelter at HZL was also certiﬁed
to OHSAS:18001. Regular surveillance audits are
carried out and management plans are prepared and
implemented to facilitate continuous improvement. 
KCM plans to have all its operations certiﬁed in
accordance with ISO:14001 and OHSAS:18001 by
31 March 2006. HZL, Sterlite and BALCO will also
modify their systems appropriately to incorporate the
changes and expansions. Certiﬁcation for TCM and
CMT will not be achieved given the short remaining
life span of their mines. Certiﬁcations for the Mainpat
mine of BALCO are expected to be received by the
end of June 2005, and the Yercaud mine of MALCO
is expected to obtain certiﬁcation by 31 March 2006.
Plans for certiﬁcation of the Bodai-Daldali deposit of
BALCO and the Kolli Hills mine of MALCO are under
review and could be progressed next year.
HSE management performance and systems
compliance throughout the Group is internally and
externally audited, including periodic reviews by
regulatory authorities.

risks and train our employees and contractors 
to recognise this and act accordingly.
Vedanta’s corporate safety and health initiatives
focus on the following elements:
• leadership – ensuring that senior management and
operational heads provide leadership in, and are
committed to, health and safety; 
• management systems – a majority of the Group’ s
operations have adopted OHSAS:18001 certiﬁed

HSE Steward System at Tuticorin
The HSE Steward System, introduced at Tuticorin in October 2004, covers the areas of health, hygiene,
housekeeping, safety and environment and encourages the participation of every individual in the unit.
The total smelter complex has been divided into 28 areas and each area is owned by one designated HSE
steward who implements the HSE system in its totality in his/her own area. In addition, ﬁve HSE
representatives from the unit’s HSE department work with these stewards to ensure the system is
implemented effectively. 
The HSE stewards regularly monitor their area to check hygiene, health, housekeeping, safety and
environment. Boundary limits of the owned area include roads, drains, and greenbelt within the
periphery. Based on this monitoring, cross-checked by HSE representatives, reports are produced and
points are awarded to individuals and areas/stewards for good performance. These reports are regularly
reviewed by the management to determine suitable rewards and penalties.
Experience so far: Over the past six months at Tuticorin, this HSE initiative has motivated and
encouraged both individuals and teams to strive for a safe and clean workplace. The use of personal
protective equipment has also improved signiﬁcantly. With six audits completed so far, 760 suggestions
for improvements in HSE have been received, of which about 650 have been acted upon. A few require
signiﬁcant expenditure and have been included in the current year’s business plan. Further
improvements in the system are being planned including quarterly rewards for employee safety. 
Case Study
• training – safety ﬂows from safe behaviours and
attitudes. Regular training is provided to all
employees and contractors to increase their
awareness and to improve their behaviours and
attitudes towards safe working practices; and
• risk management – risk assessments are carried
out, particularly for hazardous operations, and
signiﬁcant risks are minimised by the application of
engineering measures and the adoption of new
technology and safe working practices. 
Safety Committees
Safety committees are in place at various levels to
review incidents, suggest improvements in safety
systems, and to implement risk reduction and
training to prevent recurrence. Safety committees
have been strengthened in terms of representation,
frequency of meetings and implementation of their
suggestions.
HSE Steward System
An HSE Steward System was introduced at Tuticorin
(see box below) on an experimental basis to improve
standards. This has yielded excellent results and,
importantly, is motivating individuals and teams to
integrate HSE actions into their routine activities and
thinking. Given this success, other operations are
planning to replicate this approach.
Audits
Many internal and external audits were undertaken
through specialists, as well as relevant agencies, to look
at the operations and identify risks and hazards, whilst
also recommending preventive measures. These audits
provide valuable input and feedback to the operating
teams in reducing safety risks.
Training
Training operating personnel to adopt safe working
practices is an important part of the Group’ s safety
programme. It is a corporate policy to provide initial
and periodic training to all employees and contractors.
The training includes routine activities and safety
precautions, and special focus is concentrated on
identiﬁed risks and hazards in respect of operations
and other employee activities. At some locations such
as Korba, Tuticorin and Chanderiya, 5S training was
provided to employees to integrate safety as a way of
life, rather than as an add-on. The system and culture
of recording all incidents, including ﬁrst aid cases and
near-misses, was strengthened during the year to
improve understanding of incidents and provide
opportunities for prevention.
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate
LTIFR for the Group’s operations marginally increased
during the year ended 31 March 2005. There was,
however, a trend of improvement in the latter half of
the year. A target has been set of reducing the
Group’s LTIFR by 20% during the current ﬁnancial
year. It is intended to achieve this reduction through
the sustained implementation of various elements of
the Group’s corporate safety initiatives.

During the year to March 2005, two fatalities occurred
at our managed operations. Our sincere condolences
go out to the families of the deceased. Fatalities at the
Group’ s operations are totally unacceptable and
irreconcilable with the Group’ s commitment to achieve
zero fatalities and serious injuries. It is the Group’ s
intention to improve safety by developing strategies to
avoid such incidents in future. 
During the past two years several sites have seen major
construction projects relating to our expansion
programme. In order to ensure a safe working
environment, the Group has placed considerable
emphasis, from the planning stage of the projects, on
observing safety systems and precautions. Dedicated
safety teams were formed for the projects and
adherence to rigorous safety systems and compliance
was a condition of terms agreed with contractors. As a
result, the LTIFR for the two year period of project
activities at these four sites was 1.43. Regretfully, over
the same period, ten fatalities occurred, all relating to
contractors. These were generally due to material
handling and working at heights. Appropriate
guidelines and operating procedures have been
introduced to prevent any recurrence of such incidents.
Occupational Health
Programmes for regular occupational health
surveillance of all employees and contractors are
continuing. This includes speciﬁc examinations such as
tests for blood lead, audiometry , chest x-rays and

programmes, T uticorin plans to augment its occupational
health surveillance facility during the coming year .
Environment
The Group is focusing on environmental initiatives for
effective water management, waste minimisation
and recycling, reducing air emissions, energy
conservation and land stewardship, which it believes
are the main challenges to sustainability. The Group
is committed to efﬁcient use of all resources. Many 
of the Group’s Indian operations made signiﬁcant
progress in implementing their commitments to the
charter on Corporate Responsibility for Environmental
Protection, which includes signiﬁcantly reducing sulphur
dioxide and ﬂuoride emissions, achieving zero discharge
of waste water , improved handling and disposal of
hazardous wastes, and improvements in housekeeping
and on-site plantations.
Water Use 
Water availability, consumption and contamination
constitute important risks. These risks range from
water scarcity at sites located in arid and dry regions
(for example, HZL’s sites in Rajasthan and the
Tuticorin smelter in Tamil Nadu), to mine dewatering
and its impact on regional ground water levels in
Rajasthan and Zambia. The Group is committed to
the efﬁcient use of water and has taken steps to
ensure that this commitment is translated into
speciﬁc actions to reduce water consumption. These
steps have resulted in the reduction of water
consumption, despite increased levels of production
at many of the operations. BALCO, MALCO, HZL’s
mines and Sterlite all recorded a reduction in speciﬁc
water consumption during the year, while the
marginal increase at HZL’s smelters was primarily the
result of a lower level of production, set against
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 36
Sustainable Development Report continued

DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 37
Sustainable Development Report continued
constant water consumption at Chanderiya. The
Group is targeting a further 5% reduction in water
consumption in the year ending 31 March 2006.
The following cases illustrate the major efforts 
made to reduce water consumption and 
increase recycling: 
• at the MALCO Mettur aluminum smelter, water
consumption in the cooling towers was 11,465 cubic
metres per day constituting 72.5% of the total fresh
water consumption. Use of diagnostic and statistical
tools pinpointed the evaporator, vacuum pump and
foundry as areas requiring improvement. The
problem included non-usage of recycled water for
the evaporator vacuum pump and periodic overﬂow
of the foundry cooling towers. Action plans were
drawn up to implement improvement in these areas
and were completed in March 2005. As a result, the
overall water consumption in the cooling towers has
now come down to 8,675 cubic metres per day,
saving about 2,800 cubic metres per day of fresh
water and a corresponding reduction in waste water
discharge. The full impact of these improvements
will be felt during the coming year;
• at Sterlite’s Tuticorin copper smelter, all waste
water streams are treated and recycled within 
the plant. A further reduction in fresh water
consumption was achieved by introducing air
coolers in the sulphuric acid plants in August
2003. The hot water generated in the process is
cooled in air-cooled radiators so that closed loop
cooling takes place and evaporation losses are
avoided. This has resulted in a lower water
consumption rate of 9.73 cubic metres per tonne
of finished copper, compared to 10.34 cubic
metres in the previous year;
• various initiatives in water conservation at HZL
include the use of desliming hydrocyclones for
increased recovery from tailings, the use of a 
reclaim water reservoir for tailing dam water at the
Rampura Agucha mine, installing a reverse osmosis
plant for desalination and recycling of water at the
Chanderiya smelter; and
• the BALCO smelter reduced its efﬂuent discharge
by 3,500 cubic metres per day in the last two years
by increased recycling at various places, including
the main receiving step-down station, sheet rolling
shop, alumina plant and anode paste plant.
Air Quality
In the last two years, many of Vedanta’s operations
have begun generating captive electricity on site to
help reduce high power costs. This has led to
increased sulphur dioxide emissions which are
expected to increase further in the coming year as a
result of the power plants currently being commissioned
at Korba and Chanderiya. Fluoride emissions are also
expected to increase following the commissioning of
expanded smelter capacity at BALCO. However, plans
have been made to reduce these emissions.
Plans are progressing at the HZL and Tuticorin
smelters to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions from
process areas by introducing tail gas scrubbers.
Similar efforts are in progress to reduce ﬂuoride
emissions at the Korba and Mettur aluminum
smelters, together with the adoption of pre-baked
technology in the expanded capacity. The Mettur
aluminium plant will be provided with a dry scrubber
which will help reduce ﬂuoride emissions.
Some of the efforts to exercise good control and
minimise emissions are listed below:
Improvements
• adoption of highly efﬁcient DCDA technology for
the new sulphuric acid plants at Tuticorin and
Chanderiya;
• adoption of state-of-the-art Cansolv technology
for absorption of sulphur dioxide from the
Ausmelt plant under construction;
• addition of conversion stage in the DCDA plant at
Tuticorin and replacement of heat exchangers with
superior types;
• plans for installing tail gas scrubbers at Tuticorin,
Debari and Chanderiya are well under way. Tail gas
scrubbers at Chanderiya and Debari will be based
on calcine scrubbing which will use zinc oxide as
the scrubbing medium. This will generate zinc
sulphate solution which will be utilised in the
downstream process. As a result, there will be no
chemical consumed and no solid or liquid waste
generation from the process;
• adoption of pre-baked technology for the new
aluminum smelter at BALCO; 
• installation of a dry scrubber at BALCO’s old smelter
to minimise ﬂuoride emissions is in progress;

Monitoring
• on-line stack analysers are in use at all sulphuric acid
plant stacks for continuous monitoring and improved
control;
• monitoring of ﬂuoride emissions has also been
strengthened; and
• on-line SPM monitors provided for kiln and paste
plant stacks at MALCO.
Waste Management
The Group is focused on proper identiﬁcation,
characterisation, quantiﬁcation, segregation, storage
and disposal of all solid wastes. Overburden and
waste rock from mines are systematically stacked at
earmarked areas while tailings are disposed of in
tailing dams. Jarosite from hydrometallurgical zinc
smelters is disposed of in secure, lined containments,
whilst red mud from aluminum smelters is disposed
off in earmarked ponds, including a poly-lined dyke
facility at MALCO. A dry disposal system for red mud
is in place at MALCO. BALCO is moving towards the
dry disposal of red mud. A new secure landﬁll facility
was constructed at MALCO and Chanderiya as 
part of the expansion programme. For safe jarosite
disposal at Chanderiya’ s new hydrometallurgical
smelter, technology has been adopted which involves
stabilisation of jarosite with the addition of lime and
portland cement to produce a hard, compact and
inert mass known as jaroﬁx. A secure, lined disposal
facility has been constructed for jaroﬁx even though
dynamic leaching tests suggest the waste will remain
stable for more than 500 years. A new HDPE-lined
disposal facility has been constructed and
commissioned at Tuticorin for disposal of gypsum
resulting from phosphoric acid production.
Waste Utilisation
Opportunities to reuse and recycle waste are being
explored. Research studies are being undertaken to
reduce the hazardous characteristics of waste and to
ensure the re-use of waste materials. Some of the
signiﬁcant successes in this area are listed below: 
• overburden from bauxite mining at BALCO and
MALCO is used for concurrent reclamation of the
mined out areas;
• a portion of overburden and waste rock from zinc-
lead mining at Rampura Agucha and Zawar mines
at HZL is utilised for construction of tailing dam
embankments;
• ﬂy ash from coal-based power plants at BALCO,
MALCO and HZL is utilised for producing cement; 
• copper slag at Tuticorin is used in road construction
and abrasives. Its use in cement is being explored;
• during the past year , about 46% of red mud
generated at MALCO was used in the cement industry
as a partial replacement for low-grade bauxite;
• a facility was commissioned at Debari smelter 
to recover lead and zinc from old stockpiled 
leach residues;
• studies and plant trials are under way to use zinc-
lead slag in cement manufacturing at the
Chanderiya smelter; and
• a research project has been undertaken to recover
zinc and lead from Rampura Agucha mine tailings
by bio-leaching.
Energy Conservation at HZL Mines
Energy consumption at HZL mines is primarily electrical and is mainly consumed in the ore beneﬁciation
process. During the past year, the speciﬁc electricity consumption at all HZL mines decreased by about
6%, following a 3% reduction in the previous year.
Much of this was achieved through optimum capacity utilisation, increasing the throughput rates,
improving grinding mill efﬁciencies and working at optimal levels to minimise energy consumption in
addition to reducing the consumption of chemicals and maximising metal recoveries.
Increased process automation and the use of energy efﬁcient equipment contributed to the reduction
in energy consumption per tonne of concentrates produced.
Signiﬁcant saving of diesel fuel was achieved at the Rampura Agucha mine where better scheduling
of dumper trucks improved refuelling practices and more efﬁcient engines have reduced diesel
consumption in dumpers by 7%.

Reclamation Process at BALCO
The reclamation of mined out areas at BALCO is carried out in the following manner:
• removal and storage of topsoil; 
• hard overburden and waste material are placed in the previously mined out area;
• after levelling and compaction of this backﬁlled material, the areas are 
covered with topsoil stacked separately in the earlier cycle of mining; and
• the reclaimed land is then afforested.
Ongoing care and maintenance is carried out to ensure a good survival rate for the plantation.
Energy Consumption
Total energy use (fuels and electricity) amounted to
19.6 million GJ during the year ended 31 March
2005. Excluding KCM, this represented an increase
of 5% over the previous year. This higher energy use
was primarily due to higher production levels.
Electrical energy accounted for about 70% of the
total energy used, an increasing proportion of which
is now being generated through captive facilities. 
Energy conservation efforts at Vedanta include
energy audits and identifying energy efﬁciency
projects such as the use of energy efﬁcient
equipment. Use of energy efﬁcient practices,
allocation of adequate resources for energy
conservation projects and regular follow-ups reﬂect
the Group’s belief in energy conservation.
Total energy use will increase signiﬁcantly over the
next few years as a result of the Group’s expansion
projects. However, the Group is targeting a 5%
reduction in speciﬁc electricity consumption through
energy efﬁcient projects.
Land Stewardship 
The Group fully appreciates the importance 
of minimising the disturbance to land and of
rehabilitating disturbed land. Vedanta’s initiatives 
in this area include some signiﬁcant successes:
• in all our bauxite mines at BALCO and MALCO, we
follow the practice of concurrent reclamation of
mined out areas by backﬁlling with overburden and
tree planting with suitable species;
• an abandoned HZL zinc-lead tailing dam of about
38 hectares at Zawar was rehabilitated by planting,
including an area with acid-producing tailing, using
an integrated biotechnological approach with the
help of the National Environmental Engineering
Research Institute;
• the systematic closure of two HZL underground
zinc-lead mines at Sargepali (Orissa) and
Agnigundala (Andhra Pradesh), including mine and
mill decommissioning, clean-up and plantation on
the waste dump and tailing dam; and
• a signiﬁcant proportion of land in use at various
operations is under green cover. Tuticorin smelter
has 25 hectares of greenbelt within its premises
while Rampura Agucha mine has 230 hectares of
greenbelt within its mining area, which constitute
about 25% of their respective land areas. These are
regularly maintained and augmented. Land outside
the facilities is also planted with the permission and
partnership of the local people.
Community 
Operations undertake various activities based on an
assessment of the needs and aspirations of the
community. The major thrust of community initiatives
are in the following areas:
• health care;
• education, sports and the disabled; 
• female empowerment and rural livelihood;
• rural infrastructure and community development; and
• ﬁnancial and organisational support to people in
distress.
Health Care 
Organised health care activities are only one part of
the Group’s community initiatives. KCM continues 
its pioneering initiatives in health care. Its rollback
malaria programme has recorded great success with
a 62% reduction in malaria cases and no fatalities
from malaria since 2001. This has resulted in the
KCM model being adopted by the Zambian
government in its national programme.

KCM has been central to Zambian mining industry
workplace HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, and
community outreach programmes. The International
Finance Corporation’s HIV/AIDS guide for the mining
sector was developed in partnership with KCM and
launched at the Konkola mine on 1 December 2004,
being World AIDS Day. 
Our health centres at the operating locations in India
routinely reach out to the needy by distributing
primary medicines. Awareness camps are regularly
organised by company doctors on reproductive
health, child immunisation and health problems of
speciﬁc target groups. The tribal populations 
around the Zawar mines of HZL and Kolli bauxite
mines of MALCO have been the beneﬁciaries of such
health camps. 
The Vizag smelter organised two blood donation
camps as part of an HIV/AIDS programme jointly with
the District AIDS Control Society and Blood Bank Cell
of King George Hospital, Visakhapatnam. The
Yashad Hospital at the Vizag smelter works with
PHC’s in the villages of Mindi, Gajuwaka and
Shriharipuram as part of our immunisation and
family welfare outreach programmes. Three
immunisation camps covered 1,485 children 
and 277 people were covered under four family
welfare camps.
Comprehensive health check-ups and systemic
examinations are being conducted for children in and
around the Zawar mine on a regular basis with a
follow-up including remedial measures. The Rajpura
Dariba mine’s health centre conducted check-ups on
360 children in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Support was extended to PHC’ s in three villages near
Tuticorin by providing necessary medical equipment to
enhance the quality of health care. Sterlite also
operates ﬁve rural health clinics providing access to
quality health care in twelve villages. T en health and
hygiene awareness camps were conducted during the
year ended 31 March 2005.
At BALCO, doctors visit adopted villages regularly,
with consultation and primary medicines provided
free of charge. At MALCO, a health clinic caters for
people below the poverty line and medical camps are
organised for the neighbouring population. 
VAL has organised mobile health units for efﬁcient
and quality health care, impacting 35 villages and
700 tribal families in the drought and famine stricken
terrain of Kalahandi district in the State of Orissa. The
PHC is being upgraded by adding 20 beds and other
accessories. Emphasis is placed on malaria
eradication by regular fume fogging.
There is also a vision of health care at the Group and
company level which transcends the boundaries of
the individual units. HZL sponsored a state-of-the-art
cardiology centre at Udaipur in 2002, funding the
entire capital cost itself. The centre is being run by the
Government of Rajasthan and in a short time span
has emerged as a leading centre beneﬁting mainly the
poor and tribal population of southern Rajasthan.
HZL contributed INR 500,000 to Kalyan Arogya
Sadan, Sikar and INR 4,100,000 to Vivekananda
Memorial Research Society, Tamil Nadu to strengthen
their infrastructure to promote the Indian system of
medicine. Himjyoti Foundation, Dehradun received
INR 1,100,000 for the promotion of herbal and
medicinal plants and development of a plant-based
health care system for rural areas. The Dr CT Mehta
Rehabilitation Centre received INR 800,000 as a
donation for the distribution of artiﬁcial limbs and
“Jaipur Foot” to the poor and needy.
Education, Sports and the Disabled 
Education
Education is an important part of the Group’s
community initiatives: 
• HZL, BALCO and MALCO fully fund schools at their
units, mainly catering for the children of employees
but also allowing children from the neighbouring
population to attend; 
• HZL spent INR 2,180,000 this year on various
educational activities including distribution of
uniforms, books, stationery and teaching/learning aids;
• there are more than a dozen private schools
operating in and around the townships of BALCO.
BALCO provides these schools with land and building
facilities, as well as providing grants-in-aid and
subsidised school buses to encourage formal
schooling amongst local children; 
• MALCO assisted in renovating two “Anganwadi”
centres to provide nursery facilities for local children
and provided books, stationery and uniforms where
required;  Vedanta Resources plc

• the distribution of study material beneﬁted over
1,400 children enrolled in the evening study centres
being run in and around Tuticorin by Sterlite; 
• VAL is creating a hostel facility at the Industrial
Training Institute, Bhawanipatna for 50 students,
renovating and constructing rooms in the existing
Government school at Lanjigarh for tribal children
and creating two child care centres at the
resettlement village, Niyamgiri Vedanta Nagar,
which will accommodate 200 underprivileged
children; and
• HZL is contributing INR 100,000 per month to
ISKCON Chowpatty for midday meals to children.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, HZL also
contributed INR 100,000 to Matrimangal Kanya
Mahavidyalaya, Ringas, INR 750,000 to Rawal
Mallinath ji Foundation, Jodhpur and INR 250,000
to Ramanandacharya Sanskrit Vishwavidyala, Jaipur
for midday meals to children.
Sports
The Group provides support to local communities in
a variety of sporting areas:
• in January 2005, KCM signed an agreement with
the Football Association of Zambia to provide
sponsorship for the KCM Premier League. This
league was ofﬁcially launched on 18 March 2005;
• the prestigious All India Hind Zinc Mohan Kumara
Mangalam Football Tournament is organised each
year by HZL at the Zawar mine, with teams
participating from across the country;
• the Tuticorin operation organised a district level
sports meet for children jointly with the sports
authority of Tamil Nadu. Over 900 promising
athletes from various parts of Tuticorin district
attended the meet in August 2004;
• the Zawar mine hosted a national camp for 1,300
cadets during the year and hosted a state-level and
district-level sports meet for school children; and
• the Vizag smelter hosted the Andhra Pradesh
Welfare Board Sports and Culture Meet 2005,
attracting 1,200 participants representing over 225
companies. The Vedanta Rolling Championship
Cup was introduced for the best team of the event.
The Disabled
HZL has been extending assistance to physically and
mentally challenged children. T o support this, the
Badhir Balkalyan Vikas Samiti, Bhilwara in Rajasthan
and Viklang Kalyan Samiti in Udaipur are recipients of
annual ﬁnancial support for training and rehabilitation
of disabled children, speciﬁcally aimed at
strengthening educational programmes for them.
Sterlite has signed a corporate membership agreement
with Vidya Pragasam Special School in Sankaraperi
Panchayat which has physiotherapy and vocational
training facilities for children with cerebral palsy,
autism and multiple disabilities. The school has 55
children coming from families living below the poverty
line.
Female Empowerment and Rural Livelihood
The Group is conscious of the issues of rural
livelihood and the important role that women can
fulﬁl. The aim is to organise SHG’s, in coordination
with other agencies, and to provide support for
vocational and skills training. The programme is at an
early stage but holds great promise, in particular:
• Tuticorin has made a start this year by promoting
and supporting a number of SHG’s; 
• HZL has donated INR 2,000,000 to local rural self-
governance through an NGO, Seva Mandir, to
create an endowment in February 2004 for the
protection and conservation of village commons
spread over six tribal blocks near Udaipur;
• VAL is providing regular employment to about
2,000 unskilled village youths in various project-
related activities by constantly upgrading their
skills. It has also facilitated the formation of eight
SHG’s in a resettlement village involving about 95
women to make them sustainable through small
businesses;
• KCM’s capacity building for small and medium
entrepreneurs holds great promise and is likely to
be extended to other units. KCM has a local
business development plan, which seeks to:
i) develop local business and contribute to poverty
alleviation in the short term, and 
ii) diversify the economy of the copper belt in the
long term;

Sustainable Development Report continued
• KCM has to date trained 23 SME’s in capacity
development under a partnership programme with
the African Project Development Facility, ﬁnanced
by the International Finance Corporation. An
evaluation revealed that turnover and employment
for the participating SME’s increased substantially;
and 
• the KCM Widows Cooperative was launched to
give ﬁnancial support to this vulnerable group. In
addition, training and other support was given to
farmers, mainly women, in beekeeping and honey
production.
Rural Infrastructure and Community
Development
The creation of durable assets and the renovation,
repair and maintenance of the existing public utility
infrastructure is a major part of the Group's
community programme.
HZL, as part of ongoing community support to local
needs at all units, has undertaken the digging of
tube wells and the maintenance of hand pumps.
In partnership with the Government of Rajasthan,
HZL is contributing INR 186 million towards the cost
of constructing the Mansi-Wakal dam. This dam is
due for completion in August 2005 and will augment
the drinking water supply of Udaipur.
Tuticorin has contributed INR 716,000 to implement
the Government’s Sajaldhara Scheme which will
provide drinking water to 43 villages around
Tuticorin and benefit 20,000 people.
MALCO undertook desilting operations at Yercaud
Lake by using local youths. This was an important
task in revitalising local drinking water sources.
School children have planted saplings around the
lake for better recharge and the use of plastic in and
around the lake has been banned.
Sterlite Foundation
The Group maintains close links and helps the
Sterlite Foundation, although this is an independent
charitable body.
The Sterlite Foundation was founded in September
1992, with the objective of assisting underprivileged
youths to realise their aspirations. The Foundation
focuses on three areas: education, child care and
female empowerment.
Education
The education funding consists of three areas:
• Sterliteracy provides training for around 70,000
students in 230 centres across India;
• the prison programme, where there are 26 centres
running education and vocational training in jails
throughout India; and
• the municipal training programme, which has
computer labs in 24 municipal schools, covering
some 30,000 school students. 
Child Care
There are 16 child care centres in Tamil Nadu 
and two in Orissa for children between three and 
six years of age. This was developed in response to
research looking into the needs of families below
the poverty line.
Female Empowerment
The Female Empowerment Scheme encourages
women to complete their higher education through
Reengus College, founded in 1995. The programme is
driven by the belief that “if a woman in the family is
educated then the entire family gets educated” .
Financial and Organisational Support to People
in Distress
Our deepest sympathies go out to all those who
suffered in the unprecedented T sunami disaster. The
Group extended both ﬁnancial and in-kind support.
The Group contributed INR 15 million to the disaster
relief funds in addition to one day’ s wages contributed
by employees. Relief material in the form of clothes,
blankets, stoves, food packets and utensils from the
MALCO and Sterlite operations located in T amil Nadu
were distributed to the victims.
HZL has undertaken various activities as part of
drought and famine relief in the villages around its
units in Rajasthan. The activities primarily focus on
providing fodder to livestock, drinking water to
humans and livestock, and digging/deepening of
wells. Immediate relief in terms of food packets and
clothes were distributed to an area near Rampura
Agucha mine which experienced ﬂash ﬂoods.
Fire tenders, ambulance and medical aid are routinely
offered in emergencies to assist in areas near to
Group units. Vedanta Resources plc

Way Forward 
Vedanta’s work in the community will be greatly
enhanced by the recent employment of a Group
manager, along with site level managers, to provide
thrust and focus in engaging with stakeholders,
assessing their needs and aspirations, and putting in
place appropriate plans and actions. The Group is
systematically seeking NGO’s who can act as partners
in our development initiatives. 
The Group commissioned the Institute of Rural
Management, Anand, and Xavier Labour Research
Institute, Bhubaneshwar, for NGO mapping in
Rajasthan and Orissa, respectively. Similar exercises
are being carried out in Tamil Nadu and
Chhattisgarh. The Group envisages further
improvements in community initiatives in the four
Indian states in which it operates. GIVE International,
a leading international NGO, is providing direction
and supervision in planning, monitoring and
evaluating these initiatives.
Substantial resources have been allocated to each
Group subsidiary to allow them to provide support to
their local communities on an ongoing long-term basis.
Scope and Basis of Sustainable 
Development Report
This report attempts to highlight our contribution to
sustainable development by our managed
operations, focusing on our performance in the areas
of safety, health, environment and community
development. Performance data for some of the key
indicators has been included in the report for all
current operations, except KCM, along with
comparative data for the past two years. These 
have also been aggregated across the Group, except
for KCM.
Reporting of data for current and past years, and their
comparability, is inﬂuenced by a number of changes to
the Group’ s operations, including new production
capacity, brownﬁeld expansion projects and adding
captive electricity generation facilities at many of the
Indian operations. These limitations have been
appropriately explained in this report. Comparability of
data is also affected by the different methodologies
adopted for data collection systems. We are
committed to continuous improvement and the
achievement of uniformity and consistency in data
collection and reporting systems, whilst also adding
further performance indicators in the coming years.

ASSURANCE STATEMENT
1. Background
At the request of Vedanta Resources plc (the “Group”), we have reviewed the contents of their
Sustainable Development Report of the 2005 Annual Report found on pages 31 to 44 (the “Report”)
relating to performance on Health, Safety, Environmental and Community initiatives (“HSEC”). The
Report is prepared by the Group, which is responsible for collection, compilation and presentation of
information within it.
Our responsibility is to provide conclusions regarding the information presented in the Report with
respect to HSEC performance of the Group. However, this Statement should not be taken as a basis for
interpreting the Group’s performance across the scope of issues covered in the Report.
2. Approach
There is currently no statutory requirement in India for preparation and publication, nor generally
accepted international standard relating to veriﬁcation, of HSEC reports.
Therefore, a review process was used employing a series of customised work steps to ensure
consistency in our assessment. This involved challenging and substantiating the assertions and claims
made in the Report, to the extent the Report relates to current year’s performance, and also involved a
review of processes for the collection, collation and internal reporting of HSEC data.
3. Limitation of scope
• The scope of our work was limited to making veriﬁcation visits to the Group’s units at HZL (Udaipur),
BALCO (Korba), Sterlite (Tuticorin) and MALCO (Mettur). The Australian and Zambian operations are
not covered by this assurance statement.
• Our review of the data reporting procedures was limited to sample checks of HSEC data for the year
ended 31 March 2005.
4. Basis of our review
The following steps were carried out by us in order to form our conclusion:
• Interview of the Group Manager (HSE) and key personnel at units such as functional heads as well as
personnel with responsibility for functions of HSEC.
• Review of selected documents which were used to capture and collate information relating to HSEC
performance parameters as well as policy and system documents.
• Conducted visits to key units, to review data collection, reporting and internal assurance processes
relating to HSEC performance.
5. Conclusions
The senior management of the Group has demonstrated commitment towards HSEC management
and implementing an HSEC governance system, as evidenced by periodic Group level review of such
matters. There is also the presence of Health, Safety and Environment and Corporate Social
Responsibility functions at individual units as well as at Group level. We observed that the Group has
developed internal procedures for HSEC data collection, compilation and analysis. Based on our review,
the key conclusions are as follows:
• Our sample check of some of the signiﬁcant data in the Report indicated that these have been
correctly transposed from internal reporting, and the contents of the Report is consistent with
documentary evidence obtained during the course of our work, with the exception of data related to
water usage at units (other than Sterlite, Tuticorin), which rely partly on estimation and not on
metering, and therefore there is scope for improving reliability.
• The Report provides few key performance indicators (“KPIs”) on HSEC matters. Completeness of the
Report could be improved if additional HSEC KPIs, relevant to the Group’s processes and operations,
were included.

Annual Report 2005
Corporate Governance Report
Introduction 
Vedanta’s shares have been listed on the London Stock Exchange since December 2003. Most of the Group’s
assets and management are located in India. Three of the Group’s subsidiary companies are currently listed on
stock exchanges in India and maintain their own corporate governance arrangements in line with Indian
regulations. In addition, BALCO and HZL, along with the Group’s recently privatised Zambian business, KCM,
have government appointees on their company boards who represent wider stakeholder interests.
The Group’s Executive Chairman, Mr Anil Agarwal, is the Group’s original promoter and founder having built
the Group from its inception in 1976. Volcan Investments Limited, a company controlled by Mr Agarwal and
his family, remains the Group’s controlling shareholder with a 54% interest. The relationship between Volcan,
Mr Agarwal and the Group is governed by a Relationship Agreement which was entered into by the Company
and Volcan at the time of Listing in December 2003; it is designed to ensure the Company can operate
independently of the controlling shareholder (described below in further detail).
Since Listing, the Board has moved towards compliance with the requirements of “The Combined Code on
Corporate Governance” issued by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”) in July 2003. The Board
believes that in the interest of all shareholders, the application of corporate governance must reﬂect the nature
and location of the Group’s businesses, the ownership of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Group’s
development needs and ensuring that talents within the Group are utilised to their fullest potential.
Statement of Compliance
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2005, Vedanta has complied with Section 1 of the Code, save as set 
out below.
Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement and as disclosed at the time of Listing, Volcan will be consulted on all
appointments to the Board. The Nominations Committee therefore works collaboratively with Volcan over
making appointments to the Board, and to this extent, does not follow the process set out in the Code
(Provision A.4.1).
Mr Agarwal did not meet the independence criteria set out in the Code at the time of his appointment as
Executive Chairman on 23 March 2005. He had previously been Chief Executive of the Company and is the
controlling shareholder of the Company (Provisions A.2.2 and A.3.1). The Board believes that India is changing
rapidly and presents the Group with signiﬁcant opportunities. The appointment of Mr Agarwal has allowed
him to step back from operational management and to focus on turning these opportunities into value
creating projects. Together with the appointment of Mr KK Kaura as Chief Executive, the Board considers that
this allows best use of the talents within the management team.
Due to changes in Board membership during the year, no evaluation of the Board, its committees or individual
Directors has been performed during the year (Principle A.6) and membership of the Board committees has not
been maintained fully in compliance with the requirements of the Code (Provisions A.4.1, B.2.1 and C.3.1).
However at the end of the year, membership of all Board committees complied with the Code.
The Company fully complies in all other respects with the Code, with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing
Authority and with the UK Companies Acts, and the Board remains fully committed to conducting the Group’s
affairs in a transparent manner.
The Board 
The Board is responsible for setting leadership standards for the Group, sponsoring and monitoring its principal
businesses, securing ﬁnancial and other resources to enable those businesses to pursue their strategic
objectives, ensuring that the Group maintains appropriate internal control systems and ensuring effective
relationships with shareholders are maintained.
Board Composition
The Board consists of an Executive Chairman, three Executive Directors and four independent Non-executive
Directors. During the year, there have been seven appointments to the Board and ﬁve Directors have left
the Board. 
Independence
The Board considers that all of the Non-executive Directors are independent of the Company as deﬁned by
Code Provision A.3.1. The Board is aware that Messrs Mehta and Macdonald have held previous senior
management positions within subsidiary companies of HSBC Holdings plc, which acted as the joint global
coordinator and bookrunner at the time of the Company’s Listing in December 2003. 
At the time of their appointments, the Board considered that neither Mr Mehta’s nor Mr Macdonald’s previous
employments included the provision of corporate ﬁnance services in London by the HSBC Group (and thus they DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 49
Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate Governance Report continued
had no prior involvement with the Group prior to their appointment), and that the value of the business
transacted between the Company and the HSBC Group was less than 1% of the turnover of either
organisation.
Mr Mehta left the HSBC Group within a month of the Company’s Listing. Prior to Mr Mehta’s appointment to
the Board, different members of the Board met with Mr Mehta as a result of which they concluded that he
would bring clarity of thought and an independent perspective to the Board’s discussions, as well as valuable
banking experience. This was felt to be especially pertinent in the light of the Group’s bond issue and other
corporate ﬁnance activity. Consequently, the Board does not consider that Mr Mehta’s past involvement with
the HSBC Group would be likely to affect his judgment as a Director. 
Mr Macdonald left the HSBC Group in 2002, over a year before the Company listed on the London market.
Similarly, the Board believes that Mr Macdonald’s experience of international commercial banking will be of
great value to the Company and that he will bring an independent perspective to the Board’s discussions.
Consequently, the Board does not consider that Mr Macdonald’s past involvement with the HSBC Group
would be likely to affect his judgment as a Director.
Relationship Agreement
At the time of Listing, Volcan and the Company entered into the Relationship Agreement to regulate the
ongoing relationship between them. The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the
Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of Volcan, the Agarwal Family and their associates.
Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, the Board and Nominations Committee will at all times
comprise a majority of Directors who are independent of Volcan and the Agarwal Family, and the
Remuneration and Audit Committees shall at all times consist only of Non-executive Directors. Volcan is
entitled to nominate for appointment as Director such number of persons as is one less than the number of
Directors who are independent of Volcan, the Agarwal Family and their associates.
Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director
On 23 March 2005, the Board appointed Mr Anil Agarwal as Executive Chairman and Mr Kaura, previously
Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, was appointed to the Board as Chief Executive. The Executive Chairman, as agreed by
the Board, will be primarily responsible for providing strategic leadership to the Board and further enhancing
Vedanta’s exceptional growth pipeline. Meanwhile the Chief Executive, as agreed by the Board, will be
primarily responsible for leadership of the executive team, implementation of the Group’s strategy, the
management of resources, the maintenance of a sound control environment, setting budgets and managing
performance within those budgets.
The Executive Chairman is also a director of Sterlite Gold Limited, which, by virtue of having the same
controlling party as the Company, is regarded as a related party of the Group.
Mr Navin Agarwal was appointed Deputy Executive Chairman on 1 June 2005, to provide support to the
Executive Chairman.
Mr Chandra is the Company’s Senior Independent Director, having been appointed to that role on
24 November 2004. The principal duties of the Senior Independent Director are: to be available to shareholders
to discuss any concerns they may have about the running of the Company, especially where the normal
channels of communication would not seem appropriate; and to lead discussions at meetings of the
independent Non-executive Directors.
Board Appointments
Over the course of the year, the Board has sought to improve the balance of the Board by appointing Non-
executive Directors with a breadth of skills and experience to support the Executive Directors in implementing
the Group’s strategy. The composition of the Board combines specialist knowledge of the economic, political
and market environments within which the Group operates with expertise of international mining. This has
been achieved by the appointments of Messrs Naresh Chandra (who brings good knowledge of the Indian
political and economic environment to the Board), Aman Mehta (banking and Asian capital markets),
Dr Shailendra Kumar Tamotia (metals and mining expertise, especially in India) and Mr Euan Macdonald
(international corporate banking experience). As previously announced on 24 March 2005, the Board intends
to appoint a further UK-based senior independent Non-executive Director.
Mr Kaura was appointed to the Board as Chief Executive on 23 March 2005. In order to give a greater
management presence on the Board and to improve communication with the Executive Committee, Mr Navin
Agarwal was appointed as an Executive Director on 24 November 2004. Both appointments were made on the
recommendation of Mr Anil Agarwal as the then Chief Executive and subsequently approved by the
Nominations Committee. Mr Navin Agarwal’s appointment as an Executive Director was by virtue of his
responsibilities and experience since joining Sterlite at its inception, and not as an appointee of Volcan
pursuant to the Relationship Agreement. DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 50

Board Attendance
During the year, the Board has met six times for full scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee has met three
times, the Remuneration Committee, four times and the Nominations Committee, three times. Attendance
of members at Board and committee meetings, of which they have been given notice, is set down in the
following table:
Only members of a Board committee are entitled to attend the relevant committee’s meetings, although other
Directors may attend Board committees at the invitation of the relevant committee chairman.
During the year, separate meetings were held respectively involving the previous Chairmen meeting with the
Non-executive Directors, and the Senior Independent Director meeting with the Non-executive Directors.
Board Development
The Board has established procedures for providing formal induction for the new Non-executive Directors,
taking into account their existing qualiﬁcations and experience. These procedures include meetings with senior
management and the Company’s lawyers, brokers and external auditors.
Board Administration
The Board has an agreed schedule of matters reserved to it, which has been updated since Listing, and newly
adopted terms of reference for Board committees. Most operational decisions are delegated to the Executive
Committee and the boards of subsidiary companies.
The Executive Committee provides a conduit for keeping the Board informed of Group performance and
developments. It consists of the Executive Directors and senior management who head up the Group’s
principal operations and functions. The Executive Committee meets monthly to consider corporate matters
and has regular reviews with the executive teams from each of the principal subsidiaries. The biographies of
the Directors and members of the Executive Committee appear on pages 46 and 47.
In view of the presence of a signiﬁcant number of Board members at the monthly meetings of the Executive
Committee and the existing subsidiary board infrastructure, routine meetings of the Board are now scheduled
quarterly to coincide with the approval of the quarterly results, with additional meetings being set as and when
required to deal with matters that fall outside this timetable. The Board has established procedures for the
timely circulation of papers prior to Board meetings.
The Company Secretary is appointed and removed by the Board and provides administrative services to 
the Board.
Arrangements have been made for Directors to receive independent professional advice in the performance 
of their duties at the Company’s expense, if they require it. Directors are entitled to have concerns raised about
the running of the Company recorded in Board minutes. The Company has put suitable directors’ and ofﬁcers’
liability insurance cover in place.
The Notice convening the forthcoming AGM is included within the accompanying Chairman’s letter. This
provides full details of the resolutions being proposed to re-appoint Directors appointed during the year and
those retiring by rotation. The Board fully supports all of the re-appointment resolutions being put forward at
the AGM.

Relations with Shareholders
The Board is responsible for ensuring an effective dialogue between the Company and its shareholders.
Formal communication with shareholders is mainly through meetings with the Executive Directors, including
the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Board is regularly briefed by the Head of Investor
Relations, Mr John Smelt, on the Company’s relationships with its shareholders.
The Company announces its results on a quarterly basis (in full for the preliminary and interim announcements
and in abbreviated form in the intervening quarters). Analysts’ presentations involving the Executive Directors
are made following the release of the interim and year end results. Analyst and shareholder visits have been
arranged in India and, following the KCM acquisition, Zambia.
The Chairmen and the Senior Independent Director have been available to discuss issues and concerns of
major shareholders during the year and opportunities for such meetings are offered to major shareholders,
through the Company’s brokers. Contact with the Chairman and/or the Senior Independent Director may be
made directly or through the Head of Investor Relations. The Non-executive Directors are also available to meet
as and when such meetings are requested.
The interim and annual reports remain the primary means of communicating with the Company’s
shareholders. The Company’s website (www.vedantaresources.com) was relaunched during the year to
strengthen communications with investors and includes press releases, ﬁnancial reports and other information
of interest. The Company has considered the possibility of using electronic means of communicating with
shareholders but has concluded that it does not have a sufﬁciently large share register to enable it to achieve
major savings or efﬁciency by utilising electronic communications further, over and above those facilities
already available for electronic communications within the CREST share trading system.
The Board is happy to encourage the constructive use of the Company’s annual general meeting for
shareholder communication. At the forthcoming AGM, an update on trading will be given on the performance
of the Group prior to the formal business of that meeting. Shareholders will be provided with the opportunity
to ask questions of the Board and the chairmen of the various Board committees, and to present their views.
Separate resolutions will be proposed on each substantially separate issue put before the meeting. At the 2004
AGM, the level of proxies cast for each resolution was communicated following approval of each resolution
and a similar approach will be taken at the forthcoming AGM. Details of proxy voting will be placed on the
Company website. The AGM will be convened giving at least 20 working days’ notice.
Nominations Committee
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee have been revised during the year to bring them in line
with the recommendations of the Code. The terms of reference are available upon request from the Company
Secretary.
In conjunction with the consultation of Volcan pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, the Nominations
Committee has a role in reviewing the size and composition of the Board, particularly the balance between
Executive and Non-executive Directors, and advising the Board on proposed appointments of new
Non-executive Directors. It drew up a list of criteria to be used in assessing potential new appointments to the
Board and this was used as part of the selection process for new Non-executive Directors appointed during the
year. In view of the desire to recruit Non-executive Directors with appropriate skill sets and experience gained
in India and/or in the international mining sector, the Nominations Committee felt that the Directors’ contacts
would be better placed to identify suitable candidates for appointment than by employing an external search
consultancy or open advertising. In the process of appointment, a number of candidates were recommended
by Directors, considered for appointment and selected based on the pre-agreed set of criteria.
The Chairman is also chairman of the Nominations Committee and consequently Mr Anil Agarwal was
appointed Chairman of the Nominations Committee on 1 June 2005. During the year, Messrs Gilbertson and
Fowle served as Chairmen of the Nominations Committee. Sir David Gore-Booth chaired the Board when it
considered the appointment of Mr Fowle as Chairman and Mr Chandra chaired the Nominations Committee
and the Board when it considered the appointment of Mr Agarwal as Chairman. The other members of the
Nominations Committee are Messrs Chandra and Macdonald and Dr Tamotia.
The Executive Directors’ service agreements and terms of appointment for the Non-executive Directors are
available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce and head ofﬁce.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Report, providing a statement on the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration,
beneﬁts, share scheme entitlements and pension arrangements is set out on pages 55 to 61. A resolution 
to approve the Remuneration Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 52
Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate Governance Report continued
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee have also been revised during the year and are
available upon request from the Company Secretary. Following the death of Sir David Gore-Booth in October
2004, Mr Naresh Chandra was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 24 November 2004,
having previously been appointed to the Remuneration Committee on 14 June 2004. The other members of
the Remuneration Committee are Messrs Macdonald and Mehta.
Audit Committee
The role of the Audit Committee has been reviewed during the year in the light of the Code and the
Smith Guidance incorporated into the Code. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee have also
been revised in the light of the Smith Guidance. The terms of reference are available upon request from
the Company Secretary.
The primary role of the Audit Committee has been conﬁrmed in the new terms of reference as principally
being to oversee:
• the integrity of the ﬁnancial reporting system of the Group;
• the Group’s approach to risk and internal controls; 
• the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit activity;
• the Group’s relationship with its external auditors; and
• compliance with relevant statutory and required ﬁnancial reporting standards, including corporate
governance disclosures.
In addition to the requirements of the Code, the Group subsidiary companies, by virtue of their listings on
Indian stock exchanges, have their own audit committees, which are established in accordance with Indian
corporate governance requirements. This provides a second level of ﬁnancial oversight below the Audit
Committee, which also monitors the discussions and ﬁndings of the Group’s subsidiary audit committees.
Mr Mehta is the chairman of the Audit Committee, having been appointed on 24 November 2004. The other
members of the committee are Messrs Chandra and Macdonald. The Board considers that Mr Mehta has
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience by virtue of his roles at HSBC Bank and his experience on the audit
committees of other international companies. Mr Chandra brings a strong understanding of the Indian
corporate governance environment to the Audit Committee (having chaired the Government of India’s
Committee on Corporate Governance). Three Audit Committee meetings have been held during the year,
of which one meeting was dedicated to reviewing and approving policies and procedures to ensure that the
Company can achieve full compliance with the ﬁnancial reporting and internal control principles set out in
Part C of Section 1 of the Code.
Financial Reporting and Going Concern
In presenting the annual and interim ﬁnancial information, and similar signiﬁcant publications, the Board aims
to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. The Audit
Committee has adopted a procedure setting out responsibilities for the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting
infrastructure. The procedure incorporates the review of the Financial Statements and related documents, and
the process for recommending approval of the Financial Statements to the Board and their audit clearance by
the external auditors. The Committee also reviews the external auditors’ management letter (with a follow-up
review of management responses). It also reviews the basis on which the Board makes its statement regarding
going concern.
The Board has adopted the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements, as the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. This expectation is based on the most recently approved funding plan which reﬂected the
2005/06 budget and funding forecasts used to support the Group’s recent credit ratings by Standard and Poor
and Moody’s; the use of the net proceeds of $825 million raised at the time of Listing and funds raised, in two
tranches during the year, through the issue of the $600 million bond; and the requirements of the Group’s
$2.2 billion capital expansion programme. The funding plan also reﬂects the committed borrowing facilities
available to the Group. The Board also took into account potential contingent liabilities and other risk factors.
Risk Management
Following the review of risks at the time of the Company’s Listing, an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group has been introduced which accords with
the Turnbull Guidance incorporated into the Code. This involves a continual review and prioritisation of risks
throughout the Group and the identiﬁcation of risk mitigation control strategies. There is a clear accountability
for the identiﬁed prioritised risks. DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 53
Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
Corporate Governance Report continued
The Executive Committee has approved the risk management process and regularly reviews information on
the Group’s signiﬁcant risks, along with relevant control and monitoring procedures, for completeness and
accuracy. In addition, the Executive Committee also reviews strategic risks and opportunities arising from
changes in the Group’s business environment.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, annually reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of
internal control in the context of the Turnbull Guidance. Up to the date of approval of this Annual Report, the
Directors are satisﬁed that the Group has an ongoing process for identifying, managing and evaluating risks
which meets the Turnbull Guidance.
Internal Control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The principal aim of the system of internal control is the management of business risks, with
a view to enhancing the value of shareholders’ investments and safeguarding the Group’s assets. Due to the
limitations inherent in any such system, this is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk. Accordingly,
it provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Regular Group-wide cross-discipline management reporting, which provides a balanced assessment of key
risks and controls, is an important component of Board assurance on the internal control environment. In
addition there is a dedicated committee focussing on the speciﬁc risks of health, safety and environment which
provides assurance to the Board on these matters.
The Group operates a comprehensive annual planning, ﬁnancial reporting and forecasting process. The Board
formally approves a strategic plan and the annual budget. The Group’s performance is monitored against the
budget on a monthly basis by the Executive Committee, and on a quarterly basis by the Board, and signiﬁcant
variances are reviewed. The Audit Committee also receives a twice yearly review of all material tax exposures
and material litigation undertaken by or against the Group, and considers the associated risks.
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries has in place procedures to ensure that sufﬁcient internal control is
maintained. These procedures include monthly meetings of each subsidiary’s management committee and a
quarterly meeting of the audit committee of that subsidiary. The board of directors of the relevant subsidiary
appoint these committees.
Internal Audit
The Group’s internal audit activity is managed through a single Group-wide Management Assurance function,
which is supported by the services of leading international accountancy ﬁrms, other than the Group’s external
auditors. Internal audit is an important element of the overall process by which the Board obtains the
assurance it requires that the risks are being properly identiﬁed, managed and controlled. The responsibilities
of the internal audit function include recommending improvements in the control environment and ensuring
compliance with the Group’s procedures and policies. Ordinarily, signiﬁcant operational units are audited on a
monthly basis and signiﬁcant head ofﬁce and administrative units are audited quarterly.
The Audit Committee approves the resourcing of the Management Assurance function, who have access to
management and the Audit Committee. The scope of work and resources of the Management Assurance
function are periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure that it is adequate in light of the key risks
facing the Group and other monitoring functions in place. It also reviews the risk assessment and audit plan
prepared by the Management Assurance function on an annual basis. Whilst the Audit Committee routinely
meets with both the internal and external auditors to discuss matters of internal control, it also receives reports
on the signiﬁcant ﬁndings of internal audits that have been undertaken. Follow-up actions by management
noted in internal audit reports and the external auditors’ management letter are tracked by the Management
Assurance function to ensure that they have been implemented.
The Head of Management Assurance, Mr Raajeev Batra, attends meetings of the Audit Committee and has
reporting lines to the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman, if necessary.
The Audit Committee has set down the criteria by which it will assess the effectiveness of internal audit
activities on an annual basis.
External Audit
Assessment: The Audit Committee has established a procedure by which it will consider and make
recommendations to the Board as appropriate concerning the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the
external auditors. The Audit Committee annually assesses the qualiﬁcation, expertise and effectiveness of the
external auditors. It has also established criteria by which the independence and objectivity of the external
auditors will be assessed. It proposes to use these criteria following the current audit. DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 54
Corporate Governance Report continued
Independence: The Audit Committee has considered potential risks to the independence of the external
auditors, in particular:
• the Self-interest threat – the auditors could beneﬁt from a ﬁnancial interest in the client;
• the Self-review threat – the auditors may be reviewing their own work;
• the Advocacy threat – the auditors are involved in promoting the client’s interests;
• the Familiarity threat – because of their relationship, the auditors may be too sympathetic to the client’s 
interests; and
• the Intimidation threat – the auditors may be put in a situation where they are pressurised by the client.
The Audit Committee’s criteria for assessing the independence and objectivity of the external auditors aim to
minimise the possibility of these threats crystallising. To support this, policies concerning the employment of
former employees of the external auditors and the use of the external auditors to perform non-audit services
have been adopted.
In regard to the latter, the Audit Committee has distinguished between services relating to the statutory audit
and related services that must be completed by the external auditors (for example, the bond issue assurance
work); non-audit services that the external auditors could perform (for example, merger & acquisition due
diligence work and tax advisory services); and non-audit services that the external auditors should not perform
as they present a high risk of conﬂict based on advice issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (for example, work on accounting records, internal
audit and IT consultancy). The Audit Committee believes that there are certain non-audit services for which it is
cost-effective for the external auditors to be used and which do not constitute any discernible threat to their
independence. Any non-audit service assignments for fees in excess of $100,000 may only be awarded to the
external auditors after competitive tender, and with the prior approval of the Finance Director. During the year,
the only signiﬁcant non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors was the due diligence work in
connection with the KCM acquisition, the fees for which amounted to $200,000 and which was awarded to
the external auditors after competitive tender.
A panel of accounting ﬁrms (which does not include the current external auditors) are invited to tender for
non-audit work as and when necessary. This policy is consistent with the ethical standards recommended by
the Auditing Practices Board.
The Audit Committee approves the scope of the year end audit, approves the terms of engagement and then
reviews the ﬁndings of the auditors following the completion of each audit.
Other Audit Committee Activity
The Audit Committee has reviewed the arrangements by which staff of the Company or any Group subsidiary
may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in ﬁnancial reporting or other matters.
Aprocedure had already been included in the code of ethics adopted by the Indian operating companies.
The existing version was considered to provide a suitable set of guidelines and has been re-afﬁrmed. This is
being revised and upgraded to take account of issues raised by the Code and other relevant regulatory
requirements in the UK.

Remuneration Report
Introduction 
The Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policies and practices adopted by the Company during
the year ended 31 March 2005 in respect of members of the Board.
The Group’s operations are primarily managed in India and the senior management team is largely based there.
It is not possible, therefore, to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company’s approach to Executive
Directors’ remuneration without putting it into the context of the wider management structure.
This Remuneration Report therefore also sets out the remuneration policies and practices relating to the
Executive Directors in this broader Group context.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
“Regulations”). Part II of this report contains the information on which the auditors are required to report to
the Company’s members.
PART I
Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)
The Chairman of the Committee is Mr Naresh Chandra, who was appointed to this role on 24 November
2004, having previously been appointed to the Committee on 14 June 2004. The other members of the
Committee are Messrs Euan Macdonald and Aman Mehta.
The Committee is primarily responsible, on behalf of the Board, for setting the remuneration policy and
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and for maintaining an awareness of the overall
remuneration of the key operational and functional heads within the Group (“the Senior Management
Group”). The Committee’s aim is that the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Group are rewarded
appropriately for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance the return to shareholders.
The Committee is directly responsible for setting the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors.
Mr Anil Agarwal, in his capacity as Executive Chairman, and Mr KK Kaura, in his capacity as Chief Executive,
attend meetings of the Committee by invitation. No Director plays a part in any discussions about his own
remuneration. The Committee has involved Mr S Venkatesh (Head of Human Resources), in his capacity as
Minutes Secretary to the Committee, in determining the remuneration and beneﬁts offered to the Executive
Directors during the year, and the Committee has also consulted Mr Anil Agarwal to a lesser degree in 
this regard.
During the year, the Committee sought independent advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), in
their capacity as remuneration advisers to the Committee, concerning remuneration levels for certain of the
Directors. PwC provided no other services to the Company in the UK during the year. The Indian associate ﬁrm
of PwC provided internal assurance services to the Group during the year. The Australian associate ﬁrm of PwC
are the external auditors to one of the Group’s operating companies in Australia, Thalanga Copper Mines Pty
Limited. PwC are no longer the remuneration advisers to the Committee.
The Committee’s terms of reference have been reviewed during the year to ensure that they reﬂect the
recommendations of the Code. A copy of the terms of reference of the Committee is available from the
Company Secretary.
Remuneration Policy 
Over the past few years, the Group has moved its emphasis away from developing the capability of its senior
management team through active external recruitment, towards a policy of developing management from
within the existing operations. Consequently, the remuneration policies adopted by the Group are less
concerned about remuneration packages that support an aggressive approach to the recruitment of senior
managers, seeking rather to ensure the continued retention and incentivisation of managers. This principle
applies to the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group as a whole, most of whom are located in
India, and who are critical to ensuring the successful management of the Group’s activities and
implementation of the strategy.
The policy of the Group, therefore, is to reward the management competitively, enabling the Group to
motivate and retain high calibre executives. The Group is particularly concerned to ensure that managers are
motivated and incentivised to continue to perform at the highest levels.
The following factors are taken into account when setting remuneration levels for the Executive Directors and
the Senior Management Group:
• levels of remuneration throughout the Group;
• market practices prevailing in the countries in which executives work; and
• market practices in the Indian mining and industrial sectors (in respect of operational management) and in all
sectors (in respect of corporate and supporting functions).  DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 56
Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
Remuneration Report continued
The Group attempts to align the interests of the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group with those
of the shareholders by linking share and cash incentives to corporate performance. Therefore, the
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group comprise:
• a salary for day-to-day performance of duties;
• an annual bonus as an incentive to meet short-term goals – these are set by reference to personal Key Result
Areas (“KRA’s”) and the ﬁnancial performance of the Group;
• awards under the LTIP , referred to below, to incentivise long-term and strategic performance; and 
• beneﬁts in kind in accordance with local market practice.
Salaries, Pensions and Other Beneﬁts
Salaries and Cost to Company
Salaries for the UK-based Executive Directors are established by reference to those prevailing in the
employment market for company directors in the mining sector and comparable UK listed companies.
In India, salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Senior Management Group are set by reference to
those positions of comparable status, skills and responsibility in the metals and mining industries, and in the
manufacturing and engineering industries more generally. The basic remuneration of executives in India is
referred to as “Cost to Company” (“CTC”) which represents an aggregate ﬁgure encompassing basic pay,
pension contributions and allowances.
Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura both have service agreements with Sterlite which have been augmented by
letters of appointment with the Company. On the dates of their respective appointments to the Board until 31
March 2005, Mr Navin Agarwal was entitled to CTC of INR 20,001,264 per annum and Mr Kaura was entitled
to CTC of INR 12,500,000 per annum, pursuant to their Sterlite service agreements. Letters of appointment
were also agreed with Vedanta, under which Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura are each to be paid fees of
£50,000 per annum, to reﬂect the amount of time that they spend on Board business.
Messrs Navin Agarwal’s and Kaura’s remuneration have been set by reference to individuals with comparable
roles and responsibilities in similar sized organisations in India.
Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis and changes will generally be implemented with effect from 1 April
each year taking into account the period of service during the year. The salary levels of the Executive Directors
agreed by the Committee on 1 June 2005, to take effect from 1 April 2005, are as follows:
(*) Using an exchange rate of INR 79.61: £1
Pensions
The Company does not provide pension beneﬁts to either Mr Anil Agarwal or Mr Sydney-Smith and this is
reﬂected in the determination of their overall remuneration packages. The Indian-based Executive Directors
are entitled to membership of the Central Provident Fund and a Superannuation Fund which provide pension
beneﬁts consistent with local market practice. These are deﬁned contribution pension arrangements.
Contributions to the Central Provident Fund and Superannuation Fund are included within the CTC payable
to an individual in India.
Beneﬁts in Kind
Beneﬁts in kind provided to the UK-based Executive Directors are private medical insurance, life assurance and
permanent health insurance. Mr Anil Agarwal is provided with a car and fuel in the UK for business and
personal use. For his frequent business trips to India, Mr Anil Agarwal is provided with a car and driver for
business use and is entitled to the exclusive use of Company-owned accommodation.
Beneﬁts in kind provided to Indian-based senior executives are set in line with local market practice, and
include private medical insurance, accident insurance, the use of a car and driver, and for certain individuals,
the provision of accommodation, either in Company-owned or leased premises. Messrs Navin Agarwal and
Kaura are provided with Company-owned and leased accommodation, respectively. Mr Kaura is also entitled
to a mortgage subsidy, to reﬂect his move to Mumbai following his appointment as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer in
December 2003, although no such beneﬁt in kind was received during the year ended 31 March 2005. 
Mr Navin Agarwal was also reimbursed club membership fees.

Annual Bonus 
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme providing the Executive Directors and the Senior
Management Group with an opportunity to earn a cash amount based on the achievement of demanding
annual performance targets. The bonus targets are reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of the
ﬁnancial year over which performance will be measured. The annual bonus is non-pensionable.
The maximum bonus payable to the Executive Directors is 100% of annual salary. In respect of Messrs Navin
Agarwal and Kaura salary means the aggregate of their salary payable from Vedanta and their CTC payable by
Sterlite. Performance conditions are attached to all bonus arrangements which are all set by reference to
personal KRA’s and the ﬁnancial performance of the Group. The majority of KRA targets relate to ﬁnancial or
operational measures, however certain KRA’s monitor performance in respect of softer issues, or “enablers”,
for example, people management and environmental performance.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, the payment of the annual bonus was dependent on the achievement of
a combination of individual and corporate objectives, which closely correlated to the responsibilities of the
individual and the Group budget for the year. EBITDA was taken as the single parameter of corporate
performance, and the weighting for this parameter was 50%. An individual’s performance against his KRA’s,
as reviewed in the annual performance appraisal, accounted for 40% of an individual’s bonus weighting, with
the remaining 10% of the bonus weighting being for the personal qualities of an individual.
Employee Share Schemes
The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of “at risk”
remuneration for Executive Directors. Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on
Listing. The Board has no present intention to introduce any further share schemes.
The LTIP
The Group intends that the LTIP will be the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives will be
provided to the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group. The Committee has decided to change the
timing of the main awards under the LTIP to bring them in line with the Group’ s ﬁnancial reporting cycle. This
will enable future grants to be awarded on the basis of performance during the previous ﬁnancial year, as well as
being subject to the performance conditions described below. During 2005, the Committee will grant the main
awards under the LTIP following the announcement of the Group’ s results. A small number of awards were
granted at the meetings in June 2004 and November 2004 for senior managers who joined the Group after the
last main award in February 2004. After November 2004, the majority of awards are expected be made on an
annual basis following the announcement of the Group’ s results.
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100% of
annual salary. In respect of Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura salary means the aggregate of their salary payable
by Vedanta and their CTC payable by Sterlite. The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members
of the Senior Management Group is calculated by reference to the balance of basic salary and share-based
remuneration consistent with local market practice.
The performance condition attaching to outstanding awards under the LTIP is that the Company’s
performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) (being the movement in a company’s
share price plus reinvested dividends), is compared over a three-year period with the performance of the
companies constituting the FTSE Worldwide Mining Index (excluding precious metals) from the date of grant.
The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against the comparator group at
the end of the three-year performance period. The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with straight-
line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.
The performance condition will be measured by taking the Company’s TSR over the four weeks immediately
preceding the date of grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the three-year
performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group described above.
The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Committee will be provided by
the Company’s advisers. The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the
Company’s total return has out-performed the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests
of the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Group with those of the shareholders.
No awards will vest unless the Committee is satisﬁed that the Company’s TSR performance reasonably reﬂects
the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance.
Details of the awards held by the Executive Directors at 31 March 2005 are shown in the table of “Directors’
Long Term Incentive Awards” on page 61.

The Reward Plan
The Reward Plan was adopted for the purpose of rewarding 43 employees (none of whom were Executive
Directors at the time) of the Group who had contributed to the Company’s development and growth over the
period leading up to Listing. It was used solely to provide awards on Listing and no further awards will be
granted under the Reward Plan.
Under the Reward Plan, awards were made in respect of 776,000 shares on 26 February 2004 and vested in
two instalments. The ﬁrst half of the award vested immediately and the shares were issued on 31 March 2004.
The other half of the award, vested on the ﬁrst anniversary of the date of award (subject generally to the
employees’ continued employment at that date). Consequently a total of 388,000 shares were issued on
18 and 31 March 2005. Awards made under the Reward Plan are not subject to performance conditions as
these were considered to be rewards for past service rather than incentives for future performance. Two
Executive Directors – Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura – received vested shares under the Reward Plan,
although, in both cases, the initial awards were made prior to their appointments to the Board.
The Vedanta Resources Share Option Plan (the “Share Option Plan”)
The Share Option Plan was adopted to provide maximum ﬂexibility in the design of incentive arrangements over
the long-term. However, at this stage, it is not intended that share options will be granted in the foreseeable future
under the Share Option Plan.
Total Shareholder Return Performance Graph
The graph below shows the TSR performance of the Company in comparison with that of the FTSE 250 Index
and the FTSE Worldwide Mining Index (excluding precious metals) for the period from 10 December 2003 (the
date of Listing) to 31 March 2005. The FTSE 250 Index has been chosen as a suitable comparator index
because it comprises UK listed companies of similar size and complexity to the Company. The FTSE Worldwide
Mining Index (excluding precious metals) is presented as it is the comparator group for the LTIP . To provide
more detail, the graph presents performance on a monthly basis rather than using year end dates as required
by the Regulations.
Relative Importance of Fixed and Variable Pay
A significant proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors is performance-linked. Assuming the
Executive Directors receive the maximum bonus entitlement and full vesting of the maximum LTIP awards,
the chart above right demonstrates the balance of fixed and variable pay in these circumstances for the
Executive Directors.
Executive Directors’ Service Contracts 
Mr Anil Agarwal and Mr Sydney-Smith are both employed under contracts of employment with the Company
which may be terminated by not more than six months’ and twelve months’ notice, respectively. Provision is
made in both their contracts for payments to be made in lieu of notice on termination. In the case of Mr Anil
Agarwal this would be equal to basic salary and costs to the Company for providing certain beneﬁts during the
notice period or part thereof. For Mr Sydney-Smith this would equate to basic salary and bonus during the
notice period or part thereof.
For both Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura, their letters of appointment with Vedanta may be terminated by
giving six months’ notice. In the case of their service agreements with Sterlite, they may be terminated by
giving three months’ notice. In any event, Mr Kaura’s appointment as a Director of the Company and Sterlite
will automatically expire on 30 June 2006, being the expiry date speciﬁed in his Sterlite contract. Mr Navin
Agarwal’s appointment as a director of Sterlite will expire on 31 July 2008, being the expiry date speciﬁed in
his Sterlite contract, whilst his appointment as a Director of the Company is a rolling contract. The Sterlite
contracts and the Vedanta letters of appointment may be renewed.

Non-executive Directors’ fees
The Board is responsible for setting Non-executive Directors’ fees and reviews them periodically. In setting the
fees of Non-executive Directors, the Board has taken into account the complexity of the Group, the signiﬁcant
travel and time commitment required for attending Board and other meetings in India and the UK, and the
unique risk proﬁle of the Company. Non-executive Directors’ fees are made up of three elements:
Base fee £50,000
Committee membership fee Up to £5,000 (depending on the scope of the committee concerned)
Committee chairmanship fee Up to £20,000 (depending on the scope of the committee concerned)
Chairman’s Fees
The Chairman’s fees are approved by the Board (without the Chairman being present) on the recommendation
of the Committee.
Mr Agarwal’s salary as Chief Executive was not changed following his appointment as Executive Chairman.
On his appointment Mr Fowle’s fees were increased to £250,000 per annum. The Committee took advice on
market fee levels in comparable companies in setting Mr Fowle’s fees. On his departure from ofﬁce on 23
March 2005, Mr Fowle was paid 12 months’ pay in lieu of notice.
Mr Gilbertson was paid £91,000 during the period from 1 April 2004 until his resignation on 5 July 2004. He
was also paid compensation of £24,000 in lieu of notice as his letter of appointment expired at the time of the
Company’s ﬁrst annual general meeting held on 29 July 2004.
Non-executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment 
The Non-executive Directors have Letters of Appointment which may be terminated by either party giving
three months’ notice. The Non-executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment set out the time requirements
expected of them in the performance of their duties. Non-executive Directors are normally expected to spend
at least 20 days per year on Company business. There are no provisions in the Letters of Appointment of the
Non-executive Directors for compensation to be paid in the event of early termination.
Individual Service Contract Details
External Appointments
The Board’s policy on external appointments is that an Executive Director may accept one appointment
external to the Group (other than any appointment to related parties of Volcan in the cases of Messrs Anil
Agarwal and Navin Agarwal) as a non-executive director of a publicly listed company anywhere, but with the
prior approval of the Board, and that the fees for any such appointment may be retained by the individual.
Currently none of the Executive Directors holds any such outside appointments, other than Mr Anil Agarwal’s
and Mr Navin Agarwal’s directorships of related parties of Volcan.
Equity Dilution resulting from Employee Share Schemes
The dilution limits set out in the rules of the employee share schemes adopted in December 2003 allow up to
an aggregate of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital to be issued or issuable pursuant to awards under
any of the Company’s employee share schemes over a period of ten years. Up to 5% of the Company’s issued
share capital may be used for the Company’s discretionary schemes over a ten-year period. Shares issued or
issuable pursuant to awards made under the Reward Plan are not counted for these purposes. Currently
0.53% of the Company’s issued share capital is issuable in respect of outstanding awards under the LTIP .

Directors’ Long Term Incentive Awards
The performance conditions attached to LTIP awards granted in the current year require the Company’s TSR to
equal or exceed the TSR performance of the median company of the FTSE Worldwide Mining index (excluding
precious metals) before 40% of the award can vest, and to be equal to or greater than the performance of the
Company at the upper quartile of that group for the whole award to vest. Awards vest on a sliding scale in
between these points.
The mid-market price of the shares at 31 March 2005 was 471 pence and from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005
the share price varied between 270 pence and 510 pence. No options to Directors were granted, lapsed or
exercised in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Directors’ Interests in Ordinary Shares
The interests of the Directors (which are beneﬁcial unless otherwise stated) in Ordinary Shares as at 31 March
2005 were:
(1)
Mr Anil Agarwal has an interest in the 154,157,911 Ordinary Shares held by Volcan Investments Limited.
(2)
At the date of his appointment, Mr Navin Agarwal was also interested in 100,000 Ordinary Shares, being the number of shares

Directors’ Report
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their report and audited Financial Statements of Vedanta Resources
plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Principal Activities
The Company is a holding company for a diversiﬁed metals and mining group. The Group has three major
activities:
• the Aluminium Business, comprising bauxite mining, alumina reﬁning and aluminium smelting operations;
• the Copper Business, comprising mining, smelting and reﬁning operations; and
• the Zinc Business, comprising zinc-lead mining and smelting operations. 
The Group’s other activities include an aluminium conductor business and an investment in an aluminium foil
business. With the exception of KCM in Zambia, acquired during the year, and two copper mines in Australia,
the Group’s operations are all located in India. The principal subsidiaries and associated undertakings of the
Group are listed in note 42 to the Financial Statements.
Business Review and Future Developments
The Chairman’s Statement on pages 4 and 5, the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 14 and the Financial
Review on pages 18 to 30 provide a review of the business during the year and likely future developments.
Financial Results
The audited Financial Statements are presented on pages 68 to 117. Group turnover and operating proﬁt for
the year ended 31 March 2005 amounted to $1,884.2 million (2004: $1,289.5 million) and $331.8 million
(2004: $237.1 million), respectively. Attributable Proﬁt was $120.0 million compared to $72.3 million in the
prior year.
Dividend
The Directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 11.55 US cents per Ordinary
Share (2004: 5.5 US cents per Ordinary Share). Subject to the approval of shareholders, the ﬁnal dividend will
be paid on 19 August 2005 to shareholders on the register of members as at 22 July 2005.
Taken together with the interim dividend of 5.5 US cents per Ordinary Share declared on 24 November 2004
and paid to shareholders on 14 January 2005, the total dividend for the year is 17.05 US cents per Ordinary
Share (2004: 5.5 US cents per Ordinary Share).
The Board has decided to offer shareholders the option of receiving dividends in UK pounds sterling. A rate of
£0.537 to the US dollar was applied to the interim dividend resulting in an equivalent interim dividend of
2.9535 pence per Ordinary Share. An exchange rate of £0.550 to the US dollar will be applied to the ﬁnal
dividend resulting in an equivalent ﬁnal dividend of 6.325 pence per Ordinary Share, making a total UK pounds
sterling equivalent for the year of 9.306 pence per Ordinary Share.
Share Capital
On 18 and 31 March 2005, 303,000 Ordinary Shares and 85,000 Ordinary Shares, respectively, were allotted
to executives of the Group as fully paid following the exercise of awards under the Reward Plan. These
allotments represented the second tranche of shares under the Reward Plan. No further allotments will be
made under the Reward Plan.
The Company’s authorised share capital as at 31 March 2005 was $40,000,000 and £50,000, comprising
400,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 Deferred Shares, respectively. The Company’s issued share capital as
at that date was 50,000 Deferred Shares, one of which has been fully paid, and 49,999 of which have been
paid up as to one-quarter of their nominal value, and 286,776,000 Ordinary Shares each credited as fully paid.
As at the date of this report, there has been no other change to the authorised and issued share capital since
31 March 2005.
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2005 are also set out in note 22 to the
Financial Statements. Vedanta Resources plc

Signiﬁcant Changes to the Group’s Capital Structure
In May 2004, the Company injected $100 million into Vedanta Alumina Limited to progress the development
of the alumina project. This investment was followed by an independent valuation of the assets jointly
commissioned by the Vedanta and Sterlite boards which increased the Company’s Economic Interest to 94%,
with approximately 70% of those shares being held through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and
the balance held by Sterlite.
A one-for-two rights issue was launched by Sterlite on 12 August 2004 and closed on 24 September 2004. The
total proceeds of the rights issue were $434 million of which the Company subscribed $433 million. As a result
of this subscription, the Company’s direct interest and Economic Interest in Sterlite increased to 75% and 81%
respectively.
In November 2004, the acquisition of a 51% interest in KCM in Zambia was completed for an initial
consideration of $27.3 million with the total consideration expected to be $48.2 million, before the effect of
discounting deferred consideration of $20.9 million and excluding acquisition expenses of $1.0 million.
In December 2004 and January 2005, the Company issued a total of $600 million 6.625% bonds due February
2010. The proceeds of the bond issue had been substantially remitted to India by 31 March 2005 for the
funding of Group projects.
Post Balance Sheet Events
Enviromental Clearance – Sterlite
On 25 April 2005, the Group obtained the necessary clearances from the Government authorities to
commence production of copper cathode at its expansion project at Tuticorin. The expansion project will
increase the smelting capacity of Sterlite from 180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa.
Commissioning of Zinc Smelter – HZL
On 31 May 2005, it was announced that the expanded smelter of HZL had been commissioned. The expansion
project will increase the Group’s reﬁned zinc capacity from 220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa.
Directors and Directors’ Interests
The names, speciﬁc responsibilities and biographical details of the current Board of Directors are shown on

Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests of the Directors and their immediate
families in the share capital of the Company, options to subscribe for shares in the Company and interests in
the share capital of its subsidiaries are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 61.
A third party provision, as deﬁned in section 309 B(1) of the Companies Act 1985, is in force for the beneﬁt of
each of the Directors.
Sustainable Development
The Group is committed to maintaining high standards of health and safety in its operations and ensuring
the environment and communities in which its operations are located beneﬁt from the Group’s support.
Details of the Group’s approach to sustainable development is set out in the report on pages 31 to 45.
Charitable Donations 
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of $2.8 million. The most signiﬁcant charitable
donations were $340,000 to relief funds associated with the Tsumami disaster, $820,000 to the Sterlite
Foundation and $1.1 million to the Kahan-Raj Sarvoday Trust. The Sterlite Foundation and the Kahan-Raj
Sarvoday Trust are charitable organisations working with the disadvantaged in the community.
The Board believes that working with the communities in which the Group operates is critical to the success of
its operations and is an important element of the Group’s philosophy and culture. Donations to charities
working in these communities is one of the primary conduits by which the Group provides such support.
Further details about the Group’s involvement with local communities during the year can be found in the
Sustainable Development Report.
Political Donations
During the year, Sterlite made a donation of $1.3 million to the Public and Political Awareness Trust in India
(“the Trust”), a trust whose principle objective is the promotion of political awareness in India. Further details
are set out in note 30 to the Financial Statements.
The Board recognises that making political donations is a sensitive issue amongst shareholders and during the
year has approved a policy concerning the payment of political donations. Under this policy, the Trust or Group
companies do not make donations or contributions to political organisations within the United Kingdom or
European Union.
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 1 June 2005, the Company has been notiﬁed, in accordance with sections 198 to 208 of the Companies
Act 1985, of the following interests in the Ordinary Shares of the Company:
(1) 
The Company has also been notiﬁed that Agnivesh Agarwal and DP Agarwal are indirectly interested in 154,157,911 Ordinary
Shares (representing 53.76% of the Company’s issued share capital) by virtue of their beneﬁcial interest in shares in Volcan.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group does not follow any speciﬁc external code or standard on payment terms. Instead, responsibility for
determining payment terms is delegated to the individual Businesses within the Group which take into account
local market and industry practice. As a Group, the policy for determining payment terms is either to agree
terms of payment at the start of a binding contract or to ensure that the supplier is aware of the individual
business’ usual payment terms. Payment is made in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations,
and reﬂects local market practices.
The Company is a holding company and, as such, has few suppliers. Trade creditor days of the Company at
31 March 2005 were 20 days (2004: 15 days).
Value of Land
Land is carried in the balance sheet at historic cost. It is not practical to estimate the market value of land and
mineral reserves and resources at any one point in time since the market values depend on commodity prices
which ﬂuctuate on a day-to-day basis.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each ﬁnancial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the
ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those Financial Statements,
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control,
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Vedanta Resources plc

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members
of Vedanta Resources plc
We have audited the Financial Statements of Vedanta Resources plc for the year ended 31 March 2005 which
comprise the consolidated proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement,
the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses, the statement of accounting policies and the
related notes 1 to 43. These Financial Statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein. We have also audited the information in the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Company’s Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information contained in the Annual
Report including the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited in accordance with
relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether
the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the Financial Statements, if the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the
Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the July 2003 FRC Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained in the Annual Report for the above year 
as described in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Financial Statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having
been audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors
in the preparation of the Financial Statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion,
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
the Group as at 31 March 2005 and of the proﬁt of the Group for the year then ended and the Financial
Statements and part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Prior Year Adjustment
The accounting policies applied in preparing the ﬁnancial information are consistent with those adopted and
disclosed in the Group’s statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2004, with the exception of the
Group’s accounting policy in respect of employee trusts. The Group has reviewed its accounting policy for
employee trusts in light of UITF Abstract 38 “Accounting for ESOP Trusts”, which has been adopted for the
ﬁrst time this year. As required by this abstract, own shares held by employee trusts have been reclassiﬁed from
other investments and are now recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. This has the effect of increasing
the Group’s interest in Sterlite by virtue of the change in treatment for the Sterlite shares held by the SEWT.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported ﬁgures have been
restated accordingly.
The effect on the proﬁt and loss account of adopting this policy is as follows:

Year ended 31 March 2004 $ million $ million $ million
Proﬁt after tax 157.4 157.4 –

Dividends (48.9) (48.9) –
Retained proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year 71.1 66.3 4.8
The adoption of this policy led to an increase in the net assets of the Group of $4.8 million at 31 March 2004
(1 April 2003: $8.4 million).
2. Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial information for the Group has been prepared under the historical cost convention
and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
To provide information which is meaningful to the Company’s shareholders, the Directors believe that it is
necessary to prepare the accounts on the basis that the Group had existed throughout the period from 1 April
2003. The Directors believe that this information reﬂects the ongoing operations of the Group more clearly.
Vedanta and VRHL’s combination with the Twin Star Holdings Group has been accounted for as a group
reconstruction under the provisions of FRS 6 (“Mergers and Acquisitions”) and is presented as if the Company
and VRHL had been the holding company and intermediate holding company, respectively, of the Twin Star
Holdings Group for each year.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial information incorporates the Financial Statements of the Company and all its
subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls. This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to
govern a company’s ﬁnancial and operating policies so as to beneﬁt from its activities or where the Group
owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a company’s equity voting rights.
The principal subsidiaries included in the consolidation are set out in note 42. The abbreviations used
throughout these Financial Statements, in respect of these subsidiaries, are detailed in note 42. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2005
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 73
2. Accounting Policies continued
Acquisitions and Disposals
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the
date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the
fair value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and
leases, that amount is capitalised within tangible ﬁxed assets as mining properties and leases. Other excess
purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill within intangible
ﬁxed assets and is amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years. Provision is made for
any impairment.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate. The unamortised balance
is reviewed for impairment on a regular basis.
Negative goodwill is similarly included in the balance sheet and is credited to the proﬁt and loss account in the
periods in which the acquired non-monetary assets are recovered through depreciation or disposal. Negative
goodwill in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired is credited to the proﬁt and loss account through
amortisation over the periods expected to beneﬁt.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the ﬁrst post-
acquisition ﬁnancial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any
adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased
goodwill, are incorporated in the ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁrst full ﬁnancial year following the acquisition.
Investments in Associates
In the consolidated Financial Statements, investments in associates, being investments over which the Group
exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity, are accounted
for using the equity method.
The consolidated proﬁt and loss account includes the Group’s share of associates’ proﬁts/losses, whilst the
Group’s share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet, based upon the
most recent audited ﬁnancial statements or unaudited interim ﬁnancial information. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above. Any unamortised
balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates.
Other Investments
Fixed asset investments, other than investments in subsidiaries and associates, are recorded at cost less
provision for impairment.
Current asset investments primarily comprise bank term deposits, short term unit trusts, liquidity funds and
ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debt securities. These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tangible Fixed Assets – Mining Properties and Leases
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining
properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as tangible ﬁxed assets in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production
expenditure is capitalised until the mining property is capable of commercial production. From that point,
capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit of production basis over the total
estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are
written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves. Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of
production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Tangible Fixed Assets
The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-
refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to the working condition
and location for its intended use. Expenditure incurred after the ﬁxed assets have been put into operation,
such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged to the proﬁt and loss account in the
period in which the costs are incurred.

2. Accounting Policies continued
Assets in the Course of Construction
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the capital work-in-progress account. Upon completion,
the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of tangible ﬁxed assets. Costs associated
with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of
operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
Interest payable on borrowings and foreign exchange gains or losses from hedging activities related to
construction or development projects are capitalised until substantially all of the activities that are necessary to
bring the asset into productive use have been completed.
Depreciation
Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, and freehold land, are not
depreciated. Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production
commences, as described in “Tangible Fixed Assets – Mining Properties and Leases” . Leasehold land and
buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to
write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful
life, as follows:
Buildings: Operations 30 years
Administration 50 years
Plant and equipment 10 – 20 years
Ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures 3 – 20 years
Motor vehicles 9 – 11 years
Impairment
The carrying amounts of tangible ﬁxed assets, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill are
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the
asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the proﬁt and loss account.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable
amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future
cash ﬂows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful
life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other tangible ﬁxed assets, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net
realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an
arm’s length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cash-
generating unit.
Research and Exploration Expenditure
Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred unless a decision is taken
that a mining property becomes viable for commercial production.
Government Grants
Government grants relating to tangible ﬁxed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the proﬁt
and loss account over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the proﬁt
and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
Stocks
Stocks and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for
obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following basis: 
• raw materials (including ore and concentrates) and consumables are recorded at cost on a ﬁrst-in, 
ﬁrst-out (“FIFO”) basis, except for stores and spare parts which are carried at weighted average cost;
• coal and furnace oil used in the Aluminium Business, and metal and coke stocks are valued at weighted
average cost;

Stocks continued
• ﬁnished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an
attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity; and
• by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to
completion and disposal.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but have not reversed, at
the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future,
or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise
from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the
extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to
distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension schemes, the assets of which are (where funded) held in separately
administered funds. The pension schemes are generally funded by payments from employees and the relevant
Group companies, taking account of the recommendations of independent qualiﬁed actuaries.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account in respect of pension costs
and other post-retirement beneﬁts is the estimated regular cost of providing the beneﬁts accrued in the year,
adjusted to reﬂect variations from that cost. The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially
level percentage of current and future payroll. Variations from regular cost are charged or credited to the proﬁt
and loss account as a constant percentage of payroll over the estimated average remaining working life of
scheme members. Differences between amounts charged to the proﬁt and loss account and amounts funded
are shown as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For deﬁned contribution schemes, the amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account in respect of pension
costs and other post-retirement beneﬁts is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments
in the balance sheet.
Details of the Group’s pension schemes are provided in note 29.
Employee Share Awards
The estimated cost of employee share awards made by the Group is charged to the proﬁt and loss account
over the relevant performance period. The estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded or
the intrinsic value of the awards (being the difference between the exercise price of the award and the market
price at the date of grant) adjusted to reﬂect any applicable performance conditions.
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable that
an outﬂow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. Provisions are
reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reﬂect the current best estimate.

Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental
disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine. Costs arising from the installation
of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and capitalised at
the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the
proﬁt and loss account over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding
of the discount on the provision.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are
provided for at their net present values and charged to the proﬁt and loss account as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting sales
taxes and duties, and is recognised when all signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are
transferred. Dividends are recognised when received.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments
are not made on such a basis.
Foreign Currency Translation
In the ﬁnancial statements of individual group companies, transactions in currencies other than the local
functional currency are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction or,
where forward exchange contracts are in place, at contractual rates. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into local currency at year end
exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
For the purposes of consolidation, the results of those entities for which the US dollar is not the reporting
currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period. The related balance
sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation
of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that
they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of total
recognised gains and losses. All other exchange differences are included in the proﬁt and loss account.
The principal exchange rates applied for the translation of the Group’ s ﬁnancial information are set out below:
As at Average As at
$ Currency rates 31 March 2005 2004/2005 31 March 2004
Indian rupee (INR) 43.75 44.96 43.39

Australian dollar (A$) 1.298 1.357 1.312
UK pounds sterling (GBP) 0.533 0.542 0.545
Capital Instruments
Ordinary Shares are included in shareholders’ funds. Other instruments are classiﬁed as liabilities if they contain
an obligation to transfer economic beneﬁt and, if not, they are included in shareholders’ funds.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs. The ﬁnance cost
recognised in the proﬁt and loss account in respect of capital instruments, other than equity shares, is allocated
to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying value. The carrying amount is
increased by the ﬁnance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the
period. Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless conversion actually occurs. No gain or loss is recognised
on conversion.

Derivative Financial Instruments
In order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters
into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative ﬁnancial instruments. It is the Group’s policy neither
to hold nor issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses the derivative ﬁnancial instruments described above to manage exposure to foreign exchange,
interest rate and commodity price risks. The Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge
accounting when the following criteria are met:
• the instrument is related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics
have been identiﬁed;
• it involves the same currency as the hedged item; and 
• it reduces the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account, or as
adjustments to the carrying amount of ﬁxed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reﬂected in
the Financial Statements. The rates applicable to such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a
probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a ﬁxed rate to a variable rate
or vice versa. Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the
period of the contract.
Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated future production or purchases, the option premiums paid
are amortised over the life of the option and any realised gains and losses on exercise, in the period in which the
hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made, are recognised.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is
eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting proﬁt or loss is recognised at that time.

Overview of the Indian Direct Tax Regime
The following is an overview of the salient features of the Indian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of
the Group:
• companies are subject to Indian income tax on a stand-alone basis. There is no concept of tax consolidation
or group relief in India;
• companies are charged tax on proﬁts of assessment years which run from 1 April to 31 March. For each
assessment year, a company’s proﬁts will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum Alternate Tax
(“MAT”), whichever is the greater;
• regular income tax is charged on book proﬁts (prepared under Indian GAAP) adjusted in accordance with
the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act. Typically the required adjustments generate signiﬁcant timing
differences in respect of the depreciation of ﬁxed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax
losses brought forward and pension costs. Regular income tax is charged at 35% (plus a surcharge). The
corporate tax rate has been revised to 30% (plus a surcharge) from the ﬁnancial year 2005/06;
• MAT is charged on book proﬁts (prepared under Indian GAAP) but typically with a limited number of
adjustments. MAT is charged at 7.5% (plus a surcharge);
• there are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India. The most important to the
Group are:
(i) The industrial undertakings’ exemption. Proﬁts of newly constructed industrial undertakings located
in designated areas of India can beneﬁt from a tax holiday. A typical tax holiday would exempt
100% of the plant’s proﬁts for ﬁve years, and 30% for the next ﬁve years, and
(ii) The power plants’ exemption. Proﬁts on newly constructed power plants can beneﬁt from a tax
holiday. A typical holiday would exempt 100% of proﬁts in ten consecutive years within the ﬁrst 15
years of the power plants’ operation. The start of the ten-year period can be chosen by a company;
• tax is payable in the ﬁnancial year to which it relates; and
• tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and aggressive
challenge by the tax authorities. There are appeals procedures available to both the tax authorities and
taxpayers and it is not uncommon for signiﬁcant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for
several years before they are ﬁnally resolved in the High Court or the Supreme Court.

Overview of the Zambian Tax Regime
• copper and cobalt mining companies pay company tax at 25%;
• period for carry forward of tax losses for KCM and Smelterco is 20 years;
• companies are charged tax on proﬁts of accounting years;
• income tax is charged on book proﬁts (prepared under IFRS) adjusted in accordance with the provisions of
the Income Tax Act 1996 as amended; and
• tax returns are submitted on a self assessment basis to the Zambian Revenue Authority (“ZRA”) which will
review the return if found inadequate. Any disputes will be referred to the Revenue Appeals Tribunal and
subsequently to the High Court or the Supreme Court.

Dividend distribution tax 3.0 –
Minimum Alternate T ax 1.1 0.7
Adjustments in respect of prior years 0.1 (4.9)
Current tax charge for the year 65.4 68.8
The majority of the Group’s proﬁts are earned and taxed in India and in Zambia. During the period the effective
tax rate has been signiﬁcantly less than the applicable Indian corporate rate of income tax. This is primarily as a
result of the signiﬁcant tax exemptions (industrial undertakings and tax holidays) which have been available to
shelter proﬁts of Sterlite and HZL from regular income tax. The statutory tax rate in Zambia applicable to KCM
is 25%, which also has a reducing impact on the effective tax rate. A further reduction in the corporate tax rate
from the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 has reduced the overall effective tax rate due to its impact on deferred tax.
(c) Factors that may Affect Future Tax Charges
The effective tax rate of the Group in future periods is likely to be inﬂuenced most signiﬁcantly by the following
factors:
• the availability of exemptions and tax holidays to shelter proﬁts from regular Indian income tax;
• the potential utilisation of accumulated tax losses of CMT, IFL, VRHL and the Company, the potential
beneﬁt of which has not been fully recognised as a deferred tax asset; and
• incremental tax costs, if any, of distributing earnings to shareholders through the Group structure.

2005 pursuant to the exercise of the second tranche of awards under the Reward Plan. The issue of these shares
has been included in determining the 2005 weighted average number of shares.
Proﬁt for the year would be diluted if holders of the convertible bonds in Sterlite exercised their right to convert
their bond holdings into Sterlite equity. The impact on proﬁt for the year of this conversion would be the
difference between interest payable on the convertible bond and the higher charge attributable to minority
interests if conversion was to occur.
The outstanding awards under the LTIP are reﬂected in the diluted EPS ﬁgure through an increased number of
weighted average shares.

IFL’s debt includes a loan of $23.3 million with ICICI Bank. There is an option to convert this debt to equity
shares, at par value, at any time up to the maturity of the loan in 2011. If this option were exercised, MALCO’s
holding in IFL would reduce from 38.8% to 8.4%. As this option has not been exercised, the Group’s interest
in IFL has been accounted for using 38.8%.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, Sterlite advanced loans to IFL amounting to $6.2 million for working
capital purposes. The loans were advanced during the period 2 April 2004 to 7 February 2005 and are
repayable within two years. The loans bear interest at 7% per annum and interest accrued during the year
ended 31 March 2005 amounted to $0.3 million.The loans have been classiﬁed as part of the investment in the
associate.
During the year ended 31 March 2004, IFL issued preference shares to the value of $6.3 million (Sterlite – 
$5.5 million; MALCO – $0.8 million) for non-cash consideration in full settlement of its liabilities to these
companies at that time.
Fixed assets in IFL were revalued between 1980 and 1994.

(b) Deferred Taxation
The Group has accrued signiﬁcant amounts of deferred tax. The majority of the deferred tax liability represents
accelerated tax relief for the depreciation of capital expenditure, net of losses carried forward by MALCO and
CMT. No beneﬁt has been recognised for excess losses of CMT, TCM, IFL, VRHL and the Company on the
grounds that their successful application against future proﬁts is not probable in the foreseeable future.

(a) Konkola Copper Mines PLC
On 5 November 2004, the Group completed the acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in KCM, a company
incorporated in the Republic of Zambia, for a total cash consideration of $49.2 million (including acquisition
expenses of $1.0 million). KCM’s principal activities comprise copper mining and smelting, and its operations
are located in the Republic of Zambia. 
The Group subscribed for $25.0 million of new ordinary shares in KCM, representing 51% of the enlarged
issued share capital of KCM. Additionally, the Group agreed to pay $23.2 million to ZCI, a minority shareholder
in KCM, comprising an initial payment of $2.3 million at the date of acquisition, with the remaining $20.9
million payable in equal instalments over four years from 31 December 2005. As required under UK GAAP , the
deferred consideration of $20.9 million has been discounted to arrive at a net present value of $17.8 million,
thereby resulting in a consideration of $46.1 million for the purposes of the goodwill determination.  Vedanta Resources plc

The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional and will be ﬁnalised in the 2006 Financial
Statements, when the fair values exercise will have been completed; particularly as regards the determination
of environmental provisioning in light of the Development Agreement entered into by KCM and the
Government of Zambia at the date of acquisition, and the valuation of ﬁxed assets after completion of a review
of the existence and productivity of plant and equipment at KCM.
The principal fair value adjustments are as follows:
• write off of secondary development expenditure which had been capitalised by KCM, whereas Vedanta’s
accounting policy requires this expenditure to be charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred;
• increase in the provision for post-retirement employee beneﬁts arising from actuarial valuations completed
as at the date of acquisition;
• creation of a provision relating to the price participation agreement with ZCCM which obliges KCM to pay
commission to ZCCM in the event that copper prices exceed a deﬁned threshold;
• decrease in sundry debtor balances over which there is uncertainty as to their recoverability; and
• creation of a deferred tax asset arising from certain of the fair value adjustments set out above, offset by a
reduction in the deferred tax asset attributable to tax losses over which there is uncertainty as to their
recoverability in the time horizon permitted by the Group’s accounting policies. Vedanta Resources plc

KCM reported a proﬁt after taxation and minority interests of $30.0 million in the period from 1 January 2004

Since acquisition, KCM contributed $68.9 million to the Group’s net operating cash ﬂow and utilised 
$21.0 million for capital expenditure.
(b) Sterlite Employee’s Welfare Trust 
On 2 January 2004, the Group purchased 4.98% of Sterlite’s issued share capital from the SEWT for a cash
consideration of $58.0 million, being the open market price at that date. Following this acquisition, the Group’ s
Economic Interest in Sterlite increased to 70.8%. On 2 April 2004, the Group purchased 2.4% of Sterlite’ s 
issued share capital from the SEWT for a cash consideration of $21.4 million, being the open market price at
that date. Following this acquisition, the Group’ s Economic Interest in Sterlite increased from 70.8% to 71.6%.
The SEWT is treated as a quasi-subsidiary and consolidated within the Financial Statements. Consequently, as
these acquisitions are intra-group transactions, the cash consideration eliminates on consolidation and is thus
not included as an acquisition cash ﬂow in the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, and there is no cash impact
to the Group.
At 31 March 2005, the SEWT held 3,559,263 shares in Sterlite at a cost of $7.8 million (31 March 2004:
5,049,297 shares at $9.0 million).
(c) Sterlite Rights Issue
In September 2004, Sterlite completed its rights issue in which Twin Star subscribed for its own entitlement
and those rights not taken up by the minority shareholders. As a result of Twin Star subscribing $433 million to
the total rights issue of $434 million, the Group increased its Economic Interest in Sterlite from 71.6% 
to 81.3%.
(d) Vedanta Alumina Limited
VAL was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sterlite at 31 March 2004. During the year ended 31 March 2005, 
an independent valuation of the business was carried out by KPMG jointly on behalf of Sterlite and Vedanta.
Based on this valuation, the value of VAL was determined at $138 million. Based on Vedanta’s equity
subscription of $100 million, undertaken in May 2004, Vedanta has a 70.5% interest in VAL thereby diluting

28. Financial Instruments
The Group’s accounting policies with regard to ﬁnancial instruments are detailed in note 2. The Group does
not trade in ﬁnancial instruments. As permitted by FRS 13 “Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments:
Disclosure”, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures other than the currency
disclosures.
Derivatives, Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and commodity prices. The use of derivatives can give rise to credit and market risk. The Group
controls credit risk by only entering into contracts with banks and institutions with the highest national or
international standing. The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring by
appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by
management and the Board. The market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the
underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, options and other derivatives to hedge the
effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The sources of
foreign exchange risk are outstanding amounts payable for imported raw materials, capital goods and other
supplies as well as ﬁnancing transactions, loans and current asset investments denominated in foreign
currencies. The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on its exports. Most of these transactions are
denominated in US dollars. The policy of the Group is to determine on a regular basis what portion of the
foreign exchange risk on ﬁnancing transactions, loans and current asset investments are to be hedged through
forward exchange contracts and other instruments. There are systems in place for the review of open (i.e.
unhedged) exposure limits and stop-loss levels by management.
Interest Rate Risk
The short-term debt of the Group is principally denominated in Indian rupees with ﬁxed rates of interest. While
no signiﬁcant interest rate risk arises on this portion of the debt, the Group utilises interest rate swap products
to optimise the interest liability. Most of the foreign currency debt is on ﬂoating rates of interest linked to six-
month US dollar LIBOR. The Group has a policy of selectively using interest rate swaps, option contracts and
other derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. These exposures are reviewed
by appropriate levels of management on a monthly basis.
Counterparty and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of debtors, current asset investments and derivative ﬁnancial
instruments. There is no concentration of credit risk among the debtors of the Group given the large number
of debtors and the business diversity. Credit risk on debtors is very limited as almost all credit sales are against
letters of credit of banks of national standing. In respect of current asset investments, counterparty limits are in
place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. For derivative and ﬁnancial instruments,
the credit risk is limited as the Group only deals with banks and institutions with the highest national or
international standing. These exposures are further reduced by having standard ISDA Master agreements
including set-off provisions with each counterparty.
Commodity Price Risk
The Group has historically been extremely conservative in the use of derivatives for commodity hedging. 
As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable contractual terms. Moreover,
hedging is used purely as a risk management tool and in some cases to secure future cash ﬂows 
by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments.
Aluminium
The raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the London Metals Exchange prices. Currently no
hedging is being done for Aluminium.
Copper
Copper smelting operations at Tuticorin beneﬁt from a natural hedge created by matching quotational periods for
concentrate purchases with timing of ﬁnished metal sales. The balance, the “free metal“ (being the difference
between payable metal and recovery, and the previous metal content), are hedged through forward contracts or
options. For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, the policy is to hedge a part of the production as
determined by management.
Zinc and Lead
The raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the London Metals Exchange prices. Currently an
element of exports out of India is hedged through forward contracts or other instruments. Vedanta Resources plc

• interest rate exposures by using interest rate swaps, options and other derivative instruments; and
• structural and transactional currency exposures, and currency exposures on future expected sales by using
currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, options and other derivative instruments.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged
is itself recognised. The carrying value of ﬁnancial derivatives are thus held in the Financial Statements at

29. Pensions
The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia and Zambia.
(a) Deﬁned Contribution Schemes
Indian Pension Schemes
Central Provident Fund
The Central Provident Fund relates to all full time Indian employees of the Group. The amount contributed by
the Group is a designated percentage of 12% of basic salary, together with an additional contribution of 12%
of salary made by the employee.
The beneﬁt is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation
Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to senior executives. Each
relevant company holds a policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (“LIC”), to which each company
contributes a ﬁxed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required,
taking into consideration the number of years of service of the executive, and the contributions made.
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a deﬁned contribution basis and contributions are
charged directly to the proﬁt and loss account.
Pension Fund
The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the Government. The employee makes no
contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month. This must be
provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of 60 (the statutory retirement age for all non-professional employees), contributions cease and the
individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through the years, and on their
salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level. The Government funds these
payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of
whether the central fund is in surplus or deﬁcit.
It is not possible to assess the Group’s own level of assets or liabilities within the Pension Fund as it is effectively
a multi-employer scheme. On this basis, it is accounted for as a deﬁned contribution scheme. No information
regarding the overall level of surplus or deﬁcit in the fund is publicly available.
Australian Pension Schemes
The Group also operates deﬁned contribution pension schemes in Australia. The contribution of a proportion
of an employee’s salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia. The
employer contributes at least 9% of the employee’s gross remuneration into the employee’s fund of choice and
the employee has the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian Pension Schemes
The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full time permanent employees of KCM (subject to the fulﬁlment of
certain eligibility criteria). The management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives
of the employer and the members. The employer makes a monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme
of an amount equal to 11% of that month’s pensionable salary and the member makes monthly contributions
to the fund of an amount equal to 5% of that month’s pensionable salary. 
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member
attains normal retirement age of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is
permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the service of the employer. Upon such cessation of
contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of performing duties,
or early voluntary retirement within ﬁve years to retirement, the member is entitled to receive an immediate
annual pension equal to his accrued pension. The member is allowed to commute his/her accrued pension
subject to certain rules and regulations. The trustees of the KCM Pension Scheme may also allow purchase of
an annuity for the beneﬁt of members from a life assurance company or other providers of annuities subject to
statutory regulations. 
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the KCM
Pension Scheme is in surplus or deﬁcit. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a deﬁned
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the proﬁt and loss account. Vedanta Resources plc

(b) Deﬁned Beneﬁt Schemes
India
The Gratuity schemes are deﬁned beneﬁt schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a
minimum of ﬁve years of service with their employing company. These schemes are funded by the Group,
either through cash contributions or provisions each year, based on actuarial valuations. Under these schemes,
beneﬁts are provided based on ﬁnal pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out
on an annual basis.
KCM
Speciﬁed permanent employees of KCM are entitled to receive medical and retirement severance beneﬁt. This
comprises two months’ basic pay for every completed year of service. Under this scheme, beneﬁts are provided
based on ﬁnal pensionable pay and a full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out on an annual basis.
The accruals are not contributed to any fund and are in the form of provisions in KCM’s accounts. This scheme 
is accounted for as a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and the main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were 
a discount rate of 25% per annum and an annual salary increase of 25%. 
(c) Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies 
As at 31 March 2005, membership of pension schemes across MALCO, BALCO, HZL and KCM stood at 20,868
employees (31 March 2004: 10,735). The deﬁcits and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further
detail in notes (d) and (e) below.
MALCO
MALCO does not contribute to the LIC. Its Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a deﬁned beneﬁt basis. The
latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit actuarial method. At
that date the fund was in deﬁcit. The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of
8% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5%.
BALCO
At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2005 are covered by the LIC and
therefore their remaining contributions are accounted for on a deﬁned contribution basis. However, the scheme
is accounted for as a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2005, who are
not covered by the LIC. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2005 using the projected
unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deﬁcit. The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation
were a discount rate of 8.5% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5% for ofﬁce staff and 3% for non-
ofﬁce staff.
HZL
HZL contributes to the LIC but the policy does not cover the full deﬁcit of the Gratuity scheme. HZL’s Gratuity
scheme is therefore accounted for on a deﬁned beneﬁt basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as
at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deﬁcit. The main
assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 7.5% per annum and an annual salary
increase of 5.0%.
(d) SSAP 24 – Accounting for Pension Costs
The Group accounts for pension costs in accordance with “Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 –
Accounting for Pension Costs”.

(d) SSAP 24 – Accounting for Pension Costs continued
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions for either the deﬁned contribution or the deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes as at 31 March 2005 or 31 March 2004.
The latest full actuarial valuations of the Gratuity schemes for MALCO, BALCO and HZL as at 31 March 2005,
were carried out by R Krishnaswamy, Watson Wyatt India Pvt Ltd and Charan Gupta Consultants Pvt Ltd,
consulting actuaries to MALCO, BALCO and HZL, respectively. The actuarial valuation of the deﬁned beneﬁt
scheme for KCM was carried out by R Krishnaswamy.
The results of these valuations have been used as the basis for assessing pension costs for the year ended 
31 March 2005.
(e) FRS 17 – Retirement Beneﬁts – Transitional Disclosures 
The results for the year ended 31 March 2005 continue to include a pension charge calculated under the
principles of SSAP 24. Transitional arrangements for the adoption of FRS 17 require the disclosures set out
below. The disclosures relate to the third year of the transitional provisions. The United Kingdom Accounting
Standards Board has deferred the date for full adoption of FRS 17.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations of the
MALCO, BALCO, HZL and KCM deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. Scheme assets are stated at their market value as at
the relevant period end date.
The other pension schemes have been treated as deﬁned contribution schemes for FRS 17 disclosure purposes.
The principal ﬁnancial assumptions used to calculate the Gratuity schemes’ liabilities under FRS 17 are set out

KCM is expected to contribute a minimum of $10 million (with a maximum of $18 million) in a ﬁnancial year to
procure that the amount of ETB liabilities are covered by a cash reserve when the Konkola Ore Body life comes
to an end. ETB liabilities mean, at any time, KCM’s liabilities in relation to the environment and any terminal

32. Contingencies
The Group has the following material contingencies. With regard to the claims against Group companies
included below, unless stated, no provision has been made in the Financial Statements as the Directors believe
that it is more likely than not that the claims will not give rise to a material liability.
MALCO claims with Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (“TNEB”)
Under the terms of a ﬁnancial aid package, MALCO was entitled to beneﬁt from reduced tariff electricity for
the period from 1995 to 1999. In 1997 MALCO became proﬁtable and in 1999 the TNEB made a claim against
MALCO for the difference in value between full price and reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1997 to
1999. The value of this claim was $71.5 million. The case was heard before the Madras High Court in
November 1999 and it found in MALCO’s favour. TNEB has appealed the decision and this appeal has not yet
been heard.
TNEB is also claiming $21.4 million from MALCO for an electricity self-generation levy for the period from May
1999 to June 2003. This claim has arisen since the commissioning of MALCO’s captive power plant in 1999.
The company has sought an exemption from the application of this levy from the Government. The application
is under consideration. Meanwhile, the Madras High Court has granted an interim ruling in favour of MALCO
pending a ﬁnal decision. 
MALCO claims with TECHMO Car SpA (“TECHMO”)
In February 1999, MALCO entered into an agreement with TECHMO Car SpA to modernise the smelter pot
rooms at Mettur Dam. In February 2003, this contract was terminated by TECHMO following disputes over the
project. In March 2003, MALCO issued a claim against TECHMO to recover expenditure incurred on the project,
citing non-performance by TECHMO. The value of this claim was $5.8 million. The District Court had ordered
TECHMO to provide the full amount of the claim to MALCO as security, which was subsequently reversed by the
Madras High Court. MALCO has since ﬁled a petition with the Supreme Court of India, which as an interim
measure has directed both parties to arbitration and for each party to furnish security of $1 million.
Separately, in June 2003, TECHMO moved for arbitration, claiming a total of $2.8 million being the unpaid
portion of the contract. Arbitration proceedings under ICC rules are currently underway.
National Thermal Power Corporation (“NTPC”) dispute with BALCO
During the year ended 31 March 2005, BALCO has been in dispute with NTPC over the rates at which water
and coal are supplied to the BALCO captive power plant (which BALCO took over from NTPC). BALCO asserts
non-cooperation by NTPC, which has prevented BALCO from setting up its own coal handling and water
pipeline facilties.
Subsequent to BALCO being successful in arbitration, NTPC appealed to the High Court in Delhi where NTPC
gained an interim order raising water charges to nearly seven times the present level. After the granting of an
interim order, the High Court dismissed NTPC’s appeal, against which NTPC has ﬁled a petition with the
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court recommended that both parties should amicably settle the matter, and a
hearing is expected in June 2005. Meanwhile, negotiations are continuing with the NTPC over the rates being
charged.
The adverse impact to BALCO, if this matter is decided against the company and the revised rates charged by
NTPC are upheld, would be approximately $10.3 million per annum.
Ministry of Environment and Forest (“MOEF”) claim – VAL
In September 2004, VAL received environmental clearance from MOEF for its reﬁnery project in the State of
Orissa, after which construction work on the reﬁnery project commenced. Subsequently, claims were ﬁled with
the Central Empowered Committee (“CEC”) of the Supreme Court of India (which was constituted to look into
environmental violations) alleging that the land on which the reﬁnery was to be constructed included forestry,
and the mine which was expected to source the reﬁnery’ s future bauxite requirements, would adversely affect
the environment and therefore the construction work on the reﬁnery was in violation of MOEF guidelines.
VAL has since represented to MOEF that no forestry would be impacted by the construction of the reﬁnery. VAL
has also represented that the mining lease is owned by Orissa Mining Corporation Limited (“OMC”), a
Government of Orissa undertaking, which has applied to MOEF for the necessary clearance. VAL is therefore of
the view that the responsibility for obtaining the necessary mine clearance rests with OMC.
The MOEF has submitted an afﬁdavit to CEC that it would not decide on the application for clearance of the
mines submitted by OMC until CEC submits its report to the Supreme Court of India. VAL ﬁled a writ petition
in the Supreme Court seeking directions that MOEF decides on the forestry clearance. The Supreme Court
admitted the writ petition and has directed CEC to submit its report within eight weeks with a copy to MOEF .
The MOEF has subsequently been directed to submit its response. Vedanta Resources plc

Miscellaneous Excise Duty Disputes – Sterlite, HZL, MALCO and BALCO
The Indian excise and related indirect tax authorities have made several claims against the above companies for
additional excise and indirect duties. The claims mostly relate either to the assessable values of sales and
purchases or to incomplete documentation supporting the companies’ returns.
The approximate value of claims against the companies total $31.9 million, of which $10.5 million is included as
a provision in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2005. In the view of the Directors, there are no signiﬁcant
unprovided liabilities arising from these claims.
33. Share transactions
Call Options – KCM
The Group purchased a 51% holding in KCM on 5 November 2004, with ZCI and ZCCM holding 28.5% and
20.5% interests, respectively. There are several call options over the KCM shares held by the Group, ZCI and
ZCCM.
The Group has a call option over ZCI’s holding in KCM exercisable in certain circumstances. The option exercise
period commences on the earlier of the date of approval by the Government of Zambia of any application by
KCM to develop the Konkola Ore Body Extension Project, and the date immediately succeeding the last day of
four consecutive quarters during which ore is extracted at a rate of 3 million tpa or more, provided that prior to
such date, ZCI and ZCCM have not exercised their primary call options referred to below. In either case, the
option exercise period terminates 24 months after the date on which the call option becomes exercisable or
the date of any material amendment, cessation or abandonment of the Konkola Ore Body Extension Project
other than in accordance with the provisions of the KCM shareholders’ agreement.
ZCI and ZCCM each have a primary call option over the Group’s interest in KCM in proportion to their own
shareholdings in KCM, exercisable in certain circumstances. The option exercise periods are 24 month periods
commencing on either:
• 31 December 2009, provided that prior to such date: KCM does not proceed with the development of the
Konkola Ore Body Extension Project, the Group has not exercised its call option over the ZCI shares and
sufﬁcient evidence has not been provided to ZCCM and ZCI that the rate of ore extraction during the ﬁve
year period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 is expected to be more than 175,000 tpa (the
“Production Condition”); or
• 31 December 2014, provided that prior to 31 December 2009: sufﬁcient evidence has been provided that
the Production Condition will be met, and that otherwise the same conditions above apply.
ZCI and ZCCM each have a secondary call option that vests either: where one party conﬁrms to the other, and
the Group, that it does not wish to exercise its primary option; or where the primary option is not exercised
before the expiry of the relevant 24 month exercise period (the “End Date”). The secondary call option is
exercisable up to 15 days after the End Date and allows ZCI and ZCCM to acquire the shares held by the Group
in KCM that are subject to the primary call option.
The exercise price for all options is at a value to be agreed by the Group and ZCI or ZCCM as applicable, or
failing agreement, at fair market value determined by an independent valuer.
Call Option – HZL
With effect from 11 April 2007 , SOVL has the right to purchase all of the Government’s remaining shares in
HZL at fair market value. As at 31 March 2005, the Government’s holding in HZL was 29.5% (2004: 29.5%).
Call Option – BALCO
Sterlite purchased a 51% holding in BALCO from the Government on 2 March 2001. Under the terms of this
purchase agreement for BALCO, Sterlite has a call option that allows it to purchase any remaining Government
holding in BALCO at any point from 2 March 2004. The purchase price per share under this option would be
the higher of fair market value and INR 49.01 (plus 14% interest per annum). During the year ended 31 March
2005, the Group conﬁrmed to the Government that it wished to exercise the call option pursuant to the terms
of the purchase agreement, subject to regulatory approvals. An independent valuer was appointed by the
Government in March 2005 to determine the fair market value of the shares held by the Government, and the
valuation is currently being determined. Vedanta Resources plc

Convertible Debt – IFL
IFL has a loan of $23.3 million with ICICI Bank. ICICI has an option to convert this debt to equity shares at par
value at any time up to maturity of the loan in 2011. If this option is exercised, MALCO’s holding in IFL will
reduce from 38.8% to 8.4%.
Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds
In October 2003, Sterlite issued 50,000 1% $1,000 redeemable convertible bonds which are redeemable 
by Sterlite at a premium of $180 per bond on 27 October 2008 (note 19). Of these, 500 bonds were converted
into Sterlite’s ordinary shares during the year ended 31 March 2004 and 25,800 bonds were converted into
Sterlite’s ordinary shares during the year ended 31 March 2005. This had an effect of reducing the Group’s
Economic Interest in Sterlite from 81.3% to 79.9%.
If the remaining 23,700 bonds were converted into Sterlite ordinary shares, then the dilutive impact on the
Group`s Economic Interest would be 1.4%. The bonds became convertible on 4 December 2003 and can be
converted at any time before 27 September 2008.
34. Subsequent Events
Environment Clearance - Sterlite
On 25 April 2005, Sterlite obtained the necessary permission from the Government authorities to commence
production of copper cathode at its expansion project at Tuticorin. The expansion project will increase smelting
capacity of Sterlite from 180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa.
Commissioning of Zinc Smelter
On 31 May 2005, it was announced that the expanded smelter had been commissioned. This expansion
project will increase the Group’s reﬁned zinc capacity from 220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa.

Source of Information
The resources and reserves information for the year ended 31 March 2004 has been extracted from the Company’s
Listing Particulars adjusted for subsequent production during the year.
The information for the year ended 31 March 2005 in respect of HZL was determined by HZL management using 
in-house geologists. Subsequently it was subject to veriﬁcation by Steffen Robertson Kirsten (UK) Limited, an
international engineering consultancy company. In respect of businesses other than HZL, the information has been
certiﬁed by in-house geologists on behalf of company management.
Basis of Preparation
Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the “Australasian Code for Reporting of Identiﬁed
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves”. This code is subtitled “Report of the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and Minerals Council of Australia”,
and is commonly referred to as the “JORC Code”. The edition of the JORC Code in force as at the date of this Annual
Report is dated September 1999
+
. The JORC Code recognises a fundamental distinction between resources and reserves.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantiﬁed on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off
grade, and are divided into measured, indicated and inferred categories reﬂecting decreasing conﬁdence in geological
and/or grade continuity. No allowances are included for dilution and losses during mining, but the reporting of
resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation.
Resources may therefore be viewed as the estimation stage prior to the application of more stringent economic
criteria for reserve deﬁnition, such as a rigorously deﬁned cut-off grade and mine design outlines, along with
allowances for dilution and losses during mining.
Ore reserves, as deﬁned by the JORC Code, are designated as proved and probable, and are derived from the
corresponding measured and indicated resource estimates by including allowances for dilution and losses during mining.
It is an explicitly stated further requirement that other modifying economic, mining, metallurgical, marketing, legal,
environmental, social and governmental factors must also be taken into account.
References to resources and reserves are to total resources and reserves respectively. Total resources and reserves
means that part of the resource and reserve from a mine in which subsidiaries of the Group have an economic
interest. The Group does not wholly own certain of its subsidiaries and therefore total resources and total reserves
include resources and reserves attributable to third party interests in controlled subsidiaries.
References to production are to total production. T otal production means that part of production at mines and operations
in which subsidiaries of the Group have an economic interest. The Group does not wholly own certain of its subsidiaries
and therefore total production includes production attributable to third party interests in controlled subsidiaries.

Effective Holdings and Economic Interest
The Group’s Economic Interest in operating
companies is different from its Effective Holdings as a
consequence of the Sterlite shares owned by the
SEWT. The Effective Holdings are derived by
combining the Group’s direct and indirect
shareholdings in the operating companies. The SEWT
is treated as an ESOP trust, its shares held in Sterlite
are recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ funds, as
if the shares were cancelled. This has the effect of the
Group’s Economic Interest being higher compared to
its Effective Holdings. The Group’s Economic Interest
is the basis on which the Attributable Proﬁt and net

India  Vedanta at a Glance Delivering against our strategy
Sterlite is principally a copper smelting and refining business in
India with two small copper mines in Australia. The capacity at
Tuticorin smelter was increased in April 2005 from 180,000 tpa
to 300,000 tpa. The output is refined into copper cathode and 
rod at Tuticorin and Silvassa.
KCM is an integrated copper operation based in the heart of the
Zambian copper belt. It was acquired in November 2004, with
capacity for 250,000 tpa of finished copper.
MALCO and BALCO are integrated aluminium producers
with captive bauxite mines. MALCO, in Tamil Nadu, is the only
aluminium producer in southern India with capacity of 35,000 
tpa. The more substantial operations at BALCO, in Chhattisgarh,
are close to major supplies of bauxite and coal. Capacity at
BALCO is being expanded from 100,000 tpa to 350,000 tpa, 
with commissioning expected in March 2006. VAL, in Orissa, is 
a new project which will mine bauxite and refine alumina mainly
for the new aluminium capacity at BALCO.
HZL is India’s only integrated lead and zinc producer and one of
the lowest cost producers in the world. The main operations are
in Rajasthan, north west India. In May 2005 the facilities were
expanded to take capacity from 220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa of
finished zinc.
Vedanta listed on the London Stock
Exchange in December 2003. It is in
the FTSE 250, Metals and Mining
sector. The principal operations are
located in India, with further operations
in Zambia and Australia. Vedanta has a
unique profile of organic growth with
an investment pipeline of $2.2 billion –
expanding production in each of our
metals. Vedanta offers access to the
exceptional opportunities of India,
which combines low metal
consumption with world class but
undeveloped mineral resources. The
Group believes it has the skills and
opportunities to deliver highly cost
effective projects which will secure
Vedanta’s position as a world class,
cost competitive producer.
Optimise the performance of the existing assets
Vedanta’s plans for its Businesses will de-bottleneck plants, improve efficiency, expand output and
drive down unit costs. Major projects include a new power plant and zinc smelter at Chanderiya,
expansion of the Rampura Agucha zinc mine and the expansion of the Tuticorin copper smelter. 
Both of our new projects are now complete. In April 2005, a new copper smelter was
commissioned at Tuticorin increasing capacity from 180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa. In May 2005, 
the new power plant and zinc facilities at Chanderiya were commissioned, taking capacity from 
220,000 tpa to 390,000 tpa.

Finance greenfield growth
Two large greenfield projects, the 250,000 tpa GAMI-based aluminium smelter at the Korba
complex and the proposed 1.0 million tpa alumina refinery in Orissa, offer attractive economics
and future growth. 
The project at Korba is on track for commissioning in March 2006. The alumina for this expansion
will come from the new bauxite mine and refinery now under construction at Orissa. Funding is
fully in place for all projects.
Consolidate the Group structure
Vedanta will seek to increase its direct ownership in the underlying Businesses. 
The Group has made significant progress increasing and raising our share of profits from 46% in the
prior year to 52% in the second half of the year. An option over the Government’ s 49% holding in
BALCO is currently in progress. There is an option over the Government’ s 30% holding in HZL
exercisable in 2007 and the potential to take ownership in KCM from 51% to 80%. Opportunities
to consolidate the Group structure will continue to be pursued, where they add value.
Leverage established skills 
Vedanta will seek further growth opportunities in India, including the Government’s privatisation
programmes and also outside its traditional Indian base, in operations where its proven
transactional, operating and turnaround skills can provide a competitive advantage. 
The KCM operation in Zambia was acquired during the year, and expansion and improvement of
this operation is anticipated using the experience developed at our existing operations. We will
take advantage of further opportunities as they arise.

Ensuring that good governance  
is achieved throughout G4S is  
vital for the delivery of long term 
sustainable value for shareholders 
and for all the group’s stakeholders.
This is an integrated report, 
combining our annual report and 
accounts with our core corporate 
social responsibility approach. This 
reflects the fact that our corporate 
values influence every aspect of our 
culture and day-to-day business 
activity and recognises that 
sustainability strategies are best 
achieved when integrated into 
business practices.
The strategic report is set out within

Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 1
Strategic report The secure solutions business covers a wide range of services, including:
Risk services and consultancy
Monitoring and response 
Secure facilities management services 
Manned and mobile security services
Security and facilities management 
(FM) services is by far the largest 
business segment in G4S, representing 
58% of group revenues. The 84 
markets in which we provide these 
services are usually highly fragmented. 
Our competitors are typically smaller 
local and regional companies, although 
we do compete with international 
companies in some countries and  
in some markets we compete with 
facilities management companies. 
Competition is intense in manned 
security and FM and customers  
can be extremely price sensitive.
We position G4S as a high quality, 
global security service provider  
with the skills, expertise and market 
coverage to offer our customers 
integrated, cost effective and 
innovative security solutions  
that protect or add value to  
their organisations. 
Security systems and technology 
represented around 8% of group 
revenue in 2015.
The global security systems market 
is a large and growing market, but 
regional markets vary widely in 
terms of competition, products  
and services sold and customer 
segments. Our technology strategy 
seeks to market core products  
and services that are increasingly 
developed globally and configured 
locally to meet each region’s  
unique requirements. 
In our security systems service line 
we compete against fire and alarm 
system manufacturers, installers  
and security systems integrators.
We promote outsourcing and 
enhance the value of traditional 
security services through greater  
use of technology (see page 23).

G4S AT A 
GLANCE
We differentiate the G4S brand  
by investing in service innovation, 
employee selection, training, 
supervision, service delivery and 
customer service and relationship 
management. 
Our manned security customer  
base is a valuable intangible asset. 
We have historically had little 
cross-selling in our secure solutions 
business segment and an important 
long-term element of our strategy  
is to offer our broad range of 
services on a stand-alone basis or  
in conjunction with other services  
to provide customers with an 
integrated and more valuable 
security solution – see the case 
study and chart on pages 30 and  
31. This offers the opportunity to 
increase customer longevity and 
grow our margins. We have begun 
to improve our cross-selling in the 
USA, UK, Middle East and Europe 
and will continue to focus on this  
in 2016 and into the future.
* Includes 44,000 employees in businesses to be sold or exited.

Securing your world The cash solutions business covers  
a wide range of services including: 
Cash management outsourcing
Cash consulting
ATM management
Retail cash management (CASH360™) / Retail Solutions
International transportation 
Based mainly in the UK, G4S offers  
a range of outsourcing services, which 
together accounted for around 11%  
of group revenues in 2015. These 
services include back office support 
and custody suites to UK police forces 
and utility services (data collection  
and smart meter programmes). 
We also manage welfare to work 
programmes in the UK and to date 
have helped 58,000 people find 
employment. These are specialist 
services and there tend to be just a 
small number of private companies 
providing similar services in the UK. 
We aim to offer innovative  
and cost-effective solutions to 
customers, leveraging our scale  
and expertise.
Care and justice services 
represented around 9% of group 
revenue in 2015. The market 
structure is typically consolidated on 
the supply side with a small number 
of providers. Larger companies are 
usually better equipped to deliver 
such highly specialised services. G4S 
will only offer custody and detention 
services where we can maintain  
a qualified talent pool and where 
the political, legal, human rights and 
regulatory framework is consistent 
with our group values and results in 
acceptable operational, commercial 
and reputational risk.
G4S’s larger scale care and justice 
services are concentrated primarily  
in the UK and Australia, and on  
a smaller scale in a number of 
European markets. For more  
detail see page 34.

The cash solutions business accounted for around  
14% of group revenue in 2015. We are the market 
leader or number two in 43 of our 48 cash solutions 
markets. The main providers of similar services are  
a small number of international competitors in mainly 
developed markets. Wherever possible our cash 
solutions business shares facilities and back office 
processes with our secure solutions businesses. The 
market is highly regulated, often by central banks,  
and the business requires complex infrastructure and 
significant expertise. Our strategy assumes that digital 
payment technology will continue to grow in developed 
markets and gain traction in emerging markets in the 
medium term. For more information see page 32.
We aim to:
• position G4S as a reliable, innovative low cost 
operator that helps our customers to reduce  
their cash handling costs and increase the ease  
of use of cash for their customers
• play a key role in the management of the cash cycle 
on behalf of central banks, commercial banks and 
retailers, allowing them to focus on their core business
• use our developed market cash cycle expertise and 
track record to encourage central bank and financial 
institution outsourcing in emerging markets
• continue the expansion of innovative technology  
such as CASH360™/ Retail Solutions for retail 
customers (see page 32).

Strategic report The year under review
2015 has brought both good 
progress as well as new challenges.  
It has been pleasing to see that the 
strategy which the new management 
team developed towards the end  
of 2013 and began to implement  
in 2014 has been progressing well  
over the last 12 months, with solid 
growth and improved productivity. 
The strong focus on investing in 
resources where they can be most 
productive is clearly reflected in  
the progress with the portfolio 
rationalisation and better processes 
to ensure the returns and risks 
associated with prospective 
investments and contracts are well 
understood. Our chief executive, 
Ashley Almanza, comments on  
all these matters in further detail 
elsewhere in this report.
The corporate renewal process 
agreed with the UK Government, on 
which I commented in my statement 
last year, has been implemented and 
much has been done to reinforce 
the values that underpin the 
performance of the essential 
services which the group provides. 
“ 2015 has brought both good progress as well as 
new challenges. It has been pleasing to see that 
the strategy which the new management team 
developed towards the end of 2013 and began 
to implement in 2014 has been progressing still 
further over the last 12 months, with solid 
growth and improved productivity.”
GOOD PROGRESS  
IN CHALLENGING 
MARKETS
John Connolly
Chairman
Our colleagues work in challenging 
environments and deliver complex 
services, often in the public eye. We 
have high expectations of them to 
do their very best for our customers 
and to conduct themselves in a way 
which is in line with the group’s 
values and standards. Regretfully, 
there are some occasions when  
our standards have not been met.  
In those cases, the board is satisfied 
that management has taken prompt 
action to adapt our processes and 
our oversight mechanisms. Further 
information about how we have 
addressed some of these issues  
is available in our CSR Report. 
Sadly, 46 of our colleagues lost  
their lives in the course of their 
duties in 2015. The board will 
continue to support fully the 
strenuous efforts which are being 
made around the group to ensure 
that all our employees enjoy the 
safest possible working environment.
The board has welcomed the 
further progress in developing  
the management structure for  
the group’s businesses around  
the world and in recruiting high 
quality and experienced people  
to run these businesses.

Chairman’s Statement The macro-economic environment 
remains difficult and in some parts 
of the world has become more 
challenging. I am heartened though 
to see real progress in all the important 
strands of the group’s strategy and 
across the very considerable range 
of the businesses that make up  
the group.
The board
The board has undergone further 
change during the year and it is 
important that we continue to refresh 
the board’s capabilities, expertise 
and experience so that it can support 
and challenge management in the 
most effective way.
As announced previously, Grahame 
Gibson stood down from the board 
in June 2015. He made a great 
contribution to the group throughout 
his career and the board wishes him 
well in his retirement.
As also announced previously, Mark 
Seligman, a non-executive director, 
also stood down from the board, 
having served for nine years since he 
was first elected. Mark had handed 
over his role as chairman of the 
Audit Committee to Tim Weller 
prior to his departure and so Tim 
has overseen the change to our new 
external auditor, PwC, who were 
appointed during the year following 
shareholder approval. Again, I would 
like to record the board’s gratitude 
to Mark for his very valuable 
contribution to the board.
John Daly was appointed to the 
board in June 2015 and serves on 
both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. John has great experience 
in many of the markets in which the 
group operates; having held senior 
executive positions in Europe, the 
Middle East and Asia over some  
20 years.
Mark Elliott is our Senior Independent 
Director, Remuneration Committee 
chairman and is a member of our 
Nomination Committee. He has 
also been a director now since 2006 
and so will be retiring from the 
board this year since his length of 
service means that he will no longer 
be considered independent under 
UK corporate governance guidelines. 
In addition, Adam Crozier has decided 
not to seek re-election to the board 
this year. 
Since Mark’s and Adam’s departures 
leave a number of roles to fill, and 
because the Nomination Committee 
would like to broaden further the 
range of expertise available to the 
board, an exercise has begun to 
recruit two new non-executive 
directors. We have also announced 
that John Daly will take on the  
role of Remuneration Committee 
chairman following Mark Elliott’s 
retirement from the board.
I would like to thank Mark and Adam 
for their outstanding service to the 
board throughout their time with 
the company and I would particularly 
like to thank Mark for the support he 
has given me throughout my time  
as chairman.
I believe the current planned 
changes will result in a board  
with a broad spectrum of skills  
and a diversity of experience and 
background which reflects the wide 
range of geographies and cultures 
which makes up this group.
Financial performance
The progress made in 2015 was 
reflected in the group’s underlying 
financial performance.
Revenue growth was 4% overall,  
and that growth, combined with  
the success of restructuring and 
efficiency programmes, saw underlying 
operating profit increase by 5.7% and 
underlying earnings increase by 14%. 
Management has continued to tackle 
a number of legacy issues effectively, 
including onerous contracts in the 
UK and accounting issues in certain 
businesses. The effect of these legacy 
issues is reflected in the onerous 
contract provisions and the prior 
year restatement of certain items.  
This is covered in more detail in the 
CFO’s review on pages 96 to 105. 
The board has confidence in the 
group’s performance and prospects 
and the directors propose a final 
dividend of 5.82p (DKK 0.5615)  
per share, payable on 10 June 2016.
With an interim dividend of 3.59p 
(DKK 0.3793) per share paid on  
16 October 2015, the total dividend  
for the year will amount to 9.41p 
per share (2014: 9.24p per share), 
an increase of 1.8%.
Our people
The progress which has been 
achieved over the last year came 
about as a result of the efforts  
of the group’s management and 
employees. They provide vital 
services for the group’s customers 
in what can sometimes be challenging 
circumstances and I would like to 
express my thanks for their continuing 
hard work and dedication.

Strategic report Strategy – transforming G4S
In November 2013 we set out  
our strategy to transform G4S  
and build a business capable of 
delivering sustainable, profitable 
growth. During 2015 we made 
substantial progress implementing 
this strategy and the G4S group 
now has three distinct components:
• Businesses sold or to be sold  
or closed under the portfolio 
programme;
• Legacy contracts to be managed 
to an effective conclusion; and
• Continuing businesses, which  
are making tangible strategic, 
operational and financial progress 
as we implement G4S’s strategy. 
The first two components do not 
form part of the long-term future  
of G4S, whereas the continuing 
businesses form the core of G4S 
today and in the future. Each of 
these components of the group  
is described in further detail below.
Businesses sold or to be sold 
or closed – portfolio programme
In November 2013 we announced 
the start of a portfolio review 
programme, the aim of which  
“ During 2015 we made substantial 
progress with the strategic and 
operational transformation of  
G4S. Our portfolio management 
programme combined with our 
investment in sales, innovation and  
re-structuring is reflected in the 
results of our underlying operations 
where the group’s revenues rose  
by 4% and earnings rose by 14%.”
SECURING 
YOUR WORLD
Ashley Almanza
Group Chief Executive Officer
was to improve the strategic focus  
and performance of the group. 
Since 2013, we have sold or are 
exiting 61 businesses, with aggregate 
revenues of around £1.2 billion and 
pre-tax losses of £30 million. We 
have completed the sale or closure 
of 23 businesses and raised £281 
million in disposal proceeds. Since 
31 December 2015 we have 
identified a further four businesses  
to be sold, with aggregate revenues 
of around £400 million.
The implementation of our portfolio 
programme is fundamentally changing 
the shape of G4S, improving the 
strategic, commercial and operational 
focus and strengthening the financial 
position and performance of our 
continuing businesses.
Legacy contracts
Between 2005 and 2012, G4S 
entered into a number of multi-year 
contracts which contained obligations, 
terms and conditions that make 
these contracts inherently unprofitable 
for G4S. Virtually all of these relate 
to UK public service contracts. In 
addition, we have invested substantial 
time, resource and capital in the 
corporate renewal programme

Chief Executive’s review which we agreed with the  
UK Government following the 
overbilling for services under the  
UK Electronic Monitoring contract.
Since 2013 we have set aside 
around £250 million to cover the 
cost of legacy contracts, including 
the UK Electronic Monitoring 
contract, of which around £150 
million has been paid to date. We 
have also identified a contingent 
liability of £57 million relating to the 
UK Compass contract, should the 
contract be extended to August 2019.
Managing these contracts to an 
effective and efficient conclusion 
remains an important element of 
our business plan. Over the next 
two to four years we expect this to 
become significantly less important 
as these contracts come to an end. 
In the meantime we have materially 
strengthened controls over the 
approval of major contracts to 
prevent such contracts from  
being signed in future.
Continuing businesses
We continue to make substantial 
investments in these businesses and 
in 2015 we saw these investments 
producing tangible strategic, 
operational and financial benefits.  
It is important to recognise that we 
have much further to go to realise 
the full potential of our strategy.
Our investment in continuing 
businesses is focused on a number 
of key strategic priorities which  
are described below and set out  
in more detail on pages 16 to 35:
• Investing in people and values
• Investing in growth and innovation
• Investing in customer relationships 
and service excellence
• Investing in operational excellence 
financial discipline
Effective 1 January 2016, we created 
two new regions – Asia Pacific and 
Middle East & India (replacing Asia 
Middle East) which brings additional 
executive resource and focus to 
these important markets. T o lead 
these regions we made two new 
appointments to the group executive 
team: Claude Allain joined our 
executive team in January 2016  
and took up the position of Regional 
President for the Middle East and 
India region, based in Dubai. Claude 
has a strong and proven track  
record working in global service  
and technology businesses (see 
biographical details on page 58).  
Jon Corner was appointed as 
Regional President for Asia Pacific, 
based in Hong Kong. Jon was 
formerly Commercial Director,  
Asia Middle East and has extensive 
business experience in the Asia 
Pacific region (see biographical  
details on page 58).
People and values: Our people and 
values are critical to the successful 
execution of our strategy. We are 
strengthening our organisation by 
investing in talent via recruitment, 
internal development, promotion 
and training. 
In 2015 we undertook a global 
employee survey and were 
delighted that 449,000 colleagues 
took the opportunity to provide  
us with their feedback on working 
for G4S. Around 80% of participating 
employees provided favourable 
scores, confirming that they would 
recommend G4S as an employer. 
Whilst these are comparatively 
good results, we have no room  
for complacency and the survey 
provides us with invaluable 
information which we can use to 
actively engage with our colleagues 
across the group. I am grateful to 
each and every colleague who 
contributed to this important  
work in 2015.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 7
Strategic report In 2015, we welcomed Jenni Myles  
to the group executive team as 
group HR Director (biographical 
details page 59). Mel Brooks, already 
a member of the executive team, 
was appointed as Regional President 
for Africa. 
At the end of 2015, Jesus Rosano 
moved from his role as COO of  
our Latin America region, to join  
the group executive committee  
in the role of Group Commercial  
& Strategy Director.
We have a stronger senior leadership 
team in place across the group and 
we are better placed to achieve our 
strategic goals in the coming years. 
At the start of 2016 we launched 
our new group values. These values 
are the standards we set for ourselves 
and through our behaviours and 
actions, we are working to embed 
them in the culture of our organisation. 
These values help us to retain and 
attract employees and to meet and 
exceed our customers’ expectations. 
They are vital to the long term 
success of G4S and are described  
in further detail on page 19.
We re-launched our ‘Speak Out’ 
service for employees to raise any 
concerns they have about conduct 
which is inconsistent with our values. 
Recent events at our UK Medway 
facility underline the importance  
of this on-going programme.
Growth and Innovation: Against  
a backdrop of macro-economic 
volatility and challenging trading 
conditions in some of our markets, 
demand for our services remained 
resilient and we won new contracts 
with an annual value of over £1.3 
billion and total contract value of 
£2.4 billion. At the same time, we 
replenished our pipeline which now 
has an annual value of £5.7 billion.
We sustained average contract 
retention rates of around 90%, 
although lower volumes drawn 
under contracts in some markets 
have partially offset the positive 
impact of new contracts. In the 
current economic environment we 
expect demand for our services to 
grow by around 4-6% per annum 
over the medium term.
We continued to invest in product 
and service innovation and made 
substantial progress with services 
such as Symmetry (access control 
system), Symmetry-Connect (visitor 
management), CASH360™ and 
Deposita (cash management).  
New services in these areas of  
our business are gaining commercial 
traction in the marketplace, both as 
stand-alone and integrated offerings 
and we are excited about the 
potential to grow these services 
over the coming years.
Customer relationships and service 
excellence: During 2015 we 
continued to invest in progressively 
embedding a rigorous approach  
to sales operations, strategic account 
management and customer service 
management. We use a standard 
sales management tool, Salesforce, 
across the group and this has improved 
the visibility and management of our 
sales pipeline. We have also adopted 
a Net Promoter Score model to 
measure and respond to customer 
satisfaction scores. Alongside these 
measures we continue to invest in 
strategic account managers to ensure 
that we anticipate and serve our 
customers’ needs.
Operational excellence: We 
continued to invest in improving our 
efficiency through the execution of 
our restructuring and productivity 
programmes and the positive effects 
of this are reflected in the group’s 
commercial, operational and financial 
performance for 2015. We expect  
to extract further benefits in 2016.
Health & Safety: The safety and 
wellbeing of our employees and 
those in our care is a key priority  
for the group executive team and 
the global leadership team. Our goal 
is zero harm and to achieve that we 
are striving to ensure that each and 
every employee at G4S understands 
and complies with safe and secure 
working practices. We work in an 
inherently hazardous industry: many 
of our colleagues travel extensively 
and many are trained to protect  
our customers and their property. 
As a result, road traffic accidents  
and criminal attacks are inherent 
risks we face in delivering some  
of our services. We have therefore 
invested in considerable improvements 
to our health and safety policies, 
practices, training and resources 
across the group. Whilst we have 
made progress in these areas, we 
remain dissatisfied with safety 
performance in some parts of the 
company and I regret to report that 
46 colleagues lost their lives in the 
line of duty in 2015. We pay tribute 
to the courage and service of 
colleagues who lost their lives  
and we remain whole-heartedly 
committed to our goal of zero harm.
Financial discipline: We have 
strengthened capital investment 
processes and we are applying 
capital with greater consistency  
and rigour.
Our working capital processes are 
improving, but this remains an area 
where much greater consistency  
and discipline is required. Our 
management of this area fell short 
of our standards in the final quarter 
of 2015 and this is a key priority for 
our finance and line management 
teams in 2016. T o that end we have 
increased the weighting of operating 
cash flow in our annual incentive plans.
Underlying performance
Revenue growth was positive in  
all regions apart from the UK, where 
our revenues fell by 3% reflecting 
the loss of a cash services contract 
in the retail sector and the UK 
Electronic Monitoring contract in 
2014. Compared with 2014, our 
revenues grew by 8.6% in emerging 
8 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s Review continued Watch the CEO Review online 
at: www.g4s.com/investors
markets and by 5.8% in North 
America, whilst our business in 
Europe returned to growth with a 
2.6% increase in revenues. Overall 
group revenues increased by 4%.
Underlying PBITA (profit before 
interest, tax and amortisation) of 
£427 million was 5.7% higher than 
2014, which reflects revenue growth, 
operational gearing, and the benefits 
of our restructuring and productivity 
programmes. Underlying earnings 
and EPS increased 14% to £227 
million and 14.7p respectively.
Cash flow from operating businesses 
was £460 million, down by 13% on 
last year mainly due to a £69 million 
increase in working capital in 2015, 
related to revenue growth and the 
transition to a shared service centre, 
which reversed in the first two 
months of 2016.
Although the group made good 
progress on an underlying basis, our 
statutory earnings of £8 million were 
adversely impacted by a number of 
significant factors described below:
Onerous contracts: as described 
above, the group continued to incur 
significant costs in relation to legacy 
contracts and we provided a further 
£65 million, principally in relation  
to the Compass contract with the 
UK Government (asylum seeker 
accommodation) and a UK PFI 
contract (NHS). 
Goodwill impairment: a net  
charge of £66 million in relation to 
businesses acquired prior to 2013 
and businesses expected to be sold 
or closed.
Exchange rates: the sterling value of 
emerging market revenues (around 
one-third of group revenues) was 
adversely affected by the sharp falls 
in many emerging market currencies 
and this reduced our statutory PBITA.
During the year, we continued to 
invest in restructuring programmes 
which improved the competitiveness 
of some of our key businesses by 
reducing their cost structures. These 
programmes have payback periods 
of 12-36 months and deliver attractive 
double-digit returns. The cost of 
these programmes (2015: £44 
million (2014: £29 million)) is 
excluded from underlying results.
The board is recommending that the 
final dividend is maintained at 5.82p 
per share (DKK 0.5615), bringing the 
total dividend for the full year to 
9.41p per share, a 1.8% increase.
Outlook: Against a backdrop  
of global economic uncertainty, 
demand for our services remained 
resilient and growth accelerated in 
the second half of 2015, providing 
good support for further operating 
and financial progress in 2016. In the 
current economic environment we 
expect medium term demand for 
our services to grow by around 
4-6% per annum.
Finally, I would like to thank all of  
our colleagues across the world 
whose expertise and dedication to 
our customers and our group is 
reflected in the substantial progress 
made by G4S in 2015.

POSITIVE, LONG-TERM  
DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES
With our global footprint, we have  
a strong understanding of security 
market trends. The security outlook 
around the world is generally 
becoming more challenging, creating 
positive demand for our core 
services around the world. The 
increasingly challenging economic 
outlook in emerging markets presents 
both opportunities and challenges 
for the group. See page 14 for a 
more detailed discussion of some  
of the market growth drivers.
VALUES
The group values underpin what  
we do and are discussed in more 
detail on page 19. In addition,  
we work in line with relevant 
international standards and strive  
to achieve consistent high quality 
engagement, health and safety 
performance and ethical business 
practices across all our operations.
BRAND AND HERITAGE
We believe that the G4S 
brand and our heritage  
as a security company for 
over 100 years is a strong 
differentiator with 
customers.
DELIVERING 
SUSTAINABLE VALUE Our strategy addresses 
the positive long-term 
demand for our services 
and our strategic 
priorities are the safety 
and security of our 
customers and our 
people, sustainable 
growth, productivity  
and disciplined financial 
management. Our 
business model is how 
we execute that strategy 
through providing a 
broad range of security 
products and services 
(as outlined on pages  
2 and 3) and through 
our six regions

A key part of our business model is 
to grow revenues through leveraging 
the opportunity to design, sell and 
deliver more sophisticated, complex 
solutions in more countries to our 
existing customer base and to new 
customers. Such services tend to 
have longer contract terms and higher 
margins than manned security alone.
SERVICE EXCELLENCE
Excellent customer service is one  
of our core values and for the last 
three years we have been investing 
in capability, processes and 
performance measures to drive 
growth, customer retention and 
customer satisfaction – critical 
INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE
We invest in selection, training, 
support and development of our 
people. We have invested in new 
leadership, operations and sales 
training programmes and ensured 
we have the right recognition, 
incentives and rewards for 
performance (see page 36).
INVESTING IN CUSTOMER 
RELATIONSHIPS
Understanding customer needs  
is central to our success. This 
enables us to align our organisational 
objectives to those of our customers 
and means we can help our 
customers to be successful. See 
pages 2 and 3 for an overview  
of our service lines.  
We build customer understanding 
through dedicated sector experts, 
involvement in industry bodies and 
academic institutions, strategic work 
with customers, customer service 
assessments and feedback. We have 
a broad-based contract portfolio  
and our contract review process  
is detailed on page 48. 
FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE
We have a disciplined financial 
framework, operating a group wide 
contract approval process and capital 
rationing to ensure that we invest  
in those opportunities with the best 
risk/return ratios. We have focussed 
working capital management and  
an active portfolio management 
programme (see pages 27 to 29).

Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 13
Strategic report Market growth drivers
GROWING 
DEMAND
The world is facing a series of  
new and diverse threats to which 
national governments, multilateral 
organisations and multinational 
companies will be required to 
respond. The uncertainty and 
instability created by those threats 
will challenge the security services 
industry to develop innovative and 
forward-thinking solutions in order 
to help its customers to mitigate  
the risks that are emerging.
What are these threats and 
how must G4S position itself  
to be of assistance to its 
multinational portfolio of 
customers around the world?
International terrorism
A new era in international terrorism 
began in 2001 with the attack on 
the World Trade Centre. The security 
industry has played its part in 
responding to this threat, adapting  
to the needs of governments  
and multilateral organisations  
in the conflict zones of Iraq and 
Afghanistan. In 2015, the armed 
conflict in Iraq and Syria has 
undermined the stability of borders 
and the integrity of nation states in 
the Middle East and North Africa. 
We have seen a new wave of 
international terrorism, requiring  
not just protective security, but 
heightened intelligence and analysis 
services such as those being 
developed by G4S (for more 
information see pages 30 and 31).
Mass migration
The wars in the Middle East have 
resulted in a massive wave of 
irregular migration as hundreds of 
thousands of people seek sanctuary. 
The receiving countries require 
far-reaching measures to secure 
their borders and manage migration. 
The maritime and ports sector in 
particular is being impacted by mass 
migration and governments require 
support in the management of 
migrants and refugees. The attention 
of the world is also focused on  
a number of other areas where 
borders are disputed, or where 
there is international tension or 
armed conflict. G4S is in a position  
to support its government and 
corporate clients as they navigate 
these difficult geopolitical waters. 
Economic stability
Besides geopolitical and strategic 
concerns, the global economy  
is subject to ever increasing 
interdependency between nations. 
Market volatility and economic 
instability is having far reaching 
consequences on national 
economies, with the potential  
for security implications in some 
countries, whilst strong economic 
growth provides opportunities  
in other markets such as India.  
As a strategic and trusted partner  
to its customers, G4S supports 
corporate customers with the  
full range of security solutions from 
traditional physical security through 
to risk assessment and enhanced 
intelligence solutions such as  
Risk 360 and GIS (see page 31). 
Pandemic disease
The threat posed by pandemic 
disease is global, and international 
travel exacerbates the risk. The 
impacts of pandemics are even 
worse in countries that are affected 
by poverty. High rates of uncontrolled 
mass migration could potentially 
bring a heightened risk of the spread 
of disease, requiring a renewed 
focus on border controls and health. 
Economic migrants within countries 
are also moving increasingly to cities 
in a growing phenomenon seen 
around the world, particularly  
in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
Governments and multinational 
corporations will be pressured to 
respond to the challenges posed  
by these social trends and they  
will require novel approaches from  
the security services industry. G4S 
already works with communities, 
supporting livelihoods and 
development, and as risks intensify 
this will need to increase. G4S 
understands the importance of 
Corporate Social Responsibility, 
respect for human rights and  
the promotion of local prosperity  
in today’s interconnected world  
for global stability, security and  
the success of customers. 
Early warning – Indonesia
In Indonesia we have begun 
work with a large forestry 
company to protect against 
squatting, illegal logging and 
forest fires. Our initial offering 
consisted of manned security 
which has since grown 
significantly following our 
success in working with the 
local villagers. Forest fires in 
Borneo were a global news 
story in 2015. We are currently 
working on a pilot with cameras 
which will provide early warning 
of fires, enabling crews to provide 
early containment of the fire 
and reduce the smog which 
created poor air quality 
throughout south east Asia.

Cyber crime
Finally, as governments and 
corporations become ever more 
reliant upon technology and the 
digital world, they are increasingly 
exposed to the threat posed by 
cybercrime. Cyber security is an 
essential feature of a company’s 
resilience and it is required in  
all aspects of operations. It is 
estimated that 60% of cyber 
security breaches relate to the 
company itself – current and 
former employees, current and 
former service providers and 
customers. G4S has expertise  
in delivering solutions in complex 
business environments and we 
focus on delivering a holistic 
security solution together with 
software partners across the cyber 
service spectrum, from physical  
to technological.
More than ever, governments and 
corporations will seek the support 
of companies such as G4S that  
can help them meet the challenges 
posed by these risks.

Climate change
There is now broad recognition  
that climate change is impacting the 
natural environment and that nations 
and people around the world could 
face severe consequences. Nations 
are responding to the threat of rising 
sea levels with contingency plans and 
resilience measures. The populations 
of less developed countries will suffer 
the results of climate change worst, 
and many will suffer earliest. Crop 
cycles are changing as climatic 
conditions change, displacing the 
communities that rely on their yields 
or forcing them to develop other 
crops, and possible subjecting them 
to poverty. Food security in fragile 
economies will be impacted by these 
agricultural changes and this could 
lead to conflict for resources, 
particularly water. The supply chains 
of multinational corporations whose 
operations are dependent upon 
crops and agricultural produce will  
be adversely affected. This is not  
just a future threat: it is apparent  
in the world today. Governments  
and multinational corporations will  
be required to secure their food 
resources and supply chains, requiring 
innovative security solutions by 
companies such as G4S.

Dynamic Risk  
Assessment – UK
Dynamic risk assessment is a 
tool we are developing to ensure 
that we are on the front foot in 
a changing risk environment. 
We engage with customers  
to initially risk assess their 
facilities and from that, agree 
and implement a security 
solution that best meets their 
business needs. We then deploy 
the Dynamic Risk Assessment 
tool which takes real time 
information from internal (e.g. 
incident reports) and external 
(e.g. crime statistics) sources 
and assesses on an ongoing 
basis if there is a change in the 
risk rating for the facility, and 
takes mitigating actions against 
the emerging risk immediately 
within parameters pre-agreed 
with customers.

Strategic report OUR VALUES AND 
INVESTING IN PEOPLE 
Health and safety
The safety of our employees and 
those in our care is a key priority  
for the group. We have made 
improvements to our health and 
safety across the business, with a 
particular focus on management 
accountability as well as accident 
prevention and best practice  
sharing including:
• Undertook health and safety 
leadership training with  
1,000 managers 
• Developed and launched  
a new road safety policy
• Completed six health and safety 
critical country reviews in countries 
where serious incidents occurred
It has been a challenging year and 
whilst the added focus on health  
and safety has led to a reduction  
in the number of fatal accidents and 
attacks in some regions during 2015, 
46 of our colleagues lost their lives 
during 2015 (41 in 2014) which  
is unacceptable. 
We will continue to invest in safety 
awareness and training as part of an 
on-going programme to evolve the 
safety culture of the company and 
achieve our aim of zero fatalities. 
Our approach on health and safety 
will focus directly on the actions of 
staff on the front line – resources 
will be re-aligned to the areas where 
they can have the most impact – 
reviewing health and safety practices 
at our offices, branches and customer 
sites and taking remedial action to 
address every-day breaches of our 
health and safety guidelines.
Employee engagement
During 2015, we conducted our 
fourth global employee engagement 
survey to help us assess whether we 
are delivering our commitments to 
our employees and maximising their 
levels of engagement. The survey, 
which we believe is the largest of  
its kind globally, was completed by 
449,000 employees world-wide.  
This response equates to almost 
three quarters of our workforce 
and represents an 11% increase  
on the last survey in 2013. The 
questions were based on our 
employee engagement model  
called PRIDE, which sets out how 
we will Protect, Respect, Involve, 
Develop and Engage our people.  
As this was the fourth global 
engagement survey, the results 
tracked improvements over time 
and also provided feedback from 
employees to new questions on  
the group’s values. Overall the 
feedback was extremely positive  
and all questions had a favourable 
response rate in excess of 75%. 
Further details on this and an 
additional senior management survey 
can be found in the CSR report.
Both the employee and senior 
management surveys included 
questions on the group’s values  
to establish whether these are fully 
understood and, whether they help 
shape employees’ behaviour at work. 
From senior managers there was 
positive feedback about the 
introduction of a health and safety 
value in 2014 and in the wider 
employee engagement survey it  
was encouraging to see 90% of 
respondents confirming they know 
how to behave in accordance  
with the group’s values.
Our people and the group values underpin our 
strategic priorities. We need highly motivated and 
engaged employees who believe in the company, 
follow the group values and do their best to provide 
our customers with great service every day.

PEOPLE
& VALUES
18 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015
Our strategy continued Our values
Our values are the standards we set 
for ourselves and they are reflected 
in the culture of our organisation 
through our behaviours and actions. 
They help us to attract and retain 
employees, to win and keep important 
customers and to obtain appropriate 
long-term investment in the group 
– all of which contribute to achieving 
our goal of achieving sustainable 
profitable growth.
Talent and succession
Building a pipeline of talented future 
leaders remains a strategic focus for 
the business. As well as sourcing new 
talent externally to bring fresh ideas 
and expertise, we also strive to 
promote from within and develop 
the knowledge and capabilities of 
existing managers so that we retain 
our competitive advantage in the 
marketplace. In 2015, a new regional 
leadership programme was launched 
across three of the six regions.  
We are refreshing our induction 
programmes for 2016 so that new 
managers have a comprehensive 
introduction to the business, our 
values and the behaviours expected 
of them. 
Reward and recognition
Our compensation and benefit 
strategy aims to ensure terms  
and conditions compare favourably  
with others in the sector so that  
we can attract and retain high calibre 
employees. In some countries pay 
rates are mandated by legislation 
and where they are not, but we 
have collective agreements in place, 
we will agree appropriate rates 
following agreement with trade 
union or employee representatives.
Training and development
Having employees who are well 
trained and know how to respond 
in a wide range of situations is a 
core human resources standard  
and a key customer requirement, so  
it was reassuring to see that in the 
employee engagement survey, 85% 
of our employees who responded 
indicated that they had been well 
trained to do their job. 
Offering career progression is 
equally important to our employees 
and the extent to which the company 
does this was also rated positively  
in the global employee engagement 
survey (increasing from a favourable 
score of 78% to 80%).
Providing development opportunities 
means employees can realise their 
potential and our customers gain 
from an increasingly experienced 
and stable workforce. 
Diversity and inclusion
We encourage our businesses  
to reach out to the widest talent 
pools and to ensure that any 
succession pipelines they develop 
are reflective of the diverse talent 
required to run a global and 
culturally complex organisation. 
For a long time we have recognised 
our continuing success will be 
impacted by our ability to harness  
the great diversity of ideas and 
experience that exists in the business. 
T o do this, we need to foster an 
inclusive working environment where 
employees’ views are welcomed  
and where different perspectives  
are seen as vital in shaping  
the organisation.
Our on-line cultural training tool, 
available to all employees world-
wide, is helping to build greater 
cultural understanding and make 
working in diverse teams easier. 
Developing a global mindset is a 
core leadership competence so the 
tool is utilised in the new regional 
leadership programme launched in 
2015 to help participants explore 
and understand the impact of 
cultural differences at work.
Our efforts at building an inclusive 
workplace appear to be recognised 
by our employees who responded 
positively to the question about 
diversity in the employee engagement 
survey completed in 2015. Over 
80% of the 449,000 respondents 
indicated they believe the company 
respects and values people from 
different backgrounds.

Strategic report In 2016 we will continue our 
commitment to building an inclusive 
workplace focusing on improving 
our gender balance and on supporting 
people who have complex barriers 
impacting their ability to secure work.
Labour relations and freedom 
of association
With over 30% of our employees 
covered by collective bargaining 
agreements, some of which have 
been in place for decades, we have 
experience at building trusting  
and constructive union relations  
to jointly improve the working 
conditions of our employees and 
seek to drive up standards across 
the industry where we can.
The Ethical Employment Partnership 
(EEP) agreement which was signed 
with the GMB union and global 
union UNI in 2008, continues to 
safeguard industrial relations stability. 
The agreement helps to ensure  
that any serious labour issues are 
handled in a constructive manner  
to prevent them escalating into 
disputes which may have a 
significant business impact.
The group is committed to respecting 
the rights established through the 
core labour conventions of the ILO 
(International Labour Organisation). 
The EEP reaffirms this commitment 
and provides an additional avenue 
for matters of concern relating to 
ethical practices to be aired, 
particularly in relation to countries 
where international labour laws may 
not be well embedded. 
Business ethics and anti-bribery 
and corruption
Ethical conduct is not just a solution 
to the challenges of legal compliance, 
but a means of doing business which 
provides customers, employees, 
partners and communities with 
the confidence that they are 
working with an ethical organisation. 
Acting with integrity across the 
world is a key element of our 
business strategy and a positive 
differentiator with customers.
Every year we review our business 
ethics policy to ensure it reflects  
the current business and political 
environment and addresses any risks 
which may exist. Implementation  
of the standards described in the 
policy is the responsibility of local 
managers. These are subject to 
review through our internal audit 
programmes and from investigations 
triggered by whistleblowers or 
colleagues raising concerns with 
their managers. Compliance 
statements are now signed by  
the businesses and regions on  
a quarterly basis.
In 2015, we implemented an 
upgraded global whistleblowing 
system and case management tool 
to enable us to capture information 
on whistleblowing cases across the 
group and to analyse trends and 
issues raised on a more systematic 
basis. The events at our Medway 
facility in 2015 underline the 
importance of this on-going 
programme. Our ethics steering 
group works to ensure the 
appropriate focus on whistleblowing 
and ethical behaviour across the 
group and makes sure that we are 
constantly challenging ourselves  
to meet the highest standards.
From time to time, concerns about 
the conduct of our colleagues or 
our business partners are brought  
to our attention. We take all such 
concerns seriously and work  
with internal audit and external 
investigators to ensure all issues 
raised are addressed appropriately. 
Information on current issues can  
be found in our CSR report.
Human rights
Our human rights framework 
supports the continued 
development of an ethical and 
sustainable business model that 
encourages the improvement of 
standards, job creation, community 
support and broader beneficial 
impacts on societies throughout  
the world. The framework has been 
embedded across the group, along 
with newly-developed processes for 
assessing the group’s human rights 
risks in many areas such as bidding 
for major contracts, entering new 
markets and analysing our existing 
countries of operation. These 
practices are driven by an annual 
assessment of human rights risks 
and a series of assessments and 
reviews in markets where risks exist.
Where risks or concerns are 
identified, action is taken to make 
sure that we put in place processes 
to mitigate or reduce any risk.  
In some cases, this means that  
a business or operation can be 
scrutinised intensely by either  
G4S or independent experts.
More detail on human rights risk 
assessment can be found in the  
risk management section and the 
group’s separate CSR report.
Ethical conduct provides customers, employees, 
partners and communities with the confidence  
that they are working with an ethical organisation. 
Acting with integrity across the world is a key 
element of our business strategy and a positive 
differentiator with customers.

Our strategy continued ADDRESSING THE 
GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Over the last two and a half years  
we have invested heavily in sales 
leadership, sales and service training, 
customer relationships and account 
management. This also includes global 
accounts and improving how we 
identify the best global customer 
opportunities which has delivered 
success with customers such as GSK 
(see page 30). Our sales pipeline and 
sales management has improved with 
use of Salesforce.com now mandatory 
for our sales people, giving us better 
visibility on our pipeline.
Despite an uncertain economic outlook, we believe 
the long-term demand for our services remains 
strong and we expect to grow by around 4-6% per 
annum. We continue to sustain contract retention 
rates of around 90%, have won new business and 
more than replenished our sales pipeline.

Strategic report RE-INVESTING FOR 
PROFITABLE GROWTH
Operational excellence is an important lever which 
drives G4S’ multiple sources of value. A significant 
portion of the gains we are making in being more 
efficient have been re-invested in the business to 
increase our opportunities for growth as well as 
driving further efficiency. 
Our organisational efficiency 
programmes address:
• Efficient organisational design
• Management delayering
• Lean operating processes
• Efficient reporting and  
assurance processes
• Upgraded IT systems
• Efficient procurement
Some of the key ongoing initiatives 
in each of these areas are:
Efficient organisation design  
and management delayering
The formation of the group was 
based historically on many bolt-on 
acquisitions. In many cases, these 
acquisitions were not integrated. 
With the group offering a broad 
range of services in a large number 
of countries, this resulted in an 
inefficient organisational design with 
many management layers being built 
Investing in operational and 
service excellence – India
With support from group human 
resources, G4S India initiated an 
organisation design evaluation  
and change programme which 
concluded at the end of 2015 with 
an efficient and customer-oriented 
organisation. In order to eliminate 
multiple layers of duplicate work, 
branches were consolidated to have 
the best geographical coverage with 
optimum asset utilisation. In addition, 
processes were streamlined to 
de-layer the organisation. 
Some of the other achievements were: 
Processes and governance
• Standard processes and service 
delivery across all branches  
and hubs
• Controlled governance to ensure 
visibility of service delivery and 
sales at the management level
People and organisation
• Standard and clear roles  
and responsibilities across the 
organisation to enable career  
and succession planning
Multiple regional and zonal business 
units have been consolidated from 18 
into seven hubs, each with a profit and 
loss account focus similar to that of 
smaller countries. 
More than half the savings achieved 
from these initiatives were re-invested 
into upgrading the talent at all levels 
and investing in a sales and marketing 
organisation to ensure sustainable 
business growth. 
up over time – leading to inefficiency 
and lack of accountability. The aim of 
introducing organisational efficiency 
is to re-design the organisation starting 
with a blank sheet of paper. One 
example is the re-design of the 
regional and branch structures in 
India which reduced the number  
of branches from 132 to 85 and 
management layers from 18 to 
seven (see case study below).
Lean operating processes
Direct Labour Efficiency
A key enabler of efficient direct 
labour management is the 
deployment of lean “order  
to cash” process management  
enabled by the development  
and implementation of a standard  
IT system for manned security 
operations. During 2014 the group  
set up and communicated clear 
standards and best practices for  
the management of direct labour.

Vehicle management –  
Route planning and telematics
T elematics 
The telematics programme involves 
the installation and use of electronic 
tracking and driver behaviour 
monitoring devices that enable us to 
reduce fuel and maintenance costs, 
while improving driver and road safety. 
At the end of 2015 some 4,700  
of our cash solutions vehicles were 
fitted with telematics devices. 
The information is used by the 
operations team to highlight driver 
behaviour that could be improved 
and deploy corrective actions, 
including coaching and driver training 
with the objective of overall driver 
behaviour improvement and 
sustaining an acceptable level  
of driving efficiency and safety.

Strategic report By the end of August 2015 the cash

programmes deployed in 37 cash 
solutions businesses, with an 
annualised saving of £10 million  
for 2015.
Procurement and property 
rationalisation
The group procurement function 
was established in late 2014 and  
by the end of Q1 2015 it had 
reviewed G4S spend and supply 
chain profile across all our regions 
and spend categories (65,000 
suppliers accounted for spend  
of £1.5bn in 2014).
We set out on a category-focused 
regional procurement programme 
to reduce cost through better 
procurement and align our critical 
suppliers with G4S values and 
requirements. This analysis informed 
the investment needed to build  
a global and regional procurement 
category-based capability. This was 
supported by introducing global 
policies in procurement, and a  
global supplier code of conduct. 
During 2015 we focused our main 
procurement efforts at a regional 
level and completed 17 global 
contracts covering the IT, fuel and 
travel categories. These delivered 
savings in the range of 10%-25%. 
The contracts have led to closer 
global relationships with customers 
and have enabled us to control costs 
in these global categories. We now 
have agreements with eight global 
vehicle manufacturers to provide 
new vehicles for both our soft skin 
(car and van) and our armoured 
vehicle fleets along with a new 
global deal for ballistic glass – an 
essential safety feature on all cash  
in transit fleets. We now use Shell  
to supply fuel in all our operating 
regions where Shell are present.  
We enjoy preferential pricing, fuel 
card flexibility and support to our 
bunkered fuel in Africa. This has 
strengthened our relationship  
with this key customer. 
At a regional level we have 
completed over 60 regional supplier 
contracts that either fully cover  
large operating regions like North 
America and the UK or cover 
multiple countries across our 
emerging markets. These deals have 
leveraged the G4S scale within the 
different geographies which we 
believe enables us to be the 
customer of choice for our suppliers. 
We focused on telephony contracts 
in four regions and have achieved 
savings ranging from 25% to 75%  
in all areas we have addressed. We 
now have new deals in the UK, 
North America, Latin America, and 
several countries in Europe. We have 
contracted with a global real estate 
provider in the UK, Africa and Europe 
to provide advice and support on 
key strategic property consolidation 
projects, for example our central 
London property portfolio has 
reduced by 50% from four to  
two locations and now occupies 
properties with regional teams.
Finally, at a country level we have 
continued to consolidate our suppliers 
to remove risk from the supply 
chain and have completed over  
250 local engagements and 
contracts with smaller suppliers. 
Shared service centres
During 2015, we completed  
the consolidation of the manned 
security business in Canada into  
the US shared service centre. In  
Asia Middle East, we moved the 
transaction processing of five 
countries’ operations into a newly 
established shared service centre  
in India and further progressed 
consolidation of operations into  
the UK shared service centre.

Our strategy continued STRATEGIC FOCUS
During 2015 the businesses which 
we have sold or closed have generally 
been sub-scale, low growth, poor 
cash generators, low margin and 
with limited turnaround potential. 
Some of them are businesses where 
there are better opportunities for 
growth with a new owner. Our 
portfolio management programme 
has improved our strategic focus. 
We have released capital at 
attractive multiples overall. 
These proceeds have been 
re-invested in the organic growth 
and productivity programmes  
where we expect to see good 
returns on our investment. We 
continue to keep our portfolio 
under review to ensure that we are 
achieving the levels of return which 
we and our shareholders expect.
Continued portfolio management is 
a good capital discipline. It sharpens 
the group’s strategic focus, ensuring 
we apply our resources to the best 
opportunities where we have the 
highest chance of success. 
Portfolio management remains important for strategic focus, capital discipline 
and performance management. Since 2013, the group has divested 23 businesses 
realising proceeds of £281 million and more than 40 other businesses are being 
sold or exited. We have focused our activities and reduced the underlying 
countries of operation from around 120 to around 85.

During 2013, we conducted a “bottom-

evaluating their performance and 
prospects. The results showed that  
62 out of around 120 countries were 
expected to contribute 95% of the  
total PBITA expected in 2016. Since  
then we have reviewed over 60 
businesses, looking at strategic value,  
risk profile and materiality of contribution 
(growth, PBITA and cash generation).
In addition we are selling four further

lower end of the group’s aim  
of between 105% to 125%. The 
acceleration of growth in the second 
half of 2015, and the migration  
to our UK financial shared service

Excellence – India
During 2015 G4S India ran a 
programme for employees using 
motorcycles, where experience  
has shown that there is increased

“Safety on the Go”, the programme 
raises safety awareness as well as 
aiming to ensure compliance with 
the “Driving Force Rules”, a G4S 
health and safety initiative introduced 
in 2014. More than 900 employees 
took part in “Safety on the Go”, 
which included defensive driving

Our strategy continued “Order to cash” reviews  
in our key markets
During 2015 detailed order to  
cash reviews were completed  
in a number of our key markets 
including: India, Malaysia, North 
America and UK & Ireland. Best 
practice and tools shared under  
the “cash matters” initiative will 
facilitate similar reviews across  
the business during 2016.
These end to end reviews focus  
on key contracts and transactional 
data to identify both the root cause 
issues impacting timely cash collections 
and action plans to address these. 
Improvements implemented include:
Bid frameworks/contract 
management 
• Strengthening bid evaluation 
frameworks to increase focus  
on frequency of invoicing and 
shorter payment terms
Reducing the time from event  
to billing
• Improving processes and 
automating event billing 
information such as hours 
worked, milestones met, 
collections and deliveries in  
the cash solutions business
• Centralising collection of billing 
events of global and strategic 
accounts in some countries
• Invoice automation, removing the 
delay and resource requirement 
associated with manual invoicing
• Seeking to distribute all invoices 
electronically removing the  
delay and cost associated  
with postal distribution
Strengthening collections 
performance through:
• Changing incentive plans at 
management and branch level 
with greater emphasis on cash flow
• Improved management 
information to increase 
accountability and drive 
behaviours
• Embedding weekly calls attended 
by finance and operations, to 
drive timely collections
Managing accounts payable
• The group’s days payable 
outstanding of 31 days  
(2014: 37) is shorter than  
days sales outstanding of  
50 days (2014: 47 days).
• Ensuring that supply side 
contracts are back to back  
with customer contracts
• Negotiating improved terms 
through procurement on  
global and regional deals
Capital discipline
All capital investment undergoes 
rigorous review to ensure that the 
group’s return on investment hurdle

investment projects are approved  
by the executive committee. Please 
see page 27 for how our portfolio 
management programme remains 
important for capital discipline as

T o ensure the cash culture becomes 
embedded across the group, 2016 
incentive plans:
• Place an even greater weighting 
on operating cash generation  
and incentivise cash generation  
on a monthly basis across the year
• Include challenging operating  
cash targets to reduce the level  
of aged debt and accrued income 
which totalled £406 million  
at December 2015 (net of 
allowance for doubtful debt)
Improving cash flow – India
An order to cash review of our 
business in India during 2015 
significantly strengthened cash 
conversion.
• The order to cash cycle was 
reduced by c.6 days, resulting in  
a reduction in accrued income, by 
strengthening process automation 
(hours worked and invoice 
generation) and switching 
customers from cheque to 
electronic settlement; and
• Overdue debt was reduced by 
c.30% by increasing collections 
accountability, improving KPIs  
and differentiating the collection 
strategy adopted for strategic 
accounts and small and medium 
size businesses.

G4S is selective about markets in 
which it operates cash solutions 
businesses, depending on market 
characteristics and offers cash 
solutions services in 48 countries. 
The global use of cash, although 
varying considerably by market, will 
continue to diminish structurally, 
driven by the penetration of 
non-cash payments, and the  
trend towards minimising costs 
among retail and central banks. 
In developed markets, this structural 
decline will encourage trends to 
extract greater efficiencies in cash 
handling across the counting, sorting, 
storing and re-distribution cycle. 
We believe that in markets where 
central banks have made deliberate 
efforts to step back from cash 
processing, additional outsourcing 
opportunities are expected to 
emerge, particularly in high-street 
banking. Across the retail sectors  
in developed markets, structural 
declines in cash volumes over the 
medium term will accelerate the

and bank agnostic to maximise

The Reporting and Analysis module

to inventory levels of notes and 
coin, machine availability, carrier 
performance, and deposit 
management and reconciliation,  
the reporting and analysis module

CASH360™ is provided as a managed 
service and has proven to reduce:
• Cash room labour costs
• Bank processing fees 
• Armoured carrier  
transportation costs
• Cash leakage
In addition, CASH360™ provides 
“bank-owned” cash and same day 
credit to significantly improve a 
retailer’s cash flow. Bank-owned  
cash allows a retailer to free up  
the “trapped cash” used as float  
to manage day-to-day commercial 
operations. At the end of each 
business day, CASH360™ calculates 
the net change in cash position  
and sends a file to the bank for  
the purpose of providing the retail 
customer with same day credit. 
The Smart Safe programme was 
launched in 2015 to address the 
cash automation of Small Box 
retailers. A deposit-only service,  
a Smart Safe, reduces armoured 
carrier transportation costs, and cash 
leakage whilst providing faster access 
to cash through same day credit.

CARE & JUSTICE SERVICES:
34 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 THE G4S SOLUTION
The care applied by our staff is reflected in high 
standards of service provided for our customers and 
end users. Port Phillip Prison is a maximum security 
adult male prison in the state of Victoria, Australia.
Safety and security are the paramount 
features of our philosophy as well as 
incorporating fairness, respect for 
human rights and the personal dignity 
of the people entrusted to our care. 
G4S has been active within the justice 
sector in Australia since 1995 and we 
successfully manage and care for the 
offender population and prepare 
them for their future in society. 
Port Phillip Prison (PPP) can 
accommodate up to 1,107 prisoners 
and as Victoria’s largest prison, its 
primary roles include the management 
of prisoners in custody, administering 
custodial sentences, delivering a 
range of significant health services, 
programmes, education and industries 
in an environment that encourages 
positive behaviour and attitudes 
leading to self-directed rehabilitation. 
The prison is a complex and diverse 
facility accommodating the following 
prisoner cohorts: protection, youth, 
medical, mainstream, management, 
intellectually disabled and prisoners 
with psychiatric needs. T owards the 
end of 2015, G4S renewed its 
contract to run Port Phillip Prison. 
G4S will receive service payments  
of approximately £1.3 billion 
(nominal undiscounted cost, using 
G4S foreign exchange and indexation 
assumptions) for the 20 year 
operation and maintenance of  
the maximum-security prison.
Port Phillip Prison is the largest  
of Victoria’s 14 prisons, receiving  
its first prisoners on 10 September 
1997 and one of only two privately 
operated in the state. Recidivism 
(reoffending) is around 44.1% in 
Victoria, slightly lower than the 
national average of 44.3%. (Source: 
Report on Government Services 
2016 – Council of Australian 
Governments.) PPP supports  
a number of rehabilitation and 
community reintegration programmes 
which work towards reducing the 
rate of prisoners reoffending and 
support a safer Victorian community. 
These programmes are aimed at 
assisting prisoners to address their 
offending behaviour and personal 
development by focussing on issues 
relating to drug and alcohol, anger 
management, offending behaviour 
and re-establishing family ties. 
Marlborough Unit – “Joint 
Treatment Programme” 
Launched in 2007, the Marlborough 
Unit was designed to create a 
protected environment for cognitively 
impaired prisoners within the 
correctional system. In this safe 
environment, they are given 
opportunities to learn new ways  
of living through programmes 
providing transitional, educational 
and offence specific treatment.

programmes the unit runs a street 
soccer programme, they propagate 
plants and vegetables for donation 
to local community initiatives and 
the unit has seen, to great success, 
the introduction of therapy animals.
Penhyn Y outh Unit
The Penhyn Y outh Unit houses young 
adult men aged 18-25 and offers 
offending behaviour programmes and 
services targeted at these prisoners. 
The establishment of a ground-
breaking small business programme, 
‘Doin’ Time’, involves young prisoners 
being mentored by local business 
people and supported by some of 
Australia’s largest companies. The 
small business programme has been 
active for over eight years and has 
raised over £75k for various charities.
Education
The flexible learning education 
centre within the prison offers 
courses in areas such as literacy  
and numeracy, information 
technology, occupational health  
and safety, cooking, horticulture  
as well as full time education with 
access to distance education. Koori 
art and education is also offered as  
part of the curriculum as around 
seven percent of inmates are of 
indigenous Australian heritage.
Industry
The prison operates industries  
from 10 complexes and a number  
of satellite facilities located across the 
site. Some of the industries operated 
at the prison include ground and 
building maintenance, laundry, powder 
coating, kitchen, carpentry, garment 
assembly and packaging for goods and 
services used both in-house and 
outside of the prison. Prisoners are 
also employed in service industries 
in the accommodation units, hospital, 
admissions and across other 
programmes.
Health Services
The prison delivers acute medical, 
surgical and psycho-social care  
as well as secondary and tertiary 
in-patient care for all prisoners in  
the state. In addition to the in-patient 
facilities the prison also maintains  
a 10 bed secure ward at nearby 
St Vincent’s Hospital in Melbourne.

FINANCIAL KPIs
Our progress in 
implementing our  
strategic objectives  
is measured using key 
performance measures 
aligned to those objectives 
and the group values:
We have an organic growth strategy 
based on strong market positions in 
structural growth markets. We are 
investing in improved customer 
service, innovation and sales and 
business development capabilities. 
We believe there is also great 
potential to sell more complex 
solutions which tend to have longer 
contract terms and higher margins.
The group has a number of 
productivity programmes to  
drive efficiency and operational 
improvement across the group. 
These include efficient organisation 
design, management delayering,  
lean operating processes, efficient 
reporting and assurance processes, 
upgraded IT systems and  
efficient procurement.
In 2015, PBITA grew 5.7% to £427m 
(2014 restated: £404m) as a result 
of these initiatives starting to have 
some benefit. PBITA in emerging 
markets was up 9.2% and in 
developed markets PBITA 
decreased by 1.0%.
People & values
In 2015, revenues grew 4.0%  
to £6.4bn (2014 restated: £6.2bn), 
with emerging markets growing 
8.6% with broad growth across  
all three regions and developed 
markets growing 1.6%, with strong 
growth in North America and  
a return to growth in Europe 
offsetting a decline in the UK.

A key priority for the group is to drive 
improved cash generation, through 
leaner working capital management 
and capital discipline and embedding  
a “cash matters” culture throughout 
the group as outlined in more detail 
on pages 28 and 29. An even greater 
emphasis has been placed on cash  
in management incentive plans  
from 2016.
Underlying operating cash flow  
was £460m (2014 restated: £528m), 
down 13% mainly due to a temporary 
increase in working capital associated 
with strong revenue growth in the 
second half of 2015 and transition to 
a UK financial shared service centre. 
Helped by revenue growth, 
improved PBITA margins and lower 
interest costs underlying earnings 
increased 14% to £227m (2014 
restated: £199m) in 2015. Underlying 
EPS also increased 14% to 14.7p 
(2014 restated: 12.9p).
G4S is looking to deliver sustainable 
growth in earnings over the long 
term. EPS growth is a component  
of both the annual and long term 
management incentive plans.
For more detail on the group’s strategic priorities please see pages 10 and 11. For more detail on 2015 financial 
performance please see the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 96 to 105.
In addition to the financial KPIs,  
the group has a set of performance 
measures aligned to its strategic 
priorities. A description of these 
performance measures and our 
progress against them is shown

in emerging markets (up 8.6%) and 
North America (up 5.8%), solid 
growth in Europe (up 2.6%), partially 
offset by a decline of 3.0% in the UK 
& Ireland region due to contract 
phasing. Profit before interest, tax 
and amortisation increased 5.7% to 
£427m, with lower margins in Latin 
America, UK & Ireland and Europe 
offset by higher margins in Africa, 
Asia and Middle East, North America 
and lower corporate costs.

the Africa region accelerated to 
7.4% in the second half of the year 
resulting in 6.8% for the full year 
with good growth across all markets 
and in both secure solutions and  
cash solutions. 
The broad-based growth, together 
with operational gearing and 
improved productivity produced 
PBITA growth of 8.1% year on year.

Strategic report Our Europe region returned to 
growth in 2015, with revenues up by

42 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 In North America, our revenues 
grew by 5.8% for the full year, as 
strong growth in commercial 
security, security systems and cash 
management technology more than 
offset the general slowdown in 
Canada, where the economy has 
been impacted by the decline in  
oil and gas prices.
PBIT A for the region was 17.5% higher , 
as higher revenue and operational 
gearing more than offset the costs of 
our investment in product and service 
innovation and sales capacity. The 
Affordable Care Act became effective 
in the fourth quarter of 2015 and, as

Strategic report Risk management
Our aim is to gain a deep understanding of the principal risks 
we face at all levels of the business and to focus management 
attention on effective mitigation of the most critical risks.
AN INTEGRAL PART OF  
DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT
Our risks 
The last year has continued to 
highlight the dynamic nature of the 
markets in which G4S operates. The 
geo-political situation in the Middle 
East has continued to worsen, with 
its tragic consequences now directly 
impacting western countries. 
Economic recovery has strengthened 
in developed markets, albeit unevenly. 
However the fall in the oil price and 
the slowdowns in China and Brazil 
have had negative impacts across 
developing markets, particularly in 
the extractive industries. G4S also 
continues to face the operational  
and health and safety risks which  
are particular to the security business, 
along with the financial control and 
commercial risks common to all 
multinational companies. 
Governance Risk and Control 
(GRC) information system has  
been implemented and the previous 
risk management system retired.  
The board risk appetite has been 
included to enable comparison  
of reported residual risk  
against appetite.
What we will do in 2016 
We are conducting a thorough  
review of all group mandated control 
standards. These have been developed 
over many years and their clarity, 
consistency and focus can be 
improved. This will facilitate improved 
understanding and compliance by 
operating unit management teams  
of those controls which have the most 
material impact on the management 
of our key risks. Control self-
assessments on this revised control 
set will be conducted annually 
(bi-annually for financial controls) by 
operating units using the GRC system. 
Audit programmes will be adjusted to 
match the revised control set. Using 
GRC we will improve the quality of 
reporting of compliance with group 
control standards and board risk 
appetite. This will facilitate focusing 
improvement efforts on those parts 
of the business which most need it. 
We believe that the progress made  
in driving risk management quality 
over the last two years allows us to 
now push more accountability for  
risk management to the operating 
unit level. Therefore in the coming 
year the Regional Risk and Audit 
Committees will be focused on 
financial judgments and reporting  
on closure of external audit 
management letter points and 
internal audit findings. However, 
given the nature of the business  
in the UK the Risk and Audit 
Committee in that region will 
continue to cover the same detailed 
agenda as in 2015. Enterprise risk 
management will be embedded 
more tightly into operating business 
unit management. There will be a 
thorough annual review of the risk 
register as an integral part of the 
annual planning process. Updates  
to risk levels and mitigating action 
progress will be incorporated into 
operating unit senior management 
meetings and trading reviews of 
countries by regional management. 
Regional level risks will be maintained 
in the regional registers and 
reviewed during regional trading 
reviews by group management. 
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2014, the directors have 
assessed the viability of the group 
over a three year period, aligned 
with that of the group’s rolling 
planning cycle, taking into account 
the group’s current position  
and the potential impact of the 
principal risks documented on 
pages 48 to 54. Planning beyond 
three years is seen by the group  
as being of limited value due to:
• The vast majority of the group’s 
contracts being for one year;
• The correlation of demand for 
security services with the very 
volatile global economy; and
• The impact of the group’s 
ongoing transformation 
programme.
The group’s prospects are 
assessed primarily through its 
bottom up strategic planning cycle. 
The overall strategy for the group 
was refreshed comprehensively in 
November 2013 and the board 
has monitored progress closely 
against this strategy as well as  
the risks to its success. The 2015 
process commenced in June with 
each country and business unit 
updating its rolling three year 
strategic plan and considering the 
risks to that plan’s achievement. 
These plans were reviewed and 
refined by regional management 
and then by the Group Executive 
Committee before being reviewed 
and endorsed by the board in 
December 2015. The key 
assumptions in the financial 
forecasts, reflecting the overall 
strategy, include:
• A continued demand for 
security services, as set out  
on pages 14 to 15 of the 
strategic report
• An ability to continue to  
drive through our productivity 
programmes and to flex the 
cost base as set out on pages  
24 to 26
• Continuing to improve  
the operating cashflow 
performance of the group  
as set out on pages 28 to 29
The output of this plan is used  
as the baseline for stress testing 
covenant and headroom analysis.  
It includes a review and sensitivity 
analysis to changes in trading 
conditions affecting profit growth 
and the capital needs of the 
business, as well as the principal 
residual risks.
The vast majority of the group’s 
risks exist at an individual country 
level and are individually immaterial. 
The principal residual risks described 
on pages 48 to 54 are an aggregate 
view of the approximately 1,500 
individual risks captured in country, 
regional and group functional risk 
registers. The individual risk 
assessments of likelihood and 
financial impact have been 
aggregated to provide a range  
of overall impacts from expected 
to pessimistic which have been 
used to inform the sensitivity 
analysis. The most significant risks 
financially are growth strategy  
and laws and regulations.
The directors consider that this 
stress-testing based assessment  
of the group’s prospects is 
reasonable in the circumstances  
of the inherent uncertainty 
involved. Based on this assessment, 
the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company will 
be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the three financial years 
to 31 December 2018.
What we did in 2015 
Our risks are captured in a global 
risk reporting information system. 
These risks are reviewed formally  
at least annually by the operating 
companies and global functions. The 
principal residual risks to the group 
as a whole are discussed in depth by 
the Group Executive Committee 
(GEC). The board Risk Committee 
reviews the most significant risks on 
a regular basis, and the board reviews 
regularly the overall impact of these 
major risks on the group’s activities. 
During 2015 the Regional Risk and 
Audit Committees have driven 
improved risk management 
processes in the operating units, 
monitoring the quality of risk 
registers and the progress against 
planned mitigating actions. The new

OPERATING COMPANIES
Responsibility for the first line sits with the managers of our businesses, 
whether line management or financial support. The senior management 
team within each business is responsible for implementing and maintaining 
appropriate controls across their business. 
Result: Ensures standards expected by the group, our customers and other 
stakeholders are met.
2ND LINE: CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS
The second line consists of oversight functions at both regional and group 
level including: risk, finance, legal, human resources, operations, information 
technology, commercial and CSR. 
Result: Provides support to the business managers.
3RD LINE: INTERNAL INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE
The third line is designed to detect or prevent unexpected outcomes and 
comprises the internal audit function. As part of its annual programme of 
work, internal audit conducts regular reviews of risk management processes 
and gives advice and recommendations on how to improve the control 
environment. In addition, the Regional Risk and Audit Committees meet  
on a quarterly basis to monitor and review the effectiveness of the control 
environment and accounting judgements.
Result: Provides independent assurance over the design and operation  
of controls.
Board Risk Committee
The board Risk Committee meets 
four times per year and sets the 
group’s risk appetite, assesses the 
group’s principal residual risks and 
assesses the overall enterprise risk 
management process. 
Group Executive Committee 
The Group Executive Committee 
considers the group’s principal 
residual risks and the progress  
of mitigating actions.

The committees are responsible  
for whistleblowing and investigations 
across the regions.
Operating companies and shared service functions
Our operating companies and shared service functions identify and assess 
the risks to their business objectives and plan appropriate mitigating actions. 
These are recorded in our group-wide risk management tool. A thorough 
review is conducted as part of the annual planning process with updates 
made in senior management team meetings and trading reviews formally 
twice a year. Control self-assessments against group control standards are 
completed annually (bi-annually for financial control standards).
EXTERNAL AUDIT

Strategic report Principal risks
What are the key risks  
faced by G4S? 
Countries reviewed their risks and 
updated their plans as part of the 
strategic planning process in 2015. 
These were then considered at  
a regional level before group risk 
management and the office of  
the CFO consolidated them and 
identified common themes and 
regional risks which were material  
to the group. The GEC and board 
also discussed the group’s key risks 
as part of the annual strategy review 
process. These “bottom up” and “top 
down” perspectives on risk are used 
by the responsible members of the 
GEC, supported by the group risk 
function, to formulate the group’s 
principal residual risks. The board’s 
Risk Committee approved them in 
March 2016. The group’s principal 
residual risks must be considered  
in the context of the board’s risk 
appetite, which can be summarised 
as follows:
G4S operates in high risk areas  
of business in which our core 
competence and value add to 
customers is managing those risks 
effectively. We have a higher risk 
appetite to growing and transforming 
the business when we have the 
expertise to deliver and achieve  
a good commercial return on  
the risk we are accepting from  
our customers. 
There are many opportunities  
for growth and as discussed on  
page 21, there are many actions  
to drive the growth agenda through: 
• Sales and business development 
capability
• Sales performance measures  
in all businesses to drive growth, 
customer retention and customer 
satisfaction
• Customer engagement  
and retention
• Implementation of a standard tool 
to manage customer satisfaction
• Global account management
• Industry sector specialists such  
as Oil and Gas
• New service development  
and innovation 
• Pricing policy and management 
and the roll-out of Salesforce.com 
globally
There are many opportunities to 
improve productivity as discussed  
on pages 24 to 26 and set ambitious 
programmes of change and 
improvement. However in delivering 
this agenda of change and growth 
we need to effectively manage the 
risks we are taking on: 
• By assessing the risks of major 
contracts thoroughly; applying the 
best resources and our expertise; 
and hence putting in place 
mitigation strategies which  
will control the risks to a 
commercially acceptable level; 
• By applying commercial and financial 
discipline and controls to manage 
our growth opportunities; and 
• By applying effective programme 
and project management to our 
change agenda.

in our offices around the world and 
reflected in management performance 
contracts. During 2015 we conducted 
a review of these values, recognising 
that they were originally developed 
in 2004. Whilst many elements of 
the original values remain relevant 
to our business strategy today, we 
believe that they now better reflect 
the standards we expect from our 
staff and the commitments we make 
to our stakeholders. More information 
on our new values can be found on 
page 17.
We have a global whistleblowing 
process and central whistleblowing 
case management system in place 
which provides us with visibility of 
whistleblowing issues and helps us 
to assess trends and root causes.  
We have ethics steering groups  
at group level and in each region 
which oversee the whistleblowing 
investigation process and provide 
guidance to countries on  
ethical matters.
Risk description 
The provision of security services  
in hostile or dangerous circumstances 
presents particular health and safety 
challenges. The business operates  
a large vehicle fleet in a number  
of countries with poor road 
infrastructures, increasing the risk  
of road traffic incidents. In 2015, 46 
(2014: 41) employees lost their lives 
in work related incidents. Fatalities 
and injuries to our staff impact not 
only the individuals concerned, but 
also their families and loved ones.
Risk mitigation approach 
The protection of our staff, people 
in our care or custody, and third 
parties including the public, is of 
utmost importance. We believe that 
accidents are preventable and that 
‘zero fatalities’ is an appropriate goal. 
We are committed to continuous 
improvement of our health and 
safety systems, processes and 
HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S)
cultures. The group has mandatory 
health and safety controls which  
all companies are required to 
implement. Mandatory health and 
safety training for senior leaders, 
focusing on safety leadership and 
culture, has been completed by 
more than 1,000 managers. Lessons 
learned during the investigation of 
serious incidents are communicated 
in Safety First bulletins and are used 
to revise the group’s health and 
safety standards to better address 
the risks that led to these incidents. 
A road safety policy is issued to all 
businesses, a number of which also 
run local programmes on topics 
such as speed management and 
motorcycle safety. As part of our 
continuing programme of detailed 
assessments of H&S practices in  
a number of high-risk countries, 
follow-up reviews were conducted 
in order to derive assurance that 
businesses have implemented the 
improvement actions which they 
committed to. Unfortunately, this 
progress has not yet been evident  
in a reduction in the number  
of fatalities.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We will continue to drive behavioural 
change so that people take personal 
responsibility for role modelling 
good health and safety behaviours 
and for ensuring compliance with 
operational procedures. We will  
be embedding best practices, 
standards and behaviours at 
supervisory levels, and conducting 
safety “stand downs” after each 
major incident. We will conduct 
interventions to support selected 
businesses in delivering improved 
health and safety performance.
CULTURE AND VALUES
Risk description 
G4S provides security to people, 
premises and valuable assets. In its 
care and justice services businesses  
it also provides services to detainees, 
victims of crime, people needing state 
assistance, vulnerable people and 
other members of the public. This 
requires our staff to conduct 
themselves with the utmost integrity. 
We operate in many different 
countries around the world with a 
diversity of local and national cultures. 
Having a strong set of corporate 
values that unite the organisation, 
deeply embedded in our culture,  
is of particular importance.
If we fail to behave in accordance 
with the high standards that we set 
ourselves there is a risk that we will 
not deliver on our commitment to 
customers, and fail to comply with 
legislation and international standards. 
Risk mitigation approach
The group has a strong set of 
corporate values which are embedded 
Mitigation priorities for 2016
Our revised corporate values will  
be re-launched to the organisation 
and our stakeholders. This will  
be supported by an employee 
engagement programme to ensure 
they are embedded in our core 
processes for selecting, hiring, 
on-boarding, training and development 
of our colleagues around the world. 
They will also be a key element of 
how we assess the performance of 
our leaders and the basis on which 
our other corporate policies and 
standards will develop.
In the UK & Ireland business  
we have a strong focus on the 
awareness of our corporate values 
and the whistleblowing process  
in prisons and other secure 
establishments. Members of our 
Group Executive Committee are 
undertaking a programme of visits 
to these locations to help ensure 
this is embedded successfully.

Strategic report Principal risks continued
Risk description 
We provide our customers across 
the world a wide range of high 
quality, well controlled services. 
Nevertheless the nature of the 
group’s activities means that we can 
face high inherent reputational risks 
related to the countries in which  
we operate, the services which we 
provide, the customers and suppliers 
with which we work, the people in 
our care and our interactions with 
members of the public with whom 
our colleagues come into contact.
When we fail to meet either our 
own standards or the expectations 
of our key stakeholders there is the 
potential for negative impact upon 
our customers, suppliers, the people 
in our care or the communities  
in which we work. This adverse 
impact on our key stakeholders  
is likely to lead to damage to the 
group’s reputation.
Risk mitigation approach
The mitigation approach described 
under the culture and values risk 
and others play an important  
part in maintaining our reputation. 
Additionally, our human rights 
framework is embedded in key 
systems and business decision-
making processes across the group, 
such as evaluating new market 
entries, analysing the risks of 
entering into major new contracts 
or operational areas. We have a  
central media relations team which 
actively engages with commentators 
and critics.
The serious events at the Medway 
facility have put G4S in the public 
eye, increasing our reputational risk.
See the 2015 CSR report for  
more information.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We will continue to focus on 
building colleagues’ sense of 
responsibility to report issues, and 
ensuring they feel confident and  
safe that they can raise concerns 
that will be taken seriously and 
treated positively. We are re-
launching and further embedding 
our values, clarifying the expected 
behaviours of our people. We are 
developing and implementing a 
political risk management process. 
Human rights will continue to form 
an important part of our risk 
assessment and mitigation process, 
with the implementation of a new 
control-self assessment for businesses 
operating in high risk countries.

BRAND AND REPUTATION 
Risk description 
We are the largest employer listed 
on the London Stock Exchange, 
employing 610,000 people 
world-wide, and the largest security 
solutions provider in the world. In  
a global and diverse business such  
as ours, there are risks associated 
with recruiting, motivating, developing 
and training employees on a large 
scale, as well as rewarding 
appropriately and retaining our 
critical talent and ensuring effective 
succession in management roles. 
Screening is also a particular 
challenge in some territories which 
lack supporting infrastructure  
from the relevant authorities.
Risk mitigation approach
The group has mandatory human 
resources controls which all 
countries are required to implement. 
In those territories where local 
circumstances make it impossible  
to fully comply with the screening 
and vetting elements, we identify 
alternative measures, approved by 
group human resources, to mitigate 
the risk as much as possible.
In 2015, we undertook our fourth 
global employee engagement  
survey. 449,000 employees 
responded, approximately 73%  
of the workforce. The survey data 
helps shape our group-wide human 
resources and engagement strategies, 
as well as providing our management 
and supervisors at a local level with 
information on key issues impacting 
employee engagement levels. 
Information regarding the outcomes 
of our engagement survey can be 
found in the People and Values 
section of this report on page 18.
We review in detail the 
performance and potential of 
approximately 3,000 managers 
across the group to help identify 
development needs and build 
succession plans. We also run a 
regional leadership programme  
to nurture talented individuals early 
in their careers and develop them 
into more senior roles as they  
move through the organisation.
The employee survey and  
country risk registers have both 
shown improvement in overall 
employee engagement.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
Following feedback from the 
management survey in 2015 a 
review of incentives took place.  
They will continue to be scrutinised 
to ensure they are driving sustainable 
performance and the link between 
individual contribution and reward 
remains clear. Other feedback in the 
survey related to opportunities for 
career development. Further modules 
will be added to the regional 
leadership programme and some  
of the programme materials will be 
made more widely available to other 
managers who wish to make use of 
them to support their long term 
development.

50 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 MAJOR CONTRACTS
Risk description 
The group has a number of long 
term, complex, high value contracts 
with multi-national, government  
or other strategic customers. For 
such contracts there are risks to  
the group accepting onerous 
contractual terms; mobilising 
contracts; transitioning effectively 
from mobilisation to on-going 
contract management; delivering to 
contractual requirements; managing 
complex billing arrangements; 
managing contract change control; 
and managing sub-contractors. 
Failure to ensure effective contract 
take-on, mobilise successfully  
and manage complex contracts 
effectively throughout their lifecycles 
can impact the group’s liabilities, 
customer satisfaction, reputation, 
revenue, cash flow, growth  
and profitability.
Risk mitigation approach
We have strict thresholds for the 
approval of major bids involving 
both detailed legal review and 
senior management oversight.  
These are embedded into our 
SalesForce opportunity management 
tool. When appropriate we conduct 
external reviews of bid models.  
For our most significant running 
contracts, primarily in the UK, we 
perform 360° reviews of all aspects 
of contract management and 
performance. Internal Audit perform 
focused contract audits of the most 
complex contracts. We have also 
continued to perform a quarterly 
financial review of the top 25 
contracts in each region.  
We believe that the improvements 
we have made to controls in this 
area over the last two years have 
significantly reduced the risk of 
taking on new contracts which will 
become materially onerous.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We will continue to enhance the 
contract pre-signing review process, 
taking account of lessons learned 
from any underperforming 
contracts. An increased proportion 
of group internal audit reviews in 
the UK business will focus on  
major contracts.
Risk description 
We deliver our core secure 
solutions services in 84 markets  
and our core cash solutions services 
in 48 markets. A number of these 
businesses have been acquired over 
time, resulting in cultural differences, 
varying degrees of operational 
maturity and a multiplicity of 
information systems.
This can create risks around core 
operational service delivery and 
supporting functions. Failure to meet 
the service delivery requirements  
of our customers, because we have 
not implemented the right solutions 
or followed appropriate agreed 
procedures, can create risks around 
cash losses, attacks on our staff, 
subcontractors or third parties and 
the non-delivery of the service level 
agreements and KPIs agreed with 
our customers.
Additional risks relate to business 
resilience, including from climate 
DELIVERY OF CORE SERVICE LINES
change such as extreme weather  
or mass migration, control systems, 
and the availability of critical systems, 
facilities and people to perform 
contractually agreed services.
This can lead to financial penalties, 
and negatively impact customer 
retention and goodwill, to the 
detriment of financial performance.
Risk mitigation approach
G4S has a set of global best practice 
service delivery guidelines for both 
secure solutions and cash service 
lines. It is the responsibility of 
regional management to work  
with countries to progressively 
adopt these standards. Risks to 
resilience arising from climate 
change are considered on an 
on-going basis by relevant country 
management teams. A new intranet 
has been launched in early 2016, 
bringing together 65,000 users in 
G4S worldwide. This gives all of our 
intranet users common access to 
news and corporate information, 
and enable our people to share best 
practice and interact with colleagues 
from around the globe, in innovative 
and exciting ways.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We have initiated a programme to 
deliver a global information system 
supporting the end to end Order to 
Cash process in our secure solutions 
service lines. This will be based on 
commercial best practice for finance 
and HR and G4S best practice for 
operational delivery. The programme 
will be piloted initially in our UK & 
Ireland businesses and then be 
rolled out globally over a number  
of years. This will seek to transform 
our cost structure, strengthen our 
control environment and provide a 
platform for embedding our service 
delivery standards globally, thus 
transforming the quality of our 
customers’ experience.

GROWTH STRATEGY
Risk description 
Our growth strategy is to leverage 
our expertise to drive innovation in 
our core service lines which delivers 
more value to our customers and 
so increases long-term customer 
partnerships.
There are risks that we will fail  
to create higher value solutions  
that differentiate us from local 
commoditised competitors; that  
we will lose contracts or growth 
opportunities through price 
competition and market changes;  
that we fail to enter target markets 
successfully; that we become 
over-reliant on large customers;  
and that adverse government 
legislation changes could impact  
on our growth potential or force 
exit from markets and territories.
Risk mitigation approach
Our development of new service 
offerings, particularly in electronic 
security and cash solutions, is 
focused on those centres of 
excellence where we have the 
strongest capability. We then 
leverage our global networks  
to offer these services globally.  
In particular, our global accounts 
programme supports and promotes 
our multinational accounts and 
focuses on cross-selling our more 
specialist services such as investigations 
and secure logistics. Our ‘outbound’ 
programme works with Chinese  
and North American multinational 
customers to provide services to 
them on a global scale. We have 
seen a deceleration in growth 
opportunities in developing markets, 
which we mitigate through the 
diversity of industries and markets 
we are able to serve and by 
leveraging our portfolio of products 
to offer alternative cost efficient 
solutions to those industries with  
a requirement to adjust their 
investments in security.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We continue to invest in and 
develop our sales and business 
development systems and 
capabilities. We are placing a 
renewed focus on customer 
satisfaction monitoring to improve 
measurement of our engagement 
with our clients and therefore 
making us more effective in driving 
stronger customer relationships. We 
are further developing our customer 
relationship management tools to 
embed core measurement and 
reporting of our service level 
agreements and key performance 
indicators with customers.
LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Risk description 
G4S operates in many jurisdictions 
globally, with complex and diverse 
regulatory frameworks. An 
additional complexity arises from 
the extraterritorial reach of some  
of the legislation to which the  
group is subject.
Risks include increasing litigation  
and class actions; bribery and 
corruption; obtaining operating 
licences; complying with local tax 
regulations; changes to employment 
legislation; complying with human 
rights legislation; and new or 
changed restrictions on foreign 
ownership. Risk also arises from  
new or changing regulations  
which require modification of  
our processes and staff training.
Not being compliant with applicable 
laws and regulations can have far 
reaching consequences, including 
higher costs from claims and 
litigation; inability to operate in 
certain jurisdictions, either through 
direct ownership or joint ventures; 
loss of management control; damage 
to our reputation; and loss of 
customer confidence.
Risk mitigation approach 
Our internal policies and procedures 
clearly set out that most of these 
risks, including compliance with local 
laws and regulations, are the direct 
responsibility of local management. 
Ethics steering groups at group and 
regional level are in place to provide 
oversight and support compliance 
with the internal policies and 
procedures to mitigate the risks. 
Specifically, whilst ownership of 
implementing anti-bribery and 
corruption policies lies with the 
business managing directors, our 
legal community has compliance 
oversight with a direct escalation 
route to the group legal counsel.
Group legal and regional leadership 
closely monitor risks of changes in 
foreign ownership laws and make 
appropriate plans to respond. G4S 
continues to liaise with relevant 
governments and authorities to 
influence positively the regulatory 
environments in which we work.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We will be implementing a process 
for political risk management to 
ensure that we are monitoring 
regulatory and other emerging 
political risks within our key markets. 
This process will be supported  
by a programme to enhance  
our engagement with regulators, 
politicians and political influencers 
across the group.

52 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 GEO-POLITICAL
Risk description 
We operate in many countries 
across the developed and 
developing world, with wide-ranging 
government and political systems, 
differing cultural landscapes, and 
varying degrees of rule of law; and 
within conflict and post-conflict 
zones. The risk factors range  
from political volatility, revolution, 
terrorism, military intervention and 
insurgency. The geo-political risks  
we face impact us in many ways: the 
health and safety of our staff and 
customers; the continued operation 
of our businesses; and the ability  
to secure our assets and recover 
our profits.
Risk mitigation approach
We perceive the external threat  
to have increased, given terrorist 
attacks such as those in Paris in 
November 2015 or Jakarta in 
January 2016, continued seizure of 
territory by Islamic State, tensions in 
Ukraine and Y emen and the potential 
increase in political instability and the 
risk of civil unrest in parts of Africa 
and Latin America. Given the wide 
range of countries in which the 
group operates there will always  
be some with a degree of serious 
political instability. We have a global 
process for assessing the geopolitical 
risks of different countries which 
determines the types of customers 
we will serve and the types of 
services we will provide.
We have a great deal of experience 
of operating in a wide range of 
difficult territories. We collaborate 
with our local partners and/or 
agents; conduct early risk 
assessments before and during 
security assignments; have robust 
operating procedures; and work 
closely with our local and global 
customers in managing the risks of 
operating in such environments. Our 
G4S Risk Management business has 
particular expertise in providing 
secure solutions in very high risk, 
low infrastructure environments. 
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We will be implementing a process 
for political risk management to 
enhance our monitoring of 
emerging political risks within  
our key markets.
INFORMATION SECURITY
Risk description 
The customers, staff, suppliers and 
partners of G4S which entrust their 
sensitive and confidential business 
information into our care rightly 
expect that we take all reasonable 
steps to protect it.
Given G4S’ high profile, we are at 
risk of cyber and physical attack by 
criminal organisations and individual 
hackers. There is also the risk that  
an individual with legitimate access 
to business information could 
disclose it inappropriately, or that  
an insider could disrupt availability  
of key systems.
An information security breach 
could result in: censure and fines  
by national governments; loss of 
confidence in the G4S brand and 
reputation; specific loss of trust  
by customers, especially those in 
government and financial sectors; 
and disruption to service delivery 
and integrity, particularly in cash 
solutions operations.
Risk mitigation approach
G4S has implemented “defence-in-
depth” technologies (i.e. multiple 
layers of defence) in key systems  
to protect business information 
entrusted to us. We have mandatory 
policies and best practice guidance 
for application by operating 
businesses across the group. Our 
minimum mandatory security 
controls are continually refined and 
updated in line with our assessment 
of threats. Compliance with the 
controls is measured through 
self-assessment and independently 
audited by group internal audit.
In early 2016, G4S migrated 
successfully all its businesses to  
one unified office productivity suite, 
Google Apps, covering around 
65,000 employees. This gives us 
improved controls and security of 
email and corporate documents. 
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We continue to protect our 
corporate information in line with 
recognised best practice, and select 
the appropriate security enforcing 
controls required in each of our 
information systems. Our mitigations 
reflect the G4S IT strategies, local 
operating conditions and the 
corporate risk appetite.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 53
Strategic report CASH LOSSES
Risk description 
We have cash solutions businesses 
spread across the world responsible 
for cash held on behalf of our 
customers. We provide cash 
transportation from one site to 
another in high security vehicles, a 
range of cash management services 
including secure storage, counting, 
reconciliation and sorting of notes 
for ATMs; a range of ATM services; 
and secure storage and international 
transportation of cash and valuables.
There are inherent risks in this 
business related to external attacks, 
internal theft and poor cash 
reconciliation.
Cash losses can have a major impact 
for our customers and G4S in 
respect of loss of profit, increased 
cost of insurance and health and 
safety considerations for our staff 
and the public.
Risk mitigation approach
We have clearly defined standards 
for reconciliation and operational 
cash controls. The group internal 
audit cash reconciliation team is 
responsible for auditing compliance 
with these standards. An e-learning 
“academy” for cash reconciliation 
and control, has been developed 
during 2015. 
We also have clearly defined 
standards for physical cash security. 
The group cash security function is 
responsible for monitoring compliance 
with these; for monitoring attacks  
and other cash losses; and for 
communicating lessons learned. 
Innovative security defence products 
are in use, ranging from cash box 
tracking to vehicle protection foam 
and protective boxes.
Mitigation priorities for 2016
We will be rolling out the e-learning 
“academy” as a vehicle for driving 
continuous improvement in  
cash reconciliation.

54 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 We remain mindful that governance 
should not be a procedural 
straightjacket which inhibits 
entrepreneurship, but we do not 
lose sight of the need to ensure 
careful stewardship of the company 
and its resources.
This report sets out the details of 
the work of the board over the last 
year and the processes it adopts, 
including the mechanisms by which 
the board satisfies itself that adequate 
controls are maintained throughout 
the group and that systems are in 
place to preserve value for the 
company’s stakeholders.
During the year we made changes 
to the board. As explained in last 
year’s report, two directors stood 
down, as Grahame Gibson retired 
from the group and Mark Seligman 
reached the end of his tenure as  
an independent non-executive.  
We have recruited a new non-
executive director with John Daly’s 
appointment in June and we are 
looking to strengthen the experience 
and balance of the board with two 
further non-executive appointments 
during 2016.
CONTINUED COMMITMENT 
TO GOOD GOVERNANCE
John Connolly
Chairman
“ As chairman, I am encouraged by the UK Corporate Governance Code 
to report on how the Code’s principles relating to the role and effectiveness 
of the board have been applied. This section of the company’s annual 
report and accounts explains the role of the board and how it operates, 
my role as chairman and the mechanisms we adopt to comply with the 
principles embodied in the Code. More importantly, it explains how the 
governance processes we maintain are designed to help deliver long 
term sustainable value for shareholders.”
As usual, the board has undertaken 
a thorough evaluation of its own 
performance and of that of each of 
its committees. The lessons learned 
from this review have been fed into 
the board’s priorities for 2016 and, 
as a consequence, we will focus on 
ensuring the board’s understanding 
of the group is further developed, 
that the new members of the senior 
management team are integrated 
well and quickly and that the 
execution of the group’s strategy 
proceeds to plan. More details  
of the evaluation and the board’s 
priorities can be found on page 61.
In 2016 the board’s expectation  
is that the group will continue to 
build on the progress that has been 
achieved in the last couple of years, 
but that strict adherence to prudent 
management principles will continue 
to be applied and monitored not 
only by the board, but also 
throughout the group.

OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The board leads the group’s 
governance framework, setting 
broad strategic targets, monitoring 
progress, approving proposed 
actions and ensuring appropriate 
controls are in place and  
operating effectively.
Management decisions, development 
of strategies and policies and 
implementation of board decisions fall 
to the group executive committee.
Regional management teams have 
responsibility for businesses within 
their regions and are tasked with 
implementing policies and controls 
at business unit level, as well as 
ensuring they meet agreed financial 
and non-financial goals.
The presence of a majority of 
independent non-executive 
directors on the board ensures 
objectivity, challenge and debate. 
It is the primary responsibility of  
the board to provide effective 
leadership for the group and this 
is achieved by, amongst other things, 
ensuring that decision making is 
conducted throughout the group 
within an improving internal  
control framework – and by  
setting values and standards.
There is a detailed schedule  
of matters which are reserved  
to the decision of the board.
These matters fall under 12 categories:
• Strategy and management
• Structure and capital
• Financial reporting and controls
• Risk and internal controls
• Contracts
• Communication
• Board membership and  
other appointments
• Remuneration
• Delegation of authority
• Corporate governance matters
• Policies
• Other matters – such as settling 
material litigation, making major 
changes to the group’s pension 
scheme rules and the 
appointment of group advisors
By way of example, board approval 
is required for: unbudgeted capital 
projects of more than £10m; entering 
into a sales contract where annual 
revenue is anticipated to be more 
than £50m; any changes to the 
group’s capital structure; and  
the annual operating and  
capital expenditure budgets.
The board fulfils a number of its 
most important functions through 
its committees. The work of these 
committees is described below in 
this report. The terms of reference 
of each of the committees are 
available on the company’s  
website at www.g4s.com.

60 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Board composition
As at the date of this report, the 
board comprises 10 members:  
the non-executive chairman  
(John Connolly), seven other 
non-executive directors and two 
executive directors. The board 
considers all the non-executive 
directors to be independent.
The names of the directors serving 
as at 31 December 2015 and their 
biographical details are set out on 
pages 56 and 57. All these directors 
served throughout the year apart 
from John Daly, a non-executive 
director who was appointed on  
5 June 2015. Grahame Gibson, an 
executive director, and Mark Seligman, 
a non-executive director, both 
retired from the board at the 
conclusion of the company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 4 June 2015.
The Nomination Committee is 
engaged in a process to recruit  
two new non-executive directors.
Induction, information and 
professional development
A tailored induction is provided to 
new directors joining the board. In 
the case of non-executive directors, 
this includes spending time with the 
executive directors and other senior 
executives to understand the business, 
its structure and people, as well as 
the company’s strategy and financial 
performance. Induction also provides 
details of the group’s governance 
policies and structure and risk 
management framework.
T o build on the induction 
programme, directors receive 
further briefings both to help in 
their own development and also  
to enhance their awareness of the 
different elements of the business. 
Briefings are provided to board 
members on legal, governance, 
compliance and reporting 
developments and to members  
of board committees from time  
to time on matters relevant to  
their work on those committees.
In addition, non-executive directors 
are encouraged to learn about the 
group’s business and to meet 
employees and management 
through site visits and attendance  
at group conferences. In 2015, 
non-executive directors visited 
secure solutions and cash solutions 
operations and staff accommodation 
centres in Dubai, an adult prison 
operated by the group in South 
Africa, a youth training centre 
operated by the group in the UK  
and attended part of the group’s 
senior management conference.
Board performance review
In 2015, Lintstock Limited assisted 
the board with its performance 
review. The review involved detailed 
self-assessment questionnaires being 
completed by board members and 
regular board committee attendees. 
The results of the questionnaires 
were used as the basis for reports 
produced by Lintstock which 
analysed the performance of not 
only the board, but also each board 
committee. These reports were 
considered by the board and each 
of the board’s committees when 
reviewing their performance and 
informed the planning for the 
board’s priorities in 2016. 
Following consideration of 
Lintstock’s report on the  
board’s performance, and after 
consideration of priorities chosen 
by the board and the strategy 
adopted by the company, the 
board has agreed a set of primary 
objectives for its work in 2016, 
which will include:
• Reviewing progress on 
execution of the strategy 
approved by the board
• Monitoring the performance  
of the leadership team, and  
the transition to new leaders  
in certain regions
• Increasing its understanding  
of the regions and their 
businesses and people
• Reviewing the progress of 
growth initiatives and the 
development of the group’s 
technology businesses and  
its global customers
• Maintaining emphasis on  
risk management and  
efficient structures

As part of this review process, 
Lintstock also reported on the 
performance of each of the 
directors and separately on that 
of the chairman. The individual 
director reviews were used as the 
basis for the chairman’s individual 
discussion with each of the directors 
about their performance and any 
training and development needs.  
The report on the chairman was 
used to inform the discussion 
amongst the non-executive directors 
about the chairman which was led 
by the senior independent director 
without the chairman being present.
Lintstock has no connection  
with the company other than 
evaluating the board and its 
committees’ performance.

Governance RELATIONS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS
Corporate governance report continued
Diversity
Diversity is one of the group’s 
organisational strengths and helps  
it operate successfully across a wide 
range of countries and complex 
environments. Knowing its 
importance, the group seeks to  
both foster and harness diversity  
at all levels of the organisation. At 
the front-line it helps the group  
to connect better with the diverse 
range of customers it serves. For 
senior managers, having a global 
mindset and the ability to encourage 
different ideas helps them get the 
best from their teams and stay 
ahead of the competition. In the 
group’s talent development 
programmes these are important 
competencies which are nurtured 
and reviewed through the group’s 
360° feedback process.
For the board, diversity of thinking 
and experience is seen as vital to 
ensure the group can seize the right 
opportunities in each market to 
grow and consider fully the risks  
of doing so. As well as being diverse 
in terms of gender and ethnicity,  
the board also includes members 
who have international assignment 
experience and a mix of both long 
serving and new members. These 
differences help balance industry 
knowledge and expertise with  
fresh perspectives and new market 
understanding. Whilst recruitment  
of any new members to the board 
is always based on merit, diversity  
is a key consideration. In recent 
appointments, assistance has been 
sought from executive search 
agencies which are signatories of the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct to help 
ensure the most diverse talent pools 
are reached and best practice in line 
with Lord Davies’ review is adopted.
The company’s articles of 
association require that all 
continuing directors are subject 
to election by shareholders at 
the next Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment and 
that they submit themselves for 
re-election at least every three 
years and that at least one-third 
of the directors not standing for 
election for the first time stand 
for re-election at each annual 
general meeting. However,  
in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
provision on re-election of 
directors, all the continuing 
directors stand for re-election 
every year.
The company actively seeks to 
engage with shareholders and 
during 2015, senior management 
had contact via one-on-one 
meetings, group meetings and 
telephone conference calls  
with shareholders representing 
over 80% of the share register 
and over 200 institutions.
The Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer presented 
at analyst and investor meetings 
after the preliminary and half-year 
results were announced. These 
presentations also included 
strategy updates and were 
available live via webcast and  
the recording and transcripts are 
available on the group’s website. 
The chairman met with major 
shareholders as part of a general 
governance road show in January 
2016 and reported on those 
meetings to the board. The chair 
of the CSR Committee, Clare 
Spottiswoode, and relevant 
senior executives met with  
a group of socially responsible 
investors in June 2015, updating 
them on the group’s corporate 
responsibility programme. In 
addition, Clare had a number of 
ad hoc meetings with investors 
as did Tim Weller, in his capacity 
as chair of the Audit Committee.
It is intended that all the directors 
(other than John Daly who had a 
prior engagement at the time he 
joined the board) will attend and 
be available to answer questions 
at the company’s Annual General 
Meeting which is an important 
opportunity for communication 
between the board and 
shareholders, particularly private 
shareholders. At the Annual 
General Meeting, the meeting  
is informed of the number of 
proxy votes cast and the same 
information is published 
subsequently on the  
company’s website.
Director re-election
Conflicts authorisation
Each of the directors has 
disclosed to the board any 
situations which apply to them  
as a result of which they have  
or may have an interest which 
conflicts or may conflict with  
the interests of the company. In 
accordance with the company’s 
articles of association, the board 
has authorised such matters. The 
affected directors did not vote 
when their own interests were 
considered. Where the board 
deemed it appropriate, such 
authorisation was given subject 
to certain conditions. The board 
reviews such matters on a 
regular basis.
62 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 BOARD MEETINGS AND 
INFORMATION FLOW
Seven board meetings were held 
during the year ended 31 December 
2015. One of these meetings was  
an extended two-day board and 
strategy session at which, in addition 
to normal board business, the board 
and executive committee met and 
reviewed the group strategy by 
region and by business line, as  
well as considering progress made 
on the existing strategic plan, the 
use of technology by the group  
and its approach to people and 
organisation and values.
Prior to each board meeting, 
comprehensive papers are circulated 
to the directors addressing not only 
the regular agenda items on which 
the executives will report, but also 
details of any matters requiring 
approval or decisions, such as 
significant transactions or events  
or important market issues.
At each meeting the board receives 
reports from the chairman, the chief 
executive, the chief financial officer 
and the company secretary, an HR 
and health and safety report and  
an investor relations report, which 
includes summaries of analysts’ 
reviews and any comments received 
from major shareholders since the 
previous board meeting. The board 
receives regular in-depth presentations 
from regional management and from 
the management of business units 
and the board makes visits to 
business sites from time to time. 
After meetings of the board 
committees, the respective chairmen 
report to the board on the matters 
considered by each committee.
Regular board dinners are held prior 
to board meetings which provide an 
opportunity for the directors to 
discuss topics in an informal 
environment outside the more 
formal setting of the board meeting.
After each board meeting the 
chairman holds a meeting with the 
non-executive directors without  
the executives being present.
There are seven board meetings 
scheduled for the current year, 
including a two-day board and 
strategy meeting.
FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE ASSESSMENT
In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code,  
the board has given consideration  
to whether the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable. The 
preparation of the annual report 
and accounts is coordinated by  
the finance, investor relations and 
company secretariat teams with 
group-wide support and input  
from other areas of the business. 
Comprehensive reviews were 
undertaken at regular intervals 
throughout the process by 
management and other contributing 
personnel within the group. The 
board has reviewed a paper prepared 
by management and has separately 
considered the disclosures in the 
annual report and accounts and  
has concluded that they are fair, 
balanced and understandable. The 
statement required to be given by 
the directors by Code provision 
C.1.1 can be found on page 95.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the company and of how 
those risks might affect the 
prospects of the company. The 
principal risks and their possible 
impact on the company and the 
mitigations taken are set out on 
pages 46-54. The directors 
acknowledge their responsibility  
for the group’s system of risk 
management and internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness 
each year. Through the Audit 
Committee, the board conducted  
a review of the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal control during 
the year. The systems are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate  
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The key features of the group’s risk 
management process, which was  
in place throughout the year under 
review, are: 
• Senior executives in each business 
unit and region use a common 
risk management framework to 
provide a profile of those risks 
which may have an impact on  
the achievement of their  
business objectives.
• Each significant risk is documented 
in the group’s risk management 
system, showing an overview of 
the risk, its owner, how the risk is 
managed, and any improvement 
actions. Risk appetite/tolerance is 
considered in the context of the 
residual (after controls and 
mitigation) risk with a particular 
focus on “High” net risks. T o be 
categorised as “High” a risk  
must meet at least one of  
the following criteria:
 – major impact on the 
achievement of the  
business strategy;
 – serious damage to  
business reputation;
 – severe business disruption;
 – impact of > 5% on operating 
profit or assets.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 63
Governance Corporate governance report continued
• The risk profiles ensure that 
internal audit reviews of the 
adequacy, application and 
effectiveness of risk management 
and internal controls are targeted 
on the key risks.
• Risk management committees 
have been established at regional 
and group level.
• Risk and control self-evaluation 
exercises are undertaken for each 
operating company, for most 
companies at least once a year, 
and updated risk profiles are 
prepared. Similar exercises are 
undertaken as part of the 
integration process for all major 
acquisitions. The results of the 
company risk evaluations are 
assessed by the regional risk 
management committees.
• Both the regional committees and 
the group executive committee 
receive internal audit reports  
and regular reports on risks.  
They monitor the actions taken 
to manage risks. 
The process is carried out under  
the overall supervision of the group 
executive committee. The chief 
executive officer, chief financial 
officer and group director of risk 
and audit report on risks and 
planned mitigations to the Risk 
Committee of the board. The 
process outlined above is reviewed 
regularly by the board through  
its Risk Committee to ensure its 
robustness and suitability to meet 
the group’s needs.
During 2016 the risk management 
improvement plan will focus on:
• enhancing the quality of 
information being provided  
by businesses;
• managing the group’s residual  
risk exposure;
• progress on implementation 
of mitigation action plans; and
• new and emerging risks.
In 2016 the regional risk and audit 
committees will focus on risks 
arising from control weaknesses 
identified through both business unit 
control self-assessments and audits. 
Review of the risks to strategic 
objectives will take place during the 
annual business planning round and 
through trading reviews at least 
twice per year.
Further information about the  
Risk Committee, its remit, work 
during 2015 and its plans for 2016 
can be found on page 67.
The internal control system includes 
clearly defined reporting lines  
and authorisation procedures,  
a comprehensive budgeting and 
monthly reporting system and 
written policies and procedures.
In addition to a wide range of 
internal audit reports, senior 
management also receive assurance 
from other sources including security 
inspections, third party reviews, 
company financial control reviews, 
external audit reports, summaries of 
whistleblowing activity, fraud reports 
and risk and control self-evaluations.
The group has in place appropriate 
internal control and risk management 
systems for financial reporting. The 
group has a single global consolidation 
system which is used for both 
internal management reporting, 
budgeting and planning as well  
as external reporting.
The group has a comprehensive 
budgeting process with the budget 
being approved by the board. 
Forecasts for the year are reported 
quarterly. Actual results at business 
unit, region and group level are 
reported monthly and variances are 
reviewed. A programme of balance 
sheet reviews is included in the 
work of group internal audit. 
The Audit Committee undertakes a 
high-level review of risk management 
and internal control each year. As 
well as the above processes and 
sources of assurance, the Audit 
Committee also considers the 
following year end reporting  
in conducting this review:
• Summary of internal audit work 
including update on all open 
audits with a deficient rating, 
analysis of results by region, 
common audit findings and  
areas identified for improvement 
in internal controls;
• Summary of internal financial 
reviews including significant 
accounting or financial control 
issues and common concerns 
identified;
• Overview of year-end financial 
control status reports completed 
by all businesses confirming 
adherence to group standards 
with any exceptions reported;
• A broad overview of the general 
risk management and internal 
control systems in place during 
the year;
• Review of risk management 
processes and of the group’s 
principal residual risks by the  
Risk Committee of the board; and
• External audit year-end reporting 
on financial controls and 
accounting.
Further information about the Audit 
Committee, its remit, work during 
2015 and its plans for 2016 can  
be found on pages 68-73.
Notwithstanding the significant 
control failings related to the prior 
year restatements described on 
page 72, the Audit Committee  
has confirmed that it is satisfied  
that the group’s risk management 
and internal control processes and 
procedures are appropriate. The 
board has reviewed the group’s risk 
management and internal control 
system for the year to 31 December 
2015 by considering reports from 
the Audit Committee and the Risk 
Committee and has taken account 
of events since 31 December 2015.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The board’s statement on the company’s corporate 
governance performance is based on the September 
2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, which is available on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website (https://www.frc.org.uk).
The Listing Rules require companies to disclose 
whether or not they have complied with all relevant 
provisions in the Code and to report how the main 
principles in the Code have been applied by the 
company. The Code recognises that alternatives to 
following its provisions may be justified in particular 
circumstances if good governance can be achieved  
by other means, provided the reasons are explained 
clearly and carefully. In such cases companies should 
also aim to illustrate how their actual practices are 
consistent with the principle in question, contribute 
to good governance and promote delivery of 
business objectives.
The company complied throughout the year  
under review with the provisions of the Code. The 
Corporate governance report, together with the 
Audit committee report, the Risk committee report 
and the Directors’ remuneration report, describe 
how the board has applied these provisions. 
64 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Refreshing the board
Two directors retired from the 
board in 2015; Grahame Gibson  
and Mark Seligman. The Nomination 
Committee and the board concluded 
that it was not necessary to appoint 
a new executive director, but that  
a non-executive appointment was 
required. Accordingly, John Daly  
was appointed by the board in June.  
The Nomination Committee was 
assisted by Zygos LLP with the 
process it undertook to fill this role.
In May 2016, Mark Elliott and Adam 
Crozier will retire from the board.

Committee) and Adam sits on the 
Audit and Nomination Committees. 
The Nomination Committee has 
given consideration to how these 
roles will be filled as well as to the 
balance of expertise and experience 
available to the board after Mark’s 
and Adam’s departures. Accordingly, 
John Daly has agreed to take on the 
Remuneration Committee 
chairmanship and JCA Partners LLP 
has been appointed to assist the 
Nomination Committee to recruit 
two more non-executive directors.
Neither Zygos nor JCA has any 
connection with the company other 
than as provider of recruitment 
consultancy services to the 
Nomination Committee, save  
that JCA has in the past also  
provided a benchmarking service  
for a senior management role.
Mr Elliott’s term of appointment 
expired during 2015 and the 
committee recommended to  
the board that his appointment be 
extended after consideration of his 
independence, commitment to the 
role, his other commitments and the 
experience and qualities he brings 
to the board. Mr Elliott did not 
participate in the committee’s 
deliberations on this matter.
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee  
is responsible for making 
recommendations to the board  
on appointments and on maintaining 
a balance of skills and experience  
on the board and its committees. 
Succession planning for the board is 
a matter which is devolved primarily 
to the Nomination Committee, 
although the committee’s deliberations 
are reported to and debated by  
the full board. The board itself also 
reviews more general succession 
planning for the senior management 
of the group.
The committee’s terms of reference 
are available at w.w.w.g4s.com/
investors.
Succession planning
The entire board has considered 
succession planning for the senior 
management of the group  
during 2015 and, in addition,  
the Nomination Committee  
gave further consideration to  
“ The Nomination Committee continued 
the work it began in 2014 when it 
initiated a process to find a new non-
executive director. This resulted in 
John Daly’s appointment in June 2015. 
Following analysis of the needs of the 
board, a further process has begun to 
find two more non-executive directors 
to complement the range of skills and 
experience which the board has  
already and to replace Mark Elliott  
and Adam Crozier later this year.”

Committee performance
The performance of the 
Nomination Committee was 
reviewed as part of the process 
undertaken by each of the board 
committees with assistance from 
Lintstock. The Nomination 
Committee’s performance was 
determined to have been satisfactory, 
but areas of increased focus were 
identified and have been included  
as priorities for the committee’s 
work in 2016.
Priorities for 2016
The committee’s primary specific 
focus in 2016, along with that of  
the board as whole, will be the 
recruitment of two new non-
executive directors, refreshing the 
composition of certain of the board 
committees and appointing a new 
Senior Independent Director. It will 
also ensure that longer-term succession 
planning remains a subject which  
is given due attention at all levels.

reviewing the activities of the 
executives who have responsibility 
for CSR matters. The CSR Committee 
 “ With operations in around 100 countries 
and 610,000 employees, we are acutely

on ensuring that our CSR priorities  
are an integral part of doing business. 
 2015 saw the launch of our new and 
enhanced whistleblowing process and 
we conducted a review of our corporate 
values against our business and CSR 
priorities. This will result in a re-launch 
of our values to the organisation and 
our stakeholders during 2016. Sadly, 46

of the materiality exercise, which  
will inform the group’s future CSR 
strategy and CSR reporting, are

Medway STC
On 30 December 2015, G4S 
Children’s Services (UK) referred  
a number of serious allegations of 
inappropriate staff conduct at the 
Medway Secure Training Centre to 
Medway’s Local Authority Designated 
Officer for safeguarding children 
(LADO), the Y outh Justice Board  
of England and Wales and the Ministry 
of Justice (MoJ). The allegations 
centred on the unnecessary use  
of force and the use of improper 
language. The LADO, in conjunction 
with the police and other relevant 
authorities, commenced an 
independent investigation into  
the allegations.
This matter was discussed in detail 
by the CSR Committee as well as  
by the board, which made enquiries 
about the root causes of these 
incidents, the appropriateness  
and completeness of the remedial 
action plan and considered how  
the learnings from this event could  
drive an improvement of the control 
environment across the organisation. 
The board was satisfied that,

Paul Spence 
Risk Committee Chairman
Responsibilities 
The Risk Committee advises the 
board on the group’s overall risk 
appetite, develops the group’s risk 
management strategy, advises the 
Audit Committee and the board on 
risk exposures and reviews the level 
of risk within the group and assesses 
the effectiveness of the group’s  
risk management systems. The 
committee’s composition ensures 
that a broad-ranging set of skills and 
experience come together to look 
at how the group manages risk in 
the business. The Risk Committee 
also considers major contracts 
which require board approval  
due to their size or level of risk. 
Further details can be found in  
the committee’s terms of reference 
available at www.g4s.com/investors.
“ As announced at the beginning of the 
year, I succeeded John Connolly as 
chairman of the Risk Committee in 
January 2016. John remains a member 
of the committee and I am very 
grateful for his continued support. 
Since its inception over two years 
ago, the Risk Committee has led a 
programme of improvement in risk 
management quality across the group 
through changes to the governance 
structures and processes. Our focus for 
2016 is to place more accountability 
for risk management where it is most 
effective, i.e. at operating unit level. T o 
this end, the Risk Committee will now 
focus on improving the understanding 
and compliance by operating unit 
management teams of those controls 
which have the most material impact 
on the management of our key risks.”
Risk governance remained a strong 
area of focus during 2015 with the 
Risk Committee receiving regular 
reports on the performance of 
regional risk and audit committees 
and the continuing process of 
embedding enterprise risk 
management standards. Having 
defined the group’s risk appetite  
and developed a more precise  
and formal risk appetite statement, 
which was approved by the board  
in 2014, the risk appetite statement 
was disseminated across the group. 
This allowed comparison of 
reported residual risk against risk 
appetite. During the year, the Risk 
Committee received regular updates 
on significant residual risks and 
carried out detailed reviews of

on improving them, as well as ensuring 
that health and safety and compliance 
continues to be a major focus.

fulfil the committee’s responsibilities. 
Each member of the Audit 
Committee brings significant and 
relevant experience gained at senior 
management level. Their skills and 
experience are set out on pages  
56 and 57. The Audit Committee’s 
chairman, Tim Weller, is considered  
by the board to be the member of 
the Audit Committee with recent 
and relevant financial experience.
Audit Committee meetings are 
attended by the chief financial officer, 
the group financial controller, the 
company secretary, the group director 
of risk and audit and representatives 
of the group’s external auditor. The 
chairman of the board and the chief 
executive also attend meetings from 
time to time in agreement with the 
chairman of the committee. At the 
end of each meeting, a private session 
is held by the Audit Committee  
with representatives of the group’s 
external auditor without members  
of the executive management team 
being present.
After each meeting, the chairman  
of the committee reports to the 
board on the matters which have 
been discussed.
Responsibilities
The committee makes sure there is 
effective governance of the group’s 
financial reporting and internal 
controls to ensure the integrity of  
its financial statements and adequacy 
of related disclosures and assists the 
board in relation to its consideration 
of whether or not the annual report 
of the group is fair, balanced and 
understandable. The committee also 
has oversight of the performance of 
both the internal audit function and 
the external auditor. Further details

addition, the growth strategy risk 
was addressed as part of the board 
strategy sessions in October. Further 
details of the significant risks and 
uncertainties facing the business  
are set out on pages 48 to 54.
Contract risk management  
remains a key area of focus for  
the committee which undertakes  
a review of a major contract at each 
of its meetings. The Risk Committee 
also considered proposed bids  
for contracts that required board 
approval due to their size or level 
of risks, leading to a thorough 
assessment of the risks associated 
with the proposed transactions.
Committee performance
The assessment of the committee’s 
performance in 2015 showed  
that the committee continued  
to operate effectively with the 
chairman’s leadership remaining 
highly rated. It was also reported 
that the committee was effective in 
providing oversight of the controls 
in place in respect of significant risks. 
Priorities for 2016 
In 2016, the Risk Committee will 
continue to drive greater alignment 
of the risk management policies and 
procedures with group strategy and 
support the further embedding of  
risk in strategic planning. Ensuring clear 
accountability for risk management 
across the business line will also  
be an area of significant focus. 
Audit Committee report
68 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
The primary issues considered by the committee in the 2015 financial statements, and how these were  
addressed, were:
ONEROUS CONTRACT PROVISIONS
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING
Description
The group delivers certain  
long-term outsourcing services  
that are complex in nature. Some  
of those contracts may become loss 
making and lead to a position where 
future net unavoidable losses over 
their life are expected. This requires 
determining the net present value  
of future estimated losses to calculate 
an onerous contract provision. The 
identification and measurement  
of any related provision requires 
significant judgement, given the 
often extended time periods 
involved, and the number of 
variables that are not all within 
management’s control.
During the year, management 
operated the enhanced processes 
and controls introduced in 2014, 
including a review by the chief 
financial officer on a quarterly basis 
of the top 25 contracts and those 
with low profitability for each region, 
and the 360 degree contract review 
on the largest and most complex 
contracts, covering financial, legal, 
reputational and operational risk 
criteria, attended by a group 
executive committee member. 
Details of the outcome of the 
assessment of contract provisions 
are set out in the Chief Financial 
Officer’s review on pages 96  
to 105.
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the quarterly report summarising 
the results of the top 25 contracts 
and those with low profitability. The 
committee also reviewed a report 
summarising the conclusions from 
the 360 degree contract review.
In addition, the committee reviewed 
and challenged in respect of each 
onerous contract (and in particular 
the Compass and legacy UK 
government contracts), the 
underpinning assumptions provided 
by management and inquired  
about the judgements made, the 
robustness of the assumptions,  
the sensitivities to changes in the 
assumptions and the disclosure 
provided in relation to the key 
material judgements.
Conclusion
The Audit Committee was  
satisfied that the provisions and 
disclosure as at 31 December  
2015 were appropriate.
Description
The total value of the group’s 
goodwill as at 31 December 2015 
was £1.828bn and relates to a 
significant number of historical 
acquisitions. 
The estimation of the recoverable 
amount of goodwill supported  
by the group’s cash generating  
units requires significant judgement, 
primarily in relation to the achievability 
of long-term business plans and 
future cash flows which is dependent 
on circumstances both within and 
outside of management’s control,  
in relation to the discount rates 
adjusted to reflect risks specific to 
individual assets used and in relation 
to the macro-economic assumptions 
and related modelling assumptions 
underlying the valuation process. 
As a result of the annual review of 
the carrying value of goodwill, £66m 
goodwill was impaired. The balance 
remaining at the 2015 financial  
year end was £1.828bn (see note 
18 to the consolidated financial 
statements). Details of the group’s 
goodwill judgements, impairment 
test and related disclosures are 
provided in notes 4 and 18. 
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the methodology and challenged  
the results of the impairment  
test prepared by management. 
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the assumptions used in relation  
to long-term growth, resulting 
headroom and sensitivities applied 
by management. In addition, these 
results were considered against 
alternative valuation bases such  
as reference to aquisitions or 
disposals of similar assets.
For those businesses that are 
expected to be sold as part of  
the strategic portfolio management 
programme, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the recoverable value  
on the basis of expected sale price 
less costs to sell, whereas for those 
portfolio businesses that are expected 
to be closed, goodwill was fully 
impaired and the recoverable  
value of the assets was considered.
The Audit Committee finally 
considered the adequacy of the 
disclosures provided, particularly  
for the case of cash generating units 
where changes in key assumptions 
could give rise to an impairment.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied with  
the carrying value of goodwill  
and related disclosures as at  
31 December 2015.

Governance Audit Committee report continued
TAXATION
RISK OF ACCOUNTING ERRORS AND MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS
Description
The group operates in around 100 
countries and is therefore subject  
to numerous tax inspections in the 
ordinary course of business. In some 
instances these may result in claims 
being raised by tax authorities. In 
many of the jurisdictions in which 
the group operates, tax legislation  
is not always applied consistently. 
Any claims are handled by the local 
legal entity in the first instance. More 
complex cases are reviewed by the 
group tax function and provisions, 
where necessary, are made based on 
the best estimate of the likely outcome.
The group recognises deferred  
tax assets in respect of temporary 
timing differences mainly in relation 
to pension arrangements, fixed 
assets and carried forward losses. 
These losses arose largely as a  
result of settlements with the UK 
Government in 2013 and 2014 
in respect of the Olympics and 
Electronic Monitoring contracts  
as well as from trading losses from 
onerous contracts. At 31 December 
2015, total deferred tax assets were 
£187m (2014: £192m). Recognising 
such assets requires an assessment 
of their likely utilisation recovery 
which includes an assessment of the 
taxable profits expected to be made 
in each of the relevant jurisdictions.
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the group’s approach to taxation 
and approved the adoption of a  
tax policy which complies with the  
CBI’s seven tax principles for the UK. 
The committee also reviewed 
information prepared by management 
in relation to existing or potential 
tax exposures, the adequacy of the 
provisions recorded and their 
treatment and disclosure in  
the financial statements. 
The committee reviewed 
information prepared by 
management supporting the 
recoverability of deferred tax  
assets and considered the period  
of time over which these would  
be recovered and made enquiries  
of the external auditors on the 
appropriateness of the group’s  
tax position. 
The committee considered the 
group’s enhanced disclosures 
recognising that the Financial 
Reporting Council has been 
undertaking a thematic review  
in this area.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied  
with the group’s approach to tax, 
and with the recoverability of the 
deferred tax assets and disclosure  
in respect of tax exposures.
Description
The group operates in around 100 
countries and has over 700 legal 
entities with a significant number of 
local financial systems and processes. 
This leads to an inherently diverse 
set of processes and controls that 
rely on local capabilities to implement 
and operate the controls. As set out 
on page 47, the group has adopted 
a three lines of defence model to 
control and manage risks across  
the group. 
The group has continued to  
make significant investment in 
strengthening capability in finance, 
internal audit and risk management, 
and has introduced stronger internal 
controls and group oversight to 
mitigate these risks. These include 
monthly reviews of the quality of 
earnings, a comprehensive internal 
audit plan and a regular cycle of 
reviews of local business units or 
country balance sheets and controls. 
The appointment of a new external 
auditor has also provided a fresh 
perspective on the state of the 
control environment.
During the year, material errors were 
identified in relation to prior years. 
These were related to historical 
revenue recognition and lease 
accounting practices in Denmark, to 
the integrity of historical accounting 
records in the Africa region and 
acquisitions and disposals accounting 
in North America dating back to  
the period 2007 to 2014 which  
are further described on page 72. 
These corrections do not affect the 
future cash generation of the group.
Management performed extensive 
work and concluded that these 
represented material errors  
rather than changes in estimates. 
Management discussed the nature 
of these errors with each regional 
finance director to assess whether 
similar errors might have been made 
elsewhere in the group, to ensure 
learnings and corrective actions were 
shared and to ensure the right focus 
on the relevant controls is applied.
Action taken
The committee reviewed the overall 
control environment of the group, 
and monitored progress against the 
approved group internal audit plan 
for the year, the different financial 
control and balance sheet review 
processes and the output of the 
whistleblowing process. 
The committee also reviewed 
progress made on reducing reliance 
on manual controls by developing 
and integrating finance and 
operational systems across the 
group. In addition, the committee 
received regular updates on the 
implementation of different financial 
control processes including internal 
audit plans and results, the 
simplification of the controls 
framework, training and up-skilling  
of capabilities across the group, as 
well as the regular reports from the 
newly appointed external auditor.
In respect of the prior year 
restatements, the committee 
reviewed in detail papers prepared 
by management explaining the 
issues identified as well as the 
corrective action put in place to 
prevent re-occurrence of such 
errors. The committee discussed 
these issues with representatives  
of the external auditor to satisfy 
themselves that the adjustments 
were material errors rather than 
changes in estimate and to assess 
the appropriateness of the 
subsequent actions taken by 
management to provide assurance 
that there were not similar errors 
elsewhere across the group. 
70 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 RISK OF ACCOUNTING ERRORS AND MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CONTINUED
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied  
that the prior year errors were 
sufficiently material to require a 
restatement of comparative financial 
information in the consolidated 
financial statements. The committee 
noted the root cause of the errors 
and confirmed that management 
had shared the learnings across the 
finance leadership team and that  
the relevant controls are being 
strengthened to mitigate against  
the recurrence of similar errors.  
The committee also acknowledged 
the progress made in relation to the 
strengthening of the controls across 
the group and the plans in place to 
reduce the number of systems and 
to reduce the reliance on manual 
controls across the group. 
Notwithstanding the significant 
control weaknesses that allowed 
these errors to occur, the 
committee was satisfied that the 
group’s risk management and 
internal control processes and 
procedures are appropriate.
PORTFOLIO RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME
Description
The group has continued to make 
progress in its portfolio management 
programme announced in 2013, 
identifying operations in a further 38 
businesses or countries to be sold 
or ceased. Given that the size of the 
operations in these businesses or 
countries is individually not significant 
for the group, they do not meet the 
definition under IFRS 5 to be 
classified as discontinued operations. 
Management presents them separately 
in the adjusted performance 
measures in the preliminary results 
announcement and in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s review and 
provides a detailed reconciliation  
to the IFRS financial statements. 
Management classifies these entities 
within assets held for sale when it is 
expected that the carrying amount 
of these entities will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction 
in the next 12 months.
During 2015, 10 businesses related 
to the portfolio management 
programme were sold or closed.  
In the first two months of 2016,  
a further five businesses have  
been sold.
Action taken
The committee reviewed progress 
made on the portfolio management 
programme against the group’s 
strategy announced in November 
2013 and considered whether  
the businesses that management 
had identified for sale or closure 
were in line with the strategy.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied that  
the adjusted performance measures 
were both consistent with the prior 
year and presented in a balanced way 
and that the information provided for 
stakeholders to reconcile adjusted 
performance measures to IFRS 
results was appropriate.
GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY RISK
Description
The group has net debt of £1,782m. 
The group’s business plan supports a 
net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times or 
lower over the next 12-24 months. 
The group is subject to financial 
covenants related to its committed 
bank facilities and the private loan 
notes are subject to one financial 
covenant based on net debt to 
EBITDA ratio, where net debt to 
EBITDA should be lower than  
3.5 times. Non-compliance with  
the covenant could lead to an 
acceleration of debt maturities.
Consideration of the going concern 
risk is a fundamental responsibility  
of the board and the Audit 
Committee has given this matter  
its full attention. The going concern 
assertion has a significant impact  
on the financial statements in terms 
of both the valuation of assets and 
liabilities held and the presentation 
of assets and liabilities as non-
current. The Audit Committee  
has taken due consideration of  
the guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council ‘Going Concern 
and Liquidity Risk – guidance for 
Directors of UK Companies 2009’. 
Action taken
The committee reviewed the 
group’s forecasts of cash flow  
and net debt, taking into account 
reasonable risk sensitivities as well  
as the financing facilities available to 
the group; noting that no significant 
bonds or placements were due to 
mature within the next 12 months 
and that in early 2015 the group 
had renewed its revolving credit 
finance facility for six years. 
The committee also reviewed 
compliance with covenants, the 
availability of headroom in relation 
to those covenants, reasonable 
downside scenarios considering  
the risk profile of the group, both 
for going concern purposes and in 
the context of the three year viability 
statement included on page 46.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied that  
it was appropriate for the group  
to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting in the financial 
statements and recommended  
the same to the board.

Governance SPECIFIC ITEMS
Description
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the treatment of items considered 
as specific items that are separately 
disclosed by virtue of their size, 
nature or incidence. Management 
prepared documentation to support 
these items and the disclosure 
proposed in the financial statements.
Action taken
The Audit Committee reviewed  
and challenged, in light of the 
guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in December 
2013, the disclosures prepared by 
management in relation to specific 
items, considered that the nature  
of these items was within the group’s 
accounting policies that were being 
applied consistently from year to 
year and that these items included 
both debits and credits in a  
balanced manner.
The Audit Committee also 
considered the recognition in the 
current year of future unavoidable 
losses related to onerous contracts 
as specific items and determined 
that onerous contract provisions 
would only be classified as specific 
items if they were deemed to be 
material to the group’s underlying 
performance. The Audit Committee 
set a threshold amount below  
which onerous contracts would  
not be classified as specific items.
The committee also requested 
information from management to 
satisfy itself that changes in estimates 
related to items that were classified 
as specific items were consistently 
treated for both increases and 
decreases provisions.
Conclusion
The committee was satisfied that 
the group’s accounting policies  
have been applied consistently  
and that the designation of specific 
items was subject to objective and 
balanced criteria and was appropriate 
to give an improved understanding 
of the continuing operations of  
the group. 
Audit Committee report continued
Internal control
In the last three years, under the 
leadership of the chief financial 
officer, the group has had a 
heightened focus on improving 
systems of internal control and risk 
management for financial reporting. 
The main features of these control 
systems include clearly defined 
reporting lines and authorisation 
procedures, a comprehensive 
budgeting and monthly reporting 
system, written policies and 
procedures and the use of a single 
global consolidation system for both 
internal management reporting, 
budgeting and planning as well  
as external reporting. The group 
budget is approved by the board.  
A regular update is provided by the 
group CFO on the outlook. Actual 
results at business unit, region and 
group level are reported monthly 
and variances reviewed. A programme 
of business internal financial reviews 
(IFRs) is performed by the finance 
team from either region or group  
to check the accuracy of financial 
reporting and compliance with  
the group finance manual. 
The system is designed to ensure 
the integrity of financial reporting 
and the committee’s responsibility  
is to perform an annual review to 
consider whether these internal 
controls remain effective. The 
committee does this primarily 
through receiving reports from 
management, the internal audit 
function and the external auditor. 
During the year, significant progress 
was made in continuing to strengthen 
the capabilities in finance, internal 
audit and risk management and to 
improve insight into the financial 
performance of business units  
at a country level. These insights 
identified significant failings in 
controls related to material 
accounting errors in three areas  
that have led to the restatement  
of the 2014 financial statements:
• The revenue recognition policy 
previously applied in respect  
of the supply and installation of 
alarm systems in Europe, together 
with the underlying assumptions 
used in 2007 at inception of 
certain related sale and leaseback 
transactions entered into until 2013, 
were incorrect. These led to the 
incorrect timing of recognition  
of profit on installation of those 
alarm systems with upfront gains 
being recognised instead of being  
deferred over the life of the lease 
and to certain leases being 
classified as operating rather  
than as finance leases; 
• A number of legacy control 
weaknesses identified in the  
Africa region led management  
to perform a full review of the 
balance sheet in all countries of 
the region from which prior year 
errors were identified, mainly 
relating to cash reconciliations, 
under-accrual of employee and 
customer-related liabilities, incorrect 
classification of finance leases as 
operating leases and expenses 
incorrectly capitalised; and
• A number of errors in respect  
of the calculation of goodwill  
on certain acquisitions, gains and 
losses on certain disposals and 
related tax balances in North 
America between 2007 and 2014 
mainly resulting in goodwill being 
overstated as at 1 January 2014 
and at 31 December 2014 and 
profit on disposals in 2014  
being understated.
The committee reviewed in detail 
papers prepared by management 
explaining the issues identified as 
well as the corrective action put in 
place to prevent re-occurrence of 
such errors which included sharing 
72 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 the findings with the group finance 
leadership team and cascading it 
down to business level, confirming 
that these issues were not repeated 
in other locations, putting in tighter 
controls and group review when 
entering into material new leases, 
providing ‘master classes’ and 
updates on the group finance 
manual as well as integrating further 
the operations of the group tax 
department with the local tax 
departments. In relation to the 
broader failure of financial controls 
and reconciliations in the Africa 
region, the Audit Committee 
observed that this had been 
identified through the strengthening 
of the financial controls and 
organisation through specific actions 
such as the appointment of a new 
regional finance director, a new 
regional financial controller, and  
12 new finance directors during 
2015, as well as from a fresh review 
from the new external auditors.
The committee acknowledged the 
strengthening of the controls and 
the 2016 plans which include a 
targeted group internal audit plan 
for the areas where significant 
failures have taken place, a review  
of the group’s financial control 
framework with a view to simplifying 
it to key essential controls to ensure 
these operate effectively, training 
programmes and up-skilling 
capabilities. The committee also 
considered the plans that are being 
implemented by management to 
reduce reliance on manual controls, 
mainly in respect to implementation 
and integration of new financial 
systems over the longer term.
Further details on internal controls 
are set out on page 47. The Audit 
Committee confirmed to the board 
that it is satisfied that the group’s 
risk management and internal 
control processes and procedures 
are appropriate.
Internal audit
During 2015 the group internal 
audit team focused on taking  
a more risk based approach to 
auditing, with the goal of focusing 
local management on the most 
material control issues given their 
specific local environment. In 2016 
the internal audit team will spend  
a minimum of 20% of their time 
providing coaching and consulting  
to business units with control  
issues in order to seek to prevent 
recurrence of control failures.
External auditor
In the summer of 2014, the 
company put the external audit 
engagement for the 2015 financial 
year out to tender. The process 
resulted in the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) as the group’s external 
auditor for the 2015 financial year  
at the company’s AGM on 4 June 
2015. A tri-partite transition plan 
setting out the agreed principles, 
framework and timeline to ensure 
the efficient and effective transfer of 
the external audit arrangement from 
the previous group auditor KPMG 
Audit plc to PwC was put into place.
Non-audit services
T o ensure that the independence  
of the audit is not compromised, the 
committee has put a policy in place 
for the non-audit services that can be 
provided by the external auditor, the 
relevant approval process for certain 
services and those services the 
auditor is prohibited from providing. 
In essence, the external auditor is 
prohibited from providing services 
that could create a conflict of 
interest, result in the audit firm 
auditing its own work or result in  
the performance of management 
functions. The committee has 
pre-approved certain services which 
can be provided by the auditor 
subject to specified fee limits above 
which further approval is required.  
All other services would require 
prior approval by the committee. 
Every year the Audit Committee 
reviews its policy on the provision  
of non-audit services by the  
external auditor. 
Non-audit services include tax 
compliance and tax services. The 
Audit Committee has reconsidered  
the company’s policy in this area in 
the context of the new EU guidance 
on non-audit services. Whilst PwC 
do provide such services the vast 
majority of tax compliance and  
tax advisory services undertaken  
by PwC are deemed insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate 
and were either terminated or 
transitioned to other providers by 
30 June 2015. A specific exception 
was made for certain insignificant 
pre-existing services where 
transition presented significant 
business risks or difficulties and  
a final termination date of 30  
June 2016 was established for  
these services. 
The provision of any non-audit 
services by the audit firm must,  
in any event, comply with the 
requirements in that regard of  
the Auditing Practices Board. 
Details of the fees paid for audit 
services, audit-related services and 
non-audit services can be found in 
note 10 to the financial statements. 
Effectiveness of the external 
auditor
A combination of formal and 
informal processes are used in the 
assessment of the effectiveness of 
the external audit process. A formal 
questionnaire is completed at the 
end of the audit by members of  
the Audit Committee, group finance 
department and the finance directors 
of significant operations across the 
group and the output is reviewed  
by the Audit Committee. The 
assessment of the external  
audit concluded that it remained 
effective and the external auditor  
is independent. 
Committee performance 
The assessment of the committee’s 
performance conducted as part  
of the board review process with 
Lintstock’s assistance showed that 
the committee remains effective at 
discharging its responsibilities and  
in particular in reviewing the quality  
of the group’s financial reporting.
CMA Order Compliance
The committee confirms that the 
company has complied with the 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities)  
Order 2004.

Governance THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Mark Elliott
Remuneration Committee Chairman
Over the previous two years the 
Remuneration Committee had 
consulted with shareholders on  
the company’s remuneration policy 
and a proposed new Long Term 
Incentive Plan, which was approved 
by shareholders in 2014. In 2015  
the Remuneration Committee  
has concentrated on ensuring the 
policies and reward schemes which 
are in place operate in a way which 
properly reflects and rewards 
sustainable value creation.
We have again looked carefully at 
what financial measures are most 
appropriate for the group’s strategy 
and at those items which should  
be included in or excluded from  
the underlying performance metrics 
used to determine the extent to 
which executives’ performance has 
achieved the development of the 
group for its stakeholders.
I will retire from the board,  
and therefore as Remuneration 
Committee chairman, at the 
conclusion of the 2016 AGM. I am 
pleased to say that John Daly has 
agreed to take over the role. Under 
John’s leadership, the committee 
plans to review the remuneration 
policy during 2016 since that policy 
will require shareholder approval in 
2017 and, as part of that review, the 
committee will consider whether 
the remuneration arrangements  
for the group can be improved  
or simplified. For any proposed 
significant changes to the policy, the 
committee will consult with major 
shareholders prior to the 2017 AGM.
How performance is reflected 
in remuneration outcomes
The committee looked carefully  
at the underlying performance of 
the on-going business of the group 
in determining the appropriate 
measures of performance in the 
year and over the longer period 
applicable to the performance share 
plan period which ended in 2015.
In order to properly reflect that 
underlying performance, the 
committee has taken account of 
changes to the business over the 
relevant measurement period and 
made adjustments where appropriate 
to enable an equivalent comparison. 
So, for example, the performance 
against which the earnings in 2015 
was measured was adjusted to take 
into account the effects of the 
“ I am pleased to present the directors’ 
remuneration report for 2015. As is 
mentioned elsewhere in this annual 
report, 2015 was a year of good 
progress in implementing the strategy 
which the new management team 
developed towards the end of 2013.  
The year has not been without its 
challenges, but the direction of travel  
is right and the underlying performance 
of the business is reflected in the 
remuneration outcomes which are 
described in this section of the report.”
capital restructuring which resulted 
from the share placement in 2013, 
foreign exchange rate movements 
over the period of the plan, 
discontinued and acquired 
businesses, changes in pensions  
and other accounting treatments  
and provisions for certain legacy 
onerous contracts. The intention 
was to ensure that the measurement 
of the actual and targeted performance 
was done on a like for like basis.  
The effect of some changes was  
to reduce the target, whilst others 
increased it. Where adjustments 
were made for new onerous contract 
provisions, the accounting provision 
taken in the year in relation to future 
losses would only have effect in 
relation to those future years.
The 2015 annual bonus outcome 
for the CEO and CFO was 70%  
and 65% of maximum bonus 
opportunity respectively, which 
reflected a 14% growth in 
underlying earnings for 2015.
Scoring for non-financial metrics 
applicable to the annual bonus for 
the CEO and CFO was 67% and 
33% of maximum respectively  
(with the maximum contributing 
15% of maximum bonus potential  
in each case). Grahame Gibson did 
not have non-financial objectives 
given his change in role and 
subsequent retirement. Full details  
of the bonus outcomes for each of 
the executive directors are set out 
on pages 84 and 85.
Annual bonus due to the CEO and 
CFO in excess of 50% of maximum 
was deferred for a period of three 
years and paid in G4S shares under 
the plan rules. In addition, the CEO 
and CFO volunteered to translate 
immediately the entire cash element 
(net of tax) of their annual bonus 
payments into G4S shares which  
will contribute towards their minimum 
shareholding requirements. As a 
result of these awards they have 
both increased considerably their 
outright shareholdings as well as 
their interests in deferred shares.
We have reviewed whether the 
adjustments to prior years’ results 
would have resulted in any change 
to the bonus calculation for existing 
or former executive directors and 
were satisfied that no claw-back  
is applicable as a result, since the 
relevant performance measures 
would still have been satisfied.
Directors’ remuneration report
74 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 In relation to the 2013 performance 
share plan which vests this year, the 
measurement of EPS performance 
was normalised to allow for a 
proper like for like comparison 
between the business as it was in 
2012 (the baseline year) and the 
business as it was at the time of 
vesting as described above. The  
half of the award which was 
measured against total shareholder 
returns did not earn any award and 
overall 26.5% of the total award 
vested based on performance over 
the three year period from 2013 to 
2015. The awards to past directors 
have been subject to review of the 
applicable legal and performance 
criteria, following which it was 
concluded that the pro-rated 
awards were payable.
How we implemented  
our remuneration policy
When operating the policy, the 
committee takes account of the 
overall approach and structure of 
employee reward across the group 
and pay decisions for the wider 
workforce as well as the results of 
appropriate benchmarking data. It  
is the committee’s intention that  
pay should reflect the responsibility 
attached to the role fulfilled, individual 
performance and other relevant 
market information. The remuneration 
available must allow the group to 
attract, retain and motivate directors 
and other senior executives who 
will lead the group in the long-term 
interest of its stakeholders.
Base salary reviews
As reported last year, the CEO’s  
and CFO’s salaries were increased 
by 3% with effect from 1 January 
2015 and Grahame Gibson’s base 
pay for 2015 remained unchanged.
For 2016, following a review,  
the CEO’s base pay has been 
increased by 1% and that for  
the CFO remains unchanged.  
This review took account of  
market salary levels as well as  
salary increases elsewhere in the 
group. The increase awarded to  
the CEO was somewhat lower  
than the average percentage 
increase applicable to group 
employees based in the UK. 
Mr Gibson retired in October 2015.
The committee is also responsible 
for setting the fees for the chairman 
of the board. The committee 
conducted a review in 2015  
and concluded that no increase 
should be made, but confirmed  
its intention to continue to ensure 
that the position was rewarded 
appropriately and that the 
chairman’s fee should continue  
to be reviewed regularly.
How we operate our  
annual bonus plan
For 2015, the committee decided  
to operate the annual bonus with 
financial measures of performance 
of underlying group earnings and 
underlying group operating cash 
flow before capex and the same 
measures will be applied in 2016.  
The non-financial measures of 
performance are aligned with the 
group’s strategic objectives. The 
proportion of maximum bonus 
attributable to non-financial 
measures was set at 15% for both 
the CEO and CFO in 2015, but  
for 2016, the CFO’s non-financial 
measure will contribute up to 30% 
of maximum bonus opportunity, 
with a consequent decrease in the 
proportion of the annual bonus  
that will depend on group financial 
performance. The committee 
concluded that it was appropriate  
to bring the arrangements for the 
CFO into line with those applicable 
to other senior functional executives 
given the significant element of his 
role which will be involved with 
strategic projects which are not 
purely financial.
Our long-term incentive plan
The long-term incentive plan 
introduced in 2014 had 
overwhelming support from 
shareholders and will continue  
to operate unchanged in 2016.
UK Code compliance
The committee had in place malus 
and clawback before their introduction 
became a feature of the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code. These 
arrangements are explained on page 
80. The committee is also conscious 
of the Code’s requirement that 
executive directors’ remuneration 
should be designed to promote the 
long-term success of the company – 
and that performance-related elements 
of remuneration should be transparent, 
stretching and applied rigorously.
Consulting with our shareholders
I will be available to answer questions 
and listen to the views of our 
shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Retirements
In October 2014 it was announced 
that Grahame Gibson would retire 
from the board at the company’s 
Annual General Meeting in 2015. 
Mr Gibson therefore stood down 
from the board on 4 June 2015, but 
continued to be paid in accordance 
with the terms of his employment 
contract until he retired on 20 
October 2015. Mr Gibson remained 
eligible for annual bonus for 2015  
as well as PSP and LTIP awards in 
which he participated, in each case 
pro-rated to his retirement date.
As reported previously, Trevor 
Dighton stepped down from the 
board at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting and retired from the 
company on 30 July 2014. Mr Dighton 
remained eligible to receive an 
award under the 2013 PSP , pro-rated 
for the period of his employment to 
30 July 2014. Details of the award 
which vested are set out on page 87.
Mark Seligman stepped down from 
the Remuneration Committee when 
he retired from the board at the AGM 
in 2015 and, as mentioned above, I 
will retire from the board (and leave 
the Remuneration Committee) at the 
conclusion of the 2016 AGM. John 
Daly will succeed me as chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee.

Governance The committee’s performance
The committee’s formal 
performance review carried out  
at the end of 2015 concluded that 
the committee was effective and  
its performance was rated highly 
overall. Suggestions were made  
for improving the committee’s 
performance further and as a 
consequence the committee will 
review and, with the engagement  
of the executive directors, seek  
to simplify the group’s incentive 
arrangements for its most senior 
employees whilst supporting the 
recruitment and retention of top 
class talent and measuring the 
linkage between value creation  
and incentivisation.
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee  
is responsible for all elements of  
the remuneration of the executive 
directors, other members of the 
group executive committee and  
the chairman of the board.
It also agrees with the board the 
framework and policy for the 
remuneration of other senior 
managers of the group and reviews 
and recommends to the board the 
remuneration of the company secretary .
In determining remuneration policy, 
the committee takes into account  
a variety of legal and regulatory 
requirements, and the relevant 
provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The committee also determines 
policy on the duration, notice period 
and termination payments under  
the contracts with the executive 
directors, with a view to recognising 
service to the company whilst

Remuneration Policy
The company’s remuneration policy for directors was set out in full in the company’s 2013 Annual Report and 
Accounts on pages 66 to 72 and can also be found on the company’s website. It was approved by shareholders 
at the company’s Annual General Meeting held on 5 June 2014 with 98.38% of all votes cast in favour. The policy 
refers to a long term incentive plan which was also approved at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, with 96.88% 
of all votes cast in favour. The remuneration policy came into effect on 6 June 2014 and will continue to apply  
for up to three financial years unless a new or revised policy is approved by shareholders in the meantime. No 
changes are proposed. For convenience a summary of some of the main features of the policy is set out on 
pages 77 to 82 below. 
Purpose and link to strategy
Base pay is set at competitive levels 
in order to recruit and retain high 
calibre executives with the skills 
required in order to manage a 
company of the size and global 
footprint of G4S.
The level of pay will reflect  
a number of factors including 
individual experience, expertise  
and role.
Operation
Reviewed annually and fixed for  
12 months commencing 1 January. 
Interim salary reviews may be 
carried out following significant 
changes in role, scope or responsibility 
or at any other time at the 
committee’s discretion.
Purpose and link to strategy
As with base salary, a suitable  
range of benefits is made available  
in order to recruit and retain high 
calibre executives.
Operation
Executives are entitled to a number 
of benefits comprising paid holiday, 
healthcare for themselves and their 
family and life insurance of up to  
4 times base salary, car allowance, 
business related transport, limited 
financial advice from time to time 
and expatriate benefits where 
relevant. A relocation allowance 
reflecting reasonable costs actually 
incurred will be paid.
Other benefits may be granted  
at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
The final salary decision may also  
be influenced by role, experience, 
individual and company performance, 
internal relativities and increases for 
group employees.
Maximum opportunity
Actual base pay for each executive 
director is disclosed each year in  
the Directors’ remuneration report.
In determining salary increases, the 
committee considers market salary 
levels including those of appropriate 
comparator companies.
Ordinarily, annual salary increases 
would be no more than the average 
annual increase across the group. 
However, in exceptional circumstances 
a higher level of increase may be 
awarded, for example:
Reasonable business expenses  
in line with G4S’ expenses policy 
(e.g. travel, accommodation and 
subsistence) will be reimbursed  
and in some instances the associated 
tax will be borne by the company.
Maximum opportunity
• maximum benefits per director 
per annum:
• holidays – 30 days
• car allowance – £20,000
• business related local transport 
– £40,000
• for financial advice, expatriate 
benefits and relocation expenses, 
the expense will reflect the cost 
of the provision of benefits from 
time to time but will be kept 
under review by the committee

individual’s performance in  
the first few years in the role.
Where exceptional increases are 
made we will fully disclose and explain 
the rationale for such increases.
Performance measures
None, although individual 
performance may have a bearing  
on salary increases.
• other benefits granted at the 
discretion of the committee up  
to 3% of base pay per annum

are not a benefit to the director.
Any allowance in relation to 
relocation will provide for the 
reimbursement of reasonable  
costs incurred.

Governance ANNUAL BONUS
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Purpose and link to strategy
Rewards the achievement of annual 
financial and strategic business targets 
and delivery of personal objectives.
Deferred element encourages 
long-term shareholding and 
discourages excessive risk taking.
Operation
Awarded annually based on 
performance in the year. Targets are 
set annually and relate to the group 
and/or the business managed by  
the executive.
Bonus outcome is determined by 
the committee after the year end, 
based on annual performance 
against targets.
Bonuses are paid in cash, but 
executives are required to defer any 
bonus payable in excess of 50% of 
their maximum bonus entitlement 
into shares. Deferral is for a 
minimum period of three years. 
Dividends or equivalents accrue 
during the deferral period on 
deferred shares. 
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Purpose and link to strategy
Incentivises executives to achieve 
the company’s long-term financial 
goals, as well as focus on value 
creation, whilst aligning the  
interests of executives with  
those of shareholders.
Operation
Executive directors are granted 
awards on an annual basis, which 
vest over a period of at least three 
years subject to continued service 
and the achievement of a number  
of key performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee 
reviews the quantum of awards  
to be made to each executive  
each year to ensure that they 
remain appropriate.
Dividends or equivalents accrue 
during the vesting period on  
awards that vest.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum opportunity of 150%  
of base pay per annum for the  
CEO and the CFO. 
125% of base pay per annum  
for any other executive director.
Performance measures
Typically, executive directors’ bonus 
measures are weighted so that:
• between 70% and 85% of the 
bonus is based on achievement  
of challenging financial performance 
measures (e.g. profit before tax 
and amortisation, organic growth, 
cash-flow measures, etc.), with 
each measure operating 
independently of the others; and
• the remainder is linked to 
personal and/or non-financial 
measures, which are strategic  
or operational in nature.
Each year, the committee may use its 
discretion to vary the exact number 
of measures, as well as their relative 
weightings, and this will be disclosed 
in the annual remuneration report.
The award is settled by the transfer 
of market-purchased shares to the 
executive directors.
All the released shares (after tax) 
must be retained until the minimum 
shareholder requirement is met. 
Currently, the minimum shareholding 
requirement is 200% of base salary 
for the CEO and 150% for the 
other executive directors.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum opportunity of 250% of 
base pay per annum for the CEO.
Maximum opportunity of 200%  
of base pay per annum for other 
executive directors.
Performance measures
Awards vest based on performance 
over a period of at least three 
financial years commencing with  
the financial year in which the  
award is made.
Directors’ remuneration policy – summary continued
Remuneration policy for executive directors
As a result of the number of factors 
taken into account in determining 
bonus, there is no minimum  
pay-out level.
For illustrative purposes, in the  
event that only threshold has been 
achieved, pay-out would be 35%  
of maximum, rising to full pay-out 
should achievement of a stretch 
performance level be achieved for 
all measures assuming the non-
financial performance measures 
were satisfied.
The deferred element of the bonus 
is not subject to any further 
performance measures but is subject 
to clawback in certain circumstances. 
The non-deferred part of the bonus, 
which is settled in cash, is also 
subject to clawback (see separate 
section below on page 80).
Performance will be measured 
based on a combination of earnings 
per share growth, total shareholder 
return against a comparator group 
and average operating cash flow.  
For awards made in 2014, these 
were in the proportion of 40%, 30% 
and 30% respectively. However, the 
committee retains the flexibility  
to amend these proportions, 
provided that no single measure  
will be a significantly greater 
proportion than the others.
At threshold, 25% of the relevant 
portion vests. This increases on a 
straight-line basis up to 100% for 
performance in line with maximum. 
Targets are set out on page 89.
Awards are subject to clawback in 
certain circumstances (see below  
on page 80).

Governance Notes to the directors’ 
remuneration policy summary
1 . Performance measures
Annual Bonus Plan – The actual 
performance measures and targets 
are set by the Remuneration 
Committee at the beginning of each 
year. The performance measures 
used for our annual bonus plan have 
been selected to reflect the group’s 
key performance indicators. The 
committee aims to ensure that the 
measures appropriately encourage 
the executive directors to focus  
on the company’s strategic annual 
priorities, whilst the targets are  
set to be stretching but achievable.
The aim is to strike an appropriate 
balance between incentivising annual 
financial and strategic business targets, 
and each executive director’s key 
role-specific objectives for the year.
Long T erm Incentive Plan – In 
choosing the performance measures 
for the Long Term Incentive Plan, the 
committee aimed to find a balance 
of measures which reflect the 
company’s long-term financial goals 
as well as incentivise executives  
to create sustainable, long-term 
value for shareholders.
Legacy plans – The committee 
reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and 
payments for loss of office 
notwithstanding that they are not  
in line with the policy summarised 
above where the terms of the 
payment were agreed (i) before  
the policy came into effect or  
(ii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a director of the 
company and, in the opinion of the 
committee, the payment was not  
in consideration for the individual 
becoming a director of the company.
For these purposes, payments may 
include the committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration.  
In cases where all or part of the 
variable remuneration award was  
in the form of shares, the payment 
terms are those agreed at the time 
the award was granted.
In particular, awards made under the 
previous Performance Share Plan 
will continue to vest in accordance 
with the rules of that plan and  
to the extent that the relevant 
performance tests are met.
Details of the vesting of the awards 
will be published in the annual 
remuneration report each year.
The non-executive directors do not 
participate in any incentive schemes 
nor do they receive any benefits 
other than those referred to in  
the above table.
2. Malus and claw-back mechanisms
Since 2010, any cash and/or shares 
awarded under the annual bonus 
plans and the previous Performance 
Share Plan may be subject to 
clawback. The Long T erm Incentive 
Plan and the annual bonus plan may 
be subject to malus or clawback 
from the executive director 
concerned if the Remuneration 
Committee so determines and, in 
the case of misstatement of accounts, 
where the Audit Committee concurs. 
The time period in which the 
clawback can be operated depends 
on the reason for the overpayment 
as set out in the table below.
The amount to be clawed back 
directly from the executive director 
will be the overpaid amount, but the 
Remuneration Committee retains 
the discretion to claw back the “net” 
(i.e. post-tax) amount of the award 
received by the executive director.

80 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Principles and approach to 
recruitment and internal 
promotion of directors
When hiring a new executive 
director, or promoting to the board 
from within the group, the committee 
will offer a package that is sufficient 
to retain and motivate and, if 
relevant, attract the right talent 
whilst at all times aiming to pay no 
more than is necessary. Ordinarily, 
remuneration for a new executive 
director will be in line with the 
policy set out in the table summarised 
above. However, discretion may  
be required for exceptional 
circumstances such as dealing  
with remuneration relinquished  
in a previous job.
The maximum level of on-going 
variable pay that may be awarded  
to new executive directors on 
recruitment or on promotion to the 
board shall be limited to 400% of 
base salary as set out in the policy 
table summarised above (calculated 
at the date of grant, excluding any 
buy-out awards – see below). 
Remuneration and any buy-out 
arrangements will be announced  
as far as possible at the time a new 
executive director or chairman is 
appointed, or in the following 
Directors’ remuneration report.
When determining the 
remuneration of a newly  
appointed executive director,  
the Remuneration Committee  
will apply the following principles:
• The on-going remuneration 
package to be designed in 
accordance with the policy  
table summarised above.
• New executive directors will 
participate in the annual bonus 
scheme and long term incentive 
plan on the same basis as existing 
executive directors.
• The Remuneration Committee 
has discretion to grant one-off 
cash or share-based awards to 
executive directors where it 
determines that such an award  
is necessary to secure the 
recruitment of that executive 
director and where it is in the 
best interests of the company  
to do so. Such awards would only 
be made as compensation for 
remuneration relinquished under 
a previous employment (i.e. 
buy-out arrangements) and would 
be intended to mirror forfeited 
awards as far as possible by 
reflecting the value, nature,  
time horizons and performance 
measures attached. In such 
circumstances, the company  
will disclose a full explanation  
of the detail and rationale for 
such one-off awards.
• In certain circumstances, it may be 
necessary to buy out long notice 
periods of previous employment.
• With regard to internal 
promotions, any commitments 
made before promotion and 
unconnected with the individual’s 
promotion may continue to be 
honoured even if they would  
not otherwise be consistent  
with the policy prevailing when 
the commitment is fulfilled.
• For external and internal 
appointments, the Remuneration 
Committee may agree that  
the company will meet certain 
relocation expenses (including legal 
fees), as set out in the policy table.
• In determining the approach  
for all relevant elements, the 
Remuneration Committee will 
consider a number of factors, 
including (but not limited to) 
external market practice, current 
arrangements for existing 
executive directors and other 
internal relativities.
Service contracts
Shareholders are entitled to inspect 
a copy of executive directors’ 
service contracts at the company’s 
head office and at the AGM.
Executive directors’ service contracts 
all have the following features:
• Contracts are drafted in line  
with best practice at the time  
the executive directors  
were appointed.
• Terminable on 12 months’ notice 
by either party. 
Specific provisions for Ashley 
Almanza and Himanshu Raja’s 
contracts (dated 2013) include:
• Following board approval, Ashley 
Almanza is allowed to hold  
two external non-executive 
appointments and retain the fees 
paid to him for the appointments. 
He is currently a non-executive 
director of Noble Corporation 
and Schroders plc, but Mr Almanza 
will step down from the board of 
Schroders plc on 28 April 2016. 
Himanshu Raja is allowed to hold 
one external non-executive 
appointment and retain any  
fees paid directly to him for  
the appointment, although he 
does not currently hold such  
an appointment. 
• Mitigation obligations on 
termination payments are explicitly 
included in the executive directors’ 
contracts. Notice payments for 
Ashley Almanza are payable 
monthly and those for Himanshu 
Raja are payable in two six-
monthly instalments, in advance.
Non-executive directors’ letters  
of appointment:
• Appointment is subject to  
the provisions of the articles  
of association of the company,  
as amended from time to  
time regarding appointment, 
retirement, fees, expenses, 
disqualification and removal  
of directors.
• All continuing non-executive 
directors are required to stand 
for re-election by the shareholders 
at least once every three years, 
although they have agreed to 
submit themselves for re-election 
annually in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
• Initial period of appointment  
is two years.
• All reasonably incurred  
expenses will be met.
• Fees are normally  
reviewed annually.

The committee will take account of the director’s performance in office and the circumstances of their exit. The 
committee will seek to balance the interests of shareholders, the departing director and the remaining directors.  
Any awards subject to performance conditions would be assessed at the end of the relevant period and be subject 
to time apportionment.

The value of the termination

of any salary and associated benefits

remaining notice period, the value  
of which will be determined by  
the Remuneration Committee. The 
Remuneration Committee would 
also retain the discretion to make

was no reward for failure.

Notes:
1. Grahame Gibson ceased to be a director on 4 June 2015, but continued to be employed by the group until 20 October 2015. The 2015 sums for base pay, benefits, annual 
bonus and pension-related benefits shown in the table are the payments he received in respect of his qualifying service to 4 June 2015. Payments made in relation to the 
period thereafter are set out on page 87. The sum shown in the table in relation to the PSP payment for 2015 is however the full amount paid to Mr Gibson since the 
performance period over which entitlement was measured ran from 2013 to 2015 and dividing the sum between the period before and after his retirement from the 
board is not meaningful. Mr Gibson’s 2015 PSP entitlement was pro-rated to 20 October 2015. 
2. Benefits include car allowance, business-related travel, healthcare, disability and life assurance. Benefit values include the cost of certain travel, overnight accommodation, 
meals and memberships which HMRC treats as a taxable benefit and on which the company has paid, or will in due course pay, tax as it does not consider such expenses 
to be benefits in the ordinary sense. The grossed-up amounts for 2015 are £70,777 for Ashley Almanza, £47,225 for Himanshu Raja and £7,716 for Grahame Gibson. 
Benefit values also include local travel costs of £16,668 and £37,504 for Ashley Almanza and Himanshu Raja respectively who bear the tax themselves, and other business 
costs which HMRC deems to be benefits. In 2015 for Grahame Gibson, the benefits value includes a total value of £32,498 relating to flights for him and his family 
between the UK and US.
3. The 2014 benefits values also include taxes met by the company in respect of certain expenses which were incurred in the prior year.
4. Part of Mr Gibson’s salary was paid in sterling and part in US$. The US$ element has been converted into sterling for the purposes of reporting, at the exchange rates 
prevailing in each month in which Grahame Gibson was paid. The average exchange rate during the period was $1.5326 ($1.65055 in 2014).
5. Any bonus due above 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement is awarded as deferred shares which vest after a period of three years, apart from Grahame 
Gibson’s 2015 annual bonus which was paid entirely in cash due to his retirement.
6. In addition, for 2015, Ashley Almanza received £115,000 from Schroders plc and a fee of $82,500 as well as shares valued at $56,531 from Noble Corporation from his 
non-executive directorships referred to on page 81 and retained such remuneration. For 2014, the equivalent sums were £115,000, $96,000 and $230,993 respectively.
7. Mr Almanza received an additional PSP award in May 2013 upon becoming CEO, the EPS performance period for which runs to 31 December 2015. The TSR performance 
however will not be measured until shortly before the vesting date in May 2016 and therefore the 2015 PSP figure in the table above does not include any sums which 
may be due in respect of the May 2013 award.

2015 Annual bonus
During the financial year ending  
31 December 2015, the performance 
measures relating to the annual 
bonus scheme rules were consistent 
with the remuneration policy, with 
85% of the bonus for both Ashley 
Almanza and Himanshu Raja and 
100% of the bonus for Grahame 
Gibson being based on achievement 
of challenging financial performance 
measures. The financial performance 
measures were based on budgeted 
group earnings and budgeted group 
operating cash flow before capital 
expenditure. On-target performance 
would result in a payment of 60% of 
maximum entitlement, with 100% 
only being earned in the event of 
achievement of a stretch performance 
significantly in excess of budget. 
The remaining 15% of the bonus for 
Messrs Almanza and Raja was linked 
to objectives relating to non-financial 
performance, which consist of 
personal objectives or relate to the 
organisation and which are linked  
to specific elements of the group’s 
strategy for which the directors 
concerned had responsibility.
The maximum bonus potential has 
remained unchanged from 2014.  
It is 150% of base pay for Ashley 
Almanza and Himanshu Raja and 
125% of base pay for Grahame 
Gibson. Bonuses are paid in cash  
up to 50% of maximum entitlement. 
Where the bonus amount is in 
excess of 50% of the maximum 
bonus potential, the amount which 
exceeds 50% will be delivered in  
the form of a deferred share award 
which vests after a period of  
three years.
The tables below show how pay 
was linked to performance in 2015

Mr Almanza performed well in delivering the first phase of the strategy, strengthening the leadership team and 
developing a more efficient organisation. Safety remains an area where management has identified the need for 
performance improvement across the organisation.
Mr Raja met his cost leadership and operational excellence objectives in relation to procurement and the first phase 
of IT strategy development. Further focus is required on cost leadership within the finance organisation and cash 
management and controls.

(audited information)
Neither Ashley Almanza nor 
Himanshu Raja is a member of  
the group’s pension plan, which  
is a defined contribution group  
personal pension plan available  
to all UK employees. Instead they  
receive cash allowances of 25% and 
20% of their base pay, respectively.
Grahame Gibson ceased accruing 
pensions under the company’s 
defined benefit scheme on 6 April 
2006. A salary supplement in lieu of 
pension of 40% of basic salary was 
paid from then on until his 
retirement on 20 October 2015.  
His total accrued pension in the 
defined benefits scheme at  
31 December 2015 was nil 
(£24,200 at 31 December 2014).
In 2011, Grahame Gibson 
transferred the majority of his 
pension benefits to a private pension 
arrangement leaving a residual pension 
payable from age 60. Grahame 
Gibson has passed normal retirement 
date which was 17 January 2013 and 
the accrued pension set out above 
includes the application of a late 
retirement factor.
The earliest date when entitlement 
to a pension arises without consent 
and without actuarial reduction is 
age 60 (the normal retirement date).
On 3 March 2015, Grahame Gibson 
transferred his remaining and residual 
pension benefits in an amount of 
£363,188 to a private pension 
arrangement. The transfer value  
was calculated using the same 
actuarial basis as that used by the 
trustees of the pension scheme  
for all members.

Notes:
1. Nick Buckles stepped down as CEO on 31 May 2013 and Ashley Almanza took over as CEO from 1 June 2013.
2. After July 2011, the CEO’s total single figure of annual remuneration included payment in lieu of pension. This was 40% of base pay for Nick 
Buckles and is 25% of base pay for Ashley Almanza. Prior to July 2011, a notional sum equal to 40% of relevant base pay has been included.  
The value of shares that vested in the relevant year under the PSP (or a notional value in the case of shares vested but unexercised) have  
been included in the prior year’s CEO’s total figures since that is the most relevant year for measurement of performance.
3. The figures before 2013 did not include taxable expenses 
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN  
CEO’S REMUNERATION 
The table below shows how the 
percentage change in the CEO’s 
salary, benefits and bonus between 
2014 and 2015 compares with the 
percentage change in the average of 
each of those components of pay 
for a selected group of G4S 
employees. The Remuneration 
Committee has chosen all 
employees in the UK as the group 
which should provide the most 
appropriate comparator. 
G4S employs 610,000 employees 
globally. Inflation is a key driver of 
general increases in salary and the 
structure of the benefits provided is 
often driven by local market 
practice. Hence, as the Group CEO 
is based in the UK, employees in the 
same country, rather than all 
employees within the group, have 
been chosen as the comparator.

STATEMENT OF 
IMPLEMENTATION OF 
REMUNERATION POLICY  
IN 2016
A summary of the directors’ 
remuneration policy is set out on 
pages 77 to 82 and the full policy 
can also be found on www.g4s.com/
investors.
Executive directors’ remuneration 
Base pay
For 2016, at the annual pay review,  
it was decided to increase 
Mr Almanza’s base pay by 1% from 
£916,700 to £925,867. No change 
was made to Mr Raja’s base pay.
Annual Bonus Scheme
The annual bonus for the 2016 
financial year will operate on the 
same basis as that for 2015 and will 
be consistent with the remuneration 
policy. The maximum bonus 
opportunity remains at 150% of 
base pay for both Ashley Almanza 
and Himanshu Raja. The financial 
measures are group earnings and 
operating cash flow. These have 
been selected as they support the 
company’s key strategic objectives. 
As for last year, the financial 
measures are allocated an 85% 
weighting for Ashley Almanza.  
For Himanshu Raja, the financial 
measures are allocated a lower 
weighting of 70% for 2016. The 
non-financial measures will therefore 
account for up to 15% and 30%  
of their maximum bonus opportunity 
for Messrs Almanza and Raja 
respectively.
These non-financial measures are 
based on the group’s strategy and 
core values and cover the following 
key areas:

T o the extent that they are no 
longer commercially sensitive, 
targets and performance levels 
against them will be disclosed in the 
company’s 2016 annual report and 
accounts. The proposed target levels 
for 2016 have been set to be 
challenging and align with the 
business plan. In reviewing the 
targets, the committee took into 
account a number of factors 
including for example the fact that  
in relation to group earnings, the 
minimum target that needs to be 
met in order for any bonus to be 
payable must be at least equal to 
the earnings in 2015. The committee 
considered the proposed targets 
relating to non-financial measures 
and concluded that these were  
also demanding.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The level of awards due to be 
granted in the 2016 financial year 
under the LTIP approved by the 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM will 
be consistent with the remuneration 
policy. As for 2015, the Remuneration 
Committee considers that a 
combination of earnings per share 
growth, total shareholder return and 
cumulative cash flow targets are  
the most appropriate performance 
measures for the 2016 awards, as 
they provide a transparent method 
of assessing the company’s 
performance, both in terms of 
underlying financial performance 
and returns to shareholders.
Awards granted under the LTIP 
during the 2016 financial year  
are subject to the performance 
conditions listed in the table below:
The company’s current policy is to 
use market-purchased shares to 
satisfy LTIP awards.
Participants in the LTIP will receive  
a further share award with a value 
equivalent to the dividends which 
would have been paid in respect  
of LTIP awards vesting at the end  
of the performance period.
The company calculates whether 
the EPS performance targets have 
been achieved by reference to the 
group’s audited accounts which 
provide an accessible and objective 
measure of the group’s earnings  
per share.
Adjustments to the EPS will be 
made in respect of:
• Constant exchange rates – in line 
with previous years, these will be 
normalised to the rates in the 
base year
• Acquisitions – earnings will be 
added to the EPS base at the 
level used in the acquisition 
business case
• Disposals – earnings will be 
removed from the EPS base  
at the business plan rate
• Share buy-back – the company 
will only execute buy-backs if  
the investment is economically 
accretive and it is in the interest 
of the company. The adjusted EPS 
for the purposes of calculating 
performance against the LTIP 
target shall be further adjusted by
(a) increasing the average number 
of shares in issue during the 
performance year by the number 
of shares bought back during the 
past three years
(b) decreasing the net interest 
cost in the performance year in 
respect of the interest charge on 
the cash cost of any share buy 
backs during the past three years. 
Interest will be calculated at the 
group’s average costs of funds for 
the year.

Governance The Remuneration Committee will 
apply discretion in the event of 
impairment. If the impairment is not 
a result of management failure, then 
it will not impact the payout.
The Remuneration Committee may 
alter the terms of the EPS measure 
if it feels that it is no longer a fair 
measure and is no longer 
incentivising.
Operating cash flow is a measure 
taken before capital expenditure 
and investments to ensure that 
management is not incentivised to 
under-invest in growth opportunities. 
Operating cash flow is expressed as

4 Capital
The issued share capital of G4S plc 
at 31 December 2015 is as set  
out on page 166 (note 35 to the 
consolidated financial statements) 
and consisted of 1,551,594,436 
ordinary shares of 25 pence each. 
The number of shares in issue as  
at 24 March 2016 remains unchanged.
In general there are no restrictions 
on the holder’s ability to transfer 
their shares or exercise their voting 
rights, other than in situations where 
the company is legally entitled to 
impose such restrictions (usually 
where amounts remain unpaid  
on the shares after request, or  
the holder is otherwise in default  
of an obligation to the company).
The company is not aware of any 
agreements between its shareholders 
that may restrict the transfer of their 
shares or the exercise of the voting 
rights attaching to them except  
in relation to the G4S Employee 
Benefit T rust (“the T rust”) which  
has been established to facilitate 
certain employee share plans.
Resolutions granting the directors 
power, subject to certain conditions, 
to allot and make market purchases 
of the company’s shares will be 
proposed at the company’s Annual 
General Meeting. At 31 December 
2015 the directors had authority in 
accordance with a resolution passed 
at the company’s Annual General 
Meeting held on 4 June 2015 to 
make market purchases of up to 
 155,159,000 of the company’s shares.
The company does not hold any 
treasury shares as such. However, 
the 6,320,144 shares held within  
the Trust and referred to on page 
167 (note 36 to the consolidated 
financial statement) are accounted 
for as treasury shares. The Trust has 
waived its right to receive dividends 
in respect of the company’s shares 
which it held during the period 
under review.
5 Significant agreements – 
change of control
The company is party to a GBP 
1,000,000,000 multi-currency 
revolving credit facility agreement 
which requires prompt notification 
of a change of control event 
following which funds committed 
but unutilised could be cancelled 
and repayment of outstanding 
commitments would need to  
be made within 45 days.
The company entered into two US 
Private Placement Note Purchase 
Agreements (the “USPP Agreements”), 
on 1 March 2007 and 15 July 2008 
respectively. The first USPP Agreement 
is for USD 550,000,000 and series 
B-D senior notes representing USD 
450,000,000 remain outstanding and 
mature between 1 March 2017 and 
1 March 2022. The second USPP 
Agreement is for USD 513,500,000 
and GBP 69,000,000 and series C-F 
senior notes representing USD 
298,5000,000 and GBP 69,000,000 
remain outstanding and mature 
between 15 July 2016 and 15 July 
2020. Under the terms of both 
USPP Agreements, the company is 
required to offer the note holders 
the right to purchase the notes at 
par value together with interest 
thereon upon a change of control.
Under the terms of the GBP 
2,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term 
Note Programme the company 
issued three tranches of Medium 
Term Notes (MTNs) to various 
institutions on 13 May 2009 (GBP 
350,000,000), 2 May 2012 (Euro 
600,000,000) and 6 December 
2012 (Euro 500,000,000). In the 
event of a change of control, a put 
option comes into force, according 
to which holders of any MTN may 
require the company to redeem the 
MTNs at par if the MTNs carry a 
sub-investment grade in the period 
immediately prior to the change of 
control, or in certain circumstances 
where the MTNs are downgraded 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 91
Governance to sub-investment as a result of  
the change of control.
The group’s UK pension scheme 
trust deed contains provisions  
which apply if a takeover event 
occurs. Following such an event,  
the appointment and removal  
of trustees becomes subject to 
unanimous trustee agreement and 
the trustees acquire the unilateral 
power to set the employer 
contribution rates in certain  
sections of the scheme.
6 Post balance sheet events
There have been no material  
events from 31 December 2015  
to the date of this report. 
7 Research and development 
expenditure
Research in connection with the 
development of new services and 
products and the improvement of 
those currently provided by the 
group is carried out continuously. 
Research and development 
written-off to profit and loss  
during the year amounted to  
£8m (2014: £10m).
8 Employees
In 2015 the group undertook its 
fourth global employee engagement 
survey. The survey provided a wealth 
of feedback from employees and is 
the basis for the group’s employee 
engagement plans for 2016. T o 
encourage completion and to  
make it as accessible to as many 
employees as possible, the latest 
survey was offered in 39 languages 
and three versions (mobile, paper 
and on-line). Although voluntary, the 
completion rates in 2015 were very 
high with 449,000 employees taking 
the opportunity to respond to the 
survey. As with previous surveys,  
the questions were aligned to the 
employee engagement model, 
PRIDE, which describes how the 
group endeavours to protect, 
respect, involve, develop and engage 
employees so they can deliver great 
service each and every day. Local 
businesses are tasked with making 
sure they have engagement plans  
in place which reflect the feedback 
provided and address areas of 
concern raised by employees. 
Other ways in which information  
is provided to and gathered from 
employees is via representative 
forums. Such forums exist to deal 
with specific business issues like 
health and safety as well as for more 
general employee consultation and 
communication. At a global level  
the group’s Ethical Employment 
Partnership with the global union 
federation UNI provides the 
opportunity for regular dialogue on 
matters which may be of concern to 
employees and their representatives. 
At a European level, the group  
has further enhanced the existing 
Works Council communication  
and consultation framework by 
producing a quarterly newsletter 
which has updates on topics likely 
to be of interest or affect employees 
across the European Union. The 
group values the insights from 
representative forums and takes 
action where necessary on matters 
raised to protect employment rights 
and prevent issues escalating to  
the detriment of the business. 
The introduction of a new global 
intranet early in 2016 now provides 
opportunities to reach a much 
wider employee population than 
was possible previously. The ‘Hub’  
is accessible by around 65,000 
employees on-line and enables 
information about the company’s 
performance and the factors 
impacting on it during the year  
to be shared in a structured way. 
The transition to a new technology 
platform has also increased the 
scope for gathering and sharing 
information on the business across 
the group’s global, but increasingly 
connected, world. So too have 
advances in social media. In 2015  
the group consolidated the plethora 
of social media sites that had sprung 
up to ensure consistent and 
comprehensive messages are 
communicated to employees  
from the past and present as  
well as anyone planning to join  
G4S in the future. 
The group is constantly being 
challenged to deliver more with  
less; to innovate and find better 
ways of doing things in order to 
increase its competitive advantage. 
T o achieve this the group recognises 
it needs to have the best people 
and to allow them to work in ways 
which maximise their contribution. 
Recruitment, training and 
development processes are  
aligned to this goal. The group  
tries to recruit people from the 
widest applicant pool and, as well  
as running its own recruitment 
campaigns, it works with a number 
of specialist agencies who can help 
identify the best candidates including 
people with complex barriers  
to work who might be disabled  
or have challenges in securing 
suitable employment. 
The group strives to promote 
equality of opportunity and build 
inclusive working environments that 
are reflective of the communities  
it serves. As well as having robust 
policies and procedures in place  
to prevent discrimination, diversity 
training is provided for managers 
and people involved in key processes 
such as recruitment and promotion. 
Positive steps are taken to achieve 
the aim of an inclusive workplace.  
In North America for example,  
this means updating the technology 
on their careers centre website  
to ensure that it is as accessible  
as possible and participating in 
outreach programmes with 
educational establishments to 
facilitate work-study programmes 
for students, trainees, or interns  
with disabilities. In the UK, where  
the group is the largest security 
services employer, research on 
equality and diversity across the 
industry was contributed to, seeking 
to understand the barriers to 
employment for individuals with 
protected characteristics as defined 
in the Equality Act 2010. The findings  
of the research are currently being 
reviewed and the group will take  
an active role in developing and 
implementing plans to make the 
industry more attractive and 
accessible to people from  
all backgrounds. 
Where existing employees become 
disabled as a result of injury or 
illness there are support mechanisms 
in place to assist them in times of 
hardship such as a Trust Fund and 
Employee Assistance Programmes. 
Managers are provided with advice 
and guidance on making reasonable 
adjustments which will enable 
employees to continue to work 
effectively, develop in their current 
and any future roles and contribute 
fully irrespective of any disabilities 
they have. 
Directors’ report continued
92 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 9 Political donations
Each year the company’s 
shareholders have passed a 
resolution on a precautionary  
basis to allow the company and  
its subsidiaries to make political 
donations to political organisations 
or incur political expenditure not 
exceeding £50,000. However, the 
board confirms that the group’s 
policy is not to make any financial 
contribution to political parties and 
that the company and its subsidiaries 
have made no contributions during 
the year to political parties carrying 
on activities, or to candidates 
seeking election within the EU,  
or anywhere else in the world.
10 Greenhouse gas emissions
Alongside the risks faced by people 
and infrastructure from climate 
change are the challenges presented 
by global economic conditions.
Managing fuel costs and the  
impact of “carbon taxes” through 
programmes to improve the group’s 
energy efficiency and reduce its 
environmental impacts are important 
to the continued effectiveness and 
sustainability of the group’s business.
The group recognises the impact 
that its business activities can have 
on the environment and is committed 
to managing this impact in a 
responsible manner. Through its 
climate action programme the 
group measures, reports and  
aims to reduce the intensity of  
its environmental impact. 
What we are doing
Since 2008 the group has used 
WBCSD

Protocol to measure its Scope 1 
and 2 emissions – vehicle fleet, fuel, 
refrigerants and electricity usage  
for G4S businesses over which the 
group has financial and operational 
control. In addition the group has 
measured Scope 3 emissions from 
employee business air travel.

The businesses that reported data 
in the 2015 GHG measurement 
represent 96.2% of the group’s 
operations, across a 12 month 
period. This level of measurement, 
including each of the group’s  
main service types, allows reliable 
calculation of the total GHG 
emissions for 100% of the group.
How we are performing
The G4S total carbon footprint 
during 2015, extrapolated to 100% 
of the business equates to some 
522,901 t/CO2e.
These carbon emissions, including 
emissions generated by services 
which our customers have 
outsourced to G4S, have decreased 
by 5.5% since 2014 – against a 4% 
growth in the business during the 
same period. This is a positive 
achievement which recognises the 
efforts made to increase the energy 
efficiency of our business.
* World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development
**  World Resources Institute 
Priorities for 2016
Continue to implement energy 
efficiency strategies with the aim  
of reducing carbon intensity by at 
least 4.5% per annum.

A resolution to re-appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , 
chartered accountants, as auditor to 
the company for 2016 and for their 
remuneration to be fixed by the 
Audit Committee will be submitted 
to the Annual General Meeting. 
13 Directors
The directors, biographical details  
of whom are contained on pages 56 
and 57, held office throughout the 
year apart from John Daly who was 
appointed on 5 June 2015. Grahame 
Gibson and Mark Seligman retired 
from the board at the conclusion  
of the company’s Annual General 
Meeting on 4 June 2015.
In accordance with the code 
provisions on re-election of directors 
in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, each of the directors 
continuing in office will offer 
themselves for re-election. Mark 
Elliott and Adam Crozier will retire 
from the board at the conclusion  
of the company’s Annual General 
Meeting in 2016 and will not therefore 
stand for re-election. The board 
believes that the directors standing 
for re-election possess experience 
and expertise relevant to the 
company’s operations; that they 
continue to be effective; that they  
are committed to the success of  
the company; and that they should  
be re-elected (or elected) at the 
Annual General Meeting.
The contracts of service of the 
executive directors have no 
unexpired term since they are not 
for a fixed term. They are terminable 
at 12 months’ notice. None of the 
non-executive directors has a 
contract of service.
The company has executed deeds of 
indemnity for the benefit of each of 
the directors in respect of liabilities 
which may attach to them in their 
capacity as directors of the company. 
These deeds are qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions as 
defined by section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and have been 
in effect since 3 November 2006  
for Mr Elliott, 14 June 2010 for Ms 
Spottiswoode, 1 October 2010 for 
Ms Fok, 8 June 2012 for Mr Connolly,

June 2015 for Mr Daly. Copies of the 
forms of indemnity are available on 
the company’s website. In addition, 
indemnities have been granted by 
the company in favour of certain  
of the directors of certain of the 
group’s subsidiaries in the UK, 
Germany, the Netherlands, India  
and the Philippines. The company  
has maintained a directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance policy 
throughout the year under review.
Details of directors’ interests 
(including the interests of their 
connected persons) in the share 
capital of G4S plc and of the 
directors’ remuneration are  
set out on pages 74 to 90.
The directors who held office  
at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ report confirm that, so  
far as they are each aware, there  
is no relevant audit information  
of which the company’s auditor  
is unaware and each director has 
taken all the steps that he or she 
ought to have taken as a director  
to make him or herself aware of  
any relevant audit information  
and to establish that the company’s 
auditor is aware of that information. 
None of the directors had a 
material interest in any contract 
significant to the business of the 
group during the financial year.

of the annual report and  
the financial statements
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and  
the group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the  
directors to prepare group and 
parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare  
the group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements  
in accordance with UK  
Accounting Standards.
Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the group and 
parent company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the group and parent 
company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
parent company financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements  
on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume  
that the group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility  
for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the group 
and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a strategic report, 
Directors’ report, Directors’ 
remuneration report and Corporate 
governance statement that comply 
with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility 
statement
Each of the directors, the names  
of whom are set out on pages  
56 and 57 of this annual report, 
confirm that, to the best of his  
or her knowledge:
• the financial statements in  
this annual report have been 
prepared in accordance with  
the applicable accounting 
standards and give a true and  
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and results of 
the company and the group; and
• the management report required 
by DTR4.1.8R (contained in the 
strategic report and the Directors’ 
report) includes a fair review of 
the development and performance 
of the business and the position 
of the company and the group 
taken as a whole, together with  
a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties they face.
The strategic report from the inside 
front cover to page 53 includes 
information on the group structure, 
the performance of the business and 
the principal risks and uncertainties 
it faces. The financial statements on 
pages 116 to 201 include information 
on the group and the company’s 
financial results, financial outlook, 
cash flow and net debt and balance 
sheet positions. Notes 22, 26, 27, 30 
and 31 to the consolidated financial 
statements include information on 
the group’s investments, cash and 
cash equivalents, borrowings, 
derivatives, financial risk management 
objective, hedging policies and 
exposure to interest, foreign 
exchange, credit, liquidity and 
market risks.
Pages 116 to 188 contain information 
on the performance of the group,  
its financial position, cash flows, net 
debt position and borrowing facilities. 
Further information, including financial 
risk management policies, exposures 
to market and credit risk and hedging 
activities, is given in note 31 to the 
financial statements. After making 
enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the 
group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason the directors consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Directors are also required to 
provide a broader assessment  
of viability over a longer period, 
which can be found on page 46  
of the annual report and accounts.
The directors consider that the 
annual report and accounts, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides  
the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the 
company’s performance,  
business model and strategy.
The statement of directors’ 
responsibilities and the strategic 
report was approved by a duly 
authorised committee of the board  
of directors on 24 March 2016 and 
signed on its behalf by Himanshu Raja,  
Chief Financial Officer.

Governance Chief Financial Officer’s review
“ We continued to make good financial progress with 
underlying revenue growth of 4% to £6.433bn and 
a 14% increase in underlying earnings to £227m.  
Our overall results were impacted by investment 
in restructuring and legacy issues, as a result  
of which statutory earnings were £8m.”
A GOOD UNDERLYING 
PERFORMANCE
Since November 2013 we have 
identified 61 businesses for sale or 
closure with aggregate revenues of 
£1.2bn and £30m of PBITA losses of 
which we have divested 23 business 
generating proceeds of £281m. 
Through our continued focus on 
portfolio management, the group 
expects to generate additional 
proceeds of between £250m-£350m 
over the next 12 to 24 months. 
Specific items: onerous contracts
We continued to actively manage 
the effect of legacy contracts and 
acquisitions which had a significant 
impact on our statutory results:
The group provided a further  
£65m provision for future losses 
principally related to legacy UK 
government contracts and identified 
a further contingent liability of £57m 
in respect of the Compass contract 
which, as set out further on page 99, 
may be extended by the customer 
for an additional two years to 
August 2019. Since November 2013, 
the group has incurred £246m in 
onerous contract charges principally 
in relation to legacy UK government 
contracts. If the Compass contract 
(see page 99)was extended, the 
total charges would be £303m.  
We continue to manage these 
contracts closely and efficiently  
and have established robust controls 
over new contracts to ensure that 
the group effectively evaluates  
and manages contract risk on  
future contracts.

Chief Financial Officer
Introduction
We made good progress in 2015. 
Underlying earnings and earnings 
per share increased by 14% to 
£227m and 14.7p respectively. 
Underlying operating cash flow  
was £460m, compared to £528m  
in 2014 mainly due to a temporary 
increase in working capital associated 
with the strong revenue growth in 
the second half of 2015 of 5.4% and 
the impact of transitioning to a shared 
service centre in the UK which reversed 
in the first two months of 2016. 
Our overall progress was impacted 
by the investment in restructuring, 
specific items, losses on businesses 
identified for sale or closure, goodwill 
impairment and amortisation in 
respect of historical acquisitions. 
As a result, statutory earnings were 
£8m, compared with £145m in 2014.
Restructuring
In 2015, we invested a further  
£44m in restructuring the group’s 
operations addressing the cost 
structures in Latin America, Asia  
and the Middle East, Europe, North 
America and in the UK & Ireland. 
These programmes have payback 
periods of 12 to 36 months and 
deliver attractive double-digit 
economic returns. 
Portfolio management
During the year we identified a 
further 38 businesses for sale or 
closure, and the associated revenue 
of £430m and operating losses  
of £35m of these businesses and 
those sold during 2015 were 
excluded from underlying results. 
96 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Specific items: review of assets 
and liabilities
There was a net £5m charge 
comprising a £17m charge in 
respect of the re-measurement of 
assets and liabilities offset by £12m 
of pension-related gains. In 2013  
the group carried out a review of 
the carrying value of its assets and 
liabilities as at 31 December 2012 
and during 2015 these estimates 
and judgements have been updated 
to reflect any further changes in 
facts or circumstances. This concludes 
our review of the carrying value of 
assets and liabilities from 2012. All 
future related changes in estimates 
will flow through underlying results, 
unless these are individually material, 
in which case they will be separately 
disclosed in line with the group’s 
policy as set out in note 3(c). Since 
November 2013, the group has 
incurred around £500m of charges 
in relation to legacy items including 
the review of assets and liabilities.
Goodwill impairment  
and amortisation
A charge of £106m has been 
incurred in respect of amortisation 
of acquisition related intangible 
assets (£40m) and impairment 
(£66m) of goodwill in respect  
of historical acquisitions made 
before 2013 and businesses held  
for sale or closure.
Net debt
The net debt for the group was 
£1.782bn and net debt to underlying 
EBITDA was 3.3x (2014: 3.0x). The 
group’s business plan supports a  
net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.5x or 
lower in the next 12-24 months. 
In April 2015, the group’s credit 
rating was confirmed by S&P as 
BBB-(stable).
2014 Restatements 
Following the approval of 
shareholders at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting, the group appointed 
PwC as its auditor for the 2015 
financial year. We took the 
opportunity of the appointment  
of the new auditor to conduct a 
comprehensive review of accounting 
and reporting across the group. As 
set out in their report on pages 106 
to 115, the scope of the audit was 
extensive. The financial statements 
for 2014 were restated to reflect 
prior year adjustments in respect  
of certain alarm sales and related 
leases in Denmark, prior year errors 
identified in Africa and for errors in 
respect of accounting for acquisitions 
and disposals and related tax balances 
in North America between 2007 
and 2014. 
The net effect of these was to  
reduce 2014 statutory earnings by 
£7m, to increase operating cashflow 
by £10m and to reduce reserves at  
31 December 2014 by £48m. The 
restatements do not affect the future 
cash generation of the group. The 
underlying and statutory results reflect 
these restatements with 2014 and 
2015 all presented and accounted for 
on a like for like basis in the statutory 
and underlying results. 
Improved capability and 
strengthened controls 
Over the last two years, the group 
has made substantial progress in 
strengthening the capability of its 
finance, risk management and 
control processes. As I have previously 
reported, we have brought in new 
regional finance directors across our 
regions. During 2015, we appointed 
new regional finance directors for 
the newly created region of Middle 
East and India and for Africa. Since 
2013, this means that the regional 
finance directors in five of the  
seven regions are new to the group 
and bring substantial experience  
of operating in global finance 
organisations. 
As set out on page 47, we continue  
to operate the 3 lines of defence 
model. We continue to strengthen  
the first line of defence with 
investment in people, systems and 
controls. Specifically in 2015, we 
strengthened the finance capability 
across Africa with the appointment of 
a new regional controller and 12 new 
finance directors at country level.
Our regional risk and audit 
committees meet on a quarterly 
basis to monitor the effectiveness  
of the control environment and 
consider any material accounting 
judgements. 
Our contract approval processes 
have also been significantly 
strengthened with enhanced 
controls in the risk assessment of 
our contracts pre-bidding, during 
the bid cycle, through mobilisation 
and in-life review. During 2015, 
these controls have been reviewed 
and tested by our group risk and 
internal audit functions to ensure 
that they are robust and their work 
has been reviewed by the board 
Risk Committee. 
Outlook
Against a background of global 
economic uncertainty, demand for 
our services remained resilient and 
growth accelerated in the second 
half of 2015, providing good support 
for further operating and financial 
progress in 2016. In the current 
economic environment we expect 
medium term demand for our 
services to grow by around 4-6% 
per annum.
Basis of preparation
The following discussion and 
analysis on pages 98 to 105 is  
based on, and should be read in 
conjunction with, the consolidated 
financial statements, including the 
related notes, that form part of this 
annual report. The consolidated 
financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS  
as adopted by the EU. 
The group applies the basis of 
preparation as shown on page 120. 
To present underlying performance, 
2014 comparative results are 
presented on a constant currency 
basis by applying 2015 average 
exchange rates. In addition, it excludes 
the results of certain businesses 
identified for sale or closure as part 
of the portfolio rationalisation 
programme announced by the group 
in November 2013 and excludes 
investment in restructuring, specific 
items, goodwill impairment and 
acquisition-related amortisation  
as well as interest and tax relating  
to joint ventures. A detailed 
reconciliation is provided below.

98 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Underlying Revenue and PBITA
Underlying revenue was £6,433m, an increase of 4.0% on 2014. 
Emerging markets grew 8.6% year on year, with revenues of £2.3bn, and now represent 35% of group revenue 
(2014: 34%). Developed markets revenues were 1.6% higher than the prior year with strong growth in North 
America of 5.8% and growth in Europe of 2.6%. UK & Ireland revenues declined by 3.0% as the UK Electronic 
Monitoring contract ended in Q1 2014 and with the loss of a large retail contract in cash solutions in Q4 2014.
Gross margin declined 70b.p. to 19.1% (2014: 19.8%) but was offset by a 2% reduction in underlying selling, general 
and administration costs.
Underlying PBITA of £427m up 5.7% (2014: £404m) represents the continuing operations of the group. PBITA 
margin increased to 6.6% (2014: 6.5%). We saw effects of the slowdown of commodities and oil prices in the global 
markets in particular affecting some of our businesses in Africa and Latin America but were able to offset these with 
the benefits from our productivity programmes on direct labour efficiency, route planning, telematics and focus on 
organisational efficiency. 
The benefits from our productivity programmes also allowed us to make the necessary investments in IT  
and procurement and to continue to invest a further £7m in sales and business development capability. 
Corporate costs of £50m are £10m lower than for 2014 and benefit from cost and organisational efficiency offset  
by the investment in group procurement and IT capability.
Portfolio businesses identified for sale or closure
The group made further progress with its portfolio management programme and since 2013 we have sold or  
are exiting 61 businesses with annualised revenues of c.£1.2bn and operating losses of £30m, based on the last  
full year when each of these businesses formed part of the group. This programme is greatly improving the group’s 
strategic focus and has also realised £281m in disposal proceeds in relation to the 23 businesses sold to date. Since  
31 December 2015, a further four businesses have been identified for sale, with annualised revenues of £400m.  
The group’s on-going portfolio management programme is expected to raise a further £250m to £350m over  
the next 12 to 24 months. 
Restructuring costs
The group invested £44m (2014: £29m) in restructuring programmes during the year, relating to the multi-year 
efficiency programme across the group. During 2014 and 2015 these programmes have focused primarily on 
transforming the operating model in the regions of UK & Ireland and Europe. During the second half of 2015  
these programmes began to address organisational efficiency in Latin America, Africa and North America.

T otal specific items (70) (58)
Certain specific items have been disclosed separately from the underlying results to provide a better understanding 
of the underlying trading performance of the group. These include a net £70m (2014: £58m) specific items charge, 
comprising: 
• £65m (2014: £45m) charge mainly resulting from revising the estimates and judgements relating to future losses 
on legacy UK government and PFI contracts, including the Compass contract.
Under the UK Compass asylum seeker contract with the Home Office, the group provides accommodation, 
transportation and subsistence services for asylum seekers whilst their claims are being processed. This contract 
commenced in 2012 and runs to 1 September 2017, with a potential extension of a further two years.
In 2014, an onerous contract provision was recognised in relation to the then-current assumptions regarding 
asylum seeker numbers, the duration and cost of accommodation and support services. We experienced a 
significant increase in the number of new asylum seekers between November 2015 and January 2016 and as  
a result the number of asylum seekers in our care increased by 9.6% year-on-year. We have updated the Compass 
provision based upon our best estimate of the increase in asylum seekers assigned to the group, the availability of 
suitable accommodation approved by local authorities, the speed of processing of applications by the immigration 
authority and the costs of support services.
T o date, the Compass contract has not been extended and the onerous contract provision has been increased by £20m 
to £31m covering the period to August 2017. Should the contract be extended for the period to August 2019 then, 
based on the assumptions in the current provision being extended for the next two years, a further provision for £57m 
would be required. 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 99
Financial statements Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
The other principal onerous contract provision relates to a previously identified PFI contract entered into in 2005 
and is subject to on-going discussions with the customer. A best estimate has been made based on a range of 
possible outcomes including a commercial or dispute resolution process.
• A net £5m charge in respect of the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of £17m offset by £12m of pension 
related gains:
 – £17m (2014: £34m which includes a £1m charge relating to specific items in joint ventures) charge as a result 
of updating the estimates and judgements applied to those assets and liabilities that were included in the 
balance sheet review performed in 2013.
In 2013 the group carried out a review of the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, over 
and above its contract review, taking into account any changes in facts or circumstances since that date. This exercise 
required a level of judgement based on the group’s then-current understanding of the circumstances surrounding 
each issue. 
The results of the review were presented within specific items and since then any increase or reversal of provision 
for those items has been consistently reported as a specific item. As at 31 December 2015 these estimates and 
judgements have been updated to reflect any further changes in facts or circumstances during the year to 31 
December 2015. This concludes our review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities from 2012. All future 
related changes in estimates will flow through underlying results, unless these are individually material, in which 
case they will be separately disclosed in specific items, in line with the group’s policy (see note 3(c)).
 – A £5m gain in relation to a pension curtailment as a result of transferring the future pension liabilities of the 
Netherlands Cash scheme to the industry wide pension fund (2014: £21m settlement gain on transfer of the 
past and future pension liabilities of the Netherlands Security scheme to the industry wide pension fund). 
 – Other gains of £7m (2014: £nil) relate to the successful resolution and settlement of certain legacy UK pension claims.
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries and goodwill impairment
During the year the group realised a profit on disposal of businesses of £12m (2014: £nil). In addition, the group 
recorded a goodwill impairment of £66m in relation to a business in Estonia and a number of businesses identified  
for sale or closure.
Interest
Net underlying interest payable on net debt was £88m (2014: £97m); benefiting from lower interest rates on 
swapped fixed to floating debt and the repayment of a 6.43% US$150m bond in July. The pension interest charge 
was £12m (2014: £22m) resulting in total net interest costs of £100m (2014: £119m). 
Tax 
A tax charge of £78m (2014: £68m) was recognised on underlying profits of £327m (2014: £285m) which 
represents an effective tax rate of 24% (2014: 24%). The group recognised a statutory tax charge of £50m (2014: 
£46m) on profit before tax of £78m (2014: £128m) which represents an effective tax rate of 64% (2014: 36%). 
The underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 24%, including the impact of a credit  
of £9m in respect of the recognition of deferred tax assets on carried forward tax losses in various countries where 
the group expects to utilise those tax losses against projected taxable profits arising in the foreseeable future.
The underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been restated to include the 
reallocation of certain non-profit based taxes in Latin America from the tax charge into underlying profits.  
The impact of this change reduced the underlying effective tax rate by 1% to 24%.
The group’s underlying effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of its taxable profits and the respective 
country tax rates, hence if a higher proportion of future taxable profits arises in high tax countries the underlying 
effective rate will increase. 
The difference between the effective tax rate on underlying and statutory profits is due primarily to the absence  
of tax relief on goodwill impairments, and the limited tax relief in respect of losses relating to portfolio businesses 
and restructuring costs. This limited tax relief results where the group does not have sufficient forecast taxable 
profits to support the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of all such losses.
100 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Discontinued operations 
During the year progress was made in the collection of £26m (US$40m) receivables relating to the sale of the  
US Government solutions business in November 2014. As at 31 December 2015, only £8m (US$13m) receivables 
remain outstanding and are expected to be collected in the short term.
As at 31 December 2015 no further businesses remain classified as discontinued operations given that the entities 
currently being managed for sale or closure under the portfolio management programme are not significant enough 
to the group operations to be presented as discontinued operations under IFRS 5.
Non-controlling interest 
Underlying profit attributable to non-controlling interests was £22m in 2015, an increase from £18m for 2014, mainly 
due to the strong performance of businesses in the Asia and Middle East region resulting in an increase in the share of 
profit accruing to non-controlling partners. Statutory profit attributable to non-controlling interests was £18m in 2015, 
only a slight increase from £17m in 2014 due to the partners’ share of specific items charges in 2015. 
Profit for the year – underlying and statutory
The group reported underlying profit attributable to equity holders (“underlying earnings”) of £227m (2014: £199m),  
an increase of 14.1% for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
The group’s statutory earnings of £8m (2014: £145m) is after losses from portfolio businesses held for sale or 
closure of £40m (2014: £25m), restructuring costs of £44m (2014: £29m), provisions of £65m (2014: £45m) 
relating to onerous contract provisions, a net £5m (2014: £13m) from the review of assets and liabilities offset  
by pension related gains and a non-cash charge of £106m for amortisation of acqusition-related intangible assets 
and goodwill impairment (2014: amortisation of £59m) related to historical acquisitions, together with the 
corresponding tax effect. 
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased to 14.7p (2014: 12.9p). Statutory earnings per share was 0.5p (2014: 9.4p). 
These are based on the weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,545m (2014: 1,545m). A reconciliation of

Cash flow from operating businesses was £449m (2014: £524m). Cash outflows from portfolio businesses 
held for sale or closure were £11m (2014: £4m) which are excluded from underlying operating cash flows. 
Underlying operating cash flow was £460m (2014: £528m, excluding corporate items in 2014 of £27m relating  
to the Electronic Monitoring contract settlement with the UK Government). The reduction in underlying cash flow 
was mainly due to a temporary increase in working capital associated with the strong growth in the second half  
of 2015 of 5.4% and the impact of transitioning to a shared service centre in the UK which reversed in the first  
two months of 2016.
The group invested £104m in capex (2014: £119m) and received proceeds of £14m (2014: £159m) from the 
disposal of portfolio businesses. 
The net cash flow after investing in the business and proceeds from portfolio rationalisation was £292m 
(2014: £516m).
102 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Net debt 
The net debt position as at 31 December 2015 was £1,782m (2014: £1,639m). The group’s net debt to underlying 
EBITDA ratio is 3.3x (2014: 3.0x). Net debt includes an increase of £36m (2014: £24m) due to the effect of foreign 
exchange translation differences relating to the group’s debt held in foreign currencies (mainly US dollars and Euros) 
and the translation loss on cash and cash equivalents in emerging markets.
The detailed operating profit to net debt reconciliation is provided and is reconciled to the statutory cash flow on page 
102. The group’s business plan supports a net debt/EBITDA of 2.5x or lower in the next 12 to 24 months.
Net debt maturity 
In April 2015, the group’s credit rating was confirmed by Standard & Poor’s as BBB- (Stable). As of 31 December 
2015 the group had cash on hand of £443m and unutilised and committed facilities of £683m. The group has 
sufficient borrowing capacity to finance its current and medium term investment plans.
The group has no material debt maturities until May 2017 and has a diverse range of finance providers. Borrowings 
are principally in pounds sterling, US dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets  
and profits.

During 2015 a £1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility provided by a consortium of lending banks at a drawn 
margin of 1.0% over LIBOR was put in place. The facility matures in January 2021, with the option of a one year 
extension which if exercised gives the group facilities through to January 2022. As at 31 December 2015 the 
drawings were US$245m and £155m. 
The group’s average cost of gross borrowings in 2015, net of interest hedging was 4.0% (2014: 4.1%).
Financing and treasury activities
The group’s treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for managing 
the group’s financial risk arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit. Treasury is not  
a profit centre and it is not permitted to speculate in financial instruments. The treasury department’s policies are 
set by the board. Treasury is subject to the controls appropriate to the risks it manages. These risks are discussed in 
note 31 on pages 154 to 158.
T o assist the efficient management of the group’s interest costs, the group operates a multi-currency notional pooling 
cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A-rated bank. At year end, credit balances of £55m 
were pooled with debit balances of £57m, resulting in a net pool debit balance of £2m. There is legal right of set-off 
under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of £3m.

Significant exchange rates applicable to the group
The group derives a significant portion of its revenue and profits in the following currencies. Closing and average 
rates for these currencies are shown below. If December 2015 closing rates were applied to the results for the year  
to 31 December 2015, underlying PBITA would have remained unchanged at £427 million.

The sterling value of emerging market revenues (around one third of group revenues) was adversely affected by  
the sharp fall in many emerging market currencies and this reduced our statutory PBITA.
Dividend 
In assessing the dividend, the board considers:
• the future investment in the continuing business;
• net debt to EBITDA;
• satisfying the group’s pension obligations;
• the availability of distributable reserves in the parent company; and
• reward to shareholders.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 5.82p (DKK 0.5615) per share (2014: 5.82p per share; DKK 0.6041). 
The interim dividend was 3.59p (DKK 0.3793) per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 9.41p (DKK 
0.9408) per share, an increase of 1.8% (2014, the interim dividend 3.42p; DKK 0.3198 and the total dividend 9.24p; 
DKK 0.9239).
The proposed dividend cover is 1.6 times (2014: 1.5 times) on underlying earnings. The board’s intention is that 
dividends will increase broadly in line with underlying earnings over the medium term. 
Other information 
Pensions 
As at 31 December 2015 the net defined benefit pension obligation on the balance sheet was £355m (2014: £394m) 
or £238m net of tax (2014: £255m) of which £205m (2014: £264m) related to material funded defined benefit 
schemes. At 31 December 2015 the group transferred its Netherlands cash solutions defined pension scheme  
into the industry wide defined benefit scheme, resulting in a curtailment gain of £5m which was recorded within 
specific items.
The most significant pension scheme is in the UK and accounts for 74% (2014: 87%) of the total material scheme 
obligations. The scheme has approximately 30,000 members and further details of the make-up of the scheme are 
given in note 32 on page 160.

Scheme assets 2,029 1,983 
Obligations (2,218) (2,222)
T otal UK obligations (189) (239)
The movement in the UK scheme obligation was as a result of an increase of £45m in the value of scheme assets 
principally arising from an increase in underlying asset values, as well as by the scheme obligations decreasing by £4m.  
The decrease in the obligation is mainly due to the discount rate increasing modestly to 3.8% (2014: 3.7%) partly 
offset by inflation rates increasing to 3.1% (2014: 3.0%). The group made additional pension contributions of £44m 
(2014: £42m) into the scheme during the year, and the group’s current payment profile agreed with trustees  
in 2012 will result in an increase of next year’s annual deficit recovery payment to £47m. 
The group is currently working with the trustees on the 2015 triennial actuarial valuation which will determine 
future contributions for the repayment of the pension deficit. The results of this work are expected to be 
completed in the second half of 2016.
104 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps 
The group’s investments and borrowings at 31 December 2015 were a mix of fixed rates of interest and floating 
rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR. 
The private placement notes in March 2007 and July 2008 and the public notes in May 2009, May 2012 and 
December 2012 were all issued at fixed rates, whilst the group’s investments and bank borrowings were all  
at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR. 
The group’s interest risk policy requires Treasury to fix a proportion of its interest exposure on a sliding scale in  
US dollars, sterling and Euro, using the natural mix of fixed and floating interest rates emanating from the bond and 
bank markets and by utilising interest rate and cross currency swaps. Part of the proceeds of the private placement 
and public notes have been swapped to floating interest rates and accounted for as fair value hedges, with a net gain 
at 31 December 2015 of £40m (2014: net gain £49m). The market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps 
and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross currency swaps outstanding at 31 December 2015, accounted for as cash flow 
hedges, was a net liability of £36m (2014: net gain £9m).
Foreign currency 
The group has many overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, denominated in various different currencies. Treasury 
policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt/
EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, where possible. The group does not use foreign 
exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans. The group believes  
that cash flow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets. 
At 31 December 2015, the group’s US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 83% and 90% respectively, 
hedged by foreign currency loans. As at 31 December 2015, net debt held in US dollar and Euro and in those 
currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.5 times EBITDA generated  
from these currencies (2014: 2.3 times EBITDA). 
Tax policy
The group’s policy in relation to tax is as follows:
• we manage our tax affairs responsibly and transparently; 
• we only undertake tax planning which aligns with our commercial and economic activity;
• we endeavour to fully involve our tax team in all significant business developments so that we can fully assess  
any potential tax consequences of our actions in advance;
• we utilise tax incentives, reliefs and exemptions in line with the tax legislation;
• in international matters, we follow the terms of the relevant Double Tax Treaties and OECD guidelines in dealing 
with such issues as transfer pricing and establishing tax presence;
• we actively seek open dialogue with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and other tax authorities,  
in pursuit of a professional relationship of constructive compliance, with the aim of achieving early agreement  
on disputed items and obtaining certainty where possible;
• we provide all relevant information when requested to do so by HMRC or other tax authorities;
• if we discover errors in tax returns or correspondence with tax authorities, we disclose and correct them promptly; and
• we take an active role in contributing to the UK and international tax policy-making process, where relevant, 
including taking part in formal and informal consultations.
The group operates in a large number of countries and is typically subject to tax in those jurisdictions. The group 
employs an in-house team of tax professionals who interface with the regional and country business and finance 
teams to manage the group’s tax risks in a controlled and proactive manner. The complex international tax environment 
means that there is always an element of tax risk and uncertainty inherent within the group’s operations. Group 
companies are routinely subject to tax audits which can take a considerable period of time to conclude. As and  
when appropriate, the group obtains advice from external professional firms to support its positions.
As a high-profile provider of public services, the group considers it is important that we increase the public’s 
understanding of tax matters and their trust in larger corporate groups by being transparent about our tax affairs 
and cooperating with the tax authorities.
By responsibly managing the group’s tax affairs in line with our tax policy, the group is also adhering fully to the 
Confederation of British Industry’s seven tax principles.
Corporate governance 
The group’s policies regarding risk management and corporate governance are set out in the Risk management 
section on pages 46 to 54 and in the Corporate governance report on pages 60 to 73.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of G4S plc
106 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Context
The context of our audit is set by 2015 being our first year as external auditors of the group. As part of our audit 
transition, we performed specific procedures over opening balances by shadowing the prior year audit undertaken 
by the predecessor auditor, reviewing the predecessor auditor working papers in the UK and where permitted by 
local regulations in each of the group’s in-scope countries, and re-evaluating the key management judgements in  
the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2015.
We performed year one process walkthroughs to understand and evaluate the key financial processes and controls 
across the group and, in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410,  
a review of the half year financial information. As a result of this work, we initiated alongside management early  
audit procedures on the group’s 30 September 2015 balance sheet (otherwise known as a hard close audit) in  
each of the group’s in-scope markets. The objective of the hard close audit was to ensure that each of our teams 
was appropriately orientated and able to decide what work needed to be done when and where at year-end, to 
enable early consideration of as many key accounting judgements as possible before the year-end and to identify  
any businesses or specific areas where additional audit attention might be required at year-end. 
The audit transition, half year review and hard close audit were important in determining our final 2015 group  
audit scope and areas of focus. 
As we undertook each phase of this first year audit, we regularly updated our risk assessment to reflect audit 
findings including our assessment of the group’s control environment. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs  
(UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where management made judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
Consistent with all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that represented a risk of material misstatement  
due to fraud, and the risk of fraud in revenue recognition. Procedures designed to address these risks included 
testing of material journal entries and post-close adjustments, testing and evaluating management’s key accounting 
estimates for reasonableness and consistency, undertaking cut-off procedures to check proper cut-off of revenue 
and expenses and testing the occurrence and accuracy of revenue transactions. In addition, we incorporate an 
element of unpredictability into our audit work each year. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources 
and effort, are identified as areas of focus in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to 
address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit. 
Area of focus
Onerous contract provisioning 
Certain of the group’s contracts are onerous and long-term in nature. These contracts can be complex and 
incorporate penalty and key performance indicator (“KPI”) clauses in the event of non-compliance. The group  
is therefore required to make operational and financial assumptions to estimate future losses over periods that  
can extend beyond 20 years. 
The prediction of future events contains inherent risk and a high degree of management judgement.
Variability of contract penalties, underlying delivery costs and customer disputes can put additional pressure  
on margins and on future contract profitability, giving rise to onerous contract provisions. 
The group’s onerous contract provisions at 31 December 2015 are £83m (2014: £47m). The income statement 
charge for onerous contracts in 2015 amounts to £65m.
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68 and to note 33 of the group financial statements. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
Our global approach to testing complex contracts starts with an evaluation of management’s process to identify  
and quantify onerous and at-risk contracts. Management focuses on the top 25 contracts by region and on contracts 
with margins of less than 3%. Our sampling of contracts focused our testing on higher risk and larger arrangements 
and enabled us to form an independent view as to whether management’s process had identified all onerous  
and at-risk contracts. In addition, we performed scanning analytics on contract margins and investigated unusual  
or unexpected trends to check inclusion of relevant contracts in management’s assessment. We subsequently  
evaluated the completeness of the group’s onerous contract provisions, focusing in particular on the larger and  
more judgemental arrangements. 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 107
Financial statements For each contract in our sample, we obtained and read the contractual terms and tested that the revenue recognised 
in the period was in accordance with the contractual terms and was supported by evidence of service delivery. We 
read and understood the contract penalty clauses and evaluated the completeness of penalties through discussions 
with contract managers and reading meeting minutes between G4S and the customer and customer correspondence. 
We assessed each of the key assumptions used in management’s forecasts to identify and quantify onerous contract 
provisions. Where possible, we obtained third party evidence to corroborate management’s assumptions and 
assessed the appropriateness of the company’s forecasts based on past performance. The group’s policy is to  
include the benefits of performance improvement plans only where there is evidence of plans being achievable.  
We critically challenged these benefits based on observable benefits achieved to date and the extent to which  
these plans are within the group’s direct control. 
We assessed the appropriateness of the discount rate used to present value the obligation and checked that the 
rate appropriately reflected the risk in the underlying cash flows. 
We also challenged the recoverability of dedicated contract assets where the contract was identified as onerous.  
We are satisfied that assets directly attributable to delivering onerous contracts have been appropriately impaired  
at 31 December 2015. 
Having examined management’s analysis, our procedures focused on the Facilities Management and Care and  
Justice businesses in the UK and specifically on the legacy Compass and PFI contract which are long-term in nature, 
sensitive to changes in assumptions and have given rise to material changes in provisioning levels at year-end. 
In respect of the Compass contract, we performed our own independent sensitivity analysis noting that the 
provision is most sensitive to changes in assumptions of user numbers and timing of contract termination. Our 
sensitivity analysis highlighted that small movements in these key assumptions have a significant impact on the 
year-end provision. 
For both Compass and the legacy PFI contract, we also held discussions with group and regional legal counsel  
and read appropriate documentation to understand the legal position to evaluate customer claims and to assess  
any issues with the interpretation of contracts.
From the evidence obtained, we did not identify any incremental onerous contracts over and above the arrangements 
identified by management’s own procedures. We considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context 
of the group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and judgements that 
are required to formulate the provisions mean that the range of possible outcomes is broad. We are satisfied with 
the group’s related disclosures of these onerous contracts and the associated sensitivities in light of the underlying 
assumptions and accounting judgements made.
Goodwill impairment 
The group has £1 .83bn of goodwill at 31 December 2015 (2014: £1.92bn).
During the year, the group recognised an impairment charge of £66m largely relating to the Estonia (£25m),  
South Africa Cash (£9m), Brazil Technology (£12m), Serbia (£8m), Papua New Guinea (£5m) and China Systems 
(£4m) cash generating units (“CGUs”). With the exception of Estonia, all impairments related to businesses  
classified by management as portfolio businesses held for sale or closure. 
Management determines the recoverable amount of a CGU as the higher of value in use (“VIU”) or fair value less 
cost of disposal (“FVLCD”) for continuing operations. For portfolio businesses where management is committed  
to either sell or exit the business, a market valuation or market participant cash flows are used. 
The carrying value of goodwill is contingent on future cash flows and there is risk if these cash flows do not meet 
the group’s expectations that the assets will be impaired. The impairment reviews performed by the group contain  
a number of significant judgements and estimates including revenue growth, profit margins, cash conversion and 
long-term growth and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the headroom 
available in the impairment calculations.
In the current year, management has revised its specific cash flow forecasting period from 15 years to five years  
to align the forecast projections to the group’s budgeting period. 
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68 and to note 18 of the group financial statements. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We assessed the mathematical accuracy of management’s cash flow model and appropriateness of the change  
in the forecast period. The forecast period was found to be in line with the group’s budget and strategic outlook. 
We agreed the underlying forecasts to board approved budgets and assessed how these budgets were compiled. 
With the support of our valuations experts, we assessed the terminal growth rates and discount rates applied  
by management to third party information and confirmed they fell within a reasonable range of external market 
data. Where they did not, we applied our independent view of a more appropriate rate to management’s forecast. 
Independent auditor’s report to the members of G4S plc continued
Report on the financial statements
108 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 We considered the reliability of management’s forecasting for revenue, profit and cash conversion by comparing 
budgeted results to actual performance over a period of two years which we considered appropriate. Where we 
identified significant shortfalls against budget in prior years, this informed our determination of sensitivities to apply 
as we formed our independent view about reasonable downside scenarios.
We performed our own risk assessment by considering historical performance, forecasting accuracy and modelled 
headroom to highlight the CGUs with either a lower headroom or which are more sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions. We also considered the valuation multiple implied by management’s estimate. Following these 
procedures, we focused our attention on the Estonia, South Africa Cash, Brazil Security and Greece CGUs. 
We performed our own sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in the assumptions on the available 
headroom. We focused in particular on Estonia and Brazil Security which are more sensitive to changes in 
assumptions than other CGUs. 
Our sensitivity analysis highlighted that the Estonia and Brazil Security CGUs were particularly sensitive to changes  
in the discount rate. The Estonia CGU was also found to be sensitive to changes in future growth rates. We critically 
challenged management’s forecast by comparing growth forecast to actual growth to date and to IMF projections. 
Based on our procedures we are satisfied that the £25m impairment for Estonia is appropriate. 
Where the recoverable amount has been assessed with reference to a valuation multiple, including for portfolio 
businesses, we assessed the appropriateness of the multiple by comparison to recent business disposals and to other 
third party information. With the support of our valuations experts, these multiples were found to be within a reasonable 
range. Based on our procedures we are satisfied that the £12m impairment for Brazil T echnology is appropriate. 
The recoverable amount of a number of CGUs including UK Cash Solutions, Brazil Secure Solutions, China, Denmark, 
Greece, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala and Zambia were found to be sensitive to reasonably possible 
changes in assumptions and we satisfied ourselves that this risk is appropriately highlighted in the disclosures in note 18. 
As a result of our work, we determined that the quantum of the impairment recognised in 2015 was appropriate 
and adequate disclosure has been made. 
Restatements 
A number of prior period errors have been identified either as a result of our opening balance sheet procedures  
or from management’s review of the group’s balance sheet. Each of these adjustments was deemed to be material 
to the consolidated financial statements and has been restated accordingly as set out in note 3(w). The cumulative 
impact of these restatements was £48m on opening reserves at 1 January 2015 and a £7m reduction to profit in 2014.
Denmark alarms accounting 
We undertook a detailed review of the group’s accounting for alarm sales in Denmark. Considering both the legal 
form and economic substance of these arrangements, this review resulted in management making a number of 
changes to revenue recognition practices for sales of rental and non-rental alarms. In addition, the group’s historical 
treatment of sale and leaseback transactions as operating rather than finance in nature was found to be inappropriate. 
In both cases, the errors had given rise to the acceleration of recognition of profit in prior years. The cumulative 
impact of these errors on the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2015 was £28m.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We assessed whether the prior year accounting practices were appropriate and in accordance with IFRS given the 
legal form and economic substance of the arrangements between the group, its customers and the leasing company. 
The change in accounting approach was supported by corroborating evidence such as underlying contractual 
arrangements, the net present value of future lease payments and the useful economic life of the alarms. 
We performed audit procedures to test the completeness, accuracy and valuation of the adjustments made by 
management and to confirm that the group’s disclosures in respect of this restatement as disclosed in note 3  
were reasonable. 
Africa balance sheet review 
Following the appointment of new regional leadership in 2015, the ongoing review of the Africa balance sheet was 
completed. The review was performed on a country-by-country basis and focused on the recoverability of assets, 
completeness of liabilities and reconciliations between the underlying country ledgers and group consolidation 
system. Following this review, a number of adjustments were identified amounting to £26m in aggregate. 
An analysis was subsequently performed by management to assess whether the adjustments represented a prior 
period error or change in estimate. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
With the assistance of our regional and country component audit teams, we examined management’s analysis  
on a country-by-country basis and assessed the validity and accuracy of each of the adjustments. This work was 
further supported by our 2015 substantive audit procedures in the in-scope African countries. 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 109
Financial statements We assessed management’s classification of each adjustment as either an error or change in estimate and the 
group’s disclosure of items as such in note 3(w). Based on these procedures, we determined that the amounts 
deemed by management to be prior period errors and subject to restatement were consistent with the findings 
from our audit and that appropriate disclosure has been made.
Accounting for acquisitions and disposals in North America between 2007 and 2014
A number of prior period adjustments have arisen from the accounting for acquisitions and disposals in North 
America between 2007 and 2014. These adjustments mainly relate to the incorrect recognition of deferred tax 
liabilities and associated goodwill on US acquisitions in 2008 and 2009. In addition, certain errors were identified 
relating to the calculation of profits or losses on disposal of businesses in 2014 including the need to recycle 
cumulative foreign exchange from reserves on disposal of overseas subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of these 
errors on the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2015 was £6m. 
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68 and to note 3(w) of the group financial statements. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We assessed the validity and accuracy of each adjustment with reference to the company’s initial acquisition and 
disposal accounting judgements taken in prior years, underlying tax reconciliations and composition of reserves.  
As part of this assessment, we considered the root cause of the underlying errors and performed additional audit 
testing in North America and on the group’s reserve balances in order to satisfy ourselves that no further material 
errors remained undetected. Based on these procedures, we satisfied ourselves that the adjustments identified  
were reasonable.
For each of the three prior period errors subject to restatement, which are described above, we considered 
whether similar errors had arisen elsewhere in the group. We did not identify any other errors impacting prior  
years that are material individually or in aggregate. No other material items arose from our procedures on the 
opening balance sheet. 
Uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets 
The group operates in a complex multinational tax environment and is subject to a range of tax matters during  
the normal course of business including transaction related tax matters and transfer pricing arrangements. 
Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, the group establishes provisions based on management’s judgement 
of the probable amount of the future liability. At 31 December 2015, the group has recognised provisions of £16m 
related to uncertain tax positions (2014: £22m). 
In addition, the group has recognised £187m of deferred tax assets at 31 December 2015 (2014: £192m). The 
recognition of deferred tax assets involves judgement by management regarding the likelihood of the realisation  
of these assets. The expectation that these assets will be realised is dependent on a number of factors, including 
whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support utilisation of these assets. 
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68 and to notes 13 and 34 of the group financial statements. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
With the assistance of our local and international tax specialists, we evaluated and challenged management’s 
judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of the 
group’s tax provisions. 
In understanding and evaluating management’s judgements, we considered the status of recent and current  
tax authority audits and enquiries, judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates and 
developments in the tax environment. Where appropriate, we also read appropriate documentation to understand 
the legal positions reached. From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable  
in the context of the group financial statements taken as a whole. However, we noted that the assumptions and 
judgements that are required to formulate the provisions mean that is there a broad range of possible outcomes. 
In respect of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we evaluated the management’s assessment of whether there 
will be sufficient taxable profits in future periods to support the recognition of deferred tax assets. We evaluated  
the directors’ future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were prepared ensuring consistency of cash 
flows with those used for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. Based on our procedures, future cash flow 
forecasts were both consistent with those used for impairment testing and supported the recoverability of the 
deferred tax assets recognised. 
In light of 2015 being a first year audit, we deployed our transfer pricing specialists to evaluate the appropriateness 
of the group’s transfer pricing methodology, to consider recent experience with relevant tax authorities and to 
identify areas of heightened risk to focus our audit testing. Our procedures provided us with evidence that the 
related tax provisions, and disclosure thereof are materially appropriate and complete.
Independent auditor’s report to the members of G4S plc continued
Report on the financial statements
110 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Control environment 
The geographical span and decentralised structure of the group, coupled with the current disparate systems 
landscape and evolving control environment, means that there is an increased risk of errors remaining undetected 
and aggregating to cause a material misstatement to the group financial statements. 
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68 and to note 3(w) in the group financial statements. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
In recognition of the group’s scale and decentralised structure and aligning to the group’s regional management 
structure, we deployed teams in each of the group’s regions to lead our interactions with regional management,  
to coordinate the audit work performed at a country component level and to audit and report on the aggregated 
financial information of that region.
As part of our first year audit procedures, we performed year one process walkthroughs to understand and 
evaluate the group’s control environment. Considering the findings from these procedures and from our half year 
review, we initiated alongside management a hard close audit across all in-scope markets covering the 30 September 
2015 balance sheet to enable the early identification of any accounting issues in advance of year-end. Based on the 
findings from our hard close audit, we instructed our component teams not to seek to rely on financial controls  
at the local business level but to perform a substantive audit focused on transaction testing and on the integrity  
of the year-end balance sheet. That said, we were able to leverage a number of process and control developments 
implemented at the regional level (including Regional Risk and Audit Committees, contract reviews and balance 
sheet reviews) in determining where to direct our audit attention.
With the support of our regional teams, we determined the entities to be included in our year-end group audit scope 
based on those locations with significant risk and those which contribute a significant amount to material line items 
in the group financial statements. Recognising the systemic risk associated with the current control and IT environment, 
all entities which contributed more than 1% of consolidated revenue were included in our year-end scope. 
We applied a reduction to our overall materiality to set a performance materiality benchmark that we use to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of our detailed audit procedures. Our performance materiality benchmark 
reflects the group’s evolving control environment, the risk of multiple misstatements resulting in a material misstatement 
and the history of past audit adjustments. 
Wherever we identified audit adjustments, including but not limited to the prior period errors subject to restatement, 
we instructed our regional and country component teams to assess whether similar errors had arisen elsewhere. 
While we did identify audit differences across the group, management recorded the more significant items meaning 
that the uncorrected items reported to the Audit Committee were considered to be immaterial for adjustment, 
both individually and in aggregate.
Income statement presentation
The group has historically reported specific and other items (including restructuring costs) which are disclosed 
separately on the face of the income statement and which are excluded from management’s reporting of the 
underlying results of the business. Consistent with the company’s definition of profit before interest, tax and 
amortisation (“PBITA”), the following items have continued to be disclosed separately on the face of the income 
statement in 2015: net specific items £70m (2014: £57m); restructuring costs £44m (2014: £29m); goodwill 
impairments £66m (2014: £nil); and profit on disposal of subsidiaries £12m (2014: £nil). 
The treatment of specific and other separately disclosed items is explained in the group accounting policy in note 3(c). 
We focused on this area because the classification of items as specific requires judgement and because certain  
of these items are excluded from the calculation of elements of executive remuneration in line with the group’s 
remuneration policy. Consistency in the identification and presentation of these items is important to ensure 
comparability of year-on-year reporting in the Annual Report. 
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68 and to note 3(c) of the group financial statements. 
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We substantiated the nature and quantum of individual items to appropriate corroborating evidence. 
We considered whether the designation of individual items as specific was consistent with the group’s accounting 
policy and treatment in prior years.
We considered whether the group has taken a balanced approach to this area, checking that exceptional one-off 
items of income are treated consistently with one-off items of cost. 
We tested management’s process for identifying and tracking the current year reversal of any prior year specific 
items, or utilisation of or adjustment to related provisions, to identify whether these have been appropriately 
presented in the current year income statement. 
Based on our procedures, we were satisfied that the treatment and classification of these items were consistent 
year-on-year and with the group’s policies. 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 111
Financial statements Going concern
The group has £1.78bn of net debt at 31 December 2015 (2014: £1.64bn). This includes committed bank facilities 
and private placement loan notes that are subject to financial covenants. The covenant restricts net debt to 3.5x the 
group’s EBITDA subject to certain adjustments. During the year, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA has deteriorated.
Any breach of these financial covenants could impact the group’s access to financing which could in turn impact  
the going concern basis under which the group’s financial statements have been prepared. Predicting the future 
covenant compliance and liquidity position of the group is based on profit and cash flow projections which are 
inherently judgemental. 
Refer to Audit Committee report on page 68.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
In assessing the appropriateness of management adopting the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements, we obtained and examined management’s budgets and forecasts for the 12 month period from the date 
the financial statements were approved, checking that these forecasts have been subject to board review and approval. 
We considered the historical reliability of management’s forecasting for EBITDA, cash flow and net debt by 
comparing budgeted results to actual performance over a period of two years, which we considered appropriate.
Management’s base case forecasts show sufficient resources being available to the group over the 12 month  
period from the date of approval of the financial statements to allow the group to continue to execute its strategy. 
In addition, management has prepared a downside case modelling a series of risk factors, including no further  
benefit from disposal proceeds and a deterioration in working capital performance. Under this downside scenario, 
management’s forecasts continue to demonstrate covenant compliance and liquidity headroom compared to the 
group’s borrowing limits during the 12 month going concern period.
We performed our own independent sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in EBITDA, cash flow 
and net debt on the resources available to the group. Our independent sensitivity analysis also demonstrated that 
sufficient resources would be in place.
In addition, we recalculated the year-end covenants at 31 December 2015 using a consistent methodology  
to covenant certificates historically provided to the group’s lenders. 
Based on this work, we were satisfied that the preparation of these financial statements on a going concern basis  
is appropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on  
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographical structure of the group, the accounting 
processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates. 
The group is structured into six geographical regions being Asia Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America, North 
America and the UK & Ireland (“UK&I”). A seventh corporate head office region is managed at a group level. Each 
geographical region (“regional component”) is an aggregation of a number of country-based components along with 
the group’s interests in joint ventures (together the “country components”). Each geographical region has a separate 
management team which coordinates the businesses within that region. 
The group’s accounting processes are structured around a local finance function in each of the country components, 
with the exception of the UK&I and North America regions where there are finance shared service centres supporting 
the UK and North American based businesses respectively. The country components report to the regions and to 
the group through an integrated consolidation system.
In performing our audit, we determined that we needed to conduct audit work over the complete financial information 
of each of the regional components. We therefore deployed regional component audit teams in each of the six 
regions to lead our interactions with regional management, to coordinate the audit work performed on the country 
components and to audit and report on the aggregated financial information of that region. In addition to the six 
regional components, we performed audit testing over the corporate head office region at a group level. Further 
specific audit procedures over central functions, the group consolidation and areas of significant judgement (including 
taxation, goodwill and intangible assets impairment, treasury and post-retirement benefits) were directly led by the 
group audit team.
Recognising that not every country component in each regional component is included in our group audit scope, 
we considered as part of our group audit oversight responsibility what audit coverage had been obtained in aggregate 
by our regional component teams by reference to country components at which audit work had been undertaken. 
Beneath the regional component layer, the group financial statements are an aggregation of over 700 reporting units, 
each of which is considered to be a country component. We identified 108 country component units that, in our 
view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size or risk characteristics. Specific audit 
procedures over significant balances and transactions were performed at a further 17 country component units to give 
appropriate coverage of all material balances. None of the country components excluded from our group audit scope 
individually contributed more than 1% to consolidated revenue or to consolidated profit before tax. 
Independent auditor’s report to the members of G4S plc continued
Report on the financial statements
112 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Where the work was performed by regional and country component audit teams, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components. As a result, five of the six regions were 
visited by senior members of the group audit team as a supplement to the regular dialogue between our group  
and regional teams and the issuance of instructions to direct their work. Regional teams visited a further 10 country 
components performing oversight procedures under our instruction. Given the restatements identified during the 
year relating to Denmark alarms, Africa balance sheet review and accounting for North America acquisitions and 
disposals, all three components were visited by senior members of the group audit team. For those components  
in group audit scope where a site visit was not undertaken, our group and our regional component audit teams’ 
involvement included regular dialogue with our country component teams, review of component auditor work 
papers and participation in certain component audit clearance meetings. We also held a two day audit planning 
workshop in London attended by our regional component teams, largely focused on the extensive planning of  
audit transition and our first year audit. 
Taken together, the components and functions where we performed our audit work accounted for 86% of 
consolidated revenue, 78% of consolidated profit before tax and 87% of consolidated adjusted profit before tax. 
This was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the regional  
and group levels, including disaggregated analytical review procedures and our evaluation of entity level controls, 
which covers a significant portion of the group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included 
in our group audit scope. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures  
and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the consolidated financial statements as  
a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £13 million
How we determined it Approximately 5% of profit before tax (£78m), adjusted for non-recurring 
items, comprising net specific items (£70m), goodwill impairments (£66m), 
restructuring (£44m) and profit on disposal of businesses (£12m). 
Rationale for benchmark applied The group’s principal measure of earnings is profit before interest, tax and 
amortisation adjusted for a number of items of income and expenditure 
including those detailed above (“PBITA”). Management uses this measure 
as it believes that it reflects the underlying performance of the group. We 
took this measure into account in determining our materiality, except that 
we did not adjust profit before tax to add back acquisition-related 
amortisation and interest as in our view these are recurring items which 
do not introduce volatility to the group’s earnings. 
Component materiality For each regional and country component in our audit scope, we allocated 
a materiality that was less than overall group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated to each regional component was between £2m and 
£9.5m and to each country component was between £0.05m and £9m. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£700,000 as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 95, in relation to going 
concern. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention 
to in relation to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw to your attention other that 
the matters we have described in the going concern area of focus above. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group and parent company 
have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year 
from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit, we have concluded that the directors’ use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 95, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in  
giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to  
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing  
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. With respect to the strategic report and Directors’ report, we consider whether those reports 
include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 119
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
1. General information
G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial statements of the company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the company (collectively comprising 
the group) and the group’s interest in jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year. The group 
operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most significant being the euro,  
the US dollar and sterling. The group’s financial statements are presented in sterling, as the group’s primary listing  
is in the UK. The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover. 
2. Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (adopted IFRSs). The company has adopted FRS 101 
(“Reduced Disclosure Framework”) for the preparation of its parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). These are presented on pages 189 to 201. 
3. Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and  
using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.  
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. Judgements made by the directors in the application  
of those accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a 
significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4. 
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been restated to reflect prior 
year adjustments in respect of certain alarm sales and related leases in Denmark, prior year errors identified in 
Africa and for errors in respect of accounting for acquisitions, disposals and related tax balances in North America 
between 2007 and 2014. 
The consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been re-presented to reflect the 
re-classification of certain discontinued businesses that have not been sold within one year from the date they were 
classified into discontinued operations, into continuing operations. This re-classification has resulted in continuing 
revenue increasing by £41m, and continuing operating profit reducing by £7m, for the year ended 31 December 
2014. In addition, £3m in respect of certain employee-related costs in Latin America has been re-classified to PBITA 
rather than tax in 2014 to align with the presentation within the 2015 results.
The consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2014 and at 1 January 2014 have been re-presented  
to show separately the £75m retirement benefit surplus within the GSL section of the UK defined benefit pension 
scheme, and for the re-classification of £16m of cash balances in North America previously reported within investments.
Further details of restatements and re-classifications are provided in note 3(w).
(b) Presentation of the income statement
In order to provide further clarity in the group’s consolidated income statement and segmental analysis, the group 
separately discloses specific items, restructuring costs, profits or losses on disposal of subsidiaries, acquisition-related 
amortisation and expenses and goodwill impairment. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is 
measured by management and reported to the Board and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the underlying 
results of the group. The directors believe that presentation of the group’s results in this way aids the understanding 
of the group’s financial performance.
(c) Specific items and other separately disclosed items
Specific items
The group’s consolidated income statement and segmental analysis note separately identify results before specific items. 
Specific items are those that in management’s judgement need to be disclosed separately in arriving at operating profit 
by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management 
considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Specific items include the results of updating estimates and judgements for certain assets and liabilities related  
to the balance sheet review performed in 2013, where a group-wide review of the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities as at 31 December 2012 was performed. This exercise resulted in a number of assets being impaired as 
well as a number of provisions for onerous contracts and liabilities being recorded, as indicated in the 2013 annual 
report. Changes to the estimates made in relation to the liabilities and provisions then identified have since been 
classified as specific, including top-ups and reversal of provisions. The group has completed this review in 2015.  
All future related changes in estimates will flow through underlying results, unless these are individually material.
Contract losses included within specific items arise from the recognition of material future losses, net of the release 
of any surplus provisions. In general, provisions recognised for future losses are charged to the consolidated income 
statement within PBITA. Where onerous contract provisions are material by virtue of their size, they are separately 
charged within specific items. Such losses are distinct from “in-year” losses, which are utilised against provisions for 
onerous contract losses. Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
Specific items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 8.
120 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Other separately disclosed items
In order to provide further clarity in the consolidated income statement, the group also discloses separately 
restructuring costs, profits or losses on disposal of subsidiaries, acquisition-related amortisation and expenses  
and goodwill impairment.
Restructuring costs that are separately disclosed reflect the multi-year efficiency programme which is being carried 
out by the group. This programme is of a strategic nature and, as such, is monitored and approved by the group’s 
Executive Committee. During 2014 and 2015 activities under the programme have focused primarily on transforming 
the operating model in the regions of UK & Ireland and Europe. During the second half of 2015 this programme 
began to address organisational efficiency in Latin America, Africa, Asia and North America. Restructuring costs that 
are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded as part of the group’s underlying trading results and are 
not separately disclosed.
(d) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control is achieved where the group has existing rights that give  
it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the group’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns 
from the entity. This can be determined either by the group’s ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder 
agreement. In the case of certain investments detailed analysis of the different contracts in place is required, together 
with a level of judgement, to ascertain whether there is control under the definition of IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated 
financial statements’ (see note 4).
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets 
transferred as consideration to the vendor and does not include transaction costs. Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of 
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to  
the income statement in the year of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that  
in respect of put options held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition. For acquisitions 
prior to 1 January 2010 subsequent changes to the present value of the estimate of contingent consideration and 
any difference upon final settlement of such a liability are recognised as adjustments to the cost of acquisition. For 
acquisitions after 1 January 2010 such changes are recognised in the income statement with respect to contingent 
consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put options. Non-controlling interests are stated 
at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Profits and losses are applied in the 
proportion of their respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interests. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the effective date of control and up to the effective date of disposal, respectively. 
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets  
of the arrangement.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the group’s consolidated financial 
statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are 
carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the 
group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The group’s 
share of post-tax profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Where a group 
company transacts with a joint venture of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s 
interest in the relevant joint venture. 
(e) Foreign currencies
The financial statements of each of the group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to  
that business. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at  
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in 
other currencies are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement 
for the period. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expenses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period (unless this is 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 121
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). Exchange differences arising are recognised in 
other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance  
a part of the group’s net investment in foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective.  
On disposal, translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation  
is disposed of. 
(f) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the 
group’s exposure to financial risk, not for trading purposes. Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the group’s 
variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the group’s fixed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its 
diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the group’s results and on the 
translation of the group’s net assets measured in foreign currencies. The group manages these risks through a range  
of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, commodity swaps, 
commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as financial assets 
or liabilities at fair value. 
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the 
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting where the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature  
of the item being hedged as described below:
Fair value hedges
The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item  
is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Cash flow and net investment hedges 
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge  
is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow or hedged 
net investment impacts the income statement. The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument  
is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
(g) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method. Goodwill arising  
on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.  
No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary as this  
is accounted for as an equity transaction. Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and  
is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired. On 
disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of  
the profit or loss on disposal. 
Acquisition-related intangible assets 
Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair 
value at the date of acquisition. Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer 
contracts and customer relationships. The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference 
to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation 
techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method. 
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic lives. 
The directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for 
any impairment in value. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Trademarks and technology    up to a maximum of five years 
Customer contracts and customer relationships   up to a maximum of ten years
Other intangible assets 
Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group. 
Such expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure 
creates an identifiable asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic 
benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development. 
In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
3. Significant accounting policies continued 
(e) Foreign currencies continued
122 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to  
be revenue-producing, up to a maximum of ten years. The directors review the capitalised development expenditure 
on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value. 
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred. 
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation 
is charged on software so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual 
instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of eight years. 
(h) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land. Depreciation is calculated  
so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their 
expected useful economic lives as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold buildings   up to 50 years 
Short leasehold buildings (under 50 years)   over the life of the lease  
Equipment and motor vehicles    2 to 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful economic lives and  
the terms of the relevant lease.
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are  
re-assessed annually. 
(i) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instruments. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost less provision 
for doubtful debts. Provisions are made where the group identifies a risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, 
previous losses experienced and other local economic and market conditions and are calculated by discounting 
expected cash flows using the effective interest rate at origination of the receivable. 
Service concession assets 
Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) or similar project, the risks and rewards of ownership of an  
asset remain largely with the purchaser of the associated services. In such cases, the group’s interest in the asset is 
classified as a financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade and other receivables, to the extent to 
which the group has an unconditional right to receive cash from the grantor of the concession for the construction 
of the asset. T o the extent that the group has the right to charge for the use of such an asset, conditional upon the 
extent of the use, the group recognises an intangible asset. 
Current asset investments 
Current asset investments comprise investments in securities which are classified as held-for-trading. Such investments 
are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value. Gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and that form an integral part of the group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flow.
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate method. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
(j) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenditure incurred in the 
ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate 
overheads. Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the first-in-first-out method. Net realisable value 
is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

(k) Impairment 
The carrying value of the group’s assets, with the exception of inventories, financial receivables and deferred tax 
assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets’ 
recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying 
value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount. The amount of the 
reversal is limited such that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined 
(after depreciation and amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
(l) Employee benefits 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the group’s 
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting 
from the calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, net interest 
cost, and past service cost. The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the remaining 
service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement. Actuarial gains and 
losses and other remeasurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of share-based payments 
is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. The amount expensed is 
adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, 
excluding changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions. The group also issues cash-settled 
share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant.  
The value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date the liability is settled. Changes in  
the liability are recognised directly in the income statement.
(m) Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a 
past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The amount recognised as a provision 
is the group’s best estimate of the cost of settlement at the end of the reporting period. 
In respect of claims and litigation, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered 
probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. For all risks, the ultimate liability may vary 
from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement. Management 
exercise judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 33) through assessing the 
likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and in quantifying the possible range of financial outcomes.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure 
using an appropriate discount rate. 
(n) Restructuring provisions
A restructuring provision is recognised when the group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring 
and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement 
the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision 
includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both 
necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
The group distinguishes between restructuring costs that are recurring and those that relate to one-off  
or transformational group programmes that impact a number of operations. 
Recurring restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded as part of the group’s 
underlying trading results within profit before interest, tax and amortisation (PBITA).
Restructuring costs that are one-off and individually material or relate to programmes linked to the group’s wider 
transformation and require approval at executive level are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.
124 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 (o) Revenue recognition 
The group’s revenue arises from two primary sources – “Secure solutions” products, mainly comprising  
manned security and facilities management services, and “Cash solutions”, mainly the provision of physical  
cash management services. 
Within “Secure solutions” there are additional revenue streams arising from:
• Technology services, comprising the supply, installation and monitoring of alarm systems, and security and building 
systems technology; 
• Facilities management; and 
• Care and justice services.
Within “Cash solutions” there is an additional revenue stream arising from technology services, comprising  
the provision of hardware and bundled software for the processing of cash receipts by customers.
In all of these business areas revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable,  
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Certain low volume high value government contracts, mainly for care and justice outsourcing services and facilities 
management services, can cover a range of bundled services over a long period of time, that are provided on a time 
and materials basis. Revenue for these types of contracts is recognised on an accruals basis based on the individual 
services provided and in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Where services provided to customers include more than one particular revenue source, such as the supply  
and installation of alarms together with an on-going maintenance contract, the fair value of each revenue source  
is separately identified and allocated to each element of the arrangement.
Manned security, cash management, facilities management, other care and justice services and security systems services
Revenue is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Security alarm systems installations
Revenue for B2B customers is recognised on completion of the installation, and the attributable costs of the 
installation are recognised as a cost of sale, given that the risks and rewards associated with the asset are transferred 
to the customer. This is a change in accounting policy from previous years, where the attributable costs were capitalised 
and depreciated over the useful life of the assets (see note 3(w)).
Revenue for B2C customers is deferred and recognised along with the revenue from the related monitoring  
service over the term of the contract given that legal and economic ownership of the assets remains with the group.  
This is a change in accounting policy from previous years, where the revenue was recognised on completion of the 
installation (see note 3(w)).
Service and monitoring fees for all alarm system contracts are recognised in the period when the service is provided.
Long-term construction contracts 
These contracts mainly relate to long-term construction of alarm or other technology installation projects, which 
span one or more reporting periods and where long-term contract accounting is applied. 
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured by the 
proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs. Variations  
in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed 
with the customer and hence recoverable.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to 
the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as 
expenses as they are incurred. 
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised 
immediately as an expense.
(p) Pre-contract and mobilisation costs
Pre-contract costs in respect of major outsourcing contracts, incurred after the point at which the group achieves 
preferred bidder status (at which point it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained) and before 
contract mobilisation, are capitalised and expensed over the life of the contract, subject to recoverability criteria. 
Costs incurred prior to this point are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs are expensed immediately in the  
event that preferred bidder status is not followed by the award of the contract, or where these may no longer  
be expected to be recovered through future profits.
Mobilisation costs are those costs incurred after the signing of a contract with a customer, and prior to 
commencement of delivery of the contract. Costs incurred during this stage are generally only capitalised if the 
criteria to be capitalised as inventories or as property, plant and equipment are met. In all other cases mobilisation 
costs are expensed as incurred.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
(q) Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Management profit improvement plans  
to recover the position on loss-making contracts require a level of judgement and are generally taken into account 
in the calculation of the onerous contract provision only when implementation has commenced and tangible evidence 
exists of benefits being delivered. The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the contract.
In general, provisions recognised for future losses are charged to the consolidated income statement within  
PBITA. Where onerous contract provisions are material by virtue of their size, they are separately charged within 
specific items. 
In-year operating losses from onerous contracts are accounted for as a utilisation of the related provision for future 
losses. Any excess or shortfall to the initial estimate for onerous contract provisions is credited or charged in the 
consolidated income statement consistent with where the charge for the initial provision was recognised. 
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the group has committed to a course of action that will result in 
the property becoming vacant. The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the lease 
taking into account expected future sub-lease income.
(r) Interest 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest  
rate applicable. This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of  
the financial asset’s net carrying amount. Borrowing costs, also calculated using the effective interest rate method,  
are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
(s) Income taxes 
Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised  
in equity, in which case it is recognised through other comprehensive income. The tax expense represents the sum  
of current tax and deferred tax. 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation 
of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and  
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the  
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset  
to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end  
of the reporting period. 
Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations  
of tax legislation and uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations where uncertainties 
exist, provision is made for tax liabilities and assets on the basis of management judgement following consideration 
of the available relevant information. Further detail on management’s judgement in respect of taxation is provided  
in note 4.
126 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 (t) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. On occasion this classification requires a level of judgement. All other leases are classified 
as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at  
the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments made or received are 
apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce  
a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset. 
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis  
over the lease term, as are incentives to enter into operating leases. 
(u) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale 
is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The group 
must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one 
year from the date of classification. 
A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s business that represents a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed 
of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. 
(v) Dividend distribution 
Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved  
by the shareholders in general meeting.
(w) Prior year restatement and re-classifications
Prior year restatement
During the year the group identified prior year errors that required the restatement of the results for the year 
ended 31 December 2014, as well as the consolidated statements of financial position as at 31 December 2014  
and at 1 January 2014 due to their materiality. The nature of these restatements is as follows:
1.  The revenue recognition policy previously applied in respect of the supply and installation of alarm systems  
in Europe, together with the underlying assumptions used in 2007 at inception of certain related sale and 
leaseback transactions entered into until 2013, were incorrect. These led to the incorrect timing of recognition 
of profit on installation of those alarm systems with upfront gains being recognised instead of being deferred 
over the life of the lease and to certain leases being classified as operating rather than as finance leases; 
2.  A number of legacy control weaknesses identified in the Africa region led management to perform a full 
review of the balance sheet in all countries of the region from which prior year errors were identified,  
mainly relating to cash reconciliations, under-accrual of employee and customer-related liabilities, incorrect 
classification of finance leases as operating leases and expenses incorrectly capitalised; and
3.  A number of errors in respect of the calculation of goodwill on certain acquisitions, gains and losses  
on certain disposals and related tax balances in North America between 2007 and 2014 mainly resulting  
in goodwill being overstated as at 1 January 2014 and at 31 December 2014 and profit on disposals in 2014 
being understated.
Prior year re-classifications 
The consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been re-presented to reflect the 
re-classification of certain discontinued businesses that have not been sold within one year from the date they  
were classified into discontinued operations, into continuing operations. This re-classification has resulted in continuing 
revenue increasing by £41m, and continuing PBITA reducing by £7m, for the year ended 31 December 2014. In 
addition, £3m in respect of certain employee-related costs in Latin America has been re-classified to PBITA rather 
than tax in 2014 to align with the presentation within the 2015 results.
The consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2014 and at 1 January 2014 have been re-presented 
to show separately the retirement benefit surplus within the GSL section of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, 
and for the re-classification of certain cash balances in North America previously reported within investments.
None of the prior year restatements or re-classifications impact the future cash generation of the group.

(x) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations 
The IASB issued a number of amendments to IFRSs that became applicable for the year ended 31 December 2015 
which the group has adopted. None of these amendments had a material impact on the group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
The group has not adopted early any standard, amendment or interpretation. A number of new standards, 
amendments to standards and interpretations have been announced but are not yet effective for the year ended  
31 December 2015. The directors are currently evaluating the impact of these new standards on the group accounts.
• IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
• Amendments to IFRS 11 – Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate  
or Joint V enture
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure initiative
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Investment entity amendments
The group continues to assess the potential impact of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on  
its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard from its new effective date for the year ended  
31 December 2018. 
In addition, the group notes the publication of IFRS 16 – Leases, will be effective for the group’s financial year ended 
31 December 2019 and will assess in due course the potential impact of this new standard on the group accounts.

4. Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 
3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and 
expenses during the reporting period. These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current 
and expected economic conditions, and, in some cases, actuarial techniques. Although these judgements, estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the 
actual results may differ. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates  
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most significance in preparing the group’s 2015 accounts 
are detailed below:
Revenue recognition
The majority of the group’s revenue is generated by the provision of manned security services or cash management 
services and, as described in note 3(o), is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. The 
group also delivers certain long-term outsourcing services which can be complex in nature and may be governed  
by unique contractual arrangements. In these cases, revenue is recognised in line with the contract at the fair value  
of the consideration received or receivable. In such contracts, there can be significant judgements and estimates  
in relation to variations or claims not specified within the original contract, to interpretation of complex contract 
wording, and in relation to estimates required to determine future costs to complete and expected margins, 
including the impact of contractual performance conditions which may give rise to penalties.
Onerous contracts
When a long-term contract is expected to incur future unavoidable losses and has therefore become onerous, 
judgement is required to assess the future expected revenue and costs and hence to determine the appropriate 
level of provision. Further judgement is necessary in determining the extent to which account is taken of profit 
improvement plans developed by management to improve the profitability of the contract over the remainder  
of its life. Such plans are generally taken into account only once they have been developed and implementation  
has commenced, and there is tangible evidence of benefits being delivered. 
In addition, where onerous contracts have a termination date that can be extended solely at the customer’s request, 
consideration is given, based on all facts and circumstances known by management, as to whether to provide for 
future losses to the earliest or the final termination date. 
For further details of how the group has applied judgements and estimates to significant onerous contract provisions refer 
to pages 164 and 165. The most significant judgement in 2015 related to the Compass contract as described in note 33.
Carrying value of goodwill
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more 
frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired. The impairment analysis for such assets is based 
principally upon discounted estimated future cash flows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Such an 
analysis includes the estimation of future results, cash flows, annual growth rates and discount rates. Judgement is 
required in relation to the achievability of the long-term business plan and macroeconomic assumptions underlying 
the valuation process. In certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained (for example through recent 
transactions), fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount. This involves judgements and 
estimates to apply reasonable valuation techniques and to estimate future selling costs. The full methodology and 
results of the group’s impairment testing is presented in note 18.
Taxation
The group operates in many tax jurisdictions including countries where the tax legislation is not consistently applied 
and under some complex contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax arising is not always clear. 
Management are required to apply judgements and estimates to determine the appropriate amount of tax to 
provide for and any required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at each period end.
Provisions for tax liabilities are estimated for existing matters under dispute with local tax authorities, as well as  
for matters which it is considered may be disputed by them, where it is probable that a future liability will arise. The 
tax liability provided is management’s best estimate based on external advice, and takes into account the anticipated 
position of the relevant tax authorities and other local factors. In certain cases, and where appropriate, a probability 
weighting is applied in determining the amount provided. In all cases it is assumed that the local tax authorities have, 
or will be provided with, full information. Therefore the tax liability is not reduced for “detection risk”. Further details 
about the range of the potential tax exposure to which the group is subject to are set out in note 13.
The group has tax losses and other deductible temporary differences, mainly in the UK and USA, that have the 
potential to reduce tax payments in future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that their 
132 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 recovery is probable, having regard to the projected future taxable income of these entities and after taking into 
account specific risk factors that affect the recovery of these assets. Management uses the same profit projections 
for these purposes as are used by the business, for example in assessing the carrying value of goodwill. Management’s 
judgement in this area is applied on a case-by-case basis due to the jurisdictional nature of taxation. This analysis is 
considered afresh at each balance sheet date.
Review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities
In 2013 the group carried out a review of the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, 
(over and above its contract review process), and comprised a review of the balance sheets of each of the subsidiaries 
in the group, in particular focusing on the recoverability of assets and the recognition of liabilities. The specific 
judgements on liabilities were based on assessing the most likely economic outflows, taking into account any changes 
in facts or circumstances since that date. This exercise required a level of judgement based on the group’s then 
current understanding of circumstances surrounding each issue. The results of the review were presented within 
specific items given the one-off nature of the review performed and changes to the estimates then made in relation 
to these items have since been classified as specific items, including additional changes and reversal of provisions.  
As at 31 December 2015 these estimates have been further updated to reflect any changes in facts or circumstances 
during the year to 31 December 2015 with any additional charges or reversals also being presented within specific 
items (see note 8). The group has completed this review in 2015. All future related changes in estimates will flow 
through underlying results, unless individually material.
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries
The group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which are sometimes driven by local laws and 
regulations relating to foreign ownership. In some instances the group operates through local structures with limited 
direct share ownership of the business but exercises control through shareholder agreements. In determining whether 
certain group entities qualify for consolidation under IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, professional and 
legal advice is sought and a level of judgement is required. Consolidation of any of these entities would need to  
be re-assessed if the group’s ability to enforce its rights of control were successfully challenged.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations
The valuation of defined retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualified independent actuaries 
who use the projected unit credit method for determining the group’s obligations. This methodology requires the 
use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on 
scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and inflation. Full details  
of the group’s retirement benefit obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key 
assumptions are presented in note 32.
Classification of leases
The classification of leases as between operating and finance leases is based on the criteria set out in IAS 17 – 
Leases, which defines a series of attributes which, when contained within a lease, may result in its classification as  
a finance lease. Judgement is required in assessing leases at inception as to whether individual attributes, in aggregate  
or in isolation, are such that the substance of the lease is that of a finance lease. Re-measurement during 2015 of 
historical leases in Europe and Africa against the IAS 17 classification criteria resulted in prior year adjustments to 
re-classify certain alarm-related leases in Europe, and other leases in Africa, from operating to finance leases with  
effect from their inception (see note 3(w)). During the year the most material new leases were in North America  
and Europe and the related lease contracts were reviewed in detail against the classification criteria as set out in  
the group’s accounting policies.

7. Discontinued operations
During the year the group has re-classified the group’s business in Costa Rica, together with certain small businesses 
that had been classified as discontinued operations for more than 12 months and not yet been sold, into continuing 
operations. This re-classification resulted in total revenue increasing by £41m and total operating profit reducing by 
£7m for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Operations qualifying as discontinued in the prior year mainly comprised the US Government solutions business, 
sold in November 2014, the group’s cash solutions business in Canada and its business in Norway, both sold in 
January 2014 and the group’s business in Sweden, sold in September 2014.
The results of the discontinued operations are presented below:

During the year, the group collected £26m (US$40m) of receivables relating to the US Government Solutions 
business, which was sold in November 2014. Of this amount £7m was not recognised in the group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2014 due to uncertainty of collectability and therefore was 
recognised as income within specific items in 2015.

(see page 164) and for the year ended 31 December 2014 also included a £5m charge relating to other items.
Administration expenses includes items that are separately disclosed relating to the following:
• A net £5m (2014: £7m) specific item charge comprised of a £17m (2014: £28m) charge relating to changes to 
the estimates made in the review of assets and liabilities, mainly in relation to the items identified in the balance 
sheet review performed in 2013 and none of which were individually material, offset by a £12m credit (2014: 
£21m), related to a pension curtailment of £5m (2014: settlement of £21m) and a pension legal settlement  
of £7m (2014: £nil).
• The group invested £44m in restructuring activities during the year (2014: £29m), mainly relating to the multi-year 
efficiency programme across the group. During 2014 and 2015 these programmes have focused primarily on 
transforming the operating model in the regions of UK & Ireland and Europe. During the second half of 2015 
these programmes began to address organisational efficiency in Latin America, Africa, Asia and North America.
• A £66m (2014: £nil) charge for goodwill impairment, including £41m in relation to businesses expected to be 
sold or closed and £25m relating to a business in Estonia. Further details relating to the impairment of goodwill  
are included in note 18.
• A credit of £12m (2014: £nil) relating to profit on disposal of subsidiaries, mainly the group’s International Parcel 
Service business in Asia Middle East. 
Also included in administration expenses are amortisation costs of £40m (2014: £58m) and acquisition-related 
expenses of £nil (2014: £1m).

The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 64% (2014: 36%).
(i) Deferred tax recognised on purchased intangibles – £nil (2014: £(15)m)
The £15m deferred tax credit recognised in 2014 related to the release of tax liabilities recorded in prior years  
in respect of intangible assets recognised on certain acquisitions in Latin America. As a result of a group restructure 
in 2014 those intangible assets became tax-deductible, and the deferred tax liabilities were consequently released.
(ii) Profits on disposal of businesses not taxable or covered by capital losses – £(5)m (2014: £(16)m)
This relates to profits arising from the disposal of businesses where any taxable profit arising on the disposal is either 
exempt from tax under the relevant tax legislation or where capital losses are available to offset against those taxable 
profits, for which deferred tax assets were not previously recognised.
(iii) Tax losses not recognised in the current year – £30m (2014: £32m)
This relates to losses not recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that there are insufficient taxable profits 
available to utilise those losses in the foreseeable future. A significant proportion of these losses arise in the UK  
in both 2015 and 2014.
(iv) Different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in non-UK jurisdictions – £11m (2014: 8m)
This relates to the effect of profits of the group being subject to tax at rates different from the current UK corporation 
tax rate of 20.25%. The principal reason for the increase in 2015 is a rise in profits in the US, which are taxed at a 
composite rate of 37%.
(v) Adjustment for previous years – reassessment of deferred taxes recoverability on losses – £(9)m (2014: £(23)m)
Deferred tax assets are recognised on losses to the extent that these can be supported by profits forecast to be 
made in the foreseeable future, generally not exceeding five years. These forecasts are updated and reviewed each 
year and, to the extent that these indicate an increase or decrease in the level of recoverable historical tax losses, 
deferred tax assets are amended accordingly.
(vi) Adjustment for previous years – other – £(9m) (2014: £7m)
This relates to a reassessment of the tax deductibility of expense items and provisions for unresolved tax issues  
as a result of case law developments and settlements with tax authorities.
(vii) Deferred tax credit – Adjustments in respect of prior years – £(14)m (2014: £(28)m)
This largely comprises the recognition of additional deferred tax assets in respect of prior years’ losses (see (v) above). 
The remainder relates to reassessments of accounting estimates relating to the timing of certain tax deductions in  
a number of countries.
At 31 December 2015, the group had total unprovided tax liabilities of approximately £50m (2014: £53m) relating 
to unresolved tax issues in various jurisdictions and provided amounts totalling £16m (2014: £22m). During 2015, the 
group paid £19m (2014: £nil) in respect of a disputed liability in order to reduce exposure to interest and penalties.

businesses acquired in the Netherlands, Greece and Colombia and also includes the payment of £9m relating to 
deferred consideration on acquisitions in Latin America made in prior years. In addition, during the year shareholder 
agreements were re-negotiated for certain joint ventures in the Asia Middle East region resulting in the group 
obtaining control of these operations. The group accounted for these as acquisitions, consolidating the balance

Goodwill allocation
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) which are expected 
to benefit from that business combination. A significant portion of the group’s goodwill was generated by the 
merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004, which was accounted for  
as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck. 
Goodwill impairment testing
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently 
if there are indications that any of these assets may be impaired. The annual impairment test is performed prior to 
the year end when the budgeting process is finalised and is reviewed post year end. The group’s impairment test 
compares the carrying value of each CGU with its recoverable amount. CGUs for goodwill impairment testing 
purposes are identified at a country level including significant business units, as per the group’s detailed management 
accounts. Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable 
amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted  
cash flow calculations. The key inputs to the calculations are described below. In certain circumstances where market 
prices can be ascertained (for example through recent transactions or by reference to normal industry standard 
multiples), the fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount. In the current year the  
value of goodwill in the Brazil secure solutions and Greece CGUs was supported by this valuation method.
Forecast cash flows
All operating countries in the group are required to submit a budget for the next financial year (for the year  
ending 31 December 2016) and their strategic plan forecasts for the following two years (for the years ending  
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018).
The revenue figures submitted in this exercise are used to derive a growth rate for the discounted cash flow 
calculation (see the growth rate table below). During the year, to align with best practice, the group has revised  
the period over which forecast projections are applied in the impairment model to revert to a period of five years  
from 15 years used previously. In addition to this, the model now uses long-term externally-sourced country specific 
inflation rates to determine growth rates instead of applying 1% or 3% growth rates for developed or emerging 
markets respectively as used previously. 
Forecast cash flows are projected from year 4 onwards by applying growth rates as detailed in the growth rate section 
below, and discounted using country specific risk-adjusted discount rates as described in the discount rate section.
Growth rate
Growth rates are determined from the budgeted and forecast revenue for years 1-3 with year 4 being calculated  
to achieve a smooth reduction from the year 3 growth rate to the year 5 rate, which is the lower of the year 3 plan 
rate and the IMF long-term country-specific inflation rate. The terminal value calculation also uses the long-term 
inflation rates as used in year 5. This is detailed in the table below:

* Budgets and forecasts are reviewed by the group board
In the above example, budgeted year 1 growth rate is 8%, forecast growth in year 2 is 7% and in year 3 is 6%.  
The long-term country inflation rate is 2% so the growth rate is reduced in year 4 to be the midpoint between 6% 
in year 3 and 2% in year 5, i.e. 4%. The terminal value calculation is then based on the long-term interest rate of 2%.
144 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Discount rate
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU based on the relevant local risk-free rate adjusted for that CGU’s

Other than for Estonia, these businesses have all been identified during the year for sale or closure and their carrying 
value has therefore been compared to their recoverable amount, being expected net proceeds from disposal. 
Where the carrying value is more than the expected proceeds, any goodwill has been written down to the 
recoverable amount.
In the case of Estonia, forecasts have been considered within the challenging local economic and market 
environment and performance to date compared to expectations. This has resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
of £25m being incurred to reduce goodwill to its estimated recoverable amount.
Sensitivity to key assumptions
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rates and growth rates 
used. The table below shows the additional impairment that would arise from an increase in discount rates by  
1% and 3% (with all other variables being equal, for example, taking the UK base rate from 8.6% to 9.6% and  
11.6%) or a decrease in growth rates by 1% and 3% (to a minimum of 0%, with all other variables being equal,  
for example, taking the UK growth rate from 2.0% to 1.0% and 0.0%) for the group in total and for each of its 
significant countries.

The net book value of equipment and vehicles held under finance leases was £53m (2014 restated: £64m). 
Accumulated depreciation on these assets was £128m (2014 restated: £130m) and the depreciation charge  
for the year was £20m (2014 restated: £28m).
The rights over assets held on finance leases are effectively security for lease liabilities. These rights revert to  
the lessor in the event of default.
The net book value of equipment and vehicles includes £18m (2014: £18m) of assets leased by the group to  
third parties under operating leases. Accumulated depreciation on these assets was £27m (2014: £29m) and  
the depreciation charge for the year was £5m (2014: £5m).
The net book value of land and buildings comprises freeholds of £63m (2014: £85m), long leaseholds of £19m 
(2014: £19m) and short leaseholds of £61m (2014: £58m).

Credit risk on trade receivables
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the group’s customers are both 
large in number and dispersed geographically in around 100 countries. The group’s largest customer is the UK 
Government which comprises approximately 10% (2014:10%) of the total trade debtor balance as at 31 December 
2015. Group companies are required to follow Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to assessing the credit 
worthiness of potential customers. These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits 
over a set amount, performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to reflect the different risks within each 
country in which the group operates. There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts 
according to local conditions and past default experience.

Net trade debtors and accrued income 1,081 1,079 
No additional provision has been made on the above amounts as there has not been a significant change in credit 
quality and the group believes that the amounts are still recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over 
these balances. The proportion of trade debtors at 31 December 2015 that were overdue for payment was 22% 
(2014: 20%). The group’s DSO measure (days sales outstanding) for continuing operations based on revenue from 
the last 90 days of the year is 50 days (2014: 47 days). 
The directors believe that the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash flows, 
approximates to their book value.

As at 31 December 2015 disposal groups classified as held for sale include the assets and liabilities associated with 
certain operations in Asia Middle East, Europe and Latin America. At 31 December 2014, disposal groups classified 
as held for sale included the assets and liabilities associated with the group’s business in Costa Rica, which, having 
been classified as held for sale for more than 12 months and not yet sold, has been re-classified at 31 December

impact of prior year errors in Africa.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise principally short-term money market deposits, current account balances and 
group-owned cash held in ATM machines and at 31 December 2015 earned interest at a weighted average rate  
of 0.8% (2014: 0.8%). The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because wherever possible and in 
accordance with Group Treasury policy the cash is placed with bank counterparties that hold investment grade 
credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system which included over 140 group 
companies at 31 December 2015. The group met the conditions of IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ 
allowing balances within this cash pool to be offset for reporting purposes. At 31 December 2015 £55m  
(2014: £300m) of the cash balances and the equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were offset.
Cash and cash equivalents of £69m (2014: £64m) are held by the group’s wholly-owned captive insurance 
subsidiaries. Their use is restricted to the settlement of claims against the group’s captive insurance subsidiaries.

Of the borrowings in currencies other than sterling, £991m (2014: £926m) is designated as a net investment hedge.

At 31 December 2015, the group’s committed bank borrowings comprised a £1bn multi-currency revolving credit 
facility with a maturity date of January 2021. The group, with the lenders’ permission, has an option to further extend 
maturity by one year to January 2022. At 31 December 2015, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to 
£683m (2014: £998m). Interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing Libor or Euribor rates, 
dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and re-priced within one year or less. 
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk. The management of this risk  
is discussed in note 31.

The group’s average cost of gross borrowings in 2015, net of interest hedging, was 4.0% (2014: £4.1%).
During 2015 a £1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility provided by a consortium of lending banks at a drawn 
margin of 1.0% over LIBOR was put in place. The facility matures in January 2021, with the option of a one year 
extension which if exercised gives the group facilities through to January 2022. As at 31 December 2015 the 
drawings were US$245m and £155m.
The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to one financial covenant (net debt to EBITDA 
ratio where EBITDA is calculated as group PBITA plus depreciation and amortisation of non-acquisition related 
intangible assets) and non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity. The group complied 
with the financial covenant throughout the year ended 31 December 2015 and the year ended 31 December 2014. 
The group has not defaulted on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year. 
Bank overdrafts, bank loans, the loan notes issued in July 2008 (with the exception of £44m), €510m of the loan 
notes issued in May 2012 and €380m of the loan notes issued in December 2012 are stated at amortised cost.  
The loan notes issued in March 2007, £44m of the loan notes issued in July 2008, the loan notes issued in May 2009, 
€90m of the loan notes issued in May 2012 and €120m of the loan notes issued in December 2012 are stated at 
amortised cost recalculated at an effective interest rate current at the balance sheet date as they are part of a fair 
value hedge relationship. 
US$50m (£34m) (2014: US$200m (£128m)) of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of 
£9m (2014: gain £28m) resulting from the cross currency swaps fixing the sterling value of this portion of the loan 
notes at an exchange rate of 1.975.
€325m (£240m) of the loan notes issued in May 2012 have a fair value market loss of £26m (2014: loss £14m) 
predominately resulting from the cross currency swaps fixing the sterling value of this portion of the loan notes  
at an exchange rate of 1.222 and partly resulting from the cross currency swaps fixing the sterling and euro  
interest rates.
€350m (£258m) of the loan notes issued in December 2012 have a fair value market loss of £19m (2014: loss 
£5m) predominately resulting from the cross currency swaps fixing the sterling value of this portion of the loan 
notes at an exchange rate of 1.233 and partly resulting from the cross currency swaps fixing the sterling and euro 
interest rates.

It is the group’s policy to lease certain items of property, plant and equipment under finance leases. The weighted 
average lease term is seven years (2014: seven years). For the year ended 31 December 2015, the weighted average 
effective borrowing rate was 6.3% (2014: 6.3%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed 
repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.

Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, measured using techniques consistent with Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy (inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset and liability, 
either directly or indirectly). The source of the market prices is Bloomberg and in addition the third party relationship 
counterparty banks. The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the floating rate cash flows anticipated 
under the instrument which are discounted back to the balance sheet date. This value is compared to the original 
transaction value giving a fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date.
The mark to market valuation of the derivatives has fallen by £53m during the year, partly due to derivatives 
maturing during the year.

Capital management
The group refinanced its £1.1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility with a £1bn facility signed on 7 January 2015. 
The new facility was for five years with two extension options exercisable by the banks. The first of these was 
exercised during the year, extending the facility maturity date to 7 January 2021. Execution of the second option 
during 2016 would extend the facility to January 2022.
In April 2015, Standard & Poor’s confirmed the group’s long term credit rating of BBB– (stable). 
The group’s policy is to maintain a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5 times. At the end of 2015 
the ratio was 3.3 times which reflects the effect of strengthening of sterling against currencies in emerging markets 
and a short term increase in working capital.
At 31 December 2015 the group had £683m of available and undrawn facilities from its committed £1bn bank 
facility. Following the successful refinancing of its committed bank facility in January 2015, the group has no significant 
maturity until May 2017 and has a medium to long-term debt maturity profile. The group is currently well placed to 
access finance from the debt capital markets and the bank market if required. Borrowings are principally in sterling, 
US dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and profits. 
154 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it.  
For more details of the group’s bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 27.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows:
31 December 2014   34% 
31 March 2015   29% 
30 June 2015   28% 
30 September 2015   24% 
31 December 2015   25%
T o reduce re-financing risk, group treasury obtains finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the 
impact of a single material source of finance terminating on a single date.
Re-financing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major 
medium-term facility at least 6-12 months before its termination date.

156 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Market risk
Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts 
The group conducts business in many currencies. Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business 
operates and conducts its financing activities in local currency. However, the group presents its consolidated financial 
statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results 
and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net 
debt/EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, where possible. The group no longer uses foreign 
exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans. The group believes that 
cash flow should not be put at risk by using these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets. 
The group has hedged a substantial proportion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its 
overseas net assets through these loans in foreign currencies. 
At 31 December 2015, the group’s US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 83% and 90% respectively 
hedged by foreign currency loans (2014: US dollar 78%, Euro 74%). As at 31 December 2015, net debt held in US 
dollar and Euro and in those currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.5 
times EBITDA generated from these currencies (2014: 2.3 times EBITDA).
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match 
translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments which qualify as net investment hedges with no 
residual impact to equity.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £25m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on US$50m of 
the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt 
at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £266m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on €325m 
of the Euro public notes issued in May 2012, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an 
exchange rate of 1.2217.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £284m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on €350m 
of the Euro public notes issued in December 2012, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an 
exchange rate of 1.2332.
Assuming the 2015 US dollar and the Euro foreign exchange rate market movements against sterling in 2015 were 
repeated in 2016, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes 
would be expected to fall by £23m and this would impact equity.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps 
Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 27 exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the 
group manages within policy limits approved by the directors. Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward 
rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward 
periods up to a maximum of five years. At 31 December 2015 the nominal value of such contracts was £109m  
(in respect of US dollar) (2014: £103m) and £52m (in respect of Euro) (2014: £54m); their weighted average 
interest rate was 1.3% (US dollar) (2014: 1.3%) and 0.6% (Euro) (2014: 0.6 %), and their weighted average period  
to maturity was two years. All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow 
hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity. 
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors preferring a fixed rate return 
over the life of the loan notes. At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the 
proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher 
proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private 
Placement to a floating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 
+ 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan 
notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the  
fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, the GBP public notes issued in May 2009,  
510m of the Euro public notes issued in May 2012 and 380m of the Euro public notes issued in December 2012 
was initially kept at fixed rate. In April 2014, the interest rate on £44m of the US Private Placement notes issued  
in July 2008 and on all the GBP public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to floating for a period  
of three years using derivatives.
All three public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall 
below investment grade.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, Euro and sterling. Although the impact of rising interest rates  
is largely shielded by fixed rate loans and interest rate swaps which provide certainty on the vast majority of the 
exposure, some interest rate risk remains. A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these 
currencies with the 31 December 2015 debt position constant throughout 2016, would lead to an expectation  
of an additional interest charge of £12m in the 2016 financial year (2015: £11m).

Market risk continued
Commodity risk and commodity swaps
The group’s principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash 
solutions businesses. Commodity swaps and commodity options are used to fix synthetically part of the exposure 
and reduce the associated cost volatility. Commodity swaps hedging 10 million litres of projected 2016 diesel 
consumption were in place at 31 December 2015. Commodity expense is not material in the context of the group’s 
consolidated cost base.
Counterparty credit risk 
The group’s strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor 
these on a regular basis. 
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty. The utilisation  
of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each 
counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction. The total mark-to-market value outstanding with each 
counterparty is also closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty. For short-term transactions 
(under one year), at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either 
the Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s rating agencies. For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the 
financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB+/Baa1 from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. 
Treasury transactions are dealt with the group’s relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade 
rating. At 31 December 2015 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were  
£19m and £18m and both were held with institutions with a long term Standard & Poor’s credit rating of A.  
These exposures represent 38% and 36% of the carrying values of the treasury transactions, with a fair value gain  
at the balance sheet date. Both of these banks had significant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc at  
31 December 2015.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary  
of an A rated bank. At year end credit balances of £55m were pooled with debit balances of £57m, resulting in a  
net pool overdraft balance of £2m. There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft 
facility of £3m.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies. Exceptionally, where required by local 
country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties 
for a period of up to 12 months. Due to the group’s global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple 
industries, there is minimal concentration risk. 
32. Retirement benefit obligations
The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local 
conditions and practices within the countries concerned. These include funded defined contribution, multi-employer 
and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes. 
Defined contribution arrangements
The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the group are of a defined contribution structure, 
where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage 
of employees’ pay. Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement 
totalled £96m (2014: £96m).
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new 
employees is a contracted-in defined contribution scheme. 
Multi-employer arrangement
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of the Security Industry Wide Pension Fund (IWPF). This is a 
career-average defined benefit plan. Pensionable salary is subject to a cap, and minus an offset that reflects social 
security levels. Withdrawal from the scheme is only possible under certain strict conditions determined by Dutch 
law and by the pension fund board of the IWPF. 
The plan is funded by a premium that is set by the IWPF board in line with the financing rules that state that the 
premium should cover the cost of the annual accrual of pension benefits. Historically, the premium has been 30%  
of pensionable salaries and the employer pays 60% of this premium and the employees the remaining 40%. 
The financing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously 
accrued benefits. This means that in case of insufficient funding, the benefits of participants could, in theory, be 
reduced. The current solvency ratio is 103.5% (December 2015). The required solvency ratio according to Dutch 
law is 120.7% (as at 31 December 2014). Should a surplus appear within the scheme the board will decide if  
a reduction in premium is possible although this would only be possible at much higher solvency levels. 
158 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 The scheme is not accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19 – Employee Benefits as it is not possible 
to identify the group’s share of the scheme’s assets and liabilities. As a result, and in line with general practice for 
such schemes, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme under IAS 19. 
The Netherlands Cash Solutions Pension Plan (“the Cash Solutions scheme”) is a separate scheme operated by  
the group but is required to provide benefits at least equivalent to the IWPF, and in particular pension increases  
in payment and deferment, as well as revaluation of active members’ rights in the Cash Solutions scheme have to 
follow the multi-employer scheme (which applies a conditional approach).
At the end of December 2015, liability for future pension accrual in respect of the Cash Solutions scheme was 
transferred to the IWPF, resulting in a curtailment gain of £5m. Past service accruals remained with the Cash 
Solutions scheme – the scheme is insured so longevity risk on the base level of insured pension (that is before 
increases) is carried by the insurer, and any bonuses from the insurer’s returns may defray the cost of pension 
increases. Accordingly, there is a counterparty risk against the insurer.
During 2014 the assets and past and future service liabilities of the Netherlands Securicor Staff Pension Plan  
were transferred to the IWPF, resulting in a settlement gain of £21m.
Defined benefit arrangements 
The group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on 
employees’ length of service. Whilst the group’s primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates the Cash Solutions 
scheme and other less material plans elsewhere. Under funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes 
are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned. 
The amounts recognised in income in relation to the material funded schemes are included within the following 
categories in the income statement:

The £5m specific item in 2015 relates to the curtailment gain on the Cash Solutions scheme, and the £21m in 2014 
related to the settlement gain on the Netherlands Securicor Staff Pension Plan.
There are also various less material unfunded arrangements, for which the group does not hold related assets 
separate from the group. In aggregate, other unfunded arrangements incurred £1m (2014: £1m) in cost of sales, 
£3m (2014: £2m) in finance costs and a £3m (2014: £5m) actuarial loss recognised in other comprehensive income.

UK Defined Benefit Scheme
The defined benefit scheme in the UK accounts for 92% (2014: 91%) of the net balance sheet liability for material 
funded defined retirement benefit schemes. It comprises three sections: the Group 4 section which is the pension 
scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A/S, the Securicor section, responsibility for which the group 
assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, and the GSL section, responsibility for which the 
group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL. 
The UK scheme is closed to future accrual apart from some sub-sections of the GSL section, and for most members 
defines the pension based on final salary. The GSL section has historically remained open to provide a facility to 
accept former public-sector employees who join the group through outsourcings. In the Group 4 and Securicor 
sections, members retain their link to final salary where appropriate on their benefits accrued up to closure in 2011. 
The participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows:

Pensioner participants
 – Number 3,346 883 9,551 13,780
 – Average age 71.0 65.0 69.0 69.2
 
There is a mix of fixed and inflation-dependent pension increases (in payment and deferment) which vary from 
member to member according to their membership history and the section of the scheme.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections are respectively 16 years  
(Group 4 section), 18 years (GSL section) and 17 years (Securicor section). As at 31 December 2014 the discounted 
weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections were 18 years (Group 4 section), 20 years (GSL 
section) and 19 years (Securicor section).
The scheme is set up under UK law and governed by a Trustee company which is responsible for the scheme’s 
investments, administration and management. The Board of the Trustee Company is comprised of an independent 
chairman and further independent, group and scheme membership representatives.
The current schedule of deficit recovery contributions provides for a contribution of approximately £47m during 
2016. In addition, the company has pledged a share of any material disposal proceeds to the pension scheme  
(to be shared in the same proportion as the pension scheme deficit bears to overall group indebtedness) and  
has agreed that additional contributions would be made in the event that the average annual dividend payment  
to ordinary shareholders over the three financial years 2015, 2016, 2017 exceeds a certain threshold or in the  
event that the company makes a significant special dividend payment (or equivalent capital return), to its ordinary 
shareholders over the same period. 
A funding valuation is carried out for the scheme’s Trustee every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. 
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated; the group has 
guaranteed any contributions due from its subsidiaries. 
The group is currently working with the Trustees on the next valuation which has an effective date of 5 April 2015 
and the results of this work are expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.
The group has concluded that it should allow for a refund of any residual surplus in all three sections of the UK 
Scheme after all benefits have been paid. Therefore no adjustments for asset ceiling or additional liabilities under the 
IFRIC 14 interpretation are made. At present the GSL section has a surplus and the other two sections have deficits. 
The IASB is proposing to amend IFRIC 14 and the group will assess if there are any implications once the final form 
of the revised interpretation is clearer.
160 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Expected contributions
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the UK schemes during the financial year commencing 
1 January 2016 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefits should be approximately £5m and it is anticipated that 
these will remain at a similar level in the medium term subject to changes in financial conditions.
Principal risks
The group’s pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases on benefits are, to a varying 
extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits 
payable are future inflation levels (including the impact of inflation on future salary increases) and the actual longevity 
of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions 
on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when 
setting the contributions to the pension plans. For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns (for 
funding valuations) are set based on fixed margins over the LIBOR swap curve. The management of the pension 
fund assets has been delegated to an asset manager which manages the assets against a liability benchmark.  
The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows:
• An asset mix which is managed dynamically over time rather than a set strategic allocation
• Interest rate and inflation risk is managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a percentage  
of the asset value through the use of debt instruments (government bonds) and derivatives
• Currency risk is managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the overseas currency exposure in  
the portfolio through the use of forward foreign currency contracts
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation and regulatory 
mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact the group’s pension schemes.
Regarding financial reporting measures, the IAS 19 liability measurement (DBO) and the service cost are sensitive  
to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the 
expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being about future inflation and salary growth 
levels and the assumptions made about life expectation. The DBO and service cost are also very sensitive to the  
IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments. The discount rate 
depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Investment strategies are set with funding rather than 
IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of 
liabilities. As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be volatile.
Assumptions and sensitivities 
The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
UK Netherlands
Key assumptions used at 31 December 2015
Discount rate 3.8% 2.4%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 1.9%
Pension increases in payment (for the UK, at RPI
*
 with a limit of 5% p.a.) 3.0% 0.9%
Inflation 3.1% 1.9%
Key assumptions used at 31 December 2014
Discount rate 3.7% 2.3%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.1% 1.8%
Pension increases in payment (for the UK, at RPI
*
 with a limit of 5% p.a.) 2.8% 1.1%
Inflation 3.0% 1.8%
* The CPI assumption used for the UK valuation in 2015 was 2.1% (2014: 2%).
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high-quality corporate bond rates.  
The group considers that it is appropriate to consider AA-rated corporate bonds as high quality and therefore  
have used discount rates based on yields on such bonds corresponding to the liability profile of the schemes.

Assumptions and sensitivities continued
The effect of a movement in RPI inflation applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities (before associated deferred 
tax adjustments) by approximately the amounts shown in the table below:

(decrease) in the

Scheme

Inflation assumption being 0.5% higher 71 87
Inflation assumption being 0.5% lower (73) (80)
The above sensitivities allow for inflation-dependent assumptions such as salary growth and relevant pension 
increases to vary corresponding to the inflation assumption variation. Due to the caps and floors on pension 
increases a certain movement in the inflation assumption will not generally result in the same movement in the 
pension increase assumption.
In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes’ obligations. 
The mortality tables used for the scheme in the UK are: Birth year table S1P[M/F]A Base with future improvements 
in line with CMI_2013 Core projections, based on a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% p.a. and allowing for 
individual scaling factors based on the majority analysis carried out as part of the last funding valuation.
The resulting assumed life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 is 22 years. The 
assumed life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52 is 23 years. At those ages, the assumed life expectancy  
for a female member is between 2 and 3 years longer than for a male member. 
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities (before associated 
deferred tax adjustments) by approximately £93m (2014: £105m). 
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the DBO to key assumptions should not be 
interpreted as the group expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

Assumptions and sensitivities continued
Within the UK pension fund, the Equity, Credit, Macro-orientated and Multi-strategy sub-categories consist of 
pooled vehicles investing predominantly in assets with quoted prices in active markets. All government bonds are 
issued by the UK government and have quoted prices in active markets. Other UK investments are predominantly 
not quoted.
Derivatives include a range of interest rate and inflation linked swaps, forward currency contracts, equity index total 
return swaps, equity options, and futures. Investing in interest rate and inflation linked swaps is designed to mitigate 
the impact of future changes in interest rates and inflation.
None of the pension scheme assets are held in the group’s own financial instruments or in any assets held or used 
by the group.

Employee benefits 
The provision for employee benefits is in respect of any employee benefits which accrue over the working lives  
of the employees, typically including items such as long service awards and termination indemnity schemes. 
The group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than retirement benefits represents the 
present value of the future benefit that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of 
scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
During 2015 liabilities of £9m relating to severance schemes in certain businesses in Asia Middle East were re-
classified to retirement benefit obligations to more accurately reflect the substance of the schemes and to allow  
for IAS 19(R) accounting.
Restructuring 
Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in  
acquired businesses and discontinued operations. Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable. The 
timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term. In the year the group incurred restructuring costs of 
£44m (2014: £29m) within other separately disclosed items relating to the group wide transformation and a further 
£4m (2014: £4m) associated with costs incurred in the normal course of business and hence included in PBITA.
Claims 
Claims provisions represent any outstanding litigation claims against the group that are likely to lead to the outflow 
of funds in the future, including provisions within the captive insurance companies to cover (where appropriate) 
anticipated claims incurred as at the balance sheet date, based on actuarial assessments to calculate the liabilities.
The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which 
underwrite part of the group’s cash solutions, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies. In  
the year the group provided £16m in relation to these claims. The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review 
and are adjusted as appropriate. Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final 
settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both 
liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims. 
Onerous customer contracts
The present value of estimated future net cash outflows relating to onerous customer contracts is provided for 
where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations in a customer contract exceed the economic benefits 
164 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 expected to be received under the contract. During the year this included £65m of additional provisions mainly 
relating to updating estimates in respect of future losses on legacy UK government and PFI contracts, including  
the Compass contract. These additional provisions were recorded within specific items in the consolidated  
income statement.
Under the UK Compass asylum seeker contract with the Home Office, the group provides accommodation, 
transportation and subsistence services for asylum seekers whilst their claims are being processed. This contract 
commenced in 2012 and runs to 1 September 2017, with a potential extension of a further two years.
In 2014, an onerous contract provision was recognised in relation to the then-current assumptions regarding asylum 
seeker numbers, the duration and cost of accommodation and support services. The group experienced a significant 
increase in the number of new asylum seekers between November 2015 and January 2016 and as a result the 
number of asylum seekers in the group’s care increased by 9.6% year-on-year. The Compass provision has been 
updated based upon our best estimate of the increase in asylum seekers assigned to the group, the availability  
of suitable accommodation approved by local authorities and the speed of processing of applications by the 
immigration authority.
T o date, the Compass contract has not been extended and the onerous contract provision has been increased  
by £20m to £31m covering the period to August 2017. Should the contract be extended for the period to  
August 2019 then, based on the same assumptions as the current provision, a further provision for £57m would  
be required. 
The other principal onerous contract provision relates to a previously identified PFI contract entered into in 2005 
and is subject to on-going discussions with the customer. A best estimate has been made based on a range of 
possible outcomes including a commercial or dispute resolution process.
Unused amounts reversed of £3m includes a £2m release that was recorded within specific items. Net unwinding  
of discounts charged was not material.
Property and other 
Included within property and other provisions are future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall, for the cost 
of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement, for long-term idle, leased properties and for 
certain customer claims on contracts that are related to the performance on a contract but do not form part of 
onerous customer contract provisions. Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, 
there is uncertainty over their value and duration. 
Included in property and other provisions are contract-related provisions of £14m (2014: £6m) and onerous 
property lease provisions of £12m (2014: £9m). 
Contingent liabilities
T o date, the Compass contract has not been extended and the onerous contract provision covers the period to 
August 2017. Should the contract be extended for the period to August 2019 then, based on the same assumptions 
as the current provision, a further provision for £57m would be required.
Other contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements, claims, regulatory and compliance matters entered into  
in the normal course of business, none of which are individually or collectively significant.

net deferred tax assets recognised in North America and Europe.
At 31 December 2015, the group had unutilised tax losses of approximately £813m (2014: £771m) potentially 
available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £51m (2014: £41m) has been recognised in respect of 
approximately £263m (2014: £166m) of gross losses based on profitability from approved budgets and business plans.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £550m (2014: £605m) of gross losses  
due to the unpredictability and availability of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a 
significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities. In certain cases, there are 
continuing structural issues which prevent the utilisation of losses within the foreseeable future. Losses which will 
never be utilised, for example due to the operation of statute, are not included in the above figures.
Approximately £414m (2014: £439m) of the gross unrecognised losses relate to the UK group. Their utilisation  
is dependent upon the profitability of particular trading and corporate entities. The financial projections used in 
assessing the future profitability are consistent with those used in assessing the carrying value of goodwill as set  
out in note 18. The rate of utilisation of these losses will occur at different rates due to the incidence and timing  
of profits within these entities which consequently impacts their recognition as deferred tax assets.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of £38m (2014: £37m) which will expire between 2016 and 
2025. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
The group is reviewing the potential impact of proposals announced in the UK Budget in March 2016 to extend  
the period over which UK tax losses can be utilised.
At 31 December 2015, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings 
of non-UK subsidiaries and joint ventures was £1,334m (2014: £1,102m). A deferred tax liability of £3m (2014: 
£3m) has been recognised on undistributed earnings, based on expected distributions from such subsidiaries and 
joint ventures.
“Other temporary differences” varies by country, and includes items relating to the local tax treatment of fixed 
assets, employee benefits, and provisions.

Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow 
instruments related to the hedged transactions that have not yet occurred (net of tax). During the year certain 
items in the hedging reserve were re-classified into the translation reserve to more accurately reflect the group’s 
accounting policy with respect to net investment hedging. The amount recognised in the hedging reserve includes  
a fair value loss on the hedging instruments of £42m (2014: £36m) and a gain of £44m (2014: £30m).
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the company’s net 
investment in foreign operations (net of tax).
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve comprises reserves arising upon the merger between the former Group 4 Falck A/S and  
the former Group 4 Securitas BV in 2000 and the acquisition of Securicor plc by the group in 2004. In accordance 
with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 the £308m premium on ordinary shares issued in the group’s 9.99% 
share placement in August 2013 was initially recorded in the merger reserve, and was transferred to retained 
earnings in 2014.
Reserve for own shares 
An employee benefit trust established by the group held 6,320,144 shares at 31 December 2015 (2014: 6,408,450 
shares) to satisfy the vesting of awards under the performance share plan and performance-related schemes.  
During the year no shares were purchased by the trust, whilst 88,306 shares were used to satisfy the vesting of 
awards under the schemes. At 31 December 2015, the cost of shares held by the trust was £16,825,102 (2014: 
£17,060,185), whilst the market value of these shares was £14,251,925 (2014: £17,809,083). Shares held by the 
trust are treated as treasury shares, are deducted from equity, do not receive dividends and are excluded from  
the calculations of earnings per share. 
Distributable reserves
As at 31 December 2015 the parent company of the group had distributable reserves of £1,078m.

The group leases a number of its office properties, vehicles and other operating equipment under operating leases. 
Property leases are negotiated over an average term of around ten years, at rates reflective of market rentals. 
Periodic rent reviews take place to bring lease rentals in line with prevailing market conditions. Some but not  
all lease agreements have an option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. Leased vehicles and other 
operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of four years.
39. Share based payments
In June 2014 a new long-term incentive plan replaced the previous performance share plan (the performance  
share plans), as detailed in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 74. Shares allocated conditionally fall under 
either the group’s performance share plans or the group’s performance-related bonus scheme. Shares allocated 
conditionally under the performance-related bonus scheme vest three years following the date of grant provided 
certain non-market performance conditions are met. Those allocated under the group’s performance share plans 
vest after three years, to the extent that certain non-market performance conditions are met. The proportion of  
the allocation of awards to these criteria is described in the remuneration report. Vesting occurs on the third 
anniversary of the date the shares were allocated conditionally.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of conditional share allocations outstanding at 31 December 2015 
was 16 months (2014: 17 months). The weighted average share price at the date of allocation of shares allocated 
conditionally during the year was 290.0p (2014: 240.3p) and the contractual life of all conditional allocations was 
three years. 
Under the group’s performance share plans, the vesting of 30% (2014: 30%) of the shares allocated conditionally 
depends upon T otal Shareholder Return (a market performance condition) over the vesting year measured against  
a comparator group. 25% of the allocation vests upon the group’s T otal Shareholder Return equalling median 
performance amongst the comparator group. The fair value of the shares allocated subject to this market 
performance condition has therefore been reduced by 75%.
The income statement is charged with an estimate for the vesting of shares conditionally awarded subject  
to non-market performance conditions. The charge for 2015 was £8m (2014: £5m).

Parent company statement of financial position
At 31 December 2015
190 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the parent company financial statements
(a) General information
G4S plc (the ‘company’) is incorporated in the United Kingdom, registered in England and Wales, and domiciled  
in the UK. It is a public company, limited by shares. The company’s registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the company’s functional currency, and in millions  
of pounds.
(b) Statement of compliance
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’.
(c) Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and applicable 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’)).  
The principal accounting policies and measurement bases adopted are the same as those disclosed in note 3 to  
the consolidated financial statements, except as noted below, and have been applied consistently to all the years 
presented, unless stated otherwise. Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies 
which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, 
have been disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
The company has early-adopted certain amendments to FRS 100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ 
and to FRS 101 issued in July 2015 by the Financial Reporting Council. These amendments related to changes made 
to the Companies Act 2006 to maintain consistency with company law and the application of The Companies, 
Partnerships, and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2015 (‘SI 2015/980’). SI 2015/980 allowed, among 
other items, the format of the financial statements to be presented in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (‘adopted IFRSs’) instead of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
Pages 116 to 188 of the consolidated financial statements contain information on the performance of the group,  
its financial position, cash flows, net debt position and borrowing facilities. Further information, including financial risk 
management policies, exposures to market and credit risk and hedging activities, is given in note 31 to the consolidated 
financial statements, ‘Financial risk’. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason  
the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Transition to FRS 101
These financial statements were prepared by the directors in accordance with FRS 101 for the first time. FRS 101 
grants elections and certain exemptions from its full requirements when preparing the first financial statements  
that conform to FRS 101. An explanation of these and how the transition affected the previously reported financial 
position and financial performance of the company has been disclosed in note (u) to these financial statements.  
The date of transition from the previous accounting standards to FRS 101 was 1 January 2014. Comparable historical 
financial information has therefore been provided in accordance with FRS 101 as at 1 January 2014 and as at, and 
for the year ended, 31 December 2014.
Exemptions
In accordance with section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement  
to present its own income statement.
The company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements  
are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc.
These disclosure exemptions relate to: 
• the presentation of a third or opening statement of financial position at the date of transition to FRS 101  
and related notes;
• the requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’;
• the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union;
• new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the company;
• comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible 
assets and certain other additional comparative information; 
• information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units containing goodwill and management’s approach to determining these amounts;
• financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’;
• disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; 
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 191
Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements continued
• certain related party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between  
two or more wholly-owned members of a group; and
• capital management disclosures.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment. The accounting policy for 
impairments in investments in subsidiaries has been disclosed in note 3(k) to the consolidated financial statements.
Amounts owed by/to group undertakings
Amounts owed by/to group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost. Finance income and costs are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective 
interest method.
Impairment of financial assets
The company provides for impairments in financial assets when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result 
of one or more events that impact the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets.
Share-based payments
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value of share-based payments 
is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed or capitalised, with a corresponding increase in equity, on  
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. 
The amount expensed or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary is adjusted over the vesting period 
for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any 
market-related performance conditions. The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant. The value of the liability is remeasured 
at each reporting date and at the date the liability is settled. The fair value of share-based payments is expensed in 
the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and capitalised as an investment in the relevant 
subsidiary if it relates to employees of those subsidiary companies.
Financial guarantees 
The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within  
the group. The company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The company 
therefore treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the 
company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

The company issued fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m on 1 March 2007. 
US$100m of these notes matured and were repaid on 1 March 2014, with the remaining notes maturing in March 
2017 (US$200m), March 2019 (US$145m) and March 2022 (US$105m).
The company issued further fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$514m and £69m 
on 15 July 2008. US$65m of these notes matured and were repaid on 15 July 2013, and US$150m matured and 
were repaid on 15 July 2015. The remaining notes mature in July 2016 (£25m), July 2018 (US$224m and £44m),  
and July 2020 (US$75m).
The company issued its inaugural public note of £350m using its European Medium Term Note Programme on  
13 May 2009. The note matures in May 2019.
The loan notes issued in July 2008, with the exception of £44m, are stated at amortised cost. The loan notes issued 
in March 2007, £44m of the loan notes issued in July 2008 and the loan notes issued in May 2009 are stated at 
amortised cost but are designated in a fair value hedge relationship which has a fair value adjustment in relation  
to the hedged interest rate risk. Information on the significant assumptions underlying the valuation model used  
and the interest rates on the borrowings are disclosed in note (j).
Derivatives related to the loan notes have a fair value market gain of £9m (2014: £28m) as disclosed in note (j).

Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, measured using techniques consistent with Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy (inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset and liability, 
either directly or indirectly). The source of the market prices is Bloomberg and in addition the third party relationship 
counterparty banks. The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the floating rate cash flows anticipated 
under the instrument which are discounted back to the reporting date. This value is compared to the original 
transaction value giving a fair value of the instrument at the reporting date.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and using inputs 
based on observable market data. Judgement is used to determine the relevant inputs, currency yield curves and 
discount rates. Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on management’s best 
knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Currency risk and cross currency swaps
The group conducts business in many currencies. The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling 
and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its 
foreign subsidiaries. The company, together with its subsidiary G4S International Finance plc, hedges a substantial 
portion of the group’s exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of the group’s overseas net assets  
by holding loans in foreign currencies. On consolidation, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign 
currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as 
they qualify as net investment hedges. However, in the company’s own financial statements, translation adjustments 
arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the income statement and are in part hedged 
by cross currency swaps.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of £25m are outstanding which were arranged to hedge the foreign 
currency risk on US$50m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling 
value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750. These swaps will mature in July 2018. 
Notes to the parent company financial statements continued
194 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps 
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value interest rate risk, which the company manages 
within policy limits approved by the directors. When fixed/floating interest rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable 
directly from investors, interest rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend and meet Treasury policy, with  
the proportion of fixed interest rate held reducing on a sliding scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five 
years. The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as treasury 
activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors preferring a fixed rate return 
over the life of the loan notes. At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the 
proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher 
proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private 
Placement to a floating rate. Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 
+ 60bps. These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan 
notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the  
fair value of the hedged item. The swaps mature in 2017, 2019 and 2022.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the £350m public notes issued in May 
2009, was initially kept at fixed rate. In April 2014, the interest rate on £44m of the US Private Placement notes 
issued in July 2008 and on all of the £350m public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to floating  
for a period of three years using derivatives. These swaps have also been documented as fair value hedges.
The £350m public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of the company 
fall below investment grade.
(k) Retirement benefit obligations
Following the adoption of FRS 101, the company has been determined to be the sponsoring company for the group’s 
UK defined benefit pension scheme, to which it provides a guarantee over all payments to be made to the scheme 
by the operating companies. The required disclosures for this scheme are given in note 32 to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
The following disclosures relate to the UK scheme only and are given because the same disclosures in note 32  
of the group financial statements refer to the consolidated group position and include certain non-UK schemes.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and the various components of income, other 
comprehensive income and cash flow are as follows:

(n) Retained earnings
Included in the company’s retained earnings is £1,078m (2014: restated £68m) of distributable profits. During the 
year a previously unrealised gain of £1,078m relating to the sale of certain investments in subsidiaries in 2011 as  
part of a wider reorganisation of the UK holding company legal structure was realised and therefore re-classified  
as distributable reserves. The gain became realised as a result of a transaction in 2015 which involved the settlement 
of outstanding inter-company receivables due from one subsidiary with loans payable to another subsidiary.
(o) Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to PwC for the audit of the company’s annual financial statements have been disclosed in note 10  
to the consolidated financial statements.

(q) Share-based payments
The company has both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment schemes in place being the conditional 
allocations of G4S plc shares. An employee benefit trust established by the group holds shares to satisfy the vesting 
of conditional allocation awards. Reserve for own share disclosures relevant to the company are presented within 
note 36 to the consolidated financial statements. Share-based payments disclosures relevant to the company are 
presented within note 39 to the consolidated financial statements.
(r) Related party transactions
Certain disclosures relevant to the company are presented within note 40 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Company transactions with group undertakings primarily consist of royalty charges, central service charges, group 
insurance recharges and loan transactions. 
There were no material transactions with non-wholly owned group undertakings in 2015 (2014: none).
(s) Contingent liabilities 
T o help secure cost effective finance facilities for its subsidiaries, the company issues guarantees to some of its 
finance providers. At 31 December 2015 guarantees totalling £373m (2014: £370m) were in place in support  
of such facilities.
The company also guarantees the debt obligations of certain subsidiaries. At 31 December 2015 contingent 
liabilities of £1,192m (2014: £956m) were outstanding in support of such debt obligations. 
(t) Dividends
Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders of the company in the year have been disclosed in note 14  
to the consolidated financial statements.
(u) Transition to FRS 101
Between 2012 and 2015 the Financial Reporting Council revised financial reporting standards for the United 
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The revision fundamentally reformed financial reporting, replacing all previous 
accounting standards with FRS 100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ and other related standards, 
which are applicable from 1 January 2015.
Under FRS 100, the company has elected to apply FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ in its annual financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework which 
addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions for the individual financial statements  
of subsidiaries and ultimate parents that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements 
of adopted IFRSs.
As stated in the Significant accounting policies note, these are the company’s first financial statements prepared  
in accordance with FRS 101. The transition date from the legacy UK GAAP to FRS 101 was 1 January 2014.
The policies disclosed in the Significant accounting policies note have been applied in preparing these financial 
statements for each of the years ended, and as at, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, and in the 
preparation of an opening FRS 101 statement of financial position as at 1 January 2014.
In preparing its opening FRS 101 statement of financial position the company has adjusted amounts reported  
in its previous statutory annual report and financial statements. An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101  
has affected the company’s financial position and financial performance has been provided below. As the company 
previously prepared its consolidated financial statements under IFRS, it has measured its assets and liabilities at the 
same amounts in both the consolidated and parent company financial statements, except for consolidation adjustments.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 197
Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements continued
(u) Transition to FRS 101 continued
First-time adoption of FRS 101
FRS 101 grants elections and certain exemptions from its full requirements when preparing the first financial 
statements that conform to FRS 101.
Investment in subsidiaries
The carrying amounts of the company’s investments in subsidiaries have been unaffected by the transition to FRS 101.
Financial instruments including derivatives and hedge accounting
Under legacy UK GAAP , the company complied with the requirements of FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ 
and FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. FRS 25 implemented IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Presentation’ and FRS 26 implemented the recognition, measurement and hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ into legacy UK GAAP for those companies within its scope.  
As the company had accounted for its financial instruments under FRS 25 and FRS 26, and formally designated its 
hedges under FRS 26, it has complied with the requirements of IAS 32 and IAS 39 under FRS 101. The carrying 
values of the company’s financial instruments and derivatives under legacy UK GAAP have therefore been 
unaffected on transition to FRS 101 on 1 January 2014.
Share-based payment transactions
Under legacy UK GAAP the company previously applied FRS 20 (IFRS 2) ‘Share-based Payment’ when accounting for 
its share-based payment transactions. As there are no differences between FRS 20 and the FRS 101 equivalent, IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’, transactions previously recognised in equity relating to share options that were granted after  
7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2014 have been unaffected by the transition to FRS 101.
Reconciliation of equity
A reconciliation of the company’s equity reported in accordance with legacy UK GAAP to its equity in accordance 
with FRS 101 as at 1 January 2014 and as at 31 December 2014 has been provided below.

These balances are as presented in the statutory annual report and financial statements of the company under 
legacy UK GAAP but aligned with FRS 101 and adopted IFRS headings, prior to adjustments required to comply 
with FRS 101. The presentation under headings in accordance with adopted IFRSs is permitted by the early  
adoption of SI 2015/980, as explained in the Significant accounting policies.

Explanation of transition adjustments continued
Note B
Presentational adjustments to the statement of financial position due to the transition to FRS 101
On transition to FRS 101, the company has reclassified the following items.
• Non-current/current assets and liabilities. Under FRS 101, as permitted by the early adoption of SI 2015/980, the 
company has presented all assets and liabilities on a non-current and current basis. The following balances reported 
under legacy UK GAAP have been reclassified accordingly: within current assets, debtors due after more than one 
year relating to derivatives and deferred tax assets. As at 1 January 2014 this resulted in re-classifications of £52m 
and £1m respectively (31 December 2014: £53m and £1m respectively).
• Taxation. Deferred and current tax assets are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial 
position in accordance with FRS 101 instead of within debtors under legacy UK GAAP .
• Hedging reserves. Under FRS 101, the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the 
derivatives in a cash flow hedging relationship is deferred within equity in a separate reserve, the hedging reserve, 
which is net of tax. These balances were previously recognised in retained earnings. As at 1 January 2014, £1m 
was transferred from retained earnings to the hedging reserve. The equivalent re-classification as at 31 December 
2014 was also £1m, after the additional recycling of foreign exchange from the hedging reserve to the income 
statement (see below).
Note C
Retirement benefit obligations
Under legacy UK GAAP when an employer could not identify its share of the assets and liabilities of a group pension 
scheme on a reasonable and consistent basis, the scheme was accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. The 
company therefore only accounted for the contributions payable to the scheme during the year within operating 
profit in its income statement. 
Under FRS 101, IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ requires the company to recognise the following items:
• In its statement of financial position:
 – the difference between the market value of the assets of the scheme and the present value of accrued pension 
liabilities as a net asset or net liability. An asset relating to one scheme can be offset against a liability relating to 
another if the right of offset exists.
• In its income statement:
 – the current service cost within operating profit; and
 – net finance costs on the net defined benefit obligation within financing costs.
• In other comprehensive income:
 – actuarial gains and losses arising from experience or assumption changes; and
 – returns on scheme assets in excess of those recognised in the income statement.
Due to the transition to FRS 101, retirement benefit obligations of £480m and a retirement benefit surplus of £31m 
before tax were recognised on 1 January 2014. During the year ended 31 December 2014 the legacy UK GAAP 
accounting was reversed and amounts recognised in both the income statement and other comprehensive income 
in accordance with IAS 19 (£18m and £188m gains respectively). At 31 December 2014 the retirement benefit 
obligations were £314m and the retirement benefit surplus was £75m. The impact due to deferred tax has been 
disclosed in Note F.
Note D
Recycling of hedging reserves
Under FRS 101 certain hedging transactions are reported in a separate hedging reserve. The hedging reserve 
consists of the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the derivatives in a cash flow 
hedging relationship deferred within equity, which for the company mainly represented the net change in the fair 
value of its cross currency swaps. The effective portion of the cross currency swaps relating to foreign exchange 
movements should have been subsequently recycled to the income statement to offset the foreign exchange 
revaluation of the associated loan notes. However under legacy UK GAAP this recycling was omitted. During  
the year ended 31 December 2014, £8m of gains previously reported within equity was recycled to the income 
statement to offset the foreign exchange losses on the associated loan notes. The related deferred tax adjustment 
has been disclosed in Note F.
Notes to the parent company financial statements continued
200 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Note E
Share-based payments
Under legacy UK GAAP , the amount charged to the company’s income statement for share-based payments reflected 
the expense related both to employees of the company and to employees of the company’s subsidiaries. However, 
in circumstances where the company settles awards for services provided to its subsidiaries by the subsidiaries’ 
employees, the company can capitalise these costs as a cost of investment in those subsidiaries. Following the transition 
to FRS 101, share-based payment charges of £4m previously expensed to the income statement during the year 
ended 31 December 2014 were capitalised and included within the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
Note F
Deferred tax
Under legacy UK GAAP deferred tax was recognised on timing differences arising in the income statement. Timing 
differences arose from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in the taxation computations in periods 
different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Under FRS 101, IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ requires full provision for all taxable temporary differences unless specifically 
exempted. Deferred tax is recognised in the statement of financial position by applying the appropriate tax rate to 
the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
company’s financial statements.
Due to the transition to FRS 101, deferred tax was recognised on retirement benefit obligations. As at 1 January 
2014, deferred tax assets of £90m were recognised on the statement of financial position. During the year ended  
31 December 2014, a loss of £42m was recognised (£4m in the income statement and £38m in other comprehensive 
income) resulting in a deferred tax asset on the statement of financial position of £48m as at 31 December 2014.
The deferred tax adjustment related to the recycling of hedging reserves (see Note D) resulted in a deferred tax 
loss of £1m being charged to the income statement instead of equity under legacy UK GAAP .
Statement of changes in equity
Under legacy UK GAAP the financial statements included a reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds  
as a primary statement.
Under FRS 101, this has been replaced by the statement of changes in equity, which analyses in more detail the 
changes in equity during the year.

Application of FRS 101
The framework permitted by 
FRS 101 reduces disclosures 
covering a wide range of topics, as 
described in note (c) on page 191. 
We intend to prepare the parent 
company accounts for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 on  
the same basis.
The parent company’s accounts  
are still prepared to meet the 
requirements of the Companies  
Act 2006 including giving a true  
and fair view of the company’s 
assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss. This means the 
parent company is therefore always 
required to include in its accounts all 
information relevant to shareholders 
and necessary to show a true and 
fair view.
For further information  
about FRS 101 please visit: 
http://www.icaew.com/en/technical/

disclosure-framework
If you have any objections to  
the company continuing to apply  
the FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework to the individual 
financial statements of the parent 
company, please notify us in writing 
to the Company Secretary, G4S plc 
at 5th Floor, Southside, 105 Victoria 
Street, London SW1E 6QT on  
or before 30 May 2016.
For the year ended 31 December 2015 the 
parent company financial statements have

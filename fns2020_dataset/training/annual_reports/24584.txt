CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Strong underlying performance in the face of known headwinds.
I have great pleasure introducing our Annual 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2015 in which 
we announce a solid set of financial results.  
Our asset gathering abilities have meant that 
despite periods of low investor confidence 
during the year, we have delivered strong net 
new business flows underpinned by impressive 
numbers of net new clients. As a result, our 
assets under administration finished the year at 
a record level. Over the course of the year, we 
successfully navigated through the changes in 
the market place following the Retail Distribution 
Review. We have launched a number of new 
Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-Manager Funds, we 
were one of very few firms ready to offer clients 
the full range of pensions freedom on 6 April, 
and our new HL Portfolio+ service was very well 
received by our clients. At the end of the year we 
were delighted to announce the acquisition of up 
to 7 ,000 clients and £370m of assets from J. P . 
Morgan Asset Management. 
We have taken big strides forward over the year 
supporting our people, with much attention on 
career development and talent management.
We continue to be a financially strong 
organisation with a clean, robust balance sheet 
retaining a healthy margin over the regulatory 
capital adequacy requirements. Therefore 
after careful review of the company’s future 
cash requirements, the Board has decided 
to increase the total dividend for the year by 
paying a second interim ordinary dividend 
of 14.30p per share (2014: 15.39p) and an 
increased special dividend of 11.40p per share 
(2014: 9.61p) representing total dividends for 
the year of 33.0p per share (2014: 32.0p); an 
increase of 3%.
Good governance has always been at the 
heart of what we do. During the course of 
the year, we created a Board Risk Committee 
to supplement the Audit Committee and to 
focus on the forward looking aspects of risk 
management. Towards the end of the year, we 
commissioned an externally facilitated Board 
effectiveness review. Details of the agreed 
outcomes of the review are contained in our 
governance statement and can be found on 
pages 33 to 43. 
Over the course of the year, Peter Hargreaves 
and Tracey Taylor stepped down as Executive 
Directors. Peter co-founded this great business 
in 1981 and his knowledge and expertise will be 
much missed by the Board. We are delighted 
that he remains an employee allowing the 
business to continue to benefit from his wisdom. 
Tracey had been with Hargreaves Lansdown for 
15 years, serving as Chief Financial Officer for the 
last five years and was well respected in the City.   
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank both 
Peter and Tracey for their huge contribution to 
the business.
 In July 2015, we announced that we had 
selected a new independent Non-Executive 
Director whose appointment would be 
confirmed upon receipt of regulatory approval, 
and that Dharmash Mistry would be stepping 
down as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 31 August 2015.
In August 2015, we announced the 
appointment of Chris Hill as Chief Financial 
Officer who, subject to regulatory clearance, 
should be starting with us in March 2016. In 
the meantime we continue to benefit from the 
services of a very well qualified interim Chief 
Financial Officer.
Within the Executive Committee, we said 
goodbye to Nigel Bence after 22 years’ service 
contributing strongly to the risk, compliance 
and operational side of the business. In June 
2015, we welcomed Vikki Williams as Chief 
Operating Officer. 
We have delivered strong underlying 
performance across our business, but in the face 
of known headwinds, we report a reduction in 
profits. These headwinds include this year being 
the first full year following the introduction of 
the Retail Distribution Review, the changes in the 
regulations concerning client money, precluding 
the use of term deposits over 30 days, to 
the detriment of both our clients and our 
shareholders, and an unexpected increase in our 
FSCS levy, which we continue to see as nothing 
more than a tax on well run businesses.
The coming year will be a challenging one but we 
believe we are well set to return the Group to its 
growth trajectory, building on the new services 
and features delivered in 2015 to allow us to 
continue to thrive in our chosen markets. Our 
talented people remain integral to our success 
and, as always my gratitude goes to the Board 
and our staff for their continuing hard work, 
diligence and enthusiasm.

STRATEGIC REPORT 8 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
REVIEW
HEADLINES
The year to 30 June 2015 was characterised 
by continued substantial new asset and client 
flows into Hargreaves Lansdown’s services, 
successful navigation of regulatory changes, and 
announcement and implementation of exciting 
new initiatives.
Despite known headwinds, profit before tax 
remained robust at £199.0 million for the year.  
Our business also continued to grow strongly.  
Net new business was £6.1 billion, representing 
organic growth in Assets Under Administration 
(AUA) of 13%. We welcomed 84,000 net new 
clients, leading to an increase in client numbers 
of 13% to 736,000.  
After a relatively muted first half of the year, 
the six months to 30 June 2015 exceeded both 
expectations for new business and last year, 
with net new business for the six months of 
£3.8 billion (first half of FY2015: £2.3 bn).  
Hargreaves Lansdown remains the largest 
business of its type in the UK, with 35.0% 
of the direct investment market at 31 March 
2015 (Source: Platforum*), up from 33.6% in 
September 2014. Concerns about potential 
competitive pressure have proved unfounded. 
Hargreaves Lansdown has continued to increase 
its share in major markets, including new flows 
into Stocks and Shares ISAs, up from 10.9% 
for the tax year to 5 April 2014 to 14.1% for the 
year to 5 April 2015, and UK execution only 
stockbroking** (up from 22.5% to 24.2%). Our 
new initiatives, particularly new fund launches, 
also proved very successful.
Continued high service levels were rewarded not 
only through record new clients and assets, but 
also continuing high asset retention of 93.4% 
(2014: 93.3%) and through receipt of many 
awards. Hargreaves Lansdown has won no less 
than 35 awards during the last two years. 
We are pleased to present our results for the year ended 
30 June 2015, once again reporting excellent growth in 
Assets Under Administration and clients.
Ian Gorham 
Chief Executive 9 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
HARGREAVES LANSDOWN’S 2015 RESULTS 
Profit before tax for the year was £199.0 million, 
a fall of 5% on last year’s £209.8 million. Whilst 
clients and assets again grew substantially, 
profit faced several headwinds – our decision 
to reduce charges for clients (reduced revenue 
by approximately £20m versus 2014); lower 
interest margins on client cash (reduced revenue 
by approximately £17m versus 2014); lower 
stock markets as the FTSE All Share fell 0.8% 
in the year; an unexpected temporary hiatus 
in foreign exchange trading income (c£3.5m); 
and a charge for a contribution to the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme to cover the 
failings of less reputable companies (a cost of 
£4.4m versus £0.8m in 2014). The impact of 
these headwinds will be less pronounced, or in 
the case of the foreign exchange trading income 
will not be repeated at all, in 2016.
We also report an 18% increase in client assets 
under administration from £46.9 billion to £55.2 
billion. It is remarkable to note that in just 2 years 
client assets have grown by over 51%, from £36.4 
billion in June 2013 to £55.2 billion at 30 June 
2015. Net new business for the year was £6.1 bil-
lion (2014: £6.4 bn) with market movement and 
other factors increasing assets at year end by a 
further £2.2 billion. An additional net new 84,000 
investors (2014: 144,000) became clients during 
the year, taking total active clients for Vantage 
and advised services combined to 736,000. As 
many clients have more than one account, the 
total number of accounts held with Hargreaves 
Lansdown surpassed 1 million during the year.
In the year to 30 June 2014 the FTSE All-Share 
index advanced 9.4%, and we welcomed 
42,000 new clients related to Initial Public 
Offerings (IPOs), especially relevant in 2014 
being the extraordinary interest in the Royal 
Mail Share Offer. By comparison, the year to 
30 June 2015 saw the FTSE All Share fall 0.8%, 
weighed down at various points by factors such 
as the Scottish Independence referendum and 
fears of Greek exit from the Eurozone. Stock 
market performance always influences new 
business and revenue and IPO activity was also 
less prevalent. Set in this context the year’s 
asset gathering was excellent. Net new Vantage 
business in ISAs was £2.6 billion (2014: £2.2bn), 
up 18% and SIPPs £2.3 billion (2014: £2.1bn) up 
10%. Fund and Share account net new business 
was £1.1 billion (2014: £1.8bn), down 39%, aptly 
demonstrating the effect of markets and IPOs 
which tend to primarily affect investing appetite 
in non-tax wrapped general accounts.
Attracting and retaining assets and clients 
through key distribution channels, and delivery 
of service excellence continue to be primary 
drivers of growth. Client retention and 
satisfaction of 93.4% (2014: 93.3%) and 95.7% 
(2014: 92.3%) respectively are testament to our 
quality of service and value for money.
A key part of our strategy is to grow 
complementary capabilities including fund 
management, pension drawdown and other 
services that will provide clients with further “one 
stop shop” investing options, and hence increase 
AUA and clients and therefore revenue and profit.
Perhaps the most immediate success within 
this strategy has been our fund management 
expansion. During the year we launched HL UK 
Growth, HL Asia and Emerging Markets, and HL 
European Multi Manager funds, to add to our 
existing five Multi-Manager funds. In less than 
6 months, by 30 June 2015 the three new funds 
had attracted a combined £418 million of 
assets. These new launches allied to growth 
in our existing funds takes total funds under 
Hargreaves Lansdown’s management to £5.6 
billion (2014 £4.3bn). 
In June 2015 we also launched HL Portfolio+, a 
straightforward investing service based around 
our multi-manager funds and a simple online 
selection process. Although early days, interest 
in this service has been promising.
Our preparations made for the “pension 
freedoms” announced by the Chancellor during
the year meant that when this legislation was
introduced on 6 April 2015 Hargreaves Lansdown 
was one of the few companies able to offer a
comprehensive array of pension services allowing 
clients to take advantage of the freedoms. This
effort was rewarded, with £1.6 billion of net new 
pension business in the six months to 30 June 
2015, a 33% rise on the same period for 2014.
The interest rate environment remains depressed, 
and therefore income from cash balances 
remained low. However, in April 2015 we 
completed changes to our SIPP which allowed 
us to place client money on term deposit, a 
significant development as over 50% of client 
cash is held in the SIPP . This allowed us to 
increase both revenue and interest rates we 
pay to clients holding cash in their SIPP . Interest 
income should further recover when interest rates 
increase. However, in the short term we continue 
to experience subdued margins on cash balances.
Our Corporate Vantage service continues 
to expand, with 256 schemes live or in 
implementation (2014: 211). This increase in 
schemes has been accompanied by a 32% 
increase in Corporate Vantage assets, which 
now stand at £1.3 billion. Although this  
project remains long-term in nature we remain 
satisfied with its continued success. Growth 
in the first half of the year was constrained by 
the effect of new auto-enrolment on our key 
markets, with many companies focusing on 
achieving compliance rather than selecting new 
schemes. Once that period abated, the second 
half of the year was much stronger, with 32 
schemes added in the second half compared to 
22 for the corresponding period in 2014.
STRATEGIC REPORT 10 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
2015/2016 MARKET OUTLOOK
There continue to be some welcome signs 
of a return to stronger economic trading 
conditions. As we saw during the year under 
review, this does not necessarily always 
translate into higher stock market levels.  
Stock market performance is a key factor 
for our results and we believe markets are 
likely to continue to be influenced by the 
performance of Asian economies, particularly 
China, with the potential for occasional 
reprises of Eurozone issues and the influence 
of geopolitical events. However we believe 
value exists in a number of key stock markets, 
particularly Europe and Japan.  
We are also pleased to note that the benefits 
of saving and investing now feature more 
regularly as key aspects of government policy 
and this is likely to enhance the attractiveness 
of investing and the future growth of our 
company. We therefore remain optimistic 
about the future.
GROUP OUTLOOK
Given our excellent performance and reduced 
headwinds, looking forward we intend 2016 
to show a return to healthy profit growth, 
even taking into account expenditure on 
launching new services. 
Having successfully absorbed 2014’s 
regulatory changes, particularly the Retail 
Distribution Review (RDR), we have been able 
to deploy staff and resources on improving 
the business. The largest development in 
train is to deliver new cash and Peer-to-Peer 
lending services to clients. This development 
remains on track and we expect to bring it to 
market in the second half of 2016.
Given the success of our fund management 
business, further fund launches are planned, 
alongside a number of other improvements to 
the already excellent services we offer within 
the group. Once we have sufficient track 
record to evaluate the success of our new 
Portfolio+ service, we will consider whether 
to further expand our stable of simple online 
investing tools, sometimes referred to as 
“robo-advice.”
Whilst Hargreaves Lansdown has the scale 
and resources to deal with rising costs posed 
by ever-increasing regulation, technology and 
servicing expectations, these factors are an 
increasing challenge for a number of firms in 
our industry. Two transactions, one in June 
2015 and the other in July 2015 have been 
entered into with third party companies who 
wished to transfer their books of business to 
Hargreaves Lansdown post year-end. These 
transactions combined could in due course 
add up to £430 million of client assets 
and 12,000 clients. We believe further 
opportunities may present themselves in 
future as the need for scale becomes ever 
more vital.
THE IMPACT OF REGULATION AND 
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The retail distribution review, the biggest struc-
tural change to our industry for many years, 
has now been implemented and has had time 
to bed in. Looking forward, we see the direct 
investment market continuing to grow.  
Unusually the year’s biggest changes arose not 
from regulation but from government policy, 
particularly around pensions. In the budget the 
Chancellor announced what has become known 
as the “pension freedoms,” allowing the UK 
public more access to their pension investments 
and more options for funding their retirement. 
As well as supporting these changes Hargreaves 
Lansdown has been uniquely well-placed to 
benefit from them, being one of the biggest 
providers of drawdown services as well as 
the U.K.’s largest independent annuity broker. 
Through a considerable amount of hard work 
our company was in a position to offer clients 
full access to the freedoms from their inception 
on 6 April 2015 and we have benefited from 
considerable new pension business as a result. 
We hope this trend continues in 2016.
Following on from the positive public response to 
the pension freedoms, subsequent government 
policy has also brought more encouragement 
for saving and investing. The government has 
introduced the ability for Child Trust Funds 
(CTFs) to be transferred to Junior ISAs, and a 
£5,000 tax-free dividend allowance. Whilst these 
have been to some extent offset by changes 
to pensions tax relief and dividend taxation 
for wealthier investors, overall the package of 
changes have been positive and benefit the 
majority of our investors, further assisting us in 
encouraging investment amongst the UK public. 
Regulation is a continuous theme in financial ser-
vices, and addressing regulatory change continues 
to take up a considerable amount of our time and 
resources. However , Hargreaves Lansdown is 
well-placed to address these challenges and whilst 
there are always further regulatory changes coming 
down the track, we do not expect them to have as 
material an impact as those of the last 18 months. 11 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Hargreaves Lansdown is an ethical company and 
champion of the retail investor. We campaign 
tirelessly on behalf of retail investors to improve 
their lot and their wealth.
We continue to encourage price competition 
within the fund industry which has resulted in 
reduced costs of both active and passive funds 
for investors. We have negotiated market leading 
discounts on some of the best UK funds to the 
benefit of our clients. The ability for CTFs to be 
transferred to Junior ISAs allows more than 6 
million children to potentially benefit from lower 
charges, better service and returns. This change 
is also something we have campaigned for over 
a considerable period and we were delighted to 
see it come to pass.
Other campaigns have included making it 
easier and quicker for investors to transfer their 
investments and pensions from one provider to 
another, campaigning for better pensions access, 
which means we welcome the Chancellor’s 
approach of greater freedoms for pension 
investors at retirement, and we continue to 
challenge HMRC on the issue of taxation of 
loyalty bonuses, the so called “discount tax”. A 
successful challenge would see money being 
returned to investors.
Hargreaves Lansdown will again pay its 
corporate taxes in full in the UK, and we shall 
continue to seek to be a role model for how 
financial services companies deliver a great 
service, reputable behaviour and profitability in 
harmony with the UK public.
During the year the company supported the 
Youth Adventure Trust as its charity chosen by 
staff, and the Wallace and Gromit Grand Appeal, 
amongst others.
CONCLUSION
I would like to thank our clients, shareholders, 
staff and my fellow directors in what has once 
again been a very busy year of significant 
progress. The support and dedication they 
have shown has delivered another set of great 
results.

STRATEGIC REPORT 12 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
BUSINESS 
MODEL
As the UK’s largest direct to investor “investment company” Hargreaves Lansdown aims 
to make profits by providing investors with a competitively priced service for acquiring, 
managing and disposing of a wide range of authorised investments. The service  
incorporates provision of a wealth of information and research into opportunities with 
potential. We aim to be the best place in the UK to buy investments directly.
We aim to improve internal efficiencies 
embracing all proven technology. At the same 
time we strive to offer the best research and 
information across an increasing spectrum of 
investments and markets using Hargreaves 
Lansdown’s buying power to secure the best 
prices and lowest charges from providers.  
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO
We have been helping clients choose and 
manage their own investments since 1981 
and are now the UK’s largest direct to investor 
‘investment supermarket’ with an annual 
turnover in excess of £395 million. We 
provide execution only, advisory services and 
third party investments for individuals and 
corporates. We administer £55.2 billion of 
investments in our ISA, SIPP and Investment 
accounts for 736,000 clients, and have 
arranged investments for over a million clients.
Our success is built around providing our clients 
a high quality service tailored to their needs, 
and ensuring that they have access to relevant 
information to support them with making their 
own investment decisions. We also provide a 
discretionary service (the Portfolio Management 
Service) if clients prefer not to make their own 
investment decisions. Our knowledgeable and 
helpful staff, technology and experience enable 
us to provide an excellent and convenient 
service to our clients.  
Read more about our range of services on pages 
2 to 3.
HOW OUR BUSINESS GENERATES VALUE
Fund supermarkets and wrap platforms more
typically focus on servicing the IFA community.  
Our investment supermarket services the private
investor directly. The Hargreaves Lansdown
business model allows us to offer highly 
competitive prices to our clients and achieve
strong profitability. We aim to create shareholder 
value by retaining our position as the best place
in the UK for private investors to buy investments. 
We earn the majority of our income based 
on the value of assets under administration 
(AUA). This income is based on a percentage 
of the value of AUA and is expressed as basis 
points (bps). AUA grow through existing and 
new clients adding more investments into 
their accounts, combined with growth in the 
underlying value of the investments they hold in 
their accounts. Stock markets give an indication 
of investment growth and the most relevant 
proxy measure we have for such growth tends 
to be the movement in the FTSE All Share Index.  
As such, as markets grow this tends to boost 
AUA and therefore income and ultimately profits. 
Income levels vary according to the class of 
investment, the type of account and the amount 
held – some fees are stepped, tiered or capped.  
The mix of investments and products has an 
impact on the levels of revenue. 
We aim to grow our business by retaining existing 
clients, obtaining continued new investments 
from our existing clients and by winning new 
clients. We do this by providing market leading 
service, information, and value. When combined 
with the security we offer and the trust in our 
brand it provides a compelling reason for clients 
to choose Hargreaves Lansdown.
New business grows our AUA, but there will 
also be a natural loss of business whether from 
investors using their savings upon retirement, 
death or the effects of competition. However, 
investors can readily switch between different 
investments without the need to leave our 
investment platform, which means we do not 
see the outflows of AUA that an asset manager 
would experience when an investor decides 
to sell their investment – the cash or the new 
investment can remain on our investment 
platform. We aim to retain as much AUA as 
possible with a constant focus on excellent 
service and providing a ‘one stop shop’ offering 
a broad range of investments and services. AUA 
may also grow or be reduced due to the effect 
of market movements.
WHERE WE ARE BASED AND HOW WE 
OPERATE
We have been based in Bristol ever since the 
business was started in 1981. Our clients are 
located across the UK, with the majority of 
business taking place through our website. 88% 
of our clients have access to our website and 
all of our clients have access to our telephone 
helpdesk. For those clients who require advice, 
and prefer face to face advice, we have a team of 
102 financial advisers located throughout the UK.
Our people, our culture, our technology and 
IT infrastructure are key to our success. As 
at 30 June 2015 we employ 970 people and 
are committed to recruiting and retaining 
great people who understand our client-led 
culture (see Our People on page 31). We have 
a flat management structure and aim where 
possible to promote from within, building 
knowledge and loyalty.
WHO OUR CLIENTS ARE
Our investment supermarket service is provided 
directly to the private investor in the UK. Our 
clients may be investing for their future, saving for 
retirement, investing for children or grandchildren, 
making the most of tax allowances by using ISA 
and pension allowances, or they may be drawing 
down on their investments after retirement. The 
majority of our clients select and manage their 
own investments using our Vantage platform. 
Alternatively they can use our Multi-Manager  13 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
funds or the Hargreaves Lansdown Portfolio+ 
service which provides ready-made portfolios 
which are managed by our in-house experts. 
Through the Vantage service our clients are able 
to access over 13,000 different investments 
including over 2,500 investment funds, shares 
listed on the UK, US, Canadian and European 
stock exchanges, bonds, ETFs and investment 
trusts, and can also hold cash balances. We have 
727 ,000 active Vantage clients as at 30 June 2015.
We also provide services such as workplace 
pension schemes and annuity purchase services 
to private investors through corporate clients.  
We work on behalf of 500 corporate clients, of 
which 256 are Corporate Vantage schemes – the 
51,400 individual clients within those schemes 
are included in the number of Vantage clients.
Some of our clients prefer to have an investment 
manager looking after their investments for them, 
and they can use our Portfolio Management 
Service (PMS) which is accessed via one of our 
many highly qualified financial advisers. We have 
14,845 PMS clients. Read more on these and the 
other services we provide on pages 2 to 3.
HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT
Everyone these days talks about excellent 
service. It is easy to talk about it, but it takes 
experience and commitment to actually deliver 
it. Our service is joined up – one website, one 
login, one conversation, one platform offering a 
huge range of investments – a ‘one stop shop’. 
There is more we can do to keep improving, but 
we are in a strong position when it comes to 
delivering great service as evidenced by recent 
awards from Which? and The Platforum.
A founding principle of our business is ‘simplicity’ 
– the financial services industry is weighed down 
with complexity, yet when we deal directly with 
self-directed investors we make it simple for them.  
We use our scale and position in the market to 
negotiate favourable discounts for our clients, we 
lobby for better savings products, and we put the 
client at the heart of everything that we do.
Most changes and opportunities within our 
business require an element of systems or web 
development. We own, control and develop our 
own IT systems. We have our own proprietary 
systems that are not sold to others in the 
industry, and we have in-house development 
knowledge and expertise. This makes us nimble 
and quick to respond to opportunities. Our 
business is not capital intensive, but we employ 
157 IT staff to maintain, develop and operate our 
IT infrastructure, website and systems. The long-
term sustainability of our IT platform continues to 
be a key strategic priority for us.
HOW OUR BUSINESS IS SUSTAINABLE
 We have a consistent track record of 
growing AUA, active clients and improving 
our service. Other than this year, for the 
reasons highlighted in the Chief Executive’s 
statement, we also have a consistent track 
record of growing profits and EPS. We believe 
this is because we have the right distribution 
channels, offer the right service and products, 
and operate with the right cost structure.  
Going forward we believe that market and 
demographic trends continue to be favourable 
expanding our key markets of pensions and 
ISAs. In addition the growth in the market size 
addressable by Direct to Client platforms is 
expected to continue growing significantly. 
A large proportion of AUA (71%) are “sticky”, by 
this we mean that they are held within a tax 
wrapper which makes investors less likely to 
spend them. Our excellent service standards 
and breadth of service means that we have very 
high rates of asset and client retention (92.7% 
and 93.4% respectively). As a result, we attract 
high quality recurring revenue streams.
The business operations are very scalable, and as 
it continues to grow we benefit from economies 
of scale and increasing cost efficiency. We utilise 
technology to ensure our service is efficient and 
as automated as possible such that adding new 
clients and assets has only a marginal impact. 
We continually look at the competitive landscape, 
industry developments and what our clients 
want in order to evolve our service with the aim 
of growing our market share. Communication 
with clients is conducted through regular client 
forums and various targeted surveys. A key 
current project is how we can better service the 
asset class of cash on behalf of our clients and to 
that end we are developing a cash management 
portal and Peer to Peer lending service which will 
give access to a significant new pool of assets 
that we can look to add to our platform and earn 
recurring revenues.
 
To ensure that the business continues to thrive, 
we reinvest some of the increased profits back 
into the business to provide improved services, 
better functionality and over time we strive to 
make costs cheaper for our clients.

BUSINESS 
REVIEW
In a muted year for 
both stock markets and 
retail investing the key 
performance metrics of 
gathering assets and 
clients have remained 
strong, primarily because 
of our continued excellent 
service and value 
provided. Although the 
headwinds of post-RDR 
pricing and lower interest 
margins on cash have 
impacted revenue and 
profits this year, the 
underlying performance 
of the business has been 
strong, remains highly 
profitable and provides a 
solid basis for returning to 
profit growth.  
Net new business in the Vantage SIPP , ISA and 
Fund & Share account was respectively £2.3 
billion, £2.6 billion and £1.1 billion (2014: £2.1 
billion, £2.2 billion, £1.8 billion), in total £6.0 
billion (2014: £6.1 billion). The SIPP increase 
of 10% was driven by an increased number 
of SIPP clients making more contributions 
and transfers of other pensions to Vantage. In 
addition the new pension freedoms, introduced 
from 6 April 2015, have contributed to a 
particular increase year-on-year in net new 
business. The ISA increase of 18% was driven 
by increased transfers into Vantage as clients 
look to consolidate their ISA investments in 
one place. The ability to transfer Child Trust 
Funds to the Vantage Junior ISA from 6 April 
2015 has also provided a boost with £60m 
of transfers in just 3 months. In contrast the 
Vantage Fund & Share account decreased 
by 39%. As this account has no tax benefits 
and no caps on contributions it tends to be 
impacted by investor confidence and market 
sentiment. It often serves as a destination for 
investment once clients have used their tax 
wrapper accounts and also serves as the first 
point of call when withdrawing cash. Unlike last 
year there was not nearly the same level of IPO 
activity driving new business flows within the 
Fund and Share account. In addition there has 
been a significant increase this year in value of 
transfers from this account into the SIPP and 
ISA accounts as clients utilise tax benefits.  
PMS has grown by 12%, although net new 
business within PMS slowed significantly to £72 
million (2014: £304 million) as the option of 
investing in Vantage portfolios was preferred. 
Market growth was again a positive contributor 
to AUA with Vantage market growth being 
£2.0 billion (2014: £4.0 billion) and PMS £169 
million (2014: £198 million). Over the year to 
30 June 2015 the FTSE All-Share index fell by 
0.82%, although the average month-end level 
of the FTSE All-Share index was 2.0% higher 
versus 11.9% higher in 2014. 
The first half of the year was rather muted

During the year the value of total AUA has increased by 18%. The Group achieved net new 
business inflows of £6.1 billion, and the positive impact of the rise in investment markets 
and other growth factors increased client assets by a further £2.2 billion. Total AUA can be 
broken down as follows: 17 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
for both stock markets and retail investing, 
however, net new business was still a 
creditable £2.25 billion. This was down on the 
prior year comparison of £2.80 billion which 
enjoyed the dual boost of both rising stock 
markets and interest created by various IPOs 
and in particular the Royal Mail share offer.
The second half of the year is typically our 
busiest as the tax year-end is an important 
driver of new business. This year was no 
exception with a record £3.8 billion of net 
new business in the second half versus £3.6 
billion for the prior year comparative. This year 
benefited from the three HL Multi-Manager fund 
launches, the new pension freedoms from 6 
April 2015 and the ability to transfer Child Trust 
Funds into Junior ISAs. The comparative was 
boosted by the TSB IPO and Woodford fund 
launches both of which took place in June 2014 
and resulted in c£293m of new business. The 
strong second half was particularly pleasing 
given the relatively benign investment backdrop, 
with investor confidence declining and markets 
showing little growth. This performance is 
testament to the value our clients place on our 
continued excellent service and the additional 
new products and services we provide. 
Cash deposit rates on offer from banks have 
remained at historically low levels. Those 
seeking a higher return continue to turn to 
alternative investment options such as funds 
and shares, which offer higher yields and 
potential capital growth. This factor continues 
to spur clients to divert more of their savings 
into investments in Vantage. Because the 
options available to the UK investors for readily 
available online cash products are limited 
we are currently developing a range of cash 
management services including cash broking 
and Peer to Peer lending which we expect to 
be launched in the second half of 2016. This 
will give us new services for cash and once 
launched should help attract additional assets 
from existing clients and new clients who 
primarily want better returns on cash.
More clients are investing through Hargreaves 
Lansdown than ever before. In total we now 
administer investments for 736,000 clients 
(2014: 652,000, +13%) across 1,024,000 
accounts (2014: 920,000, + 11%).

STRATEGIC REPORT 18 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
The Group is organised into three core 
operating divisions, based around the products 
and services described on pages 2 and 3:
– Vantage: represents 75% of Group 
operating profit.  
– Discretionary and Managed: represents 
20% of Group operating profit. 
– Third Party and Other services: represents 
5% of Group operating profit.
VANTAGE
As highlighted in the Chief Executive’s Review, 
during the year we faced significant headwinds 
on interest earned on client money and on the 
margin we made on investment funds held by 
clients. The base rate of interest remained at 
its historic low of 0.5% for a sixth consecutive 
year. Combined with the FCAs restrictions on 
the use of term deposits for client money as 
from 1 July 2014, this served to drive down the 
revenue margin on client money to 0.53% (2014: 
0.91%). This year was also the first full year 
under the RDR pricing regime and as previously 
flagged there will be a decline in the revenue 
margin on funds from the implementation 
date of March 2014 until April 2016 when all 
renewal commissions still received from fund 
management groups relating to pre-RDR funds 
will be passed on fully to clients. The revenue 
margin for funds held on the Vantage platform 
in the year was 0.46% (2014: 0.52%). From 
April 2016, barring any other changes, we would 
expect the net revenue margin earned on funds 
to be c0.42%-0.43%. 
A third factor affecting Vantage revenue was 
the restructuring of the collection method for 
overseas foreign exchange income relating 
to overseas trading by clients. A decision 
was made to bring this activity in-house 
using our own foreign exchange service. The 
new collection method, a change required at 
short notice, will give us better control and 
long term robustness over this income and 
will also allow us to pass on the benefits 
of the resulting efficiencies in reduced 
overseas trading costs for many clients. The 
development work necessitated a hiatus in 
collecting this income over the second half of 
the year, with a one-off revenue reduction in 
stockbroking commission estimated at £3.5m 
for the six months to 30 June 2015. The 
work was completed in July 2015 and foreign 
exchange revenue returned to normal.
The Vantage division’s net revenue decreased 
by £1.0 million from £221.0 million to £220.0 
million. Although there was an 18% growth 
in AUA this year, plus the impact of a full 
year’s income on assets gathered during the 
previous year, it was not enough to offset 
the headwinds mentioned above. Interest on 
client money fell from £33.7 million to £24.2 
million; stockbroking commission fell from 
£39.0 million to £35.4 million and revenue 
from funds, despite the 22% increase in fund 
AUA across the year, only increased by 7% 
from £128.0 million to £136.7 million. 
The £6.0 billion of net new business inflows, 
or ‘organic growth’, represented 14% growth 
in Vantage assets this year (2014: 18%). 
The increase in AUA derived from stock 
market and other growth factors was 5% 
(2014: 12%). The combined impact of organic 
growth and market growth resulted in SIPP 
AUA growing by 22%, ISA by 21% and assets 
in the Fund and Share account by 10%. 
Included within the Fund and Share account is 
a significant holding in Hargreaves Lansdown 
plc shares which decreased in value by 
8% during the year. Excluding Hargreaves 
Lansdown shares, the growth in Fund and 
Share AUA was 16%. 
As at 30 June 2015, the value of assets within 
the Vantage ISA was £20.7 billion (30 June 
2014: £17.1 billion), the Vantage SIPP was 
£16.4 billion (30 June 2014: £13.4 billion) and 
the Vantage Fund and Share Account was 
£15.2 billion (30 June 2014: £13.8 billion).
 
During the year the number of active Vantage 
clients increased by 84,000 to 727 ,000. Total 
clients include 50,000 active Corporate Vantage 
scheme members across 248 live schemes and 
43,000 Junior ISA clients. Junior ISA clients were 
up from 25,000 last year helped by the fact that 
as from 6 April 2015 Child Trust Funds could 
be transferred across to Junior ISAs. We now 
administer 231,000 SIPP accounts, 515,000 
ISA accounts and 256,000 Fund and Share 
accounts on behalf of our clients.
21% more clients contributed to their SIPP 
than in the year to 30 June 2014, with the 
average new contribution into a Vantage SIPP 
this year increasing by 8% to £8,921. The 
number of clients subscribing to their Vantage 
Stocks and Share ISA decreased by 1%, 
however the average subscription increased 
by 24% to £10,153.  
Clients continued to transfer SIPP , ISA and 
other investments held elsewhere into our 
Vantage service. The value of transfers-in 
increased this year by a significant 19%. 
More clients sought to consolidate their 
investments and benefit from the advantages 
of having them all held in one place with a 
company they trust.
Clients continued to have a relatively low 
weighting in cash and were prepared to take 
more risk given the continued low interest 
rates available on cash. The composition of 
assets across the whole of Vantage at 30 June 
2015 was 10% cash (30 June 2014: 9%), 34% 
stocks and shares (30 June 2014: 36%), and 
56% investment funds (30 June 2014: 55%). 
The slight increase in cash weighting occurred 
post the tax year-end as clients contributed 
to their accounts but deferred investment 
because of reduced investor confidence. 
A number of our clients make regular 
contributions into their ISA, SIPP or Fund 
and Share accounts. The ‘Regular Savers’ 
service has been growing steadily since being 
introduced 12 years ago, and as at 30 June 
2015 we had 105,000 clients (2014: 81,000) 
saving a total of £34.4 million (2014: £28.2 
million) each month by way of direct debit  19 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
instruction. Our Corporate Vantage service 
has the potential to significantly increase 
the value of regular monthly savings and 
Corporate Vantage clients currently subscribe 
an additional £15.7 million each month.
We handled over 10.7 million dealing 
instructions on behalf of 727,000 clients. Our 
website (www.hl.co.uk) and apps were visited 
87.7 million times, an increase of 20% on the 
previous year.  
Vantage clients transacted 7.4 million fund 
deals (2014: 6.3 million) and 3.4 million 
share deals in the year (2014: 3.0 million). No 
charge is made to our clients for dealing in 
investment funds and therefore fund dealing 
does not generate revenues. Share deals are 
made up of client driven deals and automated 
deals such as dividend income reinvestment 
and regular savings. The threshold for 
dividend reinvestment was lowered from £50 
to £10 as from 1 June 2014 and consequently 
the volume of automated deals has increased 
significantly this year. Client driven deals 
totalled 2.8 million compared to 2.7 million 
last year. Despite the overall increase in 
dealing volumes stockbroking commission fell 
by £3.6m to £35.4 million as a result of the 
temporary loss in overseas foreign exchange 
income explained above.
DISCRETIONARY AND MANAGED
The Discretionary division earns recurring 
income on underlying investments held in 
the Group’s Portfolio Management Service 
(PMS), and on investments in the Group’s 
Multi-Manager funds. Net revenue in the 
Discretionary division increased by 17% from 
£44.9 million to £52.4 million. The increase in 
AUM helped to increase management fee and 
ongoing advice income. In addition following 
the implementation of RDR from 1 March 2014, 
the annual management fee charged on the HL 
Multi-Manager funds of 0.75% has been retained 
wholly within the discretionary division. Pre-RDR 
a 0.5% intra-group renewal commission was 
paid into Vantage in respect of Vantage client 
fund holdings. The net impact is an effective 
increase in revenue to the discretionary division 
and a reduction in Vantage. 
The value of assets managed by Hargreaves 
Lansdown through its own range of multi-
manager funds and PMS increased by 26% 
to £5.8 billion as at 30 June 2015 (2014: £4.6 
billion). The growth in assets was driven by 
net new business of £0.9 billion combined with 
a market increase of £0.3 billion. During the 
second half of the year three new multi-manager 
funds were successfully launched helping to 
attract new clients and assets. The three new 
funds are “UK Growth”, “European” and “Asia 
and Emerging Markets” and provide further 
geographical and sector diversification to the 
existing range. In the short time since launch 
these three funds have grown to a combined 
value of £418m. Their popularity since launch 
along with the continued growth of the existing 
five funds is an endorsement of the investment 
expertise and service we provide. 
Our Portfolio Management Service generates 
revenue from initial and ongoing advice fees, 
as clients are supported through our team 
of financial advisers. As at 30 June 2015 the 
Group had 102 financial advisers (30 June 
2014: 102). 
THIRD PARTY AND OTHER SERVICES
Third party and other services net revenues 
fell 16% during the year, from £26.0 million to 
£21.8 million.
The key reason for the decline has been the 
full year impact of the reduction in annuity 
volumes brokered following pension reforms 
introduced in the Government’s March 2014 
budget and hence the commission income 
received. The reforms have introduced greater 
flexibility in terms of how people access their 
pension savings and as a result the demand 
for annuities has declined. Annuity income has 
fallen from £4.7m in 2014 to £1.9m this year. 
As annuity volumes have declined we have 
seen an increase in clients moving into Income 
Drawdown and the associated recurring 
revenue streams from this service are within 
the Vantage division. 
Revenue from our Funds Library service 
(through the provision of fund data and 
research services) increased by £0.4 million 
to £6.4 million. The service has experienced 
underlying growth in client numbers and 
funds which has helped to increase the 
recurring revenue across a range of the 
services provided. 
The total revenues from Hargreaves 
Lansdown Currency and Markets (CFDs, 
spread betting and currency services) were 
marginally up at £4.2m as increased numbers 
of clients utilise these additional services, 
particularly the currency service, driving 
transactional volumes higher.  
Third party business has been in decline over 
recent years. Although the Group continues 
to act as an intermediary for some third 
party corporate pension schemes there is a 
focus on our own Corporate Vantage services 
which means that we expect that third party 
business will continue to decline. Indeed for the 
year, third party corporate income other than 
annuities fell by £1.7million to £3.0 million. 
IT AND SYSTEMS
We continue our successful approach of 
managing a continuous programme of 
improvement around our dedicated IT 
platform. The bespoke nature of our systems 
architecture enables us to deliver ongoing 
improvements in a successful manner. Our 
services continue to evolve and include 
the introduction of our Retirement Planner, 
Portfolio+ and Watchlists, to name just a 
few. Improvements are co-ordinated with 
significant strategic investments to ensure 
capacity, security and processing capabilities 
are scalable in the years ahead.  
STRATEGIC REPORT 20 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
MARKET 
REVIEW
Regulation and markets
Hargreaves Lansdown operates in a highly 
regulated industry, but is well placed to deal 
with the continued pace of regulatory change.  
This year saw the first full year of our post-RDR 
pricing structure, the effects of which have been 
highlighted in the Chief Executive’s Review. 
The year also included significant work to 
respond to the changes in pension legislation, as 
well as work on the launch of three new funds 
and adapting to regulatory changes introduced 
by the Alternative Investment Fund Directive.
In the wider marketplace, the effects of Basel 3 
continued to impact the cash deposit rates that 
we are able to earn for our customers, although 
we have worked hard to offset some of the 
negative effects by amending SIPP cash to a 
trustee arrangement. 
We aim to maintain an open and constructive 
dialogue with the FCA and we continue to 
monitor forthcoming regulatory changes. 
Perhaps the most significant of these is 
expected to be MiFID II which is likely to require 
additional reporting and processing changes 
for our business from January 2017 . We will 
continue to engage in active dialogue with the 
regulator and industry over implementation.
The markets in which Hargreaves Lansdown 
operates are multi-faceted. Competitors include 
IFAs, execution-only brokers, banks, building 
societies, life assurers, fund supermarkets and 
certain wrap platforms. Given the success of 
our business, direct competition is predicted to 
increase; however, significant barriers to entry 
exist. We have 34 years’ experience and have 
developed the IT systems and infrastructure in-
house, both to facilitate efficient administration 
and more specifically to fulfil clients’ needs, of 
which we have unparalleled knowledge. Our 
direct postal marketing reach is in excess of 2.3 
million people, a contact list which would be 
difficult to compile today, and we have ensured 
that we have grasped the opportunities 
offered by digital marketing, creating a 
powerful distribution network. Given our brand 
reputation and scale, if increased competition 
leads to increased awareness and growth in 
our markets we see this as positive.
Hargreaves Lansdown’s market share has 
increased in the majority of relevant markets 
that figures are available for. For example, for 
the year to 5 April 2015, HMRC figures show that 
14.1% of all stocks and shares ISA subscriptions 
were made via Hargreaves Lansdown. This 
compares to 10.9% for the year to 5 April 2014. 
At 30 June 2015 our share of the execution 
only stockbroking market in the UK had risen 
to 24.2%, compared to 22.5% at the end of the 
previous year (source: Compeer).
In addition, transfers of client assets from 
competitor companies to Hargreaves 
Lansdown increased by 12%. Hargreaves 
Lansdown is a net recipient of assets from 
the vast majority of other companies in the 
market every year. Our own asset retention, 
however, remains extremely strong, at 92.7% 
of all assets under administration. This is 
testament to our excellent service. 
We must not be complacent, as there are many 
companies who would like to emulate the success 
of Hargreaves Lansdown. However, for now our 
service remains unparalleled and we must work 
hard to maintain our competitive advantage.
ISAs
The ISA market continues to grow. HMRC 
figures published in August 2015 show that 
new subscriptions into Stocks and Shares ISAs 
were £17.9 billion and over £245 billion is now 
held within Stocks and Shares ISAs. In the 
tax year ended 5 April 2015 over 2.7 million 
adults contributed into a Stocks and Shares ISA 
with the average subscription being £6,593. 
Hargreaves Lansdown saw 249,000 adult 
clients contributing an average of £10,153. 
Each year our excellent customer service 
results in net transfers of client assets from 
other ISA providers. This year a record 52,753 
clients transferred £1.20 billion of investments 
to us. With continued low interest rates, Stocks 
and Shares ISAs remain attractive. Following 
last year’s increase in the ISA allowance from 
£11,880 to the new NISA allowance of £15,000, 
this year’s increase returns to a more normal 
increase to £15,240 as from 6 April 2015.
The launch of the Junior ISA in November 2011 
widened the ISA market with the ability to 
currently save up to £4,080 for each child per 
annum. Subsequently Hargreaves Lansdown 
and others successfully lobbied the Treasury 
to permit transfers from Child Trust Funds 
(CTFs) to Junior ISAs and following a period of 
consultation the Government made this change 
from 6 April 2015. Over six million children 
in the UK currently have CTFs with circa £4.8 
billion pounds invested. Between 6 April 2015 
and 30 June 2015 we saw over 11,600 transfers 
from CTFs to Junior ISAs further establishing 
Hargreaves Lansdown as the largest provider 
of Junior Stocks and Shares ISAs in the UK.
PENSIONS/SIPPs
The SIPP market is estimated to have assets 
under administration of £150 billion across 1.1 
million accounts. As at 30 June 2015 our Vantage 
and PMS SIPP together held £17 .0 billion, 
representing 11.3% of this current market.
In future the UK population will be less able 
to rely on state assistance or defined benefit 
pension provision. As a result there is an 
increasing need for people to make their own 
pension arrangements. 
Pension auto-enrolment in the UK is currently 
being phased in and by 2017 all employers will 
have to auto-enrol eligible staff into a suitable 
workplace pension and pay contributions on 
their behalf. Escalating minimum contributions 
have been set. By 1 October 2018 the minimum 
contribution will be 9% of which the employer 
will have to pay a minimum of 4%. Our 
Corporate Vantage service seeks to service this 
market. Existing schemes we administer will 
also benefit from auto-enrolment contributions. 
The gap between current saving and the 
amount needed to adequately fund retirement 
is being partially addressed through auto-
enrolment. In addition the increased flexibility 
introduced to pensions as from 6 April 2015 
should make them a more popular investment 
in the future. Combined, these two factors 
should provide the stimulus for long-term 
growth in the pension market. 
The pension changes or “Pension Freedoms” 
were introduced from 6 April 2015. The 
new freedoms allow for unlimited pension 
withdrawals from the age of 55 (subject to tax 
laws) and the potential to pass your pension on 
to family tax free. Such changes make pensions 
not only better in terms of a retirement plan 
but also as a long-term savings product.  21 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE – 
KEY INDICATORS 
We use a range of indicators in order to assess performance. We consider the 
following measures to be the key financial, operational and commercial indicators 
when looking at the overall performance of the Group. We refer to these measures 
throughout the Strategic Report.
A key indicator of success for the Group is the 
extent to which we have increased total assets 
under administration (AUA) during the period.  
This involves encouraging existing clients to 
entrust us with more of their savings through 
the provision of quality service, information 
and pricing, whilst also attracting new clients.  
In 2015 the 18% growth in value of total AUA 
(2014: 29%) was attributable to strong new 
business volumes, stock market increases 
and maintaining very high client and asset 
retention rates and client satisfaction scores. 
Analysis of our AUA suggests that the FTSE 
All-Share index is a reasonable benchmark 
to use for stock market effects on AUA and 
so any change in this index can form a useful 
comparison against the growth in AUA. The 
FTSE All-Share index decreased by 0.8% during 
the year ended 30 June 2015 but on average 
the FTSE All-Share index has been 2% higher 
than during the 2014 financial year. 
Assets under Administration produce a 
recurring revenue stream consisting of renewal 
commission, platform fees, management fees 
and interest. The percentage of recurring 
net revenue attributable to these ‘quality 
earnings’ increased slightly from 76% in 2014 
to 78% in 2015. The value of recurring net 
revenues increased by 5% from £220.8 million 
to £228.9 million. Not all of our AUA 
generates recurring revenue, so when looking 
at the growth in total AUA, it is relevant to 
consider another indicator, the proportion of 
assets earning recurring revenue. This has 
increased slightly from 82% in 2014 to 84% 
in 2015. 
The number of active clients acts as an 
indicator of how successful the Group has 
been at adding to its client bank. In 2015, client 
numbers increased by 13% (2014: 29%) and as 
at 30 June 2015 stood at 736,000. 
Net operating profit margin decreased from 
71.3% to 67 .3%. Robust control of costs has 
continued although investment in new services, 
increased IT investment, (both of which have 
increased employee numbers), plus a significant 
increase in the FSCS levy have impacted the 
margin. The group cost ratio during FY 2015 
improved further as we continued to benefit 
from our efficient and scalable operations. We 
consider the diluted earnings per share figure 
to be the most appropriate measure of financial 
performance. This decreased by 3.2% in the  
year to 33.1 pence.

STRATEGIC REPORT 22 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
The Business review on pages 16 to 19 contains 
information about the performance of the Group, 
in particular further information about Assets 
Under Administration (AUA), new business 
inflows and the performance of the three 
divisions – Vantage, Discretionary & Managed, 
and Third Party & Other services and the 
markets they operate in.
TOTAL REVENUE
As highlighted last year, following the 
implementation of the RDR we now focus on the 
net revenue of the Group. This measure provides 
a better indication of year-on-year comparative 
performance. Total net revenue was up 1% for 
the year. Benefits from record levels of AUA, 
strong net new business, new active clients and 
transaction volumes were largely offset by the 
headwinds of low interest rates and changes to 
fund pricing plus a reduction in annuity income in 
the Third Party & Other Services division. 
Vantage net revenue decreased fractionally for 
the reasons explained in the Business Review 
on page 20. Interest on client money fell £9.5 
million and although the revenue earned on 
investment funds held by clients increased 
by £8.7 million the margin fell from 0.52% to 
0.46%. The Discretionary division only has 
a negligible amount of interest revenue. The 
growth in AUM and net new business in this 
division drove a strong 17% growth in revenue. 
Third party and other services net revenue 
fell principally as we focus less on third party 
business and because of the reduction in 
annuity commission following pension reforms 
introduced in the March 2014 budget. Other 
services such as foreign currency and Funds 
Library continue to show underlying growth 
and we would expect these revenue sources to 
continue to grow.
Average levels of AUA were up 18% in the 
Vantage division. The assets held in Vantage can 
be held by clients in investment funds, shares 
and other stock, and cash. The net revenue

FINANCIAL 
REVIEW
Net revenue growth from strong AUA inflows offset by known margin headwinds 
led to a small increase in revenue for the year. Operating cost increased primarily 
because of planned strategic investment leading to higher depreciation, as well as 
an unforeseen significant FSCS levy. 23 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Investment funds on average represented 
56% of Vantage AUA and the net revenue 
margin earned was 0.46% (2014: 0.56%). The 
reduction related to the full-year impact of the 
new RDR pricing implemented in March 2014 
which had only a part year impact in the prior 
year. Reducing pricing on funds helped make 
investing in them cheaper for our clients. This 
was in accordance with our long-term strategy 
of lowering the cost of investing for our clients 
over time which in turn helps retain existing 
clients and attract new clients and assets. 
The pre-RDR net margin on funds was 0.60% 
while post RDR it has trended down to 0.46%. 
Looking ahead the net revenue margin will 
continue to trend down as we move through 
the transition phase of RDR until April 2016 
when any renewal commissions still received 
from fund management groups relating to pre-
RDR funds will be passed on fully to clients. 
From this point, barring any other changes, we 
would expect the net revenue margin earned 
on investment funds to be c0.42%-0.43%. 
Shares on average represented 34% of 
Vantage AUA. The revenue margin on shares 
and other stock was 0.29% (2014: 0.35%). 
The decrease in margin has been caused 
by the temporary hiatus in overseas foreign 
exchange income on overseas trading in the 
second half of the year (as highlighted on 
page 18). In addition we have caps in place 
on share charges in the SIPP and Stocks and 
Share ISA accounts once holdings are above 
£44,444 in the SIPP and £10,000 in the ISA. 
This causes a slight dilution to the margin over 
time as clients grow their portfolio of shares.
Cash on average represented 10% of Vantage 
AUA. As expected, the interest revenue 
margin earned on cash balances has fallen 
significantly during the year from an average 
of 0.91% in FY2014 to an average of 0.53% 
in FY2015. The FCA’s restrictions on the use 
of term deposits of greater than 30 days, 
for client money from 1 July 2014, served 
to reduce the revenue margin on cash. As 
highlighted in last year’s annual report we set 
out to mitigate the impact of these restrictions 
by amending SIPP cash to be held in trustee 
arrangements. From 20 April 2015 we began 
to place client monies held in SIPPs on term 
deposits again. The new arrangements have 
allowed us to offer higher interest rates for 
clients in the SIPP whilst also helping to boost 
the margin and revenue we earn. Based on 
the current base rate we anticipate the cash 
interest margin for the financial year 2016 to 
be in the range of 0.50%-0.60%.
However, following a period of unprecedented 
low interest rates in the UK, sentiment 
suggests that within the next 12 months the 
Bank of England may start to increase interest 
rates. Such a move should have a positive 
effect on the interest revenue margin.   
TOTAL OPERATING COSTS 
Total operating costs are made up of those 
management control plus certain other costs 
such as the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) levies that are outside our 
control. 
   
Commission payable is primarily the portion 
of renewal income which the Group receives 
on investment funds held in Vantage and is 
rebated to clients as a ‘loyalty bonus’. This 
is deducted from revenue to calculate net 
revenue. Following the implementation of 
the RDR in March 2014 the amounts paid 
back to clients were significantly increased as 
commission income was replaced by platform 
fees. 
Other than commission payable, staff costs 
remain our largest expense.

STRATEGIC REPORT 24 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
The number of staff employed on a full-time 
equivalent basis (including directors) at 30 
June 2015 was 970, and the average number 
of staff during the year was 910, an increase 
of 15%. The increase in staff numbers 
resulted from increased investment in IT and 
web services, the development and running 
of new services, along with recruitment 
of additional telephone based financial 
advisors and administrative staff to deal with 
the growing volume of account openings, 
transfers and helpdesk calls. 
Group marketing and distribution spend 
increased by 12%, from £11.3 million to £12.7 
million and includes the costs of printing 
and sending information and newsletters 
to existing and potential clients, media 
advertising, online marketing and client 
incentives. This year saw the launch of three 
new HL Multi-Manager Funds, the launch of 
the HL Retirement Planner embracing the 
new pension freedoms and the launch of 
HL Portfolio+ which have all given rise to 
increased marketing and advertising costs. 
A key strategic focus for the business remains 
our use of mobile and digital media. We continue 
to invest significantly in paid search traffic, cost 
per click relationships, HLTV and smart phone 
and tablet apps. These have also contributed 
to additional cost this year but have served to 
reinforce our strength in digital media which 
helps drive client and asset recruitment. 
Depreciation has increased significantly 
following the increase in capital expenditure, 
primarily on IT hardware and software for our 
core in-house systems over the past three 
years.
Other costs which include dealing costs, 
insurance, computer maintenance, external 
administration charges and irrecoverable 
VAT increased by £3.2 million or 24%. These 
increases are a result of the increased size 
and scale of the business and enhancement to 
the services we have provided.
FSCS LEVY
Costs relating to the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) are beyond 
our control. The FSCS is the compensation 
fund of last resort for customers of authorised 
financial services firms. All authorised firms 
are required to contribute to the running of 
the scheme and the cost of compensation 
payments. Contributions to the scheme are 
proportional to the amount of eligible income 
of a firm, rather than its risk profile or track 
record of running a compliant service. As 
such, as a large business we may be required 
to make a significant contribution to the 
cost of compensation on investments we 
have never recommended or been involved 
with. FSCS costs increased from £0.8 million 
to £4.4 million this year. The FSCS levy is 
calculated and applied to companies on a 
formulaic basis to cover the costs of other 
defaulting regulated firms in the market and 
does not reflect any wrongdoing on our part. 
The amount raised under the scheme has 
been greatly increased this year and hence 
Hargreaves Lansdown’s portion of this levy 
has increased accordingly.
TAXATION
The charge for taxation decreased in line 
with lower profits to £41.8 million from £47.1 
million. The effective tax rate fell from 22.4% 
in 2014 to 21.0% in the current period due to 
the standard UK corporation tax rate falling 
from 23% to 20% since the start of the prior 
period, with the 2015 applicable rate being 
20.75% (2014: 22.5%). In total, taxation of 
£0.7 million has also been credited directly to 
equity and relates to share-based payments.  
The Group’s policy on corporate taxes is to be 
transparent in our activities; we prefer not to 
engage in aggressive, artificial or sophisticated 
tax planning activities, and we actively engage 
with the UK tax authorities both on corporate 
taxes and tax issues affecting our clients.
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
The diluted EPS decreased by 3% from 34.2 
pence to 33.1 pence. EPS is calculated as 
the earnings for the year divided by the total 
weighted average fully diluted number of 
shares, including those held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust (the “EBT”). Further information 
The Group is organised into three 
core operating divisions, based 
around the products and services 
described on pages 2 and 3.

PENSION SCHEMES
There were no changes to the defined 
contribution pension scheme in the year, with 
staff and directors participating on equal 
terms. Pension costs are recognised as an 
expense when the contribution is payable.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure, primarily on IT hardware 
and software, totalled £5.5 million this year, 
compared with £7.6 million last year. It 
primarily relates to the cyclical replacement 
of hardware and the continuation of the 
project to enhance the capacity of our key 
administration systems. Last year included a 
significant investment in hardware which has 
not had to be repeated this year.  
All of our core systems are developed and 
maintained in-house and as such we have 
significant IT resource dedicated to IT support 
and development. For the year ended 30 
June 2015 an average of 102 staff (2014: 86) 
were employed in developing our systems 
with most of their related costs expensed 
within staff costs. Any costs relating to the 
development of new systems have been 
capitalised and will be depreciated over the 
useful economic life of the new system once 
implemented. In the year we capitalised £1.20 
million of staff costs (2014: £1.04 million). 
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND 
CASH FLOW
The Group is soundly financed with a strong 
balance sheet. This is an important strength 
which in addition to being attractive to clients 
provides both resilience and flexibility. The 
Group is highly cash generative and the cash 
conversion ratio measured by the operating 
cash flows as a percentage of operating 
profits remained high at 107%.
Group cash balances totalled £216.8 million 
at the end of the year. The only significant 
cash outflows from profit have been the 
second interim ordinary and special dividends 
totalling £117.7 million paid in September 
2014 and an interim dividend of £34.4 million 
paid in April 2015. 
Capital is defined as the total of share 
capital, share premium, retained earnings 
and other reserves. Total capital at 30 June 
2015 was £237.1 million (2014: £228.3m) 
and this capital is managed via the net 
assets to which it relates. The Group has 
four subsidiary companies authorised and 
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). These firms have capital resources at 
a level which satisfies both their regulatory 
capital requirements and their working capital 
requirements and, as a Group, maintain 
significant headroom over the regulatory 
minimum. Further disclosures are published in 
the Pillar 3 document on the Group’s website 
at www.hl.co.uk.
INCREASE IN COUNTERPARTY BALANCES
In accordance with market practice, certain 
balances with clients, Stock Exchange 
member firms and other counterparties  
are included in the balance sheet. These 
balances fluctuate according to the volume 
and value of recent trading. At the year-end, 
trade receivables and trade payables included 
counterparty balances of £363.2 million 
(2014: £242.9 million) and £361.9 million 
(2014: £241.1 million) respectively.
DIVIDENDS
The Board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy, and has declared 
a second interim (final) ordinary dividend of 
14.30 pence and a special dividend of 11.40 
pence per ordinary share. These dividends 
will be paid on 30 September 2015 to all 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 18 September 2015. This 
brings the total dividends in respect of 
the year to 33.0 pence per ordinary share 
(2014: 32.00p), an increase of 3%. This total 
ordinary dividend pay-out equates to 65% 
(2014: 65%) of post-tax profits, with a further 
34% (2014: 28%) of post-tax profits paid by 
way of special dividend. Any special dividend 
in future years will depend upon future cash 
requirements and therefore may vary.   
An arrangement exists under which the 
Hargreaves Lansdown EBT has agreed to 
waive all dividends.

STRATEGIC REPORT 26 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
PRINCIPAL RISKS 
AND UNCERTAINTIES
Like all businesses, the Group faces a number 
of potential risks which, if not properly 
controlled, could hinder the successful 
implementation of its strategy and have a 
material impact on the long-term performance. 
The Board believes that a successful risk 
management framework balances risk and 
reward. The Board has responsibility for risk 
management and internal control, further 
details of which can be found in the Corporate 
Governance statement. 
Last year we specifically highlighted the risk 
and uncertainty relating to interest earned on 
cash deposits as a result of the FCAs Policy 
Statement PS14/9 setting out changes to 
the client assets sourcebook (CASS) which 
restricted the use of term deposits greater 
than 30 days for client money from 1 July 
2014. As anticipated this created a significant 
revenue headwind in the year but as described 
in the Financial Review on page 22 since 
20 April 2015 we transferred SIPP cash to 
a trustee arrangement which has served to 
mitigate much of the impact. 
Also highlighted last year was the impact of 
the FCAs “platform rules” (Policy Statement 
PS13/1) resulting in a transition from 
commission income to platform fees that 
clients pay directly to us for our services. 
The rules were implemented on 1 March 
2014. Transitional rules apply enabling us to 
continue to earn some commission on existing 
platform assets until 5 April 2016 after which 
any commissions received will be passed 
entirely on to the client. Where we still receive 
commission the vast majority is now passed 
back to our clients in the form of a significantly 
higher loyalty bonus. The impact of these 
rules mean there is a downward trend on the 
margin earned on funds held by clients from 
implementation on 1 March 2014 up to 6 April 
2016 when we anticipate the margin earned 
will be 0.42%-0.43%.
The following table summarises the principal 
risks and uncertainties that are inherent 
within both the Group’s business model and 
the market in which we operate along with 
the high level controls and processes through 
which we aim to mitigate them. The risk 
factors mentioned below do not purport to be 
exhaustive as there may be additional risks 
that the Group has not yet identified or has 
deemed to be immaterial that could have a 
material adverse effect on the business. Any 
of the risks below could cause reputational 
damage if they materialise.

Fluctuations in the capital markets
Fluctuations in capital markets may adversely affect 
trading activity and/or the value of the Group’s 
assets under administration or management, from 
which we derive revenues.
• The Group model comprises high levels of both recurring platform revenue and  
transaction-based income
• A high proportion of the assets under administration are held within tax-advantaged 
wrappers, meaning there is a lower risk of withdrawal
• The Group model includes the ability to earn margin from cash management services when 
clients decide to shelter assets from market volatility
Liquidity
Lack of sufficient, readily realisable financial resources 
to meet the Group’s obligations as they fall due or lack 
of access to liquid funds on commercially viable terms 
could lead to inability to pay clients and regulatory 
breaches.
• Hargreaves Lansdown is a highly cash generative business with a low working capital 
requirement
• The Group operates a strict Treasury management policy, overseen by the Treasury 
Committee, which maximises return on capital whilst providing the ability to access 
sufficient liquid funds at short notice should this be necessary
Bank default
Given the current economic climate and in particular 
the unprecedented problems faced by banks, the Group 
must protect against the risk that a bank could fail.
• We manage this risk by placing deposits only with a range of highly credit-rated 
institutions, in accordance with the Treasury Policy and overseen by the Treasury 
Committee
• The Treasury Committee monitors the counterparties’ credit ratings on a regular basis  
Interest rates
Reduction in interest rates or regulatory changes affecting 
interest income could lead to a decline in earnings. 
• The size and diversity of client cash balances we have gives us scope to develop 
alternative cash services which could alleviate margin pressure (see page 13). 27 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Prudential risk
The risk that the Group may hold insufficient 
regulatory capital resources in order to meet FCA 
Threshold Condition requirements.
• HL undertakes ongoing capital adequacy assessments to ensure that it maintains financial 
resources of sufficient scale and quality at all times. These assessments include risk-
based stress testing to model the impact of extreme scenarios on the Group’s own funds.  
This process is overseen by the Risk Committee on behalf of the Board.

STRATEGIC REPORT 28 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
CORPORATE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY
At Hargreaves Lansdown, we want to make sure that our impact on society is a positive 
one. Our company values are rooted in providing great service at great value. We believe 
that doing the right thing makes great business sense. For more information visit our 
website at www.hl.co.uk/investor-relations/corporate-social-responsibility.
OUR CULTURE
We have worked hard to create what we 
believe to be a unique working culture at 
Hargreaves Lansdown.
Putting clients first: At Hargreaves  
Lansdown there is an embedded culture 
whereby the interests of clients are always 
put first and this is communicated to all 
employees in the business during their 
induction and throughout their careers. 
In practice this includes elements such as 
ensuring that:
• all product design and information is clear 
and understandable 
• information and client support is available 
to clients after the point of sale
• appropriate complaints handling 
procedures are in place
• financial promotion and marketing 
practices are unbiased and appropriate for 
their audience 
To ensure we are getting things right with 
clients, we listen to them about the changes 
they would like to see to our services and 
we encourage and actively seek feedback 
from clients. If clients ever feel the need 
to complain, our complaints handling 
team carefully investigates our client’s 
complaint and endeavours to provide them 
with a fair resolution. We benchmark our 
performance in treating clients fairly against 
statistics published annually by the Financial 
Ombudsman Service for the industry. The 
results for the 2015 financial year compared to 
the last figures published by the Ombudsman 
show that Hargreaves Lansdown is achieving 
good results in treating our clients fairly.
Integrity: The Company prides itself on its 
integrity in dealing with clients and staff 
openly and honestly. This is achieved through 
our policy of putting clients first. All staff 
are trained and made fully aware of anti-
money laundering procedures which must be 
adhered to at all times. The Company takes 
the views of its employees very seriously and 
as such operates a “Whistleblowing Policy” 
with any concerns raised about malpractice 
or wrongdoing within the workplace being 
treated with the utmost confidence and in full 
compliance with the Public Interest Disclosure 
Act.
Efficiency: We believe that costs require 
constant consideration and have built an ethos 
of employees continually asking themselves 
whether their actions are cost effective and 
efficient.
We are committed to managing the 
environmental impact of our operations, 
treating our employees well and maintaining 
a great culture and working environment. Our 
approach to corporate social responsibility 
includes these key elements:
Quality – We want to offer the best products 
and offer an excellent service, and are always 
looking for ways to improve
Sustainability – We work for the long-term, 
looking beyond immediate success
Integrity – We deal with people openly and 
honestly, building strong relationships
ENVIRONMENT
As a service business that does not own 
its business premises and is fundamentally 
based on intellectual capital, Hargreaves 
Lansdown has a limited direct impact on 
the environment. Nevertheless the Group 
continues to promote energy efficiency 
and the avoidance of waste throughout its 
operations.
Two years ago we commissioned a report 
to investigate our output of greenhouse 
gas emissions and reductive measures we 
could undertake (for more information visit 
www.hl.co.uk/csr). As part of this report 
Hargreaves Lansdown was compared to 
FTSE 100 companies in the same sector and 
this comparison has been updated in the 
chart above. The results demonstrate the 
relatively low impact our business has on the 
environment.
   
This low impact on the environment has 
not stopped us from enacting initiatives to 
continue reducing our environmental impact.  
Environmental initiatives: Our objective 
of reducing waste and minimising the 
environmental impact of our business is 
aligned with our objectives of protecting client 
data, reducing costs, and improving efficiency. 
It is our aim to deal with clients and other 
businesses electronically wherever possible 
not only to speed up information transfer

but also to reduce the amount of paper we 
use. We have invested heavily in providing 
a user-friendly, comprehensive website and 
automated links to banks and fund providers. 
The benefits will grow as more people and 
businesses choose to transact business and 
receive information online. We aim to increase 
the take-up of online and paperless services, 
and have been successful in doing this during 
the year.
Business travel and commuting: We do 
not provide company cars to managers or to 
our network of advisers. These advisers are 
spread throughout the UK which minimises 
travel time and carbon emissions. We provide 
a telephone advice service where a face-to-
face meeting is not required. We also provide 
a secure bike park at our office enabling up to 
150 staff to cycle to work. 
Recycling: We continue to shred and recycle 
confidential waste and have arrangements 
for the collection of recyclable waste such as 
printer toner cartridges, cardboard, plastics, 
newspapers and out-of-date literature.  
We also continue to recycle redundant IT 
equipment through specialist third parties. 
Electricity usage: Our electricity usage is not 
high enough to mean that we have to participate 
in Phase 2 of the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme. This scheme is 
compulsory for UK organisations that consumed 
over 6,000 MWh of half-hourly metered 
electricity for the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 
2013. During that period we consumed well 
below that level and for the year ended 30 June 
2015 we had consumed only 3,520 MWh (2014: 
3,285 MWh). 
Greenhouse gas emissions: In 2013 we 
engaged a consultant to assess our carbon 
emissions and benchmark us against other 
firms in our sector. The report was positive 
and reinforced our belief that we were already 
making good progress towards being resource 
efficient. For the year ending 2015 our use 
of refrigerant gases and fuel consumed per 
employee increased by 44% (2014: 10% 
fall) while our electricity use per employee 
remained flat (2014: 22% fall) compared to 
the previous year. The increase in electricity 
use was driven by the occupation of additional 
floor space, and additional computing power, 
in our head office.  
Methodology: We have reported on all of 
the emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 
which fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility for 
any emission sources that are not included 
in our consolidated statement. We have 
used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised) and 
emission factors from UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
2015.

COMMUNITY
With the exceptions described below, we 
have made it company policy to focus our 
support and fundraising activities on one 
charity or non-profit organisation each year 
which is selected from suggestions received 
from employees within the Group. We do not 
make political donations. During 2015 the 
chosen charity was the “Youth Adventure 
Trust”. Their vision is for vulnerable young 
people to fulfil their potential and to lead 
positive lives in the future. They achieve 
this by inspiring young people to reach their 
full potential, learn valuable life skills, build 
confidence and self-esteem, make a difference

to their lives through a programme of outdoor 
activities and challenging experiences. As part 
of supporting this charity we sponsored the 
Brecons 10 Peaks Challenge, with many of our 
employees taking part as well as teams from 
other companies.
Charitable activity outside of our chosen 
charity for the year
• The Group supports a grass-roots sports 
club. A monthly donation is made to the 
Bristol & West Athletics Club which is 
the leading all-round athletics club in the 
South West of England.
•  As in previous years we have continued 
to support the Bristol Children’s Hospital 
Grand Appeal and we are proud sponsors 
of a Shaun the Sheep and have been 
actively raising awareness of the appeal.
The Group also makes significant tax 
payments which help society as a whole. 
Corporation tax and employer’s national 
insurance paid in respect of the year ended 
30 June 2015 was £46.4 million (2014: £52.5 
million). In addition other taxes such as VAT, 
stamp duty and business rates paid.
Campaigning: The Company also actively 
seeks to lobby via public consultation 
documents where they believe that investors 
in the UK will benefit.

OUR 
PEOPLE
We are committed to recruiting and retaining talented people who put our clients at 
the heart of our business.
Employment and diversity: Hargreaves 
Lansdown proudly fosters a working 
environment that wholly supports the 
principals of diversity and equality and is 
committed to ensuring that everyone is 
treated with dignity and respect. We are an 
equal opportunities employer and it is our 
policy to ensure that all job applicants and 
employees are treated fairly and on merit 
without discrimination to ensure the Group 
attracts, retains and promotes the best 
available talent. The table above shows the 
gender split at different levels within the 
organisation as at 30 June 2015:
Appropriate arrangements are made for the 
continued employment and training, career 
development and promotion of disabled persons 
by the Group. If members of staff become 
disabled the Group continues employment, 
either in the same or an alternative position, 
with appropriate retraining being given if 
necessary. A full assessment of any disabled 
employee’s needs is undertaken and reasonable 
adjustments are made to the work environment 
or practices in order to assist them.
Hargreaves Lansdown is committed to 
providing a safe and healthy environment in 
which its employees can work. We engage 
Health and Safety experts on an ongoing basis 
to ensure that standards are maintained, and 
the Health and Safety policy is made available 
to all staff via our intranet.
Identifying, attracting and recruiting top 
talent: We focus on attracting, recruiting, 
developing and retaining a diverse range of 
high calibre people, who are motivated to 
deliver exceptional levels of client service.  
Our success is driven by their commitment to 
the business, coupled with their energy and 
willingness to build new capabilities. This has 
been a primary driver for new talent initiatives 
this year.
We recruit a wide range of individuals 
including school leavers and graduates, 
with an emphasis on internal development 
and promotion within the business to fill 
available vacancies. We continue to grow our 
youth employment, internship and graduate 
programmes as we believe this demonstrates 
our commitment to opportunities for young 
talented people and builds loyalty to 
Hargreaves Lansdown.  
Clear succession planning: Clearly defined 
succession plans are integral to future 
business success and Hargreaves Lansdown 
takes steps to identify high potential criteria 
and equip staff with the right blend of 
experience and capabilities to prepare them 
for the future needs of our business.
Building careers and new capabilities: 
During the year a competency based “Career 
Development Path” has been implemented, 
clearly showing performance expectations. 
The Career Development Path has been 
accompanied by a new Learning Management 
System - ‘My HL Career’ where employees can 
access courses delivered via a digital platform 
which can be downloaded at work or taken 
elsewhere via their pc, smartphone or mobile 
device. ‘My HL Career’ has been launched 
with over 50 courses covering a wide range 
of personal, management, leadership and 
compliance titles. Furthermore employees 
can track their progress and view internal 
vacancies or opportunities as they become 
available.  
Professional development continues 
to be actively encouraged and many of 
our employees embark on professional 
qualifications to further their knowledge and 
careers within the Company. During the year 
over a quarter of our employees have studied 
for professional exams across a range of 
pertinent areas of professional expertise.

STRATEGIC REPORT 32 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Each year we offer a number of university 
students the opportunity to work in positions 
throughout the business during their 
professional placement year. A number of 
these students have subsequently returned 
to Hargreaves Lansdown in a full time 
capacity.
An engaged, positive team: It is crucial that 
our people understand our priorities and are 
engaged in the development of our business. 
Hargreaves Lansdown actively encourages 
employee involvement and consultation and 
places emphasis on keeping its employees 
informed of the Company’s activities, 
macroeconomic conditions, regulatory issues 
and financial performance by such means as 
six-monthly presentations given by the CEO, 
the employee intranet and publication to all 
staff of relevant information and corporate 
announcements. As well as the regular 
calendar of employee communication we 
conduct an annual employee satisfaction 
survey which this year received a strong 
response of 82%, significantly higher than 
the financial services benchmark of 73%. The 
results showed strong employee engagement 
and led to new initiatives to further engage 
our people. We have enhanced our employee 
benefits to include improved maternity 
and paternity arrangements, introduced a 
free employee assistance programme and 
sabbaticals to recognise long service. We 
have focused on enhancing communication 
by launching an internal magazine to share 
business and employee news and have built 
our community spirit through social, sports 
and charitable activities.  
Competitive pay: Rewarding employees for 
their contribution and performance is key to 
ensuring that we retain talented staff and 
to fostering a positive culture whereby staff 
are proud to work here. Further information 
on how we set remuneration packages is 
provided in the Directors Remuneration 
Report.
The Board believes the use of share schemes 
best aligns staff interests with those of our 
shareholders. During April 2015 we granted 
new options under a SAYE scheme and now 
have 67.4% of eligible staff participating in 
one or more equity schemes. Many of our 
employees also receive an annual bonus 
related to the overall performance of the 
Group and their own individual contribution. 
Human rights: As a UK based organisation 
with clients and employees located within the 
UK we have not provided further information 
about any policies of the company in 
relation to human rights issues since it is not 
considered necessary for an understanding of 
the development, performance or position of 
the Group’s business activities.

GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Hargreaves Lansdown 
is committed to high 
standards of Corporate 
Governance, as befits 
a FTSE 100 company 
entrusted with looking 
after the investments of 
its valued clients. This 
section of the Report 
and Financial Statements 
provides an insight into 
the governance of the 
Company.
The Group complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). The 
statement of compliance can be found 
on page 36. Key areas of note are the 
disclosures surrounding the support that the 
Audit Committee has provided to the Board 
in making the statement that the Report 
and Financial Statements when taken as a 
whole are fair, balanced and understandable, 
and the further disclosures on the Audit 
Committee’s role in the appointment and 
interaction with the external auditor.
BOARD
We are in the process of strengthening our 
Board following the resignations during 
the year of Peter Hargreaves and 
Tracey Taylor, and of Dharmash Mistry 
subsequent to the year end. We have 
appointed a new Chief Financial Officer, 
Chris Hill, and a new non-executive director, 
both subject to Regulatory Approval; details 
of the process involved can be found on 
page 37.
During the year, we strengthened our 
governance framework with the creation of a 
Board level Risk Committee.
STRATEGY
As a Board, we set strategic direction, define 
risk appetite and provide oversight of the 
day-to-day running of the business. As 
Chairman, I seek to ensure that adequate 
time is set aside at Board meetings for the 
discussion and debate of proposed strategic 
initiatives and direction. Once a decision is 
reached, management are responsible for 
executing that decision with the Board’s 
ongoing oversight and support. 
PEOPLE 
Within the Group we want to ensure that we 
have the right talent, and the right balance 
and diversity of expertise, skills, background, 
gender and perspectives. We set out on page 
31 improvements we have made through 
the introduction of our Career Development 
Path and our Learning Management System. 
It is also vital that we have on the Board 
sufficient diversity, and also independence of 
thought and action. All Board appointments 
are made on merit, while at the same time 
considering the diversity required for an 
effective Board, including diversity of skills, 
experience, background and gender. Details 
of our diversity policy can be found on page 
31, and a copy of our full statement on Board 
Diversity can be found on www.hl.co.uk.
WORKING EFFECTIVELY
As Chairman my prime responsibility is 
to ensure that the Board is operating 
effectively and focusing its time, attention 
and efforts on the right matters. Each year 
the Board undertakes a formal evaluation 
of its own effectiveness, and this year the 
Board Effectiveness Review was externally 
facilitated. More details can be found on 
page 38.

GOVERNANCE REPORT  
Statement of compliance 
with the UK Corporate
Governance Code
We support the UK Corporate Governance 
Code published by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the ‘Code’). We confirm that the 
Group complied with all of the provisions of 
the Code throughout the year ended 30 June 
2015 and can confirm that the Board believes 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
for 2015 taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, 
understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess our 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Further explanation of how the main 
principles and supporting principles of the 
Code have been applied is set out in this 
Corporate Governance statement and in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. A copy 
of the Code is publicly available on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk. 
The Company’s auditor, PwC, is required 
to review whether the above statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for its review by the Listing 
Rules and to report if it does not reflect such 
compliance; no such report has been made. 
The Board 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 
BOARD
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
management and performance of the Group. 
It sets the strategic direction of the Group, 
monitors performance, determines the 
appropriate risk appetite, and ensures that 
sufficient resources in talent and capital are 
in place to achieve the objectives set and 
ensures solid succession planning for senior 
management. It ensures that risk, regulatory 
and compliance management within the 
Group are effective. The Board reviews 
performance, including that of the senior 
management and senior executives. The 
Board is also responsible for engaging with 
shareholders. It is the decision-making body 
for all other matters deemed material to the 
Group in strategic, financial and reputational 
terms. 
 
The Executive Directors are directly 
responsible for running the business 
operations. The Non-Executive Directors are 
responsible for constructively challenging 
proposals on strategy, scrutinising the 
performance of management, determining 
levels of remuneration and for succession 
planning. The Non-Executive Directors must 
also satisfy themselves on the integrity 
of financial information and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management are 
robust.
The Directors are also responsible for 
ensuring that obligations to shareholders 
and other stakeholders are understood and 
met, and that a satisfactory dialogue with 
shareholders is maintained. All Directors are 
equally accountable to our shareholders for 
the proper stewardship of our affairs and the 
success of the Company.
Except for a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for decision by the Board, the Board 
has delegated the day-to-day management 
of the Group to the Chief Executive who is 
supported by the Executive Committee and 
senior management. The Chief Executive 
and Executive Directors of the Group are 
responsible to the Board for developing 
strategy and the profitability and overall 
performance of the Group.
There is a documented schedule of matters 
which are reserved for Board decision and 
approval. These matters are significant to 
the Group as a whole due to their strategic, 
financial or reputational implications, and 
include, but are not limited to, the agreement 
of strategies, recommendation of dividends, 
approval of acquisitions and major capital 
expenditure. In addition, it is only the Board 
which can appoint and remove Directors and 
our Company Secretary. The Board also has 
overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and risk management. Risk 
management arrangements are described 
below.
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 
The Group operates within a clear governance 
framework which is set out in the report that 
follows. The Group’s internal control and risk 
management framework is described below in 
the Internal Controls section.
Certain responsibilities of the Board are 
delegated to the Board Committees to assist 
the Board in carrying out its functions and 
to ensure independent oversight of internal 
control and risk management. Other non-
board committees form part of the Corporate 
Governance framework, but are not formally 
appointed committees of the Board. These 
committees feed back to the main Board and 
Board Committees via an Executive Director 
where appropriate.  
BOARD SIZE, COMPOSITION AND CHANGES 
DURING THE YEAR
As at 30 June 2015 there were six Directors 
on the Board: the Chairman, four independent 
Non-Executive Directors, and one Executive 
Director. The size and composition of the 
Board is regularly reviewed by the Board and, 
in particular the Nominations Committee, 
to ensure that there is an appropriate and 
diverse mix of skills and experience.
During the year, the following changes were 
made:
Tracey Taylor stood down from the Board as 
Chief Financial Officer on 5 December 2014;  
and Peter Hargreaves stood down from the 
Board as Executive Director on 14 April 2015.
Simon Cleveland, a partner in Deloitte LLP , 
was contracted as Interim CFO until the new 
permanent CFO, Chris Hill, joins the Group in 
2016, subject to Regulatory Approval. Simon 
Cleveland does not serve on the Board of 
Directors. 37 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
After the year end, the Group announced that 
Dharmash Mistry would step down from the 
Board on 31 August 2015 and a new non-
executive director had been selected, subject 
to Regulatory Approval, who is expected to 
join the Board immediately after the AGM in 
October. 
Details on our Board members, including 
other directorships, are on pages 34 and 35.
INDEPENDENCE OF NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
The Code sets out the circumstances 
that should be relevant to the Board in 
determining whether each Non-Executive 
Director is independent. We have given  
due regard to provision B.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the Board 
has concluded that Dharmash Mistry,  
Stephen Robertson, Chris Barling and 
Shirley Garrood were independent directors 
throughout the financial year. Michael 
Evans was independent on appointment as 
Chairman. Chris Barling is currently the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director.  
DIVERSITY
When assessing new appointments to our 
Board, we review carefully the combined 
skills and experience of the existing Board 
members to determine what characteristics 
we are looking for from a new director. Each 
member of the Hargreaves Lansdown Board 
must have the skills, experience and character 
that will enable each director to contribute 
both individually, and as part of the team, to 
the effectiveness of the Board and the success 
of the Company. We believe that diversity 
amongst Board members is of great value but 
that diversity is a far wider subject than just 
gender. We will give careful consideration to 
issues of overall Board balance and diversity 
in making new appointments to the Board. 
As at 30 June 2015, the Board numbers six 
in total, of which one is executive and five 
independent (including the Chairman). Female 
directors constitute 17% of the Board and 
10% of the Executive Committee. Subject to 
the requirements set out above, Hargreaves 
Lansdown will aim to maintain female 
representation on the Board at least at the 
current level and give due consideration to 
increasing the level if appropriate candidates 
are available when Board vacancies arise. 
A copy of our full statement on Board 
Diversity can be found on www.hl.co.uk.
THE ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
are clearly defined, separate and approved by 
the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for the 
operation, leadership and governance of 
the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and 
setting its agenda. In conjunction with the 
Chief Executive and Company Secretary, the 
Chairman plans agenda items and timings for 
Board meetings. The Chairman ensures that 
the membership of the Board is appropriate 
to the needs of the business and that Board 
Committees carry out their duties, including 
reporting back to the Board.
The Chief Executive has executive 
responsibilities for the operations, results 
and strategic development of the Group. He 
is responsible for the delivery of strategy and 
leads the executive management team.
BOARD SUPPORT
The Company Secretary is responsible to 
the Board for ensuring Board procedures are 
followed, applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with and that the Board is advised 
on governance and relevant regulatory 
matters. All Directors have access to the 
services of the Company Secretary. In order 
for Directors to fulfil their duties they can also 
seek independent professional advice, at the 
Company’s expense. 
 
BOARD MEETINGS 
The Board convenes at least four times each 
financial year and the Board convened eleven 
times in the last financial year. Four of these 
were physical meetings and seven were 
conference calls.
Physical meetings are held in such a way 
as to encourage robust and constructive 
challenge and debate which enables the Non-
Executive Directors to use their knowledge 
and experience to critically review strategies 
proposed by management. This approach 
ensures that we act in the long-term best 
interests of our shareholders.
Between Board meetings, Directors are also 
provided with monthly information packs 
which include detailed commentary and 
analysis. To ensure that Directors are as fully 
informed as possible, minutes are circulated 
from each Committee, including the Executive 
Committee, and each Board meeting includes 
a report from the Committee Chairmen as 
appropriate. The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors have also held meetings separate to 
those with the Executive Directors, including 
meeting with the external auditor and the 
Head of Internal Audit. 
DIRECTORS
Under the existing Articles of Association 
all directors have to submit themselves for 
re-election annually if they wish to continue 
serving and are considered by the Board to 
be eligible. Other than Dharmash Mistry, 
who stood down on 31 August 2015, all 
other current directors wish to be re-elected 
and the Board confirms that all individual 
performance reviews demonstrated that the 
directors continue to demonstrate effective 
performance and commitment to their roles.  
TRAINING
Our Chairman is responsible for preparing 
and implementing a personalised induction 
programme for all new Directors, to include 
guidance as to their duties, responsibilities 
and liabilities as a director of the Company.  
We believe that the best way to learn about 
a business is to spend time within it, and 
we encourage new Directors to spend time 
GOVERNANCE 38 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
with our senior managers and executives in 
a number of business areas and to receive 
demonstrations of key operations and 
systems where relevant. 
Every Director has access to appropriate 
training throughout their appointment 
as director and we regularly assess the 
requirement for director training as part of 
each Director’s annual appraisal.
Our overall objective is to maintain and 
enhance professional standards for all our 
employees. We believe that these standards 
are particularly important for all staff who 
fall under the scope of the FCA Training and 
Competence rules. All staff under the scope 
of these rules are required to perform certain 
training annually.  
We have also introduced an E-learning 
platform for all staff, and a talent development 
programme for senior management. Further 
details are available on page 31.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the course of the year, the Board 
has made good progress against its agreed 
actions arising out of the 2014 Board review. 
Specifically it has achieved greater strategic 
focus, improved the quality, timeliness and 
method of delivery of Board information, and 
created a new Risk Committee. 
For its review in 2015, the Board carried out 
an externally facilitated Board effectiveness 
review. The review was carried out by 
Independent Audit Limited, and covered 
the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, 
its individual Directors and its Committees.  
One to one discussions were held with the 
Chairman, the Non-Executive Directors, the 
Chief Executive, a number of subsidiary 
company directors and the Company 
Secretary. The reviewer observed the 
Board and Committee meetings in April. 
All Directors were given the opportunity to 
provide comments on the draft report. The 
effectiveness review was discussed and 
approved at the Board meeting on 1 July 2015. 
A number of recommendations have been 
made and these will be implemented over 
the course of the next year. These include an 
increase in the frequency of Board meetings 
and the time allotted for the formal Board 
cycle, introduction of a rolling twelve month 
agenda, and an increase in the engagement of 
the Non-Executive Directors with management 
outside of Board meetings. An internal review 
will be carried out in six months’ time to 
ensure that progress is maintained.
Individual appraisal of each Executive 
Director’s performance is undertaken by either 
the Chief Executive or Chairman each year 
and involves meetings with each director 
on a one-to-one basis. The Non-Executive 
Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, carry out an appraisal of the 
performance of the Chairman. The Chief 
Executive’s performance was evaluated by 
the Chairman with input from the rest of the 
Board.
OTHER INFORMATION
Certain additional information in relation to 
the Company’s share capital, the powers of 
directors and amendments to the Articles of 
Association that is required to be disclosed 
pursuant to DTR 7.2.6 may be found in the 
Directors Report on pages 63 to 65.
Board committees 
This section of the report sets out how the 
Board and its Committees work within the 
Group’s governance framework and corporate 
governance guidelines.
The Board is authorised to manage the 
business of the Company in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association. The 
Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of shareholders, unless 
the Articles specify otherwise. Certain 
responsibilities of the Board are delegated 
to the Board Committees to assist the Board 
in carrying out its functions and to ensure 
independent oversight of internal control 
and risk management. The three principal 
Board Committees (Audit, Remuneration, 
and Nomination) play an essential role 
in supporting the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities. The Risk Committee became 
a formally appointed committee of the Board 
from October 2014. The Chairman of each 
Committee reports to the Board. The minutes 
of each Board Committee meeting are 
circulated to the attendees.  
The Board Committees all have formal terms 
of reference that have been approved by the 
Board, and performance of the Committees 
is assessed annually by the Board. Each 
Committee’s terms of reference sets out the 
specific matters for which delegated authority 
has been given by the Board. These terms 
of reference are reviewed annually and the 
terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Risk Committee are available 
on the Group’s website (www.hl.co.uk/
investor-relations). A summary of the terms 
of reference for each committee is included in 
the committee summaries below.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Details of the composition and work of the 
Audit Committee are provided in the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 44 to 46. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Details of the composition and work of the 
Remuneration Committee are provided in the 
Directors Remuneration Report on pages 47 
to 62.
RISK COMMITTEE
The Risk Committee is responsible for 
advising the Board on overall risk appetite, 
tolerance and strategy and for assessing the 
risk management processes embedded within 
the business. It oversees and feeds back to 
the Board on current risk exposures, and is 
responsible for reviewing and recommending 
to the Board the Group’s Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”).  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
– CONTINUED   39 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
The Committee also reports back to the Board 
on the management of the major risks facing 
the Group as assessed against the Group’s 
Risk Appetite. Further information about the 
Key Risks facing the Group are on pages 26 
to 27.
From 1 October 2014, the Risk Committee 
became a formal Board Committee. Until this 
date, the Risk Committee was chaired by the 
Chief Operating Officer and also comprised the 
Chief Executive, Chief Risk Officer, IT Director, 
Operations Director, Marketing Director and a 
Non-Executive Director.   
From 1 October 2014, the Committee is 
chaired by Michael Evans, and comprises 
Shirley Garrood, Chris Barling and Stephen 
Robertson. The subsidiary directors are 
invited to attend as necessary. 
The Risk Committee meets at least four 
times each year and the Committee met four 
times during this year. The attendance by 
each director, since the date the Committee 
became a formal Board Committee, is set out 
in the table on page 40. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed and approved its terms 
of reference, considered the appropriateness 
of the risk framework, reviewed the risk 
appetite, and challenged and approved the 
ICAAP for recommendation to the Board. At 
each meeting, the Executive Risk Register 
was reviewed, emerging risks deliberated, 
incident reporting discussed and emerging 
themes considered. Appropriate focus was 
given to cyber and fraud detection, the annual 
report from the MLRO was approved as was a 
report on conflicts of interest and prevention 
of bribery.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee leads the process 
for Board appointments, re-election and 
succession of directors and the Chairman. It 
is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board concerning the composition 
and skills of the Board including proposed 
appointees to the Board and the membership 
of the Committees. The Committee is chaired 
by Michael Evans and the Committee’s 
other members at 30 June 2015 were Chris 
Barling, Dharmash Mistry, Shirley Garrood and 
Stephen Robertson.   
The Nomination Committee meets at least 
twice each year and the Committee met three 
times during this year. The attendance by  
each director is set out in the table on page 
40.
We have a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the Board. The process involves 
the Nomination Committee interviewing 
suitable candidates who are proposed by 
existing Board members, by an external 
search company, or via searches performed 
by the Company itself. Consideration will be 
given to ensure appointees have enough time 
available to devote to the role and that the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board will be maintained. When the 
Committee has found a suitable candidate, 
the Chairman of the Committee will make 
a proposal to the whole Board and the 
appointment is the responsibility of the whole 
Board following recommendation from the 
Committee. 
During the year the Committee engaged an 
external search company to lead the search 
for a new Chief Financial Officer. After the year 
end, the Group announced the appointment of 
Chris Hill, subject to Regulatory Approval, who 
is expected to join the Group in early 2016.
During the year the Committee initiated a 
search for a new Non-Executive Director 
who would be capable of becoming Chair of 
the Investment Committee. The Committee 
utilised the Group’s extensive links with the 
Investment community to generate a long 
list of potential candidates. The selected 
candidate, subject to Regulatory Approval, is 
expected to join the Board immediately after 
the AGM.  
The Committee has reviewed the succession 
plans for the senior management team and 
considered individuals with the potential to 
take on management positions in the future.  
The Board continues to keep the organisation 
structure under review and succession will 
form part of these discussions.
Other committees
These committees form part of the Corporate 
Governance framework, but are not formally 
appointed Non-Executive committees of 
the Board. The main Committees are the 
Executive Committee, the Investment 
Committee, and the Treasury Committee:
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Board has delegated full authority to 
the Executive Committee subject to a list of

basis, for developing and implementing 
business strategy as agreed by the Board 
and ensuring that day-to-day operations are 
conducted in accordance with the relevant 
regulatory and statutory requirements. The 
Executive Committee meets at least quarterly 
but more frequently when required, and met 
five times during the current financial year.  
The attendance by each director is set out in 
the table on page 40.

Relations with 
shareholders
We are committed to maintaining good 
communications with our shareholders. We 
have a programme of communication with 
shareholders based on our financial reporting 
calendar including the interim and annual 
reports, Interim Management Statements, 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the 
Investor Relations section of the corporate 
website at www.hl.co.uk.  
In addition to this, the Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer meet with institutional 
investors after results announcements 
and upon request on an ad hoc basis 
during the year. They, together with the 
Company Secretary and Head of Investor 
Relations, also provide a point of contact 
for investors who wish to raise questions, 
queries or concerns. Chris Barling, our Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, is also 
available to meet key investors. 
Following dialogue with individual 
institutional shareholders, the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer ensured the Board was fully briefed 
on shareholders’ views such that any 
issues or concerns were fully understood 
and considered by the Board. Analyst and 
broker briefings are regularly provided to 
the Board. In addition, the Group’s brokers 
sought feedback from investors following the 
2014 final and 2015 interim results, and this 
feedback was reported to the Board.
All Directors made themselves available 
to meet shareholders at our AGM and 
they value the opportunity of welcoming 
individual shareholders and other investors 
to communicate directly and address their 
questions.  
To ensure compliance with the Code, at 
all general meetings separate resolutions 
are proposed on each discrete subject.  
Resolutions have been passed on a show 
of hands, and proxy votes for, against and 
withheld for each resolution are displayed 
at the meeting. Where the resolutions 
were to appoint or re-appoint directors, 
the votes were shown with and without 
the votes of the controlling shareholder 
(Peter Hargreaves). There is a Relationship 
Agreement in place between Peter 
Hargreaves and the Company to ensure that 
the independence provisions as set out in the 
Listing Rules are complied with. The terms of 
the agreement have been fully complied with.  
Following the AGM, the results of voting are 
published through a Regulatory Information 
Service and on our website.
Internal controls
INTERNAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems of internal control and 
risk management, the key features of which are 
outlined in the following chart and detailed below. 
Through the monitoring processes set out 
below, the Board has conducted a review of 
the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control during the year ended 30 June 2015 
and until the date of approval of this Report 
and Financial Statements. 
The system of internal control is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. 
It provides reasonable but not absolute 
assurance as to the effectiveness of the 
safeguards protecting the business against 
the risk of material error, loss or fraud. In 
that context, the review, in the opinion of the 
Board, did not indicate that the system was 
ineffective or unsatisfactory and the Board 
is not aware of any change to this status 
up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report. However, in acknowledgement 
that the business and the risks it faces are 
continually evolving and as part of a process 
of continuous improvement, steps are being 
taken to further embed internal controls and 
risk management into business operations.

Key features of the internal control framework
Internal controls 
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Board operates within clearly defined 
terms of reference, and it reserves certain 
matters for its own consideration and 
decision. It has established appropriate 
committees to oversee control activities.  
These committees also have clearly 
defined terms of reference. The Board and 
Committee processes are fundamental to the 
effectiveness of our internal controls. 
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND 
POLICIES
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s 
organisational structure to seek to ensure 
that clearly defined lines of responsibility 
exist, with appropriate delegation of 
authority. Roles and responsibilities are 
clearly communicated to each member of 
staff within their ‘Apportionment Forms’.  
These forms are reviewed annually and 
updated if necessary.
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s 
policies which are in place to manage the 
Group’s exposure to risks, such as treasury, 
interest rate risk and counterparty risk. Our 
public interest disclosure (whistleblowing) 
policy encourages employees to raise 
concerns about anything that they suspect 
is fraudulent, corrupt, dangerous or seriously 
wrong. They can raise concerns on a 
confidential basis, enabling proportionate and 
independent investigation to be undertaken.  
We thoroughly investigate any allegations of 
misconduct and irregularity and consider the 
implications for our control environment. 
Due to the nature of our business, we are 
subject to attempted external fraud on a 
regular basis. Strict processes and controls 
mean that we are able to identify attacks 
and deal with them appropriately on a timely 
basis. We are continually looking at ways 
of making our clients’ transactions with us 
more secure and have dedicated resource 
within the business whose focus is on 
managing fraud risk. We also employ external 
consultants to test our defences and to 
minimise fraud risk.
GROUP RISK STRATEGY
The Group Risk Strategy requires senior 
managers to identify, evaluate and manage 
risks in their business units. Risk registers 
are kept at department level and regular 
meetings are held between department 
managers and members of the Risk team 
to ensure that risk management remains 
high on the agenda of the business. Target 
dates for resolution of issues are continually 
monitored. A summary of significant risks is 
provided within the Business Review. 
Risk management processes within the Group 
accord with the ‘Internal Control: Guidance to 
Directors’ (formerly the Turnbull guidance), 
and are supported by reports from the 
Internal Audit function which include focus on 
significant risks faced by the Group.

business performance is monitored closely 
by the Board and senior management, in 
particular monitoring of: 
•     progress towards strategic objectives;
•     financial performance, within a 
framework including forecasting, 
financial reporting, reviewing variances 
against plan and prior year and taking 
appropriate management action; and
•     risk management processes. 
RISK COMMITTEE
The Risk Committee reports to the Board 
on the management of the major risks and 
emerging risks facing the Group as assessed 
against the Group’s Risk Appetite.
REMUNERATION POLICY
Risk management is embedded into the 
Apportionment Forms of every employee 
and awareness and mitigation of the risks 
faced by the Company are key factors used 
to evaluate individual performance. This 
policy creates an environment which ensures 
excessive risk taking is not rewarded. We 
believe that nothing will better encourage 
employees to look after the long-term 
future of the Group than being shareholders 
themselves, and so staff have the opportunity 
to invest in regular Save As You Earn share 
schemes and exceptional performance by 
key employees and senior managers will be 
rewarded with the grant of executive share 
awards. 
OUR VALUES AND CULTURE
Any system of internal control is dependent 
on the people operating it. ‘Our Culture’ 
defines what we expect from our people.  
We pride ourselves on the culture which 
exists within the Company. We have a ‘one-
firm’ mentality which helps everyone take 
responsibility for the whole of the business.   
We have a saying “success comes from 
putting the client first, Hargreaves Lansdown 
second and your department third.” This 
engenders service levels which many other 
companies can only aspire to and ensures 
that the requirements of our clients are 
foremost in our employees’ decision making 
process.  
  
GROUP FINANCE
The Group Finance department manages 
our financial reporting processes to ensure 
the information which enables our Board 
to discharge its responsibilities is provided 
on a timely basis. It ensures cost controls 
are in place and that the business efficiently 
manages its resources. It also produces a 
financial forecast based on the strategic and 
operational plans of the business which is 
continuously reviewed and is used to plan 
and review regulatory capital requirements. 
GROUP LEGAL
The Group Legal department ensures 
appropriate controls are in place to assist the 
business in both fulfilling its legal obligations 
and to ensure that any unnecessary risks are 
avoided or mitigated. 
GROUP COMPLIANCE 
Our Compliance function manages 
relationships with the Group’s key regulators 
alongside identifying major compliance and 
regulatory risks.  Our Money Laundering 
Reporting Officer (MLRO) is part of the Risk 
and Financial Crime team and is responsible 
for ensuring we have suitable anti-money 
laundering (AML) procedures and controls, 
and adequate AML training for all staff. The 
MLRO specifically considers the risk of loss 
through financial crime and the controls in 
place to mitigate the risk of such loss.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Our Internal Audit function reports to the 
Audit Committee on the effectiveness of key 
internal controls.
EXTERNAL AUDIT AND REGULATORY 
SUPERVISION
The majority of the activities of the Group, 
including the systems of business control, 
are subject to supervision by the Financial 
Conduct Authority. The Group is required on 
a regular basis to submit detailed prudential 
and statistical returns covering all areas of 
its business and meets regularly with its 
supervisors, conducting the relationship in an 
open and constructive manner. In addition, 
the Audit Committee also receives reports 
from our external auditor.

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
REPORT  
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
are set out in its Terms of Reference, 
which are designed to assist the Board in 
discharging its responsibilities for:
• monitoring the financial reporting process 
including the integrity of our annual and 
interim reports, preliminary results and 
any other formal announcements relating 
to financial performance; 
• ensuring that the integrity of our Annual 
Report and Financial Statements, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced, understandable 
and provides shareholders with the 
information necessary to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy;  
• reviewing the Group’s internal financial 
controls and the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems; 
• reviewing the statements to be included 
in the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements concerning internal controls;
• monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit 
function;
• making recommendations to the 
Board, for a resolution to be put to the 
shareholders for their approval in general 
meetings in relation to the appointment 
or removal of the external auditor and the 
approval of the remuneration and terms 
of engagement of the external auditor; 
• reviewing and monitoring the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, 
taking into consideration relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements; 
and 
• overseeing the Group’s procedures 
for public interest disclosure 
(whistleblowing).
The Audit Committee reports its findings 
to the Board, identifying any matters in 
respect of which it considers that action 
or improvement is needed, and makes 
recommendations as to the steps to be 
taken. However, the Board retains ultimate 
responsibility for reviewing and approving 
financial reports and other public statements.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be 
available at the Annual General Meeting to 
answer any questions about the work of the 
Committee.
COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The members of the Audit Committee at 30 
June 2015 were:
Shirley Garrood – Chairman (Chartered 
Accountant) – appointed 25 October 2013
Chris Barling – appointed 26 August 2010
Dharmash Mistry – appointed 3 October 2011
Stephen Robertson – appointed 3 October 
2011
All members of the Committee are 
independent. The biographies of Committee 
members can be found on pages 34 to 35.
On an on-going basis, membership of the 
Committee is reviewed by the Chairman of the 
Committee and any recommendations for new 
appointments are made to the Nomination 
Committee for onward recommendation to the 
Board. Appointments are for a period of three 
years and are extendable by no more than two 
additional three-year periods. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code requires the inclusion of at 
least one member with recent and relevant 
financial experience and our Committee 
Chairman currently fulfils this requirement.   
 
The Group provides an induction programme 
for new Audit Committee members and on-
going training to enable all of the Committee 
members to carry out their duties. The 
induction programme covers the role of the 
Audit Committee, its terms of reference and 
expected time commitment by members, and 
an overview of the Group’s business, including 
the main business and financial dynamics and 
risks. New Committee members also meet 
some of the Group’s staff, as appropriate. On-
going training includes attendance at formal 
conferences, internal briefings and briefings by 
external advisers.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee meets at least four 
times each year but more frequently when 
required, and met five times during this 
financial year. The attendance by each 
director is set out in the table on page 40. 
The Chairman, Head of Internal Audit, Chief 
Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Chief Executive are routinely invited to, and 
attend, the majority of meetings, although the 
Committee reserves the right to request any 
of these individuals to withdraw. The external 
auditor also attended all meetings.
In between the formal schedule of meetings, 
the Committee Chairman keeps in regular 
contact with the Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer, Head of Internal Audit, Chief 
Risk Officer and the Senior Engagement 
Partner of the external auditor.
OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO DISCHARGE ITS 
DUTIES
In discharging its responsibilities the Audit 
Committee concentrated on 5 main areas:
• Financial Reporting
• Internal controls and key risks 
• Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
• Effectiveness of Internal Audit
• Effectiveness and independence of the 
external auditor 
1. Financial Reporting
With support and input from the external 
auditor, the Committee has considered, 
challenged and reviewed financial reporting 
Shirley Garrood
Chairman of the Audit Committee 45 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
for the Group, assessed whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted, 
whether management have made appropriate 
estimates and judgements and whether 
disclosures in published financial statements 
were fair, balanced and understandable.   
The Committee has also considered, 
challenged and reviewed regular financial 
management information, the Group’s internal 
capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) 
document and risk appetite statement (until 
the formation of the Risk Committee) during 
the year. 
The integrity of the financial statements is 
underpinned by the control environment. In 
this regard, the Committee has considered 
risk and control reports from the Head of 
Internal Audit, the Chief Risk Officer, and 
the Compliance and Risk Director and 
satisfied itself that the integrity of the control 
environment supporting the financial reporting 
and disclosure process is appropriate. 
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL JUDGMENTS AND 
FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR 2015
As part of its work in the year, the Audit 
Committee, on behalf of the Board, has 
examined the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, Interim Report and Financial 
Statements, the Interim Management 
Statements, related disclosures, consistency of 
accounting policies and the financial reporting 
process. This has included the review and 
approval of the Annual Report, and consideration 
of the Income Statement, Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial 
Position, Statement of Changes in Equity, Going 
Concern statement and the Statement of Cash 
Flows, with an emphasis on ensuring that these 
are fair, balanced and understandable.
As part of the review of the Annual Report, 
the Audit Committee concluded that there are 
no significant financial judgements and that 
the key area of discussion for the Committee 
in the financial statements is revenue as it is 
a significant focus for stakeholders. Within 
this, the Committee considered the basis for 
revenue recognition:  
• Given the nature of HL’s business, the 
revenue stream is non-complex, being 
mainly high volume, low value transactions 
which turn into cash quickly, therefore 
the degree of judgement required over 
this significant area is limited. Whilst 
considering revenue, the Committee 
received information from the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), the finance team and the 
external auditor. The Committee reviewed 
and discussed monthly management 
information during the year including 
absolute levels of revenue and variances 
in revenue between 2014 and 2015, 
with particular emphasis on the impact 
of RDR changes and reduced interest 
rates. Information is also provided to the 
committee on the performance of cash 
reconciliations, stock reconciliations and 
client account reconciliations, which all 
underpin the revenue calculation. Increased 
confidence has been derived from the 
external audit approach such that revenue 
streams were recalculated on 100% of our 
most significant revenue streams, with 
sample based testing on the remainder.
• The Committee received regular reports 
from management on the actions taken 
following the external audit benchmarking 
exercise of our IT controls in 2014 and 
were satisfied that any improvements 
required were put in place. The external 
audit also included a review of material 
balances, including counterparty balances, 
and an assessment of our overall control 
environment with an emphasis this year 
on IT controls and controls over journal 
entries and reconciliations.
• The Committee evaluated whether the 
going concern basis of accounting was 
appropriate by assessing the ICAAP 
and forecasts. This included a review 
of possible extreme stress scenarios.  
The Committee concluded that the 
liquidity and capital position of the Group 
remained appropriate.
The Company has in place arrangements to 
ensure that the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides shareholders with the information 
necessary to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. The 
Committee examined the 2015 Annual Report 
and Financial Statements and was specifically 
tasked by the Board to advise it on whether the 
report is fair, balanced and understandable.  
The Committee did this by satisfying itself 
that there is a robust process of challenge, 
including challenge by the Committee itself.  
The Committee’s own challenge process 
included questioning the Chief Executive on 
the overall messages and tone of his review 
statement, examining and challenging reports 
from both management and the external 
auditor relating to the Annual Report, and 
reviewing consistency with internal reports 
presented to the Board by management, 
the Chief Financial Officer, Head of Internal 
Audit and Chief Risk Officer during the year. 
After challenge, debate and consideration 
of all relevant information, the Committee 
concluded that it could recommend to the 
Board that the 2015 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements are fair, balanced and 
understandable.
2. Internal controls and key risks
The Audit Committee receives reports at each 
meeting from Compliance and Risk, as well as 
Internal Audit. The Committee challenged the 
key executives on the content and veracity of 
those reports and the Committee has been 
satisfied that appropriate arrangements, 
actions or mitigating controls are in place. 
Topics addressed this year included:
• The ongoing project to upgrade and 
enhance our IT operating platform 
• IT security, including cyber risk and 
specifically Denial of Service attacks
• Considering root cause analysis for any 
systems outages
• Monitoring CASS, implementation of 
PS14/9 and client money reports
• Monitoring changes to the management 
of SIPP monies
• Overseeing the implementation of 
improved measurement and reporting of 
key controls and process mapping
• Reviewing the Risk Management 
arrangements including the assessment of 
the top ten key risks, potential impact and 
resulting actions (responsibility passed to 
the Risk Committee from 1 October 2014)
GOVERNANCE 46 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
• The implementation of a process to 
ensure continuous monitoring of controls 
as required by the Financial Reporting 
Council for the forthcoming year.
3. Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s effectiveness was 
independently reviewed as part of the overall 
Board effectiveness review undertaken 
in the year. The results showed that the 
Committee is effective and working as should 
be expected. Certain recommendations have 
been made as part of the review, actions 
have been agreed where improvements were 
suggested:
• An additional meeting has been added 
to the calendar for the coming year in 
order to ensure there is adequate time for 
discussion and debate.
• Drafts of the annual financial statements 
were provided to the Committee at an 
earlier stage to ensure there is sufficient 
time for members of the Committee to 
review and make comments.
• A more rigorous approach to evaluating 
the effectiveness of the external auditors 
has been adopted.  
• Guidance published by the Financial 
Reporting Council last year requires 
boards to consider culture as a significant 
factor in the organisation’s risk and 
control framework, as a result, the Internal 
Audit team will carry out a review of 
culture in the coming year.
• A revised control framework is being 
developed and a process mapping 
exercise is being undertaken, to ensure 
that the Committee has an appropriate 
overview of the risk and control processes 
within the Group. 
4. Effectiveness of Internal Audit
The Audit Committee assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibilities relating to the 
adequacy of the resourcing and plans of the 
Internal Audit department. Internal Audit 
presents its plans for audit, using a risk 
based approach, to the Committee twice 
a year for prioritisation and approval. The 
Internal Audit charter can be found on our 
website at www.hl.co.uk.
Having conducted a review of the Internal 
Audit department the Committee is happy 
with both its resources and plans. The 
Institute of Internal Auditors recommend 
that an external review of the Internal Audit 
function is carried out no less than every 
five years. Our Internal Audit function had a 
satisfactory external review carried out in May 
2012. The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
was in regular contact with the Head of 
Internal Audit throughout the year.
The Audit Committee met with the Head of 
Internal Audit privately this year in order to 
discuss any matters directly in the absence of 
management.
5. Effectiveness and independence of the 
external auditor 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the 
development, implementation and monitoring 
of the Group’s policy on external audit. The 
policy assigns oversight responsibility for 
monitoring the independence, objectivity 
and compliance with ethical and regulatory 
requirements to the Audit Committee, and 
day to day responsibility to the Chief Financial 
Officer. The policy states that the external 
auditor is jointly responsible to the Board 
and the Audit Committee and that the Audit 
Committee is the primary contact.
The Group’s policy on external audit can be 
found on the Group’s website at www.hl.co.
uk and it is regularly reviewed to ensure 
that the independence and objectivity of our 
external auditors is maintained. It sets out 
the categories of non-audit services which 
the external auditor will and will not be 
allowed to provide to the Group, subject to de 
minimis levels and Audit Committee Chairman 
approval. The policy establishes guidelines 
for the recruitment of employees or former 
employees of the external auditors and for the 
recruitment of our employees by them. The 
policy further states that our external auditor 
may only be used for non-audit work where 
there are specific circumstances which mean 
they are the only firm able to provide a good 
service at an acceptable price. There were no 
non-audit fees during 2015 (2014: £nil). Fees 
for the audit for 2015 were £220,000 (2014: 
£118,000). In the prior year there was a 
£39,000 overrun on the audit fees which was 
subsequently recognised as an expense in the 
year to 30 June 2015 but not included in the 
fees above. The Audit Committee has agreed 
a higher base fee for 2015, better reflecting 
the work the external auditor is performing. 
 
There is also an increase in fees in 2015 due to 
the additional work undertaken by the auditors 
in respect of specific CASS and client monies 
compliance auditing due to regulatory changes.  
There are no contractual or similar obligations 
restricting the Group’s choice of external auditor 
and the external auditor has confirmed to the 
Committee that they remain independent.
The Audit Committee met with the external 
auditor privately this year in order to 
discuss any matters directly with the Senior 
Engagement Partner in the absence of 
management. 
PwC have acted as auditors to the Group 
since 2013. In line with the EU audit  
regulation requirements, Hargreaves 
Lansdown will be required to review PwC as 
statutory auditor by 2023. This regulation 
requires the Company to undertake a formal 
tender process at least every ten years. In 
addition, the lead engagement partner is 
required to be replaced every five years in 
accordance with the regulation.
The Committee continues to remain satisfied 
with the performance and effectiveness 
of PwC and that they continue to remain 
independent and objective. The Committee 
has therefore recommended to the Board 
that a resolution is put to shareholders 
recommending their reappointment together 
with their terms of engagement and 
remuneration at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company. This will continue to be 
assessed on an annual basis.
The external auditor will be asked to attend 
the AGM and will be available to answer 
shareholders questions about the audit and 
their report found on page 67.
Signed on behalf of the Audit Committee.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
– CONTINUED   47 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
30 June 2015.
OBJECTIVES
Hargreaves Lansdown’s remuneration 
practices are designed to promote the long 
term success of the company by supporting 
the business strategy and we believe that 
this is best done by motivating and retaining 
our talented employees. Our overall 
remuneration package aligns the long-term 
interests of Executive Directors with those of 
our shareholders and other stakeholders by 
incentivising the growth in the value of the 
business over the long term.
The Remuneration Committee continues to be 
satisfied that the structure of the remuneration 
package does not incentivise inappropriate risk 
taking, and although the application of some 
areas of the Remuneration Policy are being 
tightened, the Remuneration Policy is not being 
formally changed or submitted for another 
shareholder vote.
Outline of remuneration for Executive Directors
Hargreaves Lansdown provides a simple 
remuneration package consisting of base 
salary; annual bonus and long term incentive 
plan in addition to the same benefits package 
and salary sacrifice arrangements that are 
available to all employees of the Group. 
The annual bonus is partly paid immediately 
in cash and part is deferred into shares and/or 
cash for three years and is subject to a malus 
provision (explained in more detail below) 
and, for bonus earned for 2016 onwards 
the bonus will be subject to clawback; the 
long term incentive plan provides share 
options that vest after three years, subject 
to formal performance conditions and also 
subject to malus, and, for awards made from 
2015 onwards, vested awards will also be 
subject to clawback. There is also a minimum 
shareholding requirement.
The total bonus pool is capped as a proportion 
of profit before tax which establishes a 
clear link between rewards to shareholders 
and to both Executive Directors and senior 
management within the Group. Individual 
payments to Executive Directors are capped 
as a percentage of base salary.
A relatively high proportion of remuneration is 
paid in the form of bonus. The period for the 
deferral of 30% of bonus, the performance 
period for the long term incentive scheme 
and the period over which malus can be 
applied is three years. Hargreaves Lansdown’s 
current business model ensures that profit is 
quickly translated into cash and as a result the 
Remuneration Committee deems that these 
policies and timescales are appropriate.
Remuneration outcomes for the year
The Committee’s considered view was 
that 2015 had been a reasonable year for 
Hargreaves Lansdown. There was excellent 
new asset growth and client retention. The 
decisions on pricing have proven to be sound, 
balancing reduced costs for customers, a 
competitive pricing position and continuing 
profitable business activity.
Net new business was £6.1 billion and we 
welcomed 84,000 net new clients. Assets 
under administration increased by 18% while 
profit before tax fell by 5% to £199.0 million. 
The decisions on variable remuneration 
needed to reflect both this but also recognise 
the drag effect on profit growth of the 
continuing reduction in interest rates and 
the full year impact of the new tariffs arising 
from the regulatory changes of last year.  
Whilst interest rates and regulatory change 
are beyond management’s control, they have 
directly led to reduced margins which meant 
profit declined despite growth in clients 
and assets. Management share in both the 
upside and downside of these factors and 
therefore the Executive Director and wider 
senior management bonus pool for 2015 was 
reduced compared to 2014.
As a result, the CEO’s annual bonus earned for 
the year was 13% lower than last year.
The 2012 LTIP will vest on the third 
anniversary of the award and based upon the 
outcome of three year performance period 
ending 30 June 2015. An indication of the 
value at vesting is:
• The EPS performance target partially 
achieved.
• The Net New Business target fully achieved.
• The Net New Clients target fully achieved.
• A resulting 52,441 options of the 60,000 
granted will vest
• Using the average share price over the 
quarter ended 30 June 2015 of £12,24, 
the gain over the exercise price of £6.87 
is £5,37, giving an indicative total gain of 
£281,000. 
Actions taken during the 12 months to 
30 June 2015
The 12 months to 30 June 2015 have been 
busy for the Remuneration Committee with 
work completed including:
• The Directors’ Remuneration Report in the 
2014 annual report was reviewed, with 
consideration given to all of the feedback 
received from institutional shareholders.
• The performance conditions for the 
Executive Directors Share Option Plan 
(LTIP) were set and the level of awards 
to be made to each Executive Director 
Christopher D. Barling
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
GOVERNANCE 48 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
in respect of performance for the year 
ended 30 June 2014 under the LTIP were 
determined.
• A new LTIP performance condition 
measuring customer service levels was 
proposed, reviewed and agreed for LTIP 
awards to be made in 2015 onwards. This 
will be based on asset retention and the 
results of regular client surveys.
• The new corporate governance guidelines 
on clawback were considered and a new 
clawback measure proposed and agreed.
• The Committee commissioned an external 
benchmarking review of Executive 
Directors against general market and 
comparable financial services companies.
• The base salary levels and performance 
bonuses for the Executive Directors were 
reviewed and agreed, and salary levels 
for other senior management and FCA 
Remuneration Code Staff were reviewed.
• The CEO’s base salary was increased from 
£450,000 to £500,000 per annum, with 
effect from 1 July 2015, and the maximum 
bonus opportunity was reduced from 
five times to four times base salary as 
part of a rebalancing from variable to 
fixed remuneration. This is the first salary 
increase that the CEO has received since 
his appointment.
• The Chairman’s activities and 
remuneration were reviewed and an 
increased time commitment agreed 
alongside an increase in fees from 
£150,000 to £250,000 per annum with 
effect from 1 July 2015. 
• The Remuneration Code Staff disclosure 
was reviewed and agreed.
• Tracey Taylor stood down from the Board 
and her termination arrangements were 
reviewed and agreed. These included 
a payment in lieu of salary and a cash 
bonus. Full details are provided in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
• Peter Hargreaves stood down from the 
Board and this was reviewed. No special 
termination arrangements were made.
• The remuneration for the incoming CFO, 
Chris Hill, was reviewed and agreed. 
This includes a base salary of £425,000 
per annum and the same arrangements 
on annual bonus and LTIP as for other 
Executive Directors. Also included is 
compensation for a proportion of the 
value of the awards forfeited by Mr Hill as 
a result of his appointment at Hargreaves 
Lansdown. Further details are provided in 
the Implementation Report.
• The effectiveness of the Remuneration 
Committee was reviewed and it was 
concluded that the Committee remained 
effective throughout the year.
• The EBA consultation document was 
reviewed and the Committee contributed 
to the response submitted by the Group.
Taking account of shareholder views
We were delighted that last year’ s remuneration
report received a favourable vote of 93.0% 
from shareholders, and that the Remuneration 
Policy received a favourable vote of 98.4%. 
In future the Remuneration Committee will 
implement the approved Remuneration Policy 
more tightly than in the last year, including 
applying a maximum annual bonus cap of four 
times salary, down from five times and the 
introduction of clawback. These changes are 
in response to shareholder feedback received 
in the last year.
We have also consulted with our very 
largest shareholders this year on executive 
remuneration matters. 
Direction of travel
The Remuneration Policy is well embedded 
and has been successful.
Last year, we stated that the relationship 
between fixed and variable remuneration 
had become unbalanced. Accordingly we are 
making two changes this year in relation to 
this relationship:
• The maximum bonus in relation to base 
salary is reduced from five times to four 
times.
• The CEOs base salary has been increased 
from £450,000 to £500,000 per annum.
During the year, the European Banking 
Authority issued a consultation which included 
draft guidelines on remuneration policies 
which suggested that the application of 
proportionality to CRD IV remuneration policies 
for some financial services companies may not 
operate in the future. Hargreaves Lansdown has 
responded to the consultation appropriately. 
The Remuneration Committee will continue to 
keep the balance of the remuneration package 
under review in the light of ongoing market 
and regulatory change.
Compliance with legislation and best practice
This report has been prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups Regulations 2013. It 
also meets the requirements of the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules.
The Remuneration Committee confirms 
throughout the financial year that the 
Company has complied with these governance 
rules and best practice provision.
The report is split into two sections:
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which details the payments made to 
Directors and explains the link between 
group performance and remuneration for 
the 2014/15 financial year (the ‘Annual 
Report on Remuneration’). This will be 
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at 
this year’s AGM.
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the 
‘Remuneration Policy’ or ‘Policy’), which 
sets out Hargreaves Lansdown’s policy 
for Directors of Hargreaves Lansdown plc 
(Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors collectively known as ‘Directors‘).  
This was approved by shareholders at 
our Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 
24 October 2014, and is included here 
to provide shareholders with a complete 
picture of remuneration. It is the intention 
of the Committee that this Policy will be 
in effect for three years from the date of 
approval in October 2014.
The Annual Report on Remuneration is subject 
to an advisory vote.
I would like to commend the Annual Report on 
Remuneration to our shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
– CONTINUED   49 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
ANNUAL REPORT 
ON REMUNERATION
The Directors Remuneration Report 
also encompasses the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee’s statement.
CHANGES TO THE APPLICATION OF THE 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee has agreed three changes to 
the application of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy. These all tighten up our approach 
and as a result we have been advised that 
there is no need for a new shareholder vote 
on the Policy this year. We intend to submit 
the Remuneration Policy for a new binding 
vote in 2017 in line with the usual three year 
timetable. The following are the changes:
Cap on annual bonus:
• The Remuneration Committee have 
previously stated that the direction 
of travel on remuneration is to have a 
smaller element of variable pay and to 
increase base salaries. Accordingly, the 
cap on the maximum amount of annual 
bonus for Executive Directors will be 
constrained to four times base salary 
(down from five times).
Clawback:
• In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, clawback is being 
introduced and will apply to all Executive 
Director’s variable compensation. This  
will apply to new LTIP awards made in 
2015 and to the annual bonus earned for 
the year ended 30 June 2016.
• Clawback will potentially be applied by 
the plc Board following:
a.    Material misstatement of financial 
results which resulted in over-vesting 
or over payment of awards.
b.    An error in the calculation of incentive 
payments which resulted in the over 
vesting or over payment of awards.
c.    Gross misconduct.
• Clawback will apply to the non-deferred 
element of the bonus up to 3 years from 
the date of the award.
• Clawback will not apply to deferred 
bonuses which are already subject to 
malus.
• Clawback will apply to LTIP awards up to 
two years from the vesting date.
Peter Hargreaves stood down from the Board 
during the year and the clause in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy relating specifically to his 
remuneration “Special arrangements for the 
founding Executive Director” will therefore not 
be applied in the future.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee has put the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy into practice recognising 
that achieving the appropriate balance 
and determining a fair outcome in setting 
a competitive level of total remuneration 
involves judgement. In forming this 
judgement, the Committee considers pay data 
at similar size and scale companies operating 
in similar sectors. However, these do not 
determine what remuneration the Company 
offers but rather set a ‘context’ within which 
an individual’s rewards will be positioned.
In determining that positioning, the primary 
factors taken into account are the challenges 
the individual faces in their role, and their 
ability, experience and performance.
HOW THE REMUNERATION POLICY 
HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR YEAR ENDING 
30 JUNE 2015
Details of how the Policy has been applied are 
set out below.
Executive Directors’ salaries
The Executive Director’s base salaries were 
reviewed in June 2015. In reviewing base 
salaries the Committee takes into account 
salaries elsewhere across the Group, relevant 
market data and information on remuneration 
practice in a comparator group of companies 
in the financial sector. Historically, Executive 
Directors’ base salaries have been set well 
below the market median.
The Chief Executive’s base salary has been 
increased in 2015 for the first time since his 
appointment. The increase was 11% and was 
accompanied by a reduction in the maximum 
annual bonus opportunity from five times 
base salary to four times. Since the Chief 
Executive took office on 2nd September 2010, 
the company’s sales have grown by 100%, the 
company’s profit by 131% and the share price 
by 196%, during which time we have become 
an established member of the FTSE 100.
Ian Gorham’s base salary is being increased 
as part of the rebalancing between fixed 
and variable pay highlighted in last year’s 
report. The base salary figures in the above 
table are the reference base salaries of the 
Executive Director before any salary sacrifice 
or exchange into pension or other benefits.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director 
Remuneration
The Chairman’s remuneration was reviewed in 
June 2015. The Chairman’s remuneration and 
the time expected to be spent on his duties 
had remained unchanged since 1st July 2012. 
Since then, the company has significantly 
grown in scale. As a result, the Committee has 
reviewed the Chairman’s responsibilities with 
the CEO and concluded that the company can 
obtain more value from the Chairman’s unique 
position by his spending more time on his 
role. The Chairman has been asked, and has 
agreed, to significantly increase the amount of 
time he will spend on his duties from just over 
one day per week to between two to two and 
a half days per week and his remuneration 
was accordingly increased to £250,000 per 
annum.

The Non-Executive Director fees include a base 
fee of £50,000 per annum which includes 
membership of the various committees. There 
are additional fees for the senior independent 
director role (£12,500 per annum) and for 
chairing committees (Remuneration £12,500 
per annum, Audit £25,000 per annum). Details 
of the membership of the committees are given 
in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 
36 to 43.  
Executive Directors’ annual bonus for the year 
ending 30 June 2015
The size of the bonus pool was determined 
by the Committee based on the performance 
of the Group against a number of financial 
measures, detailed below. The bonus pool 
covers both Executive Directors and the wider 
senior management team and is subject to a 
cap of 5% of profit before tax, in line with the 
Policy.
Similarly, each individual Executive Director’s 
performance and that of the senior 
management team has been considered by 
the Committee against objectives to ensure 
that allocation of the pool is consistent with 
individual performance. The bonuses awarded 
to Executive Directors have been constrained 
to a maximum cap of five times base salary 
this year as per the Policy, and details are 
reported below.
30% of the bonus awarded has been 
deferred in either shares or cash, subject 
only to continuing employment and with no 
performance conditions as this is a reward for 
performance in the financial year. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
The awards made under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) in the year have been 
constrained to a maximum of two and a half 
times base salary. The awards made in 2012 
and 2013 were subject to three performance 
conditions which were earnings per share 
(EPS), net new business flows and net new 
clients. The awards made in 2014 were 
subject to two performance conditions; EPS 
and net new business flows. For awards to 
be made in 2015 the Committee has decided 
there will be three performance conditions; 
EPS, net new business flows and a synthetic 
measure for customer service which is 
based on the Net Promoter Score
SM
 across 
several key products combined with client 
retention as a percentage of assets. This 
measure has the benefit of several years of 
back data. The EPS and client satisfaction 
targets will be disclosed for the year in which 
the initial awards are made and the net new 
business flows target will be fully disclosed 
retrospectively. In making this decision, the 
Committee felt that these three measures 
align well with the long term strategy of the 
business. Client satisfaction is at the heart 
of everything that Hargreaves Lansdown 
does, earnings per share indicate the overall 
financial performance of the Group and net 
new business is the key driver of future 
years’ financial performance. No significant 
amendments have been made to the terms 
and conditions of any entitlement of a director 
under the LTIP .  
Termination arrangements for Tracey Taylor 
(audited)
Mrs Taylor stood down from the role of CFO 
with effect from 5th December 2014 following 
15 years’ service with the Group. She 
continued in employment with the Company 
until 30th June 2015. In line with the Policy, 
Mrs Taylor received the remuneration as per 
the table at the bottom of this page.
The Committee determined that an 
appropriate annual bonus for Mrs Taylor was 
£150,000 based on the financial performance 
of the Group, her performance as CFO in the 
period to 5 December 2014, her contribution 
to a number of operational projects and a 
smooth and professional transition of her role 
in the period to 30 June 2015.

salary of £425,000 per annum, participation 
in the annual bonus (pro-rated for time to 
be employed), participation in the LTIP 
and participation in other benefits on the 
same basis as other Executive Directors. No 
guaranteed awards have been made. The 
notice period is 12 months on either side.
Existing share awards forfeited by Mr Hill 
at his previous employer as a result of his 
appointment at Hargreaves Lansdown will 
be bought out by an award of Hargreaves 
Lansdown shares at the same or a discounted 
basis to the current estimated value of the 
previous award and will vest on the same 
dates as the benefit being replaced as follows:
• 2016: An award over 27,100 Hargreaves 
Lansdown shares which will vest on 1st 
July 2016. This award had a face value of 
£312,463 based on the share price as at 
30th June 2015.
• 2017: An award over 12,200 Hargreaves 
Lansdown shares which will vest on 1st 
July 2017. This award had a face value of 
£140,666 based on share price as at 30th 
June 2015.
No compensatory awards were made in 
respect of other awards foregone. Both of 
the buy-out awards are subject to continuing 
employment until the relevant vesting dates.  
No performance conditions are attached 
because the existing benefits being bought 
out have none attached.

ANNUAL BONUS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 
30 JUNE 2015 (AUDITED)
The size of the bonus pool was determined 
based on performance against a number of 
financial measures. The relevant measures 
and the Committee’s assessment of 
performance are as shown opposite:
The Committee’s considered view was whilst 
2015 had been a reasonable year overall, 
the results were not quite as strong as 
previous years (for many very valid reasons, 
including those outside of management’s 
control) and decided that the total bonus 
pool for Executive Directors and wider senior 
management team for 2015 should be 1.78% 
of profit before tax as compared to 2.42% for 
the previous year. 
The Committee individually considers each 
Director’s performance and that of the senior 
management team against objectives to 
ensure allocation of the pool is consistent 
with individual performance. 
Deferral of annual performance bonuses 
As disclosed in 2014, the requirement for 30% 
of all performance bonuses to be waived in 
favour of deferred awards has been phased 
in over 3 years. In line with previously stated 
intentions 30% of the annual performance 
bonuses are deferred for the current year and 
deferment at this level will continue in future.
The deferred awards will ordinarily be in 
the form of shares on which dividends (or 
dividend equivalents) are earned. However, 
providing the Director satisfies the minimum 
shareholding target with reference to base 
salary, the option is given for deferred awards 
to be either in shares on which dividends (or 
dividend equivalents) are earned or in cash on 
which no interest will be earned, or a mixture 
of shares and cash. The right to exercise 
deferred awards will vest after three years 
provided the individual remains employed by 
the Hargreaves Lansdown Group.
For additional information, the history of the 
performance measures and the bonus pool for 
the last five years is:

VESTING OF LONG TERM INCENTIVE 
AWARDS FOR FINANCIAL YEAR ENDING 
30 JUNE 2015 (AUDITED)
The LTIP awards made for the year ended 
30th June 2012 will vest on the third 
anniversary of the award. The LTIP targets  
and the outcomes achieved are detailed 
opposite. 
For each of the performance criteria achieved 
in full, 20,000 options are exercisable. For  
the criteria achieved in part, a pro-rated 
number of options is exercisable.
For each participant 52,441 options of the 
60,000 granted will vest. Using the average 
share price over the quarter ended 30th June 
2015 of £12.24, the gain over the exercise 
price of £6.87 is £5.37, giving an indicative 
total gain of £281,000. 
There have been no long term incentive 
awards vesting in the year.
Share awards made during the year ending 
30 June 2015 (Audited)
In respect of performances of the Executive 
Directors during the year ended 30 June 
2014, the Remuneration Committee made 
awards under the LTIP on 2nd October 2014.  
Each Director received an award of options 
over 55,000 shares (the face value of these 
awards being 114% of base salary for Ian 
Gorham and 146% of base salary for Tracey 
Taylor). These awards are well within the 
maximum levels permitted by the rules of the 
Plan. 
Each target will have a threshold and 
maximum target set by the Committee. 
Provided the threshold is achieved, 25% 
of that part of the Option relating to that 
performance condition will vest, rising to 
vesting in full if the maximum target is met 
or exceeded. For performance between the 
minimum and maximum targets, the vesting 
will be pro-rated on a straight line basis 
between 25% and 100%.

under executive (discretionary) schemes 
which exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the company in any rolling 10 year 
period.

The table opposite shows the actual expenditure 
of the Group in terms of total employee 
remuneration pay, profit before tax, and total

To aid comparison we have also detailed the 
percentage change between the years.
ALL-EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS 
The company operates a SAYE share options 
scheme and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) on the 
same terms for all employees. All employees 
are encouraged to become shareholders, 
both through direct ownership or through 
participation in share schemes.
PENSION
No Directors or staff participates in a defined 
benefit pension scheme. The Group operates 
its own Group Self Invested Personal Pension 
(the “GSIPP”). The Company contributes 4% 
of base salary to the scheme which applies 
to Executive Directors and staff. Employees 
wishing to make personal contributions to 
the GSIPP can do so via ‘salary exchange’ or 
‘bonus waiver’ ensuring that they benefit from 
the maximum, immediate relief from income 
tax and National Insurance. Staff, Senior 
Management and Executive Directors may opt 
out of the scheme should they wish.
The Committee confirms that no excess 
retirement benefits have been paid to current 
or past Directors.
PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES
The Committee confirms that no amounts 
have been paid to third parties in respect of 
Directors’ services.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for the framework or broad policy for the fair 
remuneration of the Executive Directors of 
the Company and its subsidiaries as well as 
their performance management. The policy is 
determined with due regard to the interests 
of the Company and the shareholders. The 
Committee makes recommendations to 
the Board. No Director plays a part in any 
discussion about his or her own remuneration.  
The Remuneration Committee meets at least 
twice per year and is governed by formal 
Terms of Reference, which are reviewed 
annually. 
The Remuneration Committee met nine times 
during this financial year. The attendance by 
each director is set out in the table on page 
40. The Committee is chaired by Chris Barling 
and its other members at 30 June 2015 were 
Michael Evans, Shirley Garrood and 
Dharmash Mistry. None of the Committee 
has any personal financial interest (other 
than as shareholders), conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day

the Group; and 
• monitor the level and structure of 
remuneration for senior management.
The performance measurement of the 
Directors and key members of senior 
management and the determination of their 
annual remuneration packages are undertaken 
by the Committee. The Committee also 
ensures that the remuneration relationship 
between the Directors and senior employees 
of the Company is appropriate and that 
the remuneration policy complies with the 
FCA Remuneration Code. Any exceptional 
remuneration arrangements for senior 
employees are advised to the Committee.
EXTERNAL ADVISORS
Throughout the year, the Committee has 
appointed and been advised by Deloitte LLP , 
who are signatories to the Code of Conduct 
for the provision of independent remuneration 
advice of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group. The Remuneration Committee are 
satisfied that the advice it has received was 
independent. The fees payable to Deloitte for 
this advice were £24,300 plus VAT.
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS OF EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS IN THE YEAR
Peter Hargreaves is a Non-Executive Director 
of ITM Power plc and retains the fees related 
to that role. Ian Gorham does not currently 
hold any external directorships. Tracey Taylor 
held no external directorships while she was 
a Director.

PREAMBLE
This Policy took effect immediately following 
the AGM of 24 October 2014. It is the 
intention of the Committee that this Policy 
will be in effect for three years from the date 
of approval. The Committee has reviewed the 
policy and intends to operate it in the future 
with the following tightening of policy in three 
areas, which are explained in detail in the 
Remuneration Report:
• The cap on Directors Annual Performance 
Bonus will be constrained to four times 
salary.
• The special arrangements for founding 
Executive Director will not be applied as 
Peter Hargreaves has stepped down from 
the Board.
• Clawback will be applied to variable 
remuneration in future.
POLICY
The Company’s Policy is designed such that 
each component of remuneration works in 
unison with the others to form an overall 
package which will attract, retain and 
motivate individuals of the calibre required 
to run a group of the scale and complexity of 
Hargreaves Lansdown. 
For Executive Directors, packages are 
provided which are weighted towards 
performance with measures which reflect 
individual and corporate performance over a 
one and three year time horizon.
The Policy is divided into separate sections 
for Executive and Non-Executive Directors.  
The remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and Chairman is set by the Committee under 
delegated powers from the Board. The Non-
Executive Directors’ remuneration is set by 
the Chairman and Chief Executive. No Director 
plays a role in setting their own remuneration.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY –
FOR INFORMATION ONLY
Component / Purpose 
and link to strategy
Operation and performance measures Maximum Opportunity
Base Salary 
To attract and retain 
high performing 
individuals, considering 
both the market 
value of the position 
and the individual’s 
skills, experience and 
performance.
The Committee will review each Director’s Base Salary annually and will consider each 
individual’s performance and progress taking into account the scope and nature of their 
role, their ability and their experience.
The base salary will also be set with reference to mid-market levels and to remuneration 
within the Group as well as appropriate comparator companies. 
Salary increases are usually effective from 1 July.
No prescribed maximum annual 
increase.
Factors considered when determining 
any increase to Base Salary will 
include individual performance 
and any changes in roles or 
responsibilities. The Committee will 
also consider increases across the 
wider senior management team.
Annual Performance 
Bonus
To reward achievement 
of the Group’s business 
plan, key performance 
indicators and the 
personal contribution 
of Directors. To align 
the interests of 
Directors with those of 
shareholders.
The level of Performance Bonus payable is linked to key financial metrics as well as 
individual, departmental and corporate performance against objectives.
Bonus awards to Directors are made from the Directors’ annual performance aggregate 
bonus pool (which also provides for bonuses for the wider senior management team). 
The size of the aggregate bonus pool is established taking account of the Group’s key 
performance indicators for the relevant financial year such as underlying profit before tax, 
operating margin, underlying earnings per share, quality of customer service provided, 
corporate governance, compliance with regulatory requirements and risk management 
along with making some allowance for impacts on profit outside of management’s control 
such as market and interest rate movements. The Committee considers each individual 
Director’s performance against his or her personal objectives to ensure that awards are 
made where performance so merits.
30% of the Annual Performance Bonus is subject to compulsory deferral for a period of 
three years. It may be deferred into deferred share awards and / or deferred cash awards 
at each Director’s discretion, subject to each Director maintaining the required minimum 
shareholding. Dividend alternatives will accrue on deferred share awards and will be paid 
at the time of vesting.
To the extent that the minimum shareholding is not yet held, the Director must defer into 
share awards.
At the discretion of the Committee, the immediately payable element of the Annual 
Performance Bonus may be paid as cash and/or as an additional employer pension 
contribution.
Any unvested deferred awards are subject to a formal malus mechanism.
The aggregate bonus pool is 
capped at 5% of Profit Before Tax 
for that year. The maximum bonus 
opportunity for Directors under the 
Policy is five times base salary for 
the reward period.
a) Policy applying to the Executive Directors of the Company 59 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Long Term Incentive 
Plan 
To align the interests 
of Directors with those 
of shareholders and to 
reward growth of the 
long-term value of the 
business.
Annual awards of market value share options will vest after 3 years subject to continuing 
employment and to the extent that performance tests are met over the 3 year performance 
period. The awards are subject to up to three performance conditions including one profit related 
and up to two business performance indicators.
In respect of each performance condition, which are set by the Committee prior to the grant of 
the award, performance below the minimum threshold results in zero vesting. Vesting of each 
performance condition starts at 25% and rises to 100% for levels of performance between the 
minimum and maximum targets. 
Any unvested awards are subject to a formal malus mechanism.
The maximum award each year 
under the Policy is two and a half 
times base salary.
Shareholding 
Guideline 
To align the interests 
of management and 
shareholders in the 
success of the Group
Directors have six years from appointment to achieve a shareholding with a minimum value 
of two times base salary with a minimum goal of one times after three years assessed on 30 
June of each year.
Not applicable.
Pension 
To provide adequate 
pension saving 
arrangements for 
Directors and staff.
Pension provision is provided in line with the pension provision for all staff.   
Any changes made to the staff arrangements will be carried across to the Directors.
The Committee may amend the form of any Director’s pension arrangements in response to 
changing pension legislation or similar developments, so long as any amendment does not 
increase the cost to the Company of a Director’s pension provision by any greater percentage 
than the increase to the provision for all other staff.
All staff and Directors may waive an element of their Annual Performance Bonus in return for 
a corresponding employer’s contribution into their pension.
The Committee reserves the right to pay a cash allowance in place of an employer pension 
contribution where a Director has reached the Lifetime Allowance.
Current policy for all staff pensions 
is defined contribution with 
an employer contribution of a 
maximum of 4% of base salary.   
Any contribution paid as a result 
of waiver of the cash element of 
an Annual Performance Bonus will 
not be counted towards the 4% 
maximum.
Benefits 
An ‘across the board’ 
benefits package is 
available to both staff 
and Directors alike.
All eligible staff and Directors may take up a range of benefits.
Where costs are necessarily incurred in the performance of duties on behalf of the company, 
those costs will be reimbursed in full e.g. travel, accommodation, subsistence, relocation, and 
any tax and social costs arising.
Provision of tax efficient benefits such as pension contributions, additional holiday, childcare 
vouchers and workplace parking is available through a salary sacrifice mechanism.
Group life insurance and Group PHI is provided to all staff with greater than 6 months 
continuous service.
All eligible staff (as defined by the scheme rules and which includes Executive Directors) may 
participate in the Save As You Earn scheme or Share Incentive Plan. 
Appropriate director insurance and indemnity cover is provided by the company.
The maximum value of benefits 
will depend on the cost of the 
provision of those benefits.
There are a number of variables 
and unknowns impacting the 
maximum payable in the event of 
relocation; however, the Committee 
would pay no more than is 
necessary in such situations.
b) Special arrangements for founding Executive Director
The cap on annual performance bonus in relation to basic salary will not apply to Peter Hargreaves due to the nominal value of his base salary, 
although the absolute value of his bonus in any year will not exceed that of the Chief Executive. Mr Hargreaves is also not subject to the 
compulsory deferral of any element of his annual performance bonus.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY – FOR INFORMATION ONLY 
– CONTINUED  
Component / Purpose Operation
Basic fee
To attract and retain high performing individuals, 
considering both the market value of the position and 
the individual’s skills, experience and performance.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ basic fees are reviewed annually by those responsible 
as outlined earlier.
Fee increases, if applicable, are normally effective from 1 July.
The fee levels are set taking into account market data for comparable positions taking account of 
the time commitment required for the role. 
All Non-Executive Director’s fees including those below are paid in cash, on a quarterly basis.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension, or to participate in any Group 
employee share plan.
Committee Chairman fees 
To recognise the additional time commitment and 
responsibility involved in chairing a Committee of the 
Board.
Each Non-Executive Director receives an additional fee for each Committee for which they are 
Chairman.
The Committee Chairman fees reflect the additional time and responsibility in chairing a committee 
of the Board, including time spent in preparation and liaising with management, and the time spent 
attending and preparing for a committee of the Board.
Senior Independent Director (SID) fee 
To recognise the additional time commitment and 
responsibility involved holding the role of the SID.
The SID receives an additional fee for his role.
The fee reflects the additional time and responsibility in fulfilling the role of Senior Independent 
Director.
Benefits and Expenses 
To appropriately reimburse the Chairman and Non-
Executive Director for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in the fulfilment of their responsibilities and any tax and 
social costs arising.
Expenses may be claimed by the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in line with the Company’s 
expenses policy.
Appropriate director insurance and indemnity cover is provided by the company.
Reduced share dealing fees, in line with those charged for all other employees.
No other benefits are made available to Non-Executive Directors.
c) Policy applying to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors of the Company
The maximum aggregate remuneration for 
Non-Executive Directors is set in accordance 
with the Articles of Association.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND LOSS OF 
OFFICE PAYMENTS
All Executive Directors have a service 
contract and the Non-Executive Directors are 
contracted under a letter of appointment. 
Both will reflect the approved policy in force 
at the time of appointment. The service 
contracts and the letters of appointment for 
all Directors in post are available for viewing 
(on the giving of reasonable notice) at our 
registered office during normal business hours 
and both prior to and at the Annual General 
Meeting. Under the terms of our Articles of 
Association, all Directors are subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Our policy is that service contracts do 
not have a specific duration but may be 
terminated with 12 months’ notice from the 
Company or the Executive Director.
The service contracts contain no provision 
for liquidated damages for compensation 
on termination, except for those set out 
in the table on the next page. The service 
agreements contain provisions for payment 
in lieu of notice in respect of base salary, 
pension contributions but these are at the 
Company’s sole discretion.
The Committee has a policy framework 
for payments for loss of office by an 
Executive Director, both in relation to the 
service contract and incentive pay, which is 
summarised on the next page. The approach 
of the Company on any termination is to 
consider all relevant circumstances, including 
the recent performance of the Executive 
Director, and to act in accordance with any 
relevant rules or contractual provisions.
PROVISIONS ON A TAKEOVER AND OTHER 
CORPORATE EVENTS
In the event of a takeover or other corporate 
event, the Committee shall determine the 
amount (if any) of any bonus payable taking 
into account any applicable performance 
targets that have been achieved and any such 
factors as it considers appropriate given the 
curtailed performance period.
Deferred bonus awards and outstanding 
LTIP awards will vest at that time subject to 
satisfaction of the applicable performance 
conditions and pro-rated to reflect the 
length of the Performance Period which has 
been worked (with the Committee having 
discretion not to pro-rate or to reduce the  61 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
pro-rate if it considers it appropriate to do so). 
Alternatively the Committee may determine 
with the agreement of the acquiring company 
that awards may be exchanged for equivalent 
awards in another company.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
(NEDs) letters of appointment cover the 
terms of their appointment, including the time 
commitment expected. Each appointment is 
for an initial fixed term of three years from 
the commencement date subject to election 
by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment and 
annual re-election thereafter.
Either party may terminate the appointment 
upon three calendar months written notice 
and the Company may do so with immediate 
effect subject to a payment in lieu of notice.  
Should termination arise as a result of a 
resolution of shareholders in general meeting, 
or as a result of a failure to be re-appointed by 
the shareholders, NEDs will not be entitled to 
receive any fees in respect of any period after 
the termination date. No compensation is 
payable on termination, other than for accrued 
fees and expenses.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT 
REMUNERATION
The Committee will set a remuneration 
package for new Executive Directors 
determining the individual elements of the 
package and the total package taking account 
of the skills and experience of the candidate, 
the market rate, and remuneration levels 
across the Group, respecting maximum levels 
for variable pay referred to in the appropriate 
policy table.       
                   
Additional cash and/or share based awards 
on a one-off basis may be made as deemed 
appropriate by the Committee if the 
circumstances require taking into account pay 
or benefits forfeited by a Director on leaving 
a previous employer. The Committee has the 
discretion to make such awards under the 
LTIP and in excess of the LTIP salary limit or 
as permitted under Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing 
Rules (which allows companies to make one 
off share awards in exceptional circumstances, 
including recruitment). Such awards will, as 
far as possible, maintain consistency with 
the awards forfeited in terms of type of 
reward (shares or cash), expected value, time 
horizons and whether they were subject to 
performance criteria. Other payments may 
be made for relocation expenses, recruitment 
from abroad, legal costs, other costs or 
benefits forfeited by an individual being 
recruited. None of these payments made on 
new appointments will be deemed to be taken 
from the bonus pool. 
On the appointment of a new Chairman or 
Non-Executive Director, the Committee will 
set the fee level consistent with the approved 
policy at the time of appointment having due 
regard to remuneration paid for comparable 
positions taking account of the time 
commitment required for the role.

CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR REGULATION
Authority is given for the Group to comply 
with all prevailing legislation and statutory 
regulation both current and future, making 
the minimum changes to policy in order to so 
comply. 
PAY MODELLING AND PERFORMANCE 
MEASURE SELECTION
The Committee will disclose each year in 
the Group’s annual report a bar chart that 
models the potential remuneration for each 
of the Executive Directors for the forthcoming 
year using a range of assumptions. The 
chart will show the potential value of the 
current Executive Directors’ remuneration 
for the forthcoming year for three scenarios; 
‘minimum’, ‘maximum’ and ‘middle scenario’:
• The minimum amount represents 
the unconditional components of the 
remuneration package: salary, pension 
and employee benefits. 
• The mid-point amount is the amount the 
Executive Director will receive if they 
attain at least half of their objectives for 
the period. It will include both fixed and 
variable components of remuneration. 
The variable will reflect performance 
achieved during the year. 
• The maximum level is the maximum 
amount of remuneration each Executive 
Director can be awarded in the year. The 
maximum is subject to the remuneration 
caps that have been established for each 
component.  
The bar chart uses the maximum share price 
growth assumption of 30% growth over a 
three year period for the calculation of the 
potential value of the LTIP award.  
  
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER 
EMPLOYEES
All employees across the Group are subject 
to the same process in respect of annual 
salary reviews. Consideration is given to the 
scope of each role, the level of experience, 
responsibility, progress in role, and pay levels 
for similar roles in comparable companies.  
The performance and potential of the 
individual is also considered.
All permanent employees are considered for 
an annual performance bonus with similar 
metrics to those used for the Executive 
Directors. All eligible employees (under the 
rules of the scheme) may also participate 
in the Group’s Save As You Earn and Share 
Incentive Plans and senior staff may also be 
awarded share options under the Group’s 
Company Share Option Plan or Executive 
Share Option Plan where they have displayed 
exceptional performance.
EXTERNAL BOARD APPOINTMENTS
The Company recognises that external Non-
Executive Directorships are beneficial to both 
the Director and the Company and that its 
Executive Directors may be invited to become 
Non-Executive Directors of other companies. 
Such non-executive duties can broaden 
experience and knowledge which can 
benefit the Company. Subject to approval by 
the Board, Executive Directors are allowed 
to accept a maximum of two non-executive 
appointments and retain the fees received, 
provided that appointments are not likely to 
lead to conflicts of interest.
CONSULTATION WITH EMPLOYEES
Whilst the Committee does not consult 
directly with employees in respect of the 
Directors’ remuneration, it does consider 
the wider salary increase, remuneration 
arrangements and employment conditions 
across the wider employee population when 
setting the remuneration policy for Directors.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee recognises that Director 
remuneration is an area of particular interest 
to our shareholders and in setting and 
considering changes to remuneration it is 
critical that we listen to and take into account 
their views. 
The Committee considers shareholder 
feedback received in relation to the AGM 
each year at its first meeting following the 
AGM. This feedback, as well as any additional 
feedback received during any other meetings 
with shareholders, is then considered as 
part of the Company’s annual review of 
the remuneration policy. We also regularly 
engage with our largest shareholders to 
ensure we understand the range of views 
which exist on remuneration issues. When 
any material changes are made to the Policy, 
the Committee will discuss these in advance 
with our major shareholders wherever 
practical. The Committee will also consult with 
professional advisors to ensure we consider 
current market and industry practices, where 
appropriate. 
APPROVAL
The Director’s Remuneration Report including 
Policy, Annual Report and Chairman’s 
Statement have been approved by the Board 
of Directors and signed on its behalf.

purpose. The review contains forward looking 
statements which are made by the Directors

DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
The directors who held office during the 
year and at 30 June 2015 had interests 
(including beneficial interests) in the shares 
of the Company as shown on the previous 
page. These interests are exclusive of any 
interests under share options or awards, 
details of which are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
During the period covered by this report, no 
director had any material interest in a contract 
to which the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings was a party other than their own 
service contract, requiring disclosure under 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
except in respect of the rental of the office 
premises at Kendal House as disclosed in 
Note 27 to the financial statements. 
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
As at the date of this report, other than the 
directors’ interests which are set out in the 
table above, the Company has been notified 
in accordance with the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
of the following shareholdings amounting to 
more than 3% of the issued share capital of 
the Company.
As noted on page 41, there is a Relationship 
Agreement in place between Peter Hargreaves 
and the Company.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
As permitted by the Articles of Association, 
the Directors have the benefit of an indemnity 
which is a qualifying third party indemnity 
provision as defined by Section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was 
introduced in August 2014 and is currently 
in force. The Company also purchased and 
maintained throughout the financial year 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
cover in respect of itself and its Directors 
against liability which may be incurred acting 
as directors and officers. Cover was increased 
from £20 million to £40 million during the 
year and this remains in force at the date of 
this report.    
MODEL CODE
The Company has its own internal dealing 
rules which extend the FCA Listing Rules 
Model Code provisions to all employees.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
At the Annual General Meeting on 23 October 
2015, the following three items of special 
business will be tabled:
1. Authority to purchase own shares: The 
Company was granted authority at the AGM 
in 2014 to purchase its own shares up to an 
aggregate value of 10% of the issued nominal 
capital. This authority expires at this year’s 
AGM and a special resolution will be proposed 
for its renewal.
This resolution gives the directors authority to 
make market purchases of up to 47,431,862 
ordinary shares, representing approximately 
10 percent of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital at 15th September 2015. The 
directors do not have any present intention 
of exercising such authority and the authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM 
after the passing of the proposed resolution.
2. and 3. Directors’ authority to allot shares 
and waiver of pre-emption rights: Resolutions 
are to be proposed as special business at 
the AGM on 23 October 2015 to enable the 
directors to allot unissued shares and, subject 
to the limits therein contained, to allot shares 
for cash other than to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their shareholdings.
Allotment of shares - This resolution renews 
the directors’ authority to allot shares. 
The maximum nominal value of relevant 
securities that may be allotted pursuant to 
the authority is £632,424.80, representing 
158,106,200 ordinary shares. This amount 
represents approximately 33.3 percent of the 
Company’s total share capital in issue as at 
15th September 2015.
Waiver of pre-emption rights - This 
resolution renews the directors’ authority to 
issue new shares for cash, without following 
the statutory pre-emption procedures, so 
long as: (i) the issue is a rights issue, open 
offer or other pre-emptive offer, or pursuant 
to a scrip dividend alternative; or (ii) the 
aggregate nominal amount of such issue does 
not exceed £94,863.72 (which represents 5 
percent of the issued share capital as at 15th 
September 2015). 
The directors do not have any present 
intention of exercising either of the 
authorities and the authorities will expire at 
the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting.
These resolutions seek authorities which are 
in accordance with the current guidelines 
issued by the Investment Committees of 
the Association of British Insurers and the 
National Association of Pension Funds.
PwC have expressed their willingness 
to accept appointment as auditor and a 
resolution to appoint them will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY – FOR INFORMATION ONLY 
– CONTINUED 65 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have assessed, in the light of 
current and anticipated economic conditions, 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. The principal risks that the Group is 
challenged with have been set out on page 26 
along with how the Directors mitigate these 
risks in the current economic climate. The 
Group’s business activities, financial position, 
cash flows, liquidity position, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review. In addition, 
Note 28 to the Financial Statements includes 
the Group’s policy on capital management, its 
exposure to financial risks and its policies and 
processes to manage those risks.   
The Group maintains ongoing forecasts that 
indicate profitability in 2015/16 and beyond.  
Stress test scenarios are undertaken, the 
outcomes of which show that the Group has 
adequate capital resources for the foreseeable 
future even in extreme adverse economic 
conditions. The Group’s business is highly 
cash generative with a low working capital 
requirement; indeed, the forecast cash flows 
show that the Group is expected to remain 
highly liquid in the forthcoming financial year.
After reviewing the Group’s financial forecasts 
including an assessment of regulatory and 
working capital, the Directors are confident 
that the Company and the Group have 
adequate financial resources available to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. The going concern 
basis has continued to be adopted in the 
preparation of the financial statements.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO 
AUDITOR
Each of the persons who is a director at the 
date of approval of this annual report confirms 
that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the director has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as a director, 
in order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.

GOVERNANCE 66 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The directors consider that the annual Report 
and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess a company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. When arriving at this 
position the Board was assisted by a number 
of processes including the following:
• the Annual Report is drafted by appropriate 
senior management with overall co-
ordination by the Chief Financial Officer;
• an extensive verification process is 
undertaken to ensure factual accuracy; 
and
• a draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee 
prior to consideration by the Board.
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in the Governance section 
of the annual report confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group; 
and
• the directors’ report contained in the 
Governance section of the annual report 
includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Materiality
Areas of
focus
Audit scope
• Overall Group materiality: £9.95 million which represents 5% of profit before tax.
• The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 18 reporting units, 9 of which are dormant.
• We perform a full scope audit of the complete financial information of 2 reporting units, 
which together represent 94% of the Group’s profit before tax.
• Specific procedures were also performed on a further 3 reporting units to audit 
stockbroking settlement receivables and payables, cash and cash equivalents, shares held 
by the employee benefit trust (EBT) and the EBT reserve. 
• Revenue recognition.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining 
materiality and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risk of material misstatement that had 
the greatest effect on our audit, including 
the allocation of our resources and effort, is 
identified as an “areas of focus” in the table 
below. We have also set out how we tailored 
our audit to address this specific area in 
order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures should 
be read in this context. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
Overview
GOVERNANCE 68 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Asset and transaction based revenue streams
To address the risk identified in the asset and transaction based revenue 
streams calculated by the underlying administration system, we independently 
reperformed the calculation of each revenue stream using data extracted from 
the Group’s system. In order to rely on the data extracted, we:
• reconciled transactional data provided from opening positions through to 
closing positions of individual securities held; and 
• tested a sample of transactions to customer instructions and a sample of 
security positions to stock reconciliations and external sources (such as 
fund manager statements).
This testing provided sufficient evidence for us to determine that the data 
extracted was reliable for the purposes of performing the recalculations. Our 
recalculations were performed as follows:
• using data auditing techniques, we reperformed the calculation of platform 
fees, management fees, renewal commission and stockbroking commission 
based on the data extracted from the underlying administration system; 
and 
• we tested the inputs of our recalculations by agreeing standing data, such 
as fee structures, commission rates, and security prices, to supporting 
evidence on a sample basis.
In testing the standing data, we noted 1 exception. We extended our sample 
and found no further exceptions. On the basis of this testing, we determined 
that it was appropriate for us to use the standing data in order to perform 
our independent recalculation of each of the revenue streams. We compared 
our independent recalculation of platform fee, management fee, renewal 
commission and stockbroking commission to the amount reported and noted 
differences that, in our view, were trivial and required no further investigation.
Manually calculated revenue streams
Hargreaves Lansdown Fund Managers (HLFM) AMCs
We agreed 100% of the revenue through to cash received in bank statements 
and manually recalculated the HLFM AMCs. We noted differences that, in our 
view, were trivial and required no further investigation.
Interest on client money
We manually recalculated the gross interest earned on client money based on 
records maintained by management, and tested these by agreeing a sample of 
deposits and interest rates to documentation received from the relevant bank. 
Using data auditing techniques, we recalculated the amount of interest 
paid to clients using the daily cash balance as recorded in the underlying 
administration system, and standard rates. To rely on the cash data 
extracted from the system, we tested a sample of cash movements to 
supporting documentation. In addition, we agreed a sample of rates to those 
communicated to customers.
No exceptions were noted from our testing of cash movements, or testing of 
the rates communicated to customers and, on this basis, we determined that 
it was appropriate for us to use this data in order to perform our independent 
recalculation of interest paid to clients. We compared our independent 
recalculation of interest paid to clients to the amount reported and noted 
differences that, in our view, were trivial and required no further investigation.
Revenue recognition (refer to the Audit Committee report, revenue 
recognition section of note 2, and note 4)
We focus on revenue recognition because it is material and is an important 
determinant of the Group’s profitability. In addition, there are a number of 
incentive schemes in place for both directors and staff which are in part based 
on the Group’s revenue performance, and certain share schemes for senior 
management with earnings per share performance conditions attached to 
them. As in any organisation where there are incentives based on performance, 
this gives rise to an inherent risk of fraud in revenue recognition as there is an 
incentive to overstate revenue. 
We have assessed each revenue stream for the in-scope reporting units and 
determined that there is a significant risk in relation to each of the revenue 
streams. The risk is dependent upon the opportunity to commit fraud in each 
revenue stream. Our assessment for each revenue type is as follows:
Type of revenue Description, including fraud risk factors
Revenue streams 
calculated by 
the underlying 
administration 
system:
Platform fees
Management fees
Renewal commission
Stockbroking 
commission
These revenue streams are calculated based on 
either the value of assets held or based on the 
number of trades made by a customer, multiplied 
by the relevant rate.
The value of securities and data on trades is 
held in the underlying administration system 
which supports the Vantage and PMS platforms. 
The rates are derived from the standard rate 
tables for management fees, platform fees, 
and stockbroking commission. For renewal 
commission it is based on agreements with fund 
groups.
Unauthorised changes to these inputs could allow 
manipulation of revenue. 
Revenue streams 
manually calculated 
by management:
Multi-manager fund 
Annual Management 
Charges (AMCs)
Interest on client 
money
The AMCs are manually calculated by management 
based on the net asset value of funds provided by 
Northern Trust, an independent third party, and the 
published AMC rate.
Gross interest on client money is calculated by 
management based on the deposit balance and the 
rate agreed with the bank.
Opportunity therefore arises from manipulating  
manual spreadsheet based calculations which are 
also inherently risky.
In addition, a proportion of the gross interest on 
client money is due to customers, and is calculated 
based on rate tables and daily cash balances on 
the Vantage and PMS IT platforms. The net interest 
is the amount recognised as revenue. Therefore the 
opportunity to commit fraud on interest on client 
money also arises from unauthorised changes to 
the interest rates paid to customers which impacts 
the revenue recognised by the Group 69 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure 
that we performed enough work to be able to 
give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic 
structure of the Group, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in 
which the Group operates. 
The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of 18 separate legal entities. 
There are five trading subsidiaries, two of 
which we consider to be financially significant 
reporting units and on which we performed an 
audit of their complete financial information. 
An entity was considered to be financially 
significant if it contributed more than 15% of 
consolidated profit before tax. 
In addition, we determined that there were 
three entities which required an audit of 
specific account balances, being stockbroking 
settlement receivables and payables, cash and 
cash equivalents and shares held by the EBT 
and the EBT reserve. 
All of the audit work was performed by the 
Group engagement team in the UK as all 
books and records were available at one 
location. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by 
our application of materiality. We set certain 
quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our 
audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we 
determined materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole as follows:
GOVERNANCE
Overall Group materiality £9.95 million (2014: £10.5 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied We consider this benchmark is the most appropriate benchmark for a profit orientated group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing practice, in the absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate. This 
basis of calculating materiality is consistent with that applied in the prior year.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them misstatements 
identified during our audit above £497,000 
(2014: £500,000) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the directors’ statement, set out on 
page 65, in relation to going concern. We 
have nothing to report having performed our 
review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the 
directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements using the 
going concern basis of accounting. The going 
concern basis presumes that the Group and 
Parent Company has adequate resources to 
remain in operation, and that the directors 
intend it to do so, for at least one year from 
the date the financial statements were signed. 
As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis is 
appropriate.
However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, these statements 
are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 70 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015

Responsibilities for the 
financial statements and 
the audit
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF 
THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities on page 66, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK 
& Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has 
been prepared for and only for the Parent 
Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS INVOLVES
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in 
the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to 
the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Report and 
Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”) 
to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If 
we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity
The share premium account represents the difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued. 
The capital redemption reserve relates to the repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares. 
The Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (“the EBT”) reserve represents the cost of shares in Hargreaves Lansdown plc purchased in the market and held by the Hargreaves Lansdown plc 
Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Group’s share option schemes. 
The EBT reserve represents the cumulative gain on disposal of investments held by the Hargreaves Lansdown EBT. The reserve is not distributable by the Company as the assets and liabilities 
of the EBT are subject to management by the Trustees in accordance with the EBT trust deed.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the minority’s proportion 
of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interest’s change in equity since that date. The non-controlling 
interest represents a 22% shareholding in Library Information Services Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 76 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Hargreaves Lansdown plc (the “Company”) and ultimate parent of the Group is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the 
Companies Act 2006 whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is One College Square South, 
Anchor Road, Bristol, BS1 5HL, United Kingdom. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates 
and are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as discussed on page 65.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported or the 
accounting policies in these financial statements:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’, which establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements 
when an entity controls one or more other entity (an entity that controls one or more other entities) to present consolidated financial statements. 
It defines the principle of control, and establishes controls as the basis for consolidation. It sets out how to apply the principle of control to 
identify whether an investor controls an investee and therefore must consolidate the investee. It also sets out the accounting requirements for the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements.
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint 
arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles. This has required the Group to make additional disclosures 
regarding the interest in the HLFM Multi-Manager funds that it manages, as the funds are considered to be unconsolidated structured entities. The 
disclosure has been made in Note 29.
Other new standards that were adopted during the year but had no impact on the financial statements are as follow:
 -  IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’
 -  IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’
 -  IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate financial statements’ 
 -  IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Associates and joint ventures’
 -  Amendment to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’
 -  Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not yet been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
The Directors are currently investigating whether the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial 
assets at fair value through profit and loss. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Accounting policies as shown below have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
 -  IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’
 -  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’
 -  Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’
 -  Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’
 -  Amendments to IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’
 -  Amendments to IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ 
 -  Amendments to IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Investments in associates and 
joint ventures’
 -  Annual improvements to IFRS 2012 - 2014 cycle
 -  Amendments to IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate financial statements’
 -  Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 77 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and subsidiary undertakings (investees) controlled 
by the Group made up to 30 June 2015. The Group controls an investee when it has power over an investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group reassesses 
whether it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
“Business Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to 
the cash-generating unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated 
are reviewed for impairment at least annually as a matter of course, and whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs which indicates 
potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value 
less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS on 1 July 2005 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 30 June 1997 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is primarily classified as recurring, transactional or other. 
Recurring revenue principally comprises the revenue streams of renewal income, management fees, platform fees and interest income on client 
money, while transactional revenue principally comprises initial commission on stockbroking transactions. Revenue is recognised as follows: 
Recurring
Renewal income is earned from fund management groups and is recognised on an accruals basis calculated according to the level of assets under 
the administration, or agency, of the Group primarily at each month-end. Management and platform fees are paid by clients and are recognised on 
an accruals basis calculated according to the level of applicable assets where fees apply at each month-end. The interest income on client money 
balances is the net interest margin earned by the Group and is accrued on a time basis, according to the client money balances under administration 
and by reference to the effective interest rate applicable.
Transactional
The Group’s stockbroking and unit trust management subsidiaries earn commission on securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients. The 
commission earned is recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction, as this is the date on which the service is provided to the client and 
the Group becomes entitled to the income.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 78 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group also earns initial commission from annuity services and from third party providers on the set up of group pension schemes. Initial 
commissions on group pension schemes are deemed to be earned at the policy inception date on those policies where there are only negligible 
ongoing services. Where ongoing services are provided, an appropriate proportion of the income is deferred over the relevant period. Where 
such commission is received on an indemnity basis, a provision is made for clawbacks, if any, which would be due if the policy lapses during the 
indemnity period.
Other
Other income principally represents the amount of fees receivable from the provision of Funds Library services, and is recognised on an accruals 
basis when the services are provided. 
Investment revenue recognition
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal balance and the effective interest rate applicable. Dividend income from 
investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Commission payable, staff costs and other operating costs
Commission payable represents a percentage of renewal income paid to clients as a loyalty bonus. Staff costs represent amounts paid to 
employees in respect of services provided in the year including wages and salaries, share-based payment expenses, bonuses, payments to a 
defined contribution retirement benefit scheme and related social security costs. Other operating costs represent those arising as a result of our 
operations and include depreciation and amortisation. All amounts are recognised on an accrual basis. FSCS costs are those relating to the running 
of and the levies issued under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and are recognised in accordance with IFRIC 21.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
Provisions are recognised for:
-   future committed property lease payments when the Group receives no benefit from the property through continuing usage and future receipts 
from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the Group’s future committed payments.
-   commissions received on indemnity terms where there may be a liability to repay the commissions received.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 79 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were 
unvested at 1 July 2005.  
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options expected to vest as a 
result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement 
such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.  
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Prior to 15 May 2007 the Company’s shares were not listed on a 
stock exchange and therefore, in the absence of a readily available market price for the shares, the share price was based on the market value agreed with 
HM Revenue & Customs and share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility applying to a comparable group of listed companies.  
Any gains or losses on sale of the Company’s own shares held by the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) are credited or debited 
directly to the EBT reserve and are treated as undistributable profits.
Property, plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes the original purchase 
price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is charged on all plant 
and equipment based on the estimates of their useful economic lives and expected residual values, which are reviewed annually. Management 
determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account 
other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology. The charge is calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated 
residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows:
Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment:
Leasehold property tenants’ fixtures and other fixtures – over 3 to 10 years  
Computer hardware – over 3 to 10 years
Office equipment – over 3 to 10 years
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Leasing
Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill
Other intangible assets comprise computer software and the Group’s key operating system which are stated at cost less amortisation and any 
recognised impairment loss. Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the 
cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows:
Computer software – over 3 to 8 years
Computer software relates entirely to purchases and does not include any internally generated value. The carrying values of computer software are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Internally generated assets (Assets under construction)
IT development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset, which delivers benefits at least as great 
as the amount capitalised and in accordance with the recognition criteria of IAS 38. Development work has been undertaken in-house by IT staff 
and management to enhance the key operating systems. Until 1 July 2012 this cost was not material and was recognised as an expense, the amounts 
are now more material and hence the costs are being capitalised as an intangible asset and subsequently amortised over the estimated useful life of 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 80 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
the system. Where such costs relate to an asset that is not yet available for use by the business, they have been separately classified as assets under 
construction and have not been amortised, but instead been reviewed for impairment. 
Internally generated assets
Where IT development costs relate to an asset that is now used amortisation is over an estimated useful life of 8 years. Internal policies exist to identify 
intangible assets that can be capitalised and in the case of internally generated assets a process of time sheets for IT developers and management time 
is used to identify the costs to be capitalised. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and paid, or, if 
earlier, in the accounting period when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.  
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequently appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
made and recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. In accordance with market practice, certain 
balances with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as debtors. Market receivables and payables are 
presented net where there is a legal right of offset.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment within the time-frame established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
The Group’s available-for-sale investments have been included at fair value where a fair value can be reliably calculated, with the revaluation  
gains and losses reflected in the investment revaluation reserve, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 73, 
until sale when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement. If a fair value cannot be reliably calculated by reference to a 
quoted market price or other method of valuation, available-for-sale investments are included at cost. If required a fair value adjustment would be 
recognised upon disposal of the investment. 
Investments which are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price of the 
listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement. An investment is classified in this category if it is held principally for 
the purpose of selling in the short term.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash. The carrying 
amount of these assets is approximately equal to their fair value.  
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. All financial liabilities are 
measured at amortised cost apart from trade payables.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 81 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value which is equivalent to amortised cost. In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, 
Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as creditors. Market debtors and creditors are presented net where there is a 
legal right of offset.
Interests in other entities
The Group has determined that investment funds that it manages are structured entities. Structured entities include entities that are designed so that voting 
or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the relevant activities are directed by means of a contractual 
relationship. As the Group directs the investing activities of the eight Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-Manager funds through its investment management 
agreements with them, it considers them to be structured entities. The Group holds interests in these funds through the receipt of management fees, 
together with ownership interests that it holds. Investments in the funds have been designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).   
3. KEY SOURCES OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on 
management’s best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and 
assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. The areas where a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are minimal and discussed below.
Share-based payments
In determining the fair value of equity-settled share-based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions 
about the future events and market conditions. In particular, judgement must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the 
fair value of each award granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model which is dependent on future estimates, 
including the Group’s future dividend policy, the timing with which the options will be exercised and the future volatility in the price of the 
Group’s shares. Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could affect the reported value of share-based payments. 
Whilst this is an area of judgement in the financial statements, the value of share-based payments is not materially impacted by the selection of 
assumptions and consequently no sensitivity analysis has been presented. The main assumptions are provided in Note 25.
4. REVENUE
Revenue represents commission receivable from financial services provided to clients, interest income on client money and management fees 
charged to clients. It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax. An analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:
Recurring income principally comprises renewal income, management fees, platform fees and interest income on client money. Transactional 
income principally comprises commission earned from stockbroking transactions. Other income principally represents the amount of fees receivable 
from the provision of funds data services and research through Library Information Services Ltd to external parties. The policies adopted for the 
recognition of each significant revenue stream are set out in Note 2 above.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 82 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
Following the implementation of the Retail Distribution Review (“RDR”) on 1 March 2014, total revenue earned from investment funds held 
by clients significantly increased as a new platform fee was introduced. At the same time commission income is being received from the fund 
management groups on funds purchased by clients before the RDR implementation date. Where we still receive commission on these pre-RDR 
or “legacy funds” the vast majority is now passed back to our clients in the form of a significantly higher loyalty bonus which is shown within 
commission payable in the income statement.
5. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group is organised into three business segments, namely the Vantage division, the Discretionary/Managed division and the Third Party/
Other Services division. This is based upon the Group’s internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in which the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is provided with financial information. The CODM has been identified as the Board of Executive Directors.
The ‘Vantage’ division represents all activities relating to our direct to private investor platform. 
The ‘Discretionary/Managed’ division is focused on the provision of managed services such as our Portfolio Management Service (PMS) and range 
of Multi-Manager funds.  
The ‘Third Party/Other Services’ division includes activities relating to the broking of third party investments and pensions, certificated share dealing 
and other niche services such as currency, CFDs and spread betting. In this division, clients’ investments are not administered within the Group.
The ‘Group’ segment contains items that are shared by the Group as a whole and cannot be reasonably allocated to other operating segments.
Segment expenses are those that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably 
be allocated to the segment. Gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income, interest payable and tax are not 
allocated by segment. 
Segment assets and liabilities include items that are directly attributable to a segment plus an allocation on a reasonable basis of shared items.  
Corporate assets and liabilities are not included in business segments and are thus unallocated. At 30 June 2015 and 2014, these comprise cash 
and cash equivalents, short-term investments, tax-related and other assets or liabilities. 
Consolidation adjustments relate to the elimination of inter-segment revenues at arm’s length prices, balances and investments in group 
subsidiaries required on consolidation.

Information about products/services
The Group’s operating segments are business units that provide different products and services. The breakdown of revenue from external 
customers for each type of service is therefore the same as the segmental analysis above.
Information about geographical area
All business activities are located within the UK.
Information about major customers
The Group does not rely on any individual customer.

Operating profit has been arrived at after charging:
In the prior year there was a £39,000 overrun on the audit fees which was subsequently recognised as an expense in the year to 30 June 2015 but 
not included in the fees above. The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have not received any remuneration for non-audit services of any kind. 85 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
The staff costs above are after stripping out costs that have been capitalised under intangible assets as assets under construction.
The Group aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre employees by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, which may 
be linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value. Salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market 
generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills. All employees are eligible to be considered for an annual discretionary 
bonus. In addition to cash bonuses, the Group operates various share-based remuneration schemes as described in Note 25. Other pension costs 
relate wholly to defined contribution schemes.

Factors affecting tax charge for the year
It is expected that the ongoing effective tax rate will remain at a rate approximating to the standard UK corporation tax rate in the medium term.  
The standard UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 20% (from 21%) on 1 April 2015 and accordingly the Group’s profits for this accounting period 
are taxed at an effective rate of 20.75%. Deferred tax has been recognised at 20%, being the rate substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.  
A deferred tax asset in respect of future share option deductions has been recognised based on the Company’s share price as at 30 June 2015.

In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, certain tax amounts have been charged or (credited) directly to equity as follows:

After the balance sheet date, the directors declared a second interim (final) ordinary dividend of 14.30 pence per share and a special dividend 
of 11.40 pence per share payable on 30 September 2015 to shareholders on the register on 18 September 2015. Dividends are required to be 
recognised in the financial statements when paid, and accordingly the declared dividend amounts are not recognised in these financial statements,

The net carrying value of goodwill relates entirely to the acquisition of Hargreaves Lansdown Pensions Direct Limited (HLPD) now named Hargreaves 
Lansdown Advisory Services Limited (HLAS).
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The Group has 
prepared financial forecasts for the business for the period to June 2018 which show that the Group as a whole will remain highly profitable and cash 
generative. Within the forecast, the revenue streams which belong to HLAS, although lower than before the restructuring, are forecast to grow with 
the company continuing to be profitable. HLAS is profit-making (profit before tax for year ended 30 June 2015 was £3.4 million) and has a net assets 
position as at 30 June 2015 of £7.8 million, therefore the directors see no reason to impair the value of goodwill and continue to hold it at its carrying 
amount.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 1,010,928 
at 30 June 2015 (2014: 179,414).

Assets under construction are primarily internally generated being IT development staff working on an upgrade of the core IT platform for the business. 
The internally generated intangible asset under construction is an ongoing project and whilst the system is still being developed to allow it to handle 
current transactions, tranches of archived information have been transferred across to the new system and therefore amortisation has started despite 
development work being ongoing.

disposal of the investment.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
17. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. In accordance with market practice and IFRS, certain 
balances with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties totalling £363.2 million (2014: £242.9 million) are included in trade 
receivables. These balances are presented net where there is a legal right of offset and the ability and intention to settle net. The gross amount of 
trade receivables is £457.1 million and the gross amount offset in the balance sheet with trade payables is £93.9 million. Other than counterparty 
balances, trade receivables primarily consist of fees and amounts owed by clients and renewal commission owed by fund management groups. 91 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits held by the Group that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash. 
The carrying amount of these assets is approximately equal to their fair value.  
At 30 June 2015 segregated deposit amounts held by the Group on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority amounted to £5,499 million (2014: £4,109 million). The client retains the beneficial interest in these deposits and accordingly 
they are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.

Other payables principally comprise amounts owed to clients as a loyalty bonus and to staff as a bonus. Accruals and deferred income principally comprise 
amounts outstanding for trade purchases and revenue received but not yet earned on group pension schemes where an ongoing service is still being provided. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The provision on property-related costs represents the Group’s future committed lease payments on non-cancellable leases and other contractual 
obligations that arise on the surrendering of operating leases. These property provisions are not expected to be fully utilised until 2026.

25. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by employees, principally through schemes which encourage and assist the purchase of 
the Company’s shares.  
The Group operates four share option and share award plans: the Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”), the Hargreaves 
Lansdown plc Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), the Hargreaves Lansdown Company Share Option Scheme (the “Executive Option Scheme”) and the 
Hargreaves Lansdown Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”).
Awards granted under the Employee SAYE scheme vest over five years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Incentive Plan vest over a three-
year period. Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme vest between nil and a maximum of ten years. Options are exercisable at a price 
equal to the market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. There are currently no performance conditions attached to any options 
granted under any of the schemes, although options are forfeited (in most circumstances) if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.  
Interests in shares purchased under the JSOP were granted at under market value, with tax and National Insurance being paid on the difference.  
The shares must be held for a minimum of three years under the terms of the Deeds and are realisable in only very limited circumstances before 
that date. There are no performance conditions attached to the shares. 95 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
The weighted average market share price at the date of exercise for options exercised during the year was 1,156.16 pence (2014: 1,129.73 pence).

25. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (CONTINUED)
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year ended 30 June 2015 and the year ended 30 June 2014 has been estimated by 
the Black-Scholes methodology and the principal assumptions required by the methodology were as follows:

Risk-free rate 1.29% 1.28%
Expected life 4.1 years 3.8 years
The expected volatility   
The expected Hargreaves Lansdown Plc share price volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price since 
flotation in May 2007.
Prior to 15 May 2007 the Company’s shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore no readily available market price existed for the 
shares. The share price of share option awards granted prior to 15 May 2007 were based on the latest market value agreed with HM Revenue 
& Customs using an earnings multiples approach based on comparable quoted companies. Similarly, share price volatility was estimated as the 
average of the volatility experienced by a comparable group of quoted companies. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Since 15 May 2007, a 
quoted market price has been available for the Company’s shares. 
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in Note 7.
26. EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE
On 9 September 2015 the directors proposed a second interim ordinary dividend payment of 14.30 pence per ordinary share and a special dividend 
of 11.40 pence per ordinary share, payable on 30 September 2015 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 September 2015 
as detailed in Note 10. 
As mentioned in the Chief Executive’s Review, two deals have been signed with third party companies who wish to transfer their books of business 
to Hargreaves Lansdown post year-end. In total the deals could mean an additional 12,000 clients and £430 million of assets transfer across to the 
Vantage platform in the autumn of 2015 after the date of approval of the Report and Financial Statements.

27. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, and with its directors and members of the Executive Committee (the “key 
management personnel”). Transactions between the Company and its key management personnel are disclosed below. Details of transactions 
between the Company and other related parties are also disclosed below.      
Trading transactions
The Company entered into the following transactions with directors within the Hargreaves Lansdown Group and related parties who are not 
members of the Group:
During the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 the Company has been party to a lease with P K Hargreaves, a director until 14 April 2015, 
for rental of the old head office premises at Kendal House. A ten-year lease was signed on 6 April 2011 for a rental of part of the building, to be used 
for disaster recovery purposes at a market rate rent of £105,000 per annum. No amount was outstanding at either year-end. 
During the year the Company settled certain personal expenses on behalf of one director, all of which were subject to subsequent reimbursement 
from the director. At the year end the amount outstanding was £nil (2014: £4,999). 
On 7 November 2014, the Group agreed to purchase 30 shares in its subsidiary, Library Information Services Ltd (LIS), in an arm’s length transaction; 
increasing the Group’s share-holding from 75% to 78%. The shares were purchased from Stuart Louden the founder director of LIS and currently 
the only other shareholder, who is an employee of Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Limited. The price paid per share was £35,405. 
There is no readily available market for these shares and hence a valuation was arrived at based on a multiple of operating profit. The directors of 
Hargreaves Lansdown plc deemed this to be a fair price in the circumstances. The total amount paid was £1,062,150 and this was settled in cash on 
17 December 2014. 
During the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 the Group has provided a range of investment services in the normal course of business to 
shareholders on normal third party business terms. Directors and staff are eligible for a slight discount on some of the services provided.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 100 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
28. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
(a)  Financial risk management
 Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset listed and unlisted investments.  
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables. The main risks arising from financial instruments are market risk 
(including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk), liquidity risk, and credit risk. Each of these risks is discussed in detail below. 
 The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis. Hargreaves Lansdown’s financial risk management is based upon sound economic 
objectives and good corporate practice. No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented. The Group has designed a 
framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed 
company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board. 
(b)  Market risk
–  Interest rate risk
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest-bearing assets. There is an exposure to 
interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. At 30 June 2015 the value of financial instruments on the Group 
balance sheet exposed to interest rate risk was £216.75 million (2014: £201.24 million) comprising cash and cash equivalents. A 50bps (0.5%) 
move in interest rates, in isolation, would impact investment income by c. £0.9 million per annum. This impact, after taking into account the 
corresponding increase/decrease in the Group’s tax charge, would lead to a change in retained profit for the year. This exposure is continually 
monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints. The Group has 
no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings. Cash at bank earns interest at floating 
rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 13 months depending 
on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective fixed term deposit rates.  
 As a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on 
cash balances held for clients. These balances are not on the Group balance sheet but amounted to £5,392million (2014: £4,045 million). 
–  Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk
 Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates. With substantially 
all of the Group’s businesses located within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in foreign 
currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any foreign 
current assets or liabilities. The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure. 
Given the limited nature of transactions and assets involving foreign currencies no sensitivity analysis has been conducted as the impact would 
be minimal.
–  Price risk
 Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not meeting 
its expected value. The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group balance sheet. At 30 June 2015, the fair 
value of investments recognised on the Group balance sheet was £909,000 (2014: £874,000). A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, 
would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
 As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to security price 
risk on investments held for clients. These assets are not on the Group balance sheet. The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset 
class diversification. The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks, and so 
the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
 In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its 
exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails 
to fulfil its obligations. The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls.
 (c) Liquidity risk
 The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. The Group is 
highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets. The Group actively maintains a proportion of cash balances on short-term deposit to 
ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.

(d) Credit risk
 The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as credit exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.  
 Within the Group’s Stockbroking operation, the Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the period 
between the trade date and the settlement date. This period is generally three business days. The Group has credit exposure that extends 
beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities. These transactions are with 
financial institutions and clients. Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby, if a 
counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty. In that instance, the securities could be sold in 
the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of delivery versus payment 
trade debtors. As a result, the risk exposure is effectively to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and settlement.  
 Other credit risk within the Group is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the majority represents balances due from other 
regulated financial institutions where there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and institution. Credit risk is therefore considered to 
be limited. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made 
where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
 Cash is held with UK banks. The credit risk on liquid funds is minimised because the counterparties are banks with strong credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management and selection of banking 
counterparties, and carries out regular reviews of all its banks’ and custodians’ credit ratings.    
 As at the balance sheet date, no financial assets were individually determined to be impaired.

Capital management
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a strong capital base. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are i) to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; ii) to maintain a strong 
capital base and utilise it efficiently to support the development of its business; and iii) to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by 
the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group’s management and Board. 
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive prescribed in the UK by the FCA. The 
Directive requires continual assessment of the Group’s risks in order to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 (Minimum Capital Requirements) and Pillar 
2 (Supervisory Review) requirements is met. 
Pillar 2 requires firms to assess firm-specific risks not covered by the formulaic requirements of Pillar 1 and, where necessary, maintain additional 
capital - the objective being to ensure that the regulated firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks. The Group completes 
its assessment of regulatory capital requirements using its Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) under Pillar 2, which is a 
forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major risks, such as a significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action. The 
ICAAP covers current as well as projected capital requirements, and is used to manage regulatory capital. 
Surplus regulatory capital was maintained throughout the year at both a consolidated Group level, as well as at an individual regulated entity level. 
Under the requirements of Pillar 3 (Disclosure), the Group is required to disclose regulatory capital information, and has done so by making the 
disclosures available in the Group’s website at http://www.hl.co.uk/investor-relations/pillar-3-disclosures.  
  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 104 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015
29. INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
The Group has determined that investment funds that it manages are structured entities. Structured entities include entities that are designed so 
that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the relevant activities are directed by 
means of a contractual relationship. As the Group directs the investing activities of the eight Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-Manager funds through its 
investment management agreements with them, it considers them to be structured entities. The Group holds interests in these funds through the 
receipt of management fees, together with ownership interests that it holds. Investments in the funds have been designated at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL). 
Where the Group has an equity holding in the funds, the maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees should the market value of 
the funds decrease, plus the fair value of the Group’s investment in that fund.
Structured entities with direct holdings
Direct investments in structured entities relate to box positions held by Hargreaves Lansdown Fund Managers Ltd and through portfolios held in 
Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Ltd which mimic holdings in the Portfolio Management Service and HL Portfolio+.
The table below shows the details of unconsolidated structured entities in which the group has direct holdings as at 30 June 2015.

Chairman’s
Statement
investment for future growth
We have made significant progress this year in developing the 
Group’s business through both investment and the effective 
execution of the Group’s consistent and proven strategy. The 
robust financial performance this year and the continuing 
strength of the balance sheet and cash flow provide 
confidence in the Group’s long term prospects.
After several years of strong underlying growth, the focus 
this year has been on the Group’s Investment for Growth 
programme, through which significant investments are 
being made across the Group’s businesses to establish a 
firm foundation for the next phase of future growth. The 
investment programme started last year and by 30 September 
2013 the Group had invested £4.4m in modern, enlarged 
facilities and new and efficient information systems. Additional 
senior management to strengthen the Group’s corporate 
development resources have added a further £1.1m to 
annual operating costs. This investment programme will be 
concluded during the next financial year and details of the key 
programme elements, together with an indication of the likely 
benefits that will flow to the Group over the coming years, 
are described later in this Report. 
Acquisitions remain an integral part of the Group’s growth 
strategy and we continue to see a promising pipeline of 
opportunities. Our strong track record for acquiring good 
quality businesses, investing in them and delivering value is 
founded on a disciplined approach to acquisitions. This year, 
uncertainties about future economic prospects have made 
vendors cautious and transaction processes have been 
lengthened. With an improving acquisition environment and 
additional corporate development resources in place, the 
Board remains confident that 2014 will be a successful year 
for converting opportunities into good value-enhancing 
acquisitions.
After the year end on 5 November 2013, contracts were 
signed for the acquisition of 80% of Kentek Oy, based in 
Finland, for a maximum consideration of £11.2m, extending 
the Seals businesses into new and emerging markets.
Results
Group revenue increased in 2013 by 10% to £285.5m (2012: 
£260.2m) driven by a strong performance from the Life 
Sciences businesses and benefiting from the contribution 
from acquisitions completed last year. The Seals businesses 
delivered modest underlying growth against strong prior 
year comparatives, while the Controls businesses reported 
a decline in underlying revenues given the difficult trading 
conditions in Europe, particularly in the first half of the year.

Strategic Report
Underlying Group revenues increased by 4%, after adjusting 
for the additional net contribution from acquisitions, the 
divestment last year of a small business in Switzerland and for 
currency movements on the translation of overseas results.
As anticipated, adjusted operating margins reduced to 19.0% 
(2012: 20.3%) from the record levels reported last year, largely 
reflecting the impact on operating costs of investing in the 
businesses. Adjusted operating profit increased by 3% to 
£54.3m (2012: £52.8m). 
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% to £54.3m (2012: 
£52.6m) and adjusted earnings per share, helped by a lower 
effective tax rate, increased by 5% to 34.8p (2012: 33.1p).
The Group continued to generate strong cash flow of £31.6m 
(2012: £32.7m), after both increasing capital investment in the 
businesses to £4.6m (2012: £3.5m) and making an exceptional 
cash contribution of £4.7m (2012: £Nil) to the Group’s 
Employee Benefit Trust. 
During the year, £17.4m (2012: £14.2m) was distributed to 
shareholders as dividends and with a much lower expenditure 
on acquisitions of £2.2m (2012: £22.3m), the Group’s net cash 
funds increased by £11.4m to £19.3m at 30 September 2013. 
Dividends
The strong balance sheet and free cash flow, supported by 
a solid set of results has led the Board to recommend an 
increase in the final dividend of 5% to 10.7p per share (2012: 
10.2p). Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 22 January 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at 29 November 2013. 
The total dividend per share for the year will be 15.7p which 
represents a 9% increase on 2012. The dividend is well covered 
by adjusted EPS at 2.2 times, in line with our objective of 
targeting towards a two times level of cover. 
Board development
I am very pleased with the progress we have made this year in 
developing and refreshing the Board and its Committees. This 
process started some 18 months ago following the Company’s 
admission to the FTSE 250 index. In November 2012, we 
welcomed Marie-Louise Clayton to the Board as a non-
Executive Director and I was delighted that John Nicholas and 
Charles Packshaw agreed to join the Board as non-Executive 
Directors in June 2013. These changes were in part brought 
about by the decision of John Matthews and Ian Grice to retire 
from the Board, having served as independent Directors for 
many years. During their tenure they have guided the 
Company through a period of significant growth and 
development and I am very grateful to both John and Ian for 
their wise counsel and for their substantial contribution to the 
success of the Group. 
I am confident that the refreshed Board has the right balance 
of skills, experience, capabilities, independence, diversity and 
knowledge required to lead the Company forward during its 
next stage of development. 
Employees
It is important to thank all our employees whose tremendous 
hard work has been a driving force behind our performance. 
Diploma is very much a people business and success is always 
a team effort. We continue to foster an entrepreneurial culture 
within our businesses which encourages all our staff to take 
responsibility for their own businesses. 
 
o utlook
The Group has a resilient business model with a good 
geographic spread of businesses, supported by a strong 
balance sheet and cash flow. We have made significant 
investments in the business this year, providing the resources 
and capacity to support our future growth in key markets and 
improve our ability to target and develop acquisitions.
Looking ahead, the investments we have made provide a 
strong platform for growth and the Board is confident that 
the Group will make further progress this year.

Our Business Model
The Group comprises a number of high 
quality, specialised businesses which design 
their individual business models to make 
them essential to their customers.
Our businesses focus on supplying 
essential products and services funded by 
customers’ operating rather than capital 
budgets and supplied across a range of 
specialised industry segments.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are 
generated from consumable products. 
In many cases, the products will be used  
in repair and maintenance applications 
and refurbishment and upgrade 
programmes, rather than supplied to 
original equipment manufacturers.
These characteristics all contribute to the 
Group’s record of stable revenue growth 
over the business cycle.
Our businesses design their individual 
business models to provide solutions 
which closely meet the requirements 
of their customers. 
The solutions can be in the form of:
•	 Highly responsive customer service, 
such as the next day delivery from stock 
of essential, but low value items;
•	 Deep technical support, where we 
work closely with our customers in 
designing our products into their 
specific applications;
•	 Added value services which, if we did 
not provide these services, customers 
would have to pay others to provide 
them or would require them to invest in 
additional resources of their own.
By supplying solutions, not just products, 
we build strong long term relationships with 
our customers and suppliers, supporting 
sustainable and attractive margins.
We encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture across our businesses, through 
a decentralised management structure. 
We want the managers to feel that they 
have the freedom to run their own 
businesses, while being able to draw upon 
the support and resources of a larger 
group where this is beneficial.
Within our businesses we have strong, 
self-standing management teams who are 
committed to and rewarded according to 
the success of their businesses. This 
ensures that decisions are made close to 
the customer and that the businesses are 
agile and responsive to changes in the 
market and the competitive environment.

Our Growth Strategy
The main focus this year has 
been on the “Build” phase of 
our growth strategy. 
investment in Facilities
£3.6m of capital and revenue cost 
is being invested in modern and 
expanded facilities. By the end of 
2013, four of five planned business 
moves had been successfully

been successfully completed. The 
final project will be rolled out to the 
Canadian Healthcare businesses 
through 2014.
investment in management
Investment is being made in 
additional senior managers at the 
Group’s Head Office and in the 
major businesses to strengthen the 
corporate development resources. 
These additional managers are all 
now in place and add ca. £1.2m to 
annual operating costs.
The Group’s “Acquire, Build, Grow” strategy is designed 
to deliver strong, double-digit growth by building larger, 
broader-based businesses in the three Group sectors.
The focus this year has been on the “Build” phase of the 
strategy through the Group’s “Investment for Growth” 
programme. This comprises a series of specific investments 
designed to provide the foundation for the next phase of 
the Group’s growth.

Review
Principal corporate objectives
achieve double digit growth in adjusted EpS over 
the business cycle
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”), measured over the 
business cycle, provides an absolute benchmark of the 
Company’s performance. Over the last five years, adjusted 
EPS has grown at a compound growth rate of 17% p.a. 
through a combination of steady organic growth and 
carefully targeted acquisitions.
Generate TSR growth in the upper quartile of the FTSE 250 
Total shareholder return (“TSR”) is the growth in value of a 
share plus the value of dividends reinvested in the Company’s 
shares on the day on which they are paid. This is measured 
against the TSR growth of the FTSE mid-250 index (excluding 
investment trusts) (“FTSE 250”). The last five years have seen 
a compound TSR growth for Diploma of 39% p.a., which 
represents upper quartile performance as compared with 
the FTSE 250, where median TSR growth has been 18% p.a. 
Deliver progressive dividend growth with two times 
dividend cover
Diploma follows a progressive dividend policy with a target 
cover of two times on an adjusted EPS basis. Over the last five 
years, dividends have steadily grown at the rate of 16% p.a. and 
this continues the trend of increasing dividends in each of the 
last 14 years. 
“ Over five years, compound 
growth rates for adjusted EPS 
and TSR have been 17% p.a. 
and 39% p.a. respectively.” 09 Strategic Report

Our Year

Business model and growth strategy
The Group’s strategy is designed to generate strong, double-
digit growth in earnings and value over the business cycle, by 
building larger, broader-based businesses in the three Group 
Sectors of Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. 
Our businesses target organic revenue growth over the business 
cycle at the rate of 5–6% p.a. (“GDP plus” growth). Stable and 
resilient revenue growth is achieved through our focus on 
essential products and services funded by customers’ operating 
rather than capital budgets and supplied across a range of 
specialised industry segments. By supplying essential solutions, 
not just products, we build strong long term relationships with 
our customers and suppliers, which support sustainable and 
attractive margins. Finally we encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture in our businesses through our decentralised 
management structure and these essential values ensure 
that decisions are made close to the customer and that the 
businesses are agile and responsive to changes in the market 
and the competitive environment. 
Overall growth is accelerated from the underlying GDP plus 
levels to the strong, double-digit level through carefully 
selected, value-enhancing acquisitions which fit the business 
model and offer entry into new strategic markets. Acquisitions 
are not made just to add revenue and profit, but rather we are 
looking for successful businesses which have growth potential, 
capable management and a good track record of profitable 
growth and cash generation. 
As part of our Acquire, Build, Grow strategy, we invest in the 
businesses post acquisition to build a firm foundation to allow 
them to move to a new level of growth. These acquisitions 
form a critical part of our Sector growth strategies and are 
designed to generate a pre-tax return on investment of at least 
20% and hence support our Group objective of consistently 
exceeding 20% return on trading capital employed (“ROTCE”).
The Group has delivered another year of growth, albeit at a 
lower level than previous years.  The main focus this year has 
been on the Investment for Growth programme to ensure that 
following the strong growth in recent years, we continue to 
have the right platform in place to support the future growth 
of the business. Whilst our pipeline of opportunities remains 
promising, we have seen more modest acquisition activity this 
year as transaction processes have lengthened in the current 
macroeconomic environment.
performance against Kpis
Growth in the year against the principal corporate objectives 
of adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) and total shareholder 
return (“TSR”) has been 5% and 42% respectively. Over a five 
year period, compound growth rates for EPS and TSR have 
been 17% p.a. and 39% p.a. respectively. 
This year, the Group increased revenues by 10% over the prior 
year with underlying revenue growth of 4% after adjusting for 
currency effects, acquisitions and a small divestment in 2012. 
Underlying growth rates strengthened from 2% in the first half 
of the year to 6% in the second half, trending towards GDP 
plus levels of growth as prior year comparatives became less 
challenging. The Group continues to benefit from its broad 
spread of businesses and geography, with the Life Sciences 
businesses growing strongly and more than offsetting the small 
decline in underlying revenues in Controls, largely caused by the 
challenging trading conditions in Europe. The Seals businesses, 
which in recent years have acted as the principal driver for the 
Group’s growth, showed modest underlying growth this year 
against very strong comparatives. 
“ The main focus this year has 
been the Group’s Investment 
for Growth programme.”

Strategic Report
Adjusted operating margins reduced to 19% this year from the 
record 20% plus levels of last year reflecting the impact on 
operating costs of investing in the businesses. There will be 
benefits resulting from these investments in terms of greater 
operating efficiencies and improved management of working 
capital, which should start to make a positive impact in the 
second half of 2014. Against this, new acquisitions brought into 
the Group are likely to join with initial operating margins below 
the Group average.
The level of acquisition spend this year of £2.2m is well below 
the five year average of ca. £15m p.a. and a current target of 
£25m plus. The uncertainty over future economic prospects 
has made vendors very cautious and has resulted in 
lengthening transaction processes and delayed completions. 
With an improving acquisition environment and additional 
corporate development resources in place, prospects for 2014 
are more encouraging. 
The Group continued to generate strong free cash flow, which 
at £31.6m was still close to last year’s level of £32.7m. This was 
after an exceptional £4.7m cash contribution this year to fund 
the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust and £4.6m of capital 
expenditure, which was up £1.1m from the prior year. Free 
cash flow as a percentage of adjusted profit after tax (free cash 
flow conversion) was 80% compared with the five year average 
of ca. 95%. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 
16.7% compared with the five year average of 16.5%. 
Return on trading capital employed or ROTCE is the final 
indicator of the overall performance of the Group and very 
importantly its success in creating value for shareholders. 
ROTCE is measured as the pre-tax return on total Group 
investment excluding net cash funds, but including all goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets. ROTCE has exceeded the 20% 
target in each of the last five years and this year was 25.8%.
 
investment for Growth
The Investment for Growth programme comprises a series 
of specific investments designed to provide the foundation 
for the next phase of the Group’s growth. Major investments 
are being made in modern and expanded facilities, powerful 
and efficient new information technology (“IT”) systems and 
additional senior management to strengthen corporate 
development resources. 
By the end of the 2013 financial year, £4.4m of the 
programme’s planned investment of £5.3m in new facilities 
and IT infrastructure had been invested, with ca. £0.9m still 
to be invested in 2014. The benefits resulting from these 
investments in facilities and ERP systems should start to impact 
in the second half of 2014, delivering greater operating 
efficiencies and improved management of working capital.
To date, £3.4m has been invested in major facility moves. In 
2012, two of the Industrial OEM Seals businesses, RT Dygert 
and All Seals moved to new facilities. This year the Vantage 
business in Canada and the IS-Rayfast business in the UK 
completed major relocations into new larger facilities in 
Markham, Ontario in Canada and Swindon in the UK 
respectively. After the year end, the Hercules business in Barrie, 
Ontario completed a move to a new custom built facility. 
All moves have been successfully completed with minimal 
disruption to the businesses. The new facilities not only provide 
an appropriate environment for modern, technically biased 
companies, but also substantial capacity for future growth. 
A further £1.0m has been invested in powerful new ERP 
systems to improve the IT infrastructure. During the year, 
major new ERP systems were implemented by M Seals across 
its three locations in Denmark, Sweden and China, by Hawco 
in its principal UK operation and by a1-envirosciences in 
Germany. A major new ERP project has also been initiated by 
the Healthcare businesses in Canada, with implementation 
starting in Somagen during the second half of 2013 and plans 
to roll out the system across the other businesses through the 
2014 financial year.

The Life Sciences businesses increased revenues by 19%, 
which included a full year contribution from the DSL business 
in Australia, acquired in June 2012. After adjusting for this 
acquisition, for currency effects and for a minor reshaping of 
the Environmental businesses, underlying revenues in Life 
Sciences increased by 15%. 
Adjusted operating profit increased by 16% and adjusted 
operating margins reduced by 60bps to 22.4%. In the 
Healthcare businesses, there was some weakening in gross 
margins towards the end of the year, caused by the weakening 
of the Canadian and Australian exchange rates, relative to the 
US dollar. The implementation of the Investment for Growth 
programme during the year also impacted Healthcare 
operating margins but this was partly offset by an 
improvement in Environmental margins. 
The DHG group of Healthcare businesses in Canada and 
Australia account for ca. 85% of Life Sciences revenues. 
The DHG business model is to build strong market positions 
in growing niche healthcare markets. Products are sourced 
from high quality medical device manufacturers under the 
terms of long term exclusive distribution agreements. Full 
service solutions are provided by highly qualified DHG 
technical sales and product application staff, working closely

Investment has also been made in additional senior managers 
at the Group’s Head Office and in the major businesses 
to strengthen corporate development resources. These 
additional managers are all now in place and have added 
ca. £1.1m to annual operating costs this year.
Outside the Investment for Growth programme, there has 
been further investment within the businesses to strengthen 
sales and business development resources and in regional 
management. These additional resources are designed to give 
the strong leadership required to extend the businesses into 
new areas and develop acquisition opportunities.
acquisitions 
Acquisitions remain an integral part of the Board’s strategy, but 
this has been a frustrating year for completing acquisitions, as 
the general economic uncertainty has contributed to increased 
caution from vendors and lengthened transaction processes. 
During the past ten years the Group has experienced similar 
challenging periods for completing acquisitions and therefore 
is prepared to wait until the environment improves, rather 
than compromise the quality of acquisitions and risk diluting 
shareholder value.
As confidence builds and the prospects for the global 
economy improve, there are signs that the acquisition 
environment is now improving. With the investments made 
this year in additional corporate development resources, the 
scope of the acquisition programme has broadened and the 
acquisition pipeline has strengthened. 
Following the year end, in early November contracts were 
signed for the acquisition of 80% of Kentek Oy for a maximum 
consideration of £11.2m (€13.3m). Kentek is a specialised 
distributor of filters and related products, used in heavy mobile 
machinery and industrial equipment applications. Kentek is 
based in Finland with operations in Russia and the Baltic States 
and will extend the reach of the Seals businesses into new and 
emerging markets. 
This transaction is expected to close in January 2014 with 
completion conditional upon certain conditions precedent. 
These conditions include the approval of the Russian 
competition authorities, no material adverse change and 
warranties to be repeated at closing. 
Sector developments
Good progress was made in the year in further developing the 
Group’s strategy in each of the three business Sectors and the 
key developments this year are summarised below. 13

with the surgeons, operating room nurses and laboratory 
technologists. A large proportion of revenues (ca. 70%) 
are secured under multi-year customer contracts.
In Canada, the Somagen and AMT businesses continued to 
grow steadily in their core markets of Clinical Diagnostics 
and Electrosurgery. The principal drivers of growth this year 
however, have been the two newer businesses, Vantage and 
AMT’s Minimally Invasive (“MI”) Surgery business. Vantage has 
benefited from prior year investments to establish it as a strong 
independent business within DHG, focused on the growing 
GI Endoscopy market. Vantage started the current financial 
year with a complete product range, an integrated and fully 
trained sales team and strengthened operational and service 
management. Vantage has performed strongly this year with 
steadily growing sales of consumable and service products 
boosted by strong capital equipment sales and CPP (cost per 
procedure) based contracts.
AMT’s new MI Surgery business also benefited from prior 
year investments in securing a strong portfolio of products, 
negotiating long term supplier agreements and in building a 
focused sales team. The business supplies products ranging 
from surgical instruments used in standard laparoscopic 
procedures to leading edge interventional radiology and 
oncology products for use in the treatment of cancer and cancer 
related conditions. This year has seen a substantial increase in 
revenues from this new business area.
In Australia, DSL in its first full year in the Group, delivered a 
step change increase in revenues from the addition of a major 
new supplier (also a key supplier to Somagen) shortly after 
acquisition. BGS also continued to penetrate the market with 
its smoke evacuation products while maintaining steady 
growth in sales of its core electrosurgical grounding pads and 
laparoscopic electrodes. During the year, senior management 
in Australia was strengthened at country level and the BGS 
operations and back office functions were successfully 
relocated and integrated into the DSL facility in Melbourne. 
The DSL and BGS businesses continue to operate as clear 
separate sales and marketing businesses, but will now 
benefit from the efficiencies and critical mass of a central 
services group.
The remaining ca. 15% of Life Sciences revenues are generated 
by the Group’s Environmental businesses in Europe, which 
supply a range of products used in Environmental testing and 
Health & Safety applications. Following various initiatives in 
recent years to reshape and refocus the businesses, both 
a1-envirosciences and a1-CBISS delivered double digit growth 
this year and an improvement in operating margins.

The Seals businesses increased revenues by 6% including a full 
year contribution from J Royal, which had been acquired in 
December 2011. After adjusting for the additional contribution 
from this acquisition and for currency translation effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 2%. 
Adjusted operating profits decreased by 4% and operating 
margins reduced by 200bps to 18.4% of revenue, reflecting 
the impact of investment in the Seals businesses, including 
the Group’s Investment for Growth programme begun last 
year. Aftermarket gross margins continued to be resilient, 
underpinned by essential product availability and added 
value technical service, though overall, Seals gross margins 
weakened slightly with continued competition in the Industrial 
OEM markets.
The Aftermarket businesses account for ca. 55% of Seals 
revenues and supply own-branded sealing products used in 
a broad range of heavy mobile machinery applications. The 
products are generally supplied from inventory on a next day 
delivery basis and are used in the repair and maintenance 
of equipment after it has completed its initial warranty or 
lease term.

In North America, the Aftermarket businesses have 
consistently out-performed the relevant construction indices 
and have posted strong growth rates since emerging from the 
2009 downturn. This year, the businesses have consolidated 
their market share gains and are now moving to more normal 
GDP plus growth rates. Hercules Bulldog has made a number 
of investments during the year to reinforce its market leading 
levels of service. During the year, over 3,000 new kit 
applications were developed and additional revenues were 
generated from sales of new parts. 
The business continued to develop its electronic trading 
capabilities (“Webstore”) with new search and find capabilities, 
allowing the business to develop new sales channels to retail 
customers, as well as converting existing customers to online 
ordering. Online sales increased this year by over 30% and 
now represent 15% of revenues. The business also installed its 
third seal machining centre and added technical staff and 
development engineers to broaden the product range offered 
to customers. 
In Europe, FPE took operational responsibility for the Hercules 
Europe operation in the Netherlands, which will now provide 
the impetus to develop a more substantial, unified European 
Aftermarket group. The FPE group delivered another year 
of good revenue growth and installed an additional seal 
machining centre to complement the two existing machines.
“ Good progress has been 
made in the year in further 
developing the Group in 
each of the three business 
Sectors.”

The Industrial OEM businesses account for ca. 45% of Seals 
revenues and supply seals, O-rings and custom moulded 
and machined parts used in a range of specialised industrial 
equipment. The businesses work closely with the Industrial 
OEM customers to specify the most appropriate sealing 
material, design and manufacturer for the application. Once 
the product is designed in to the application, the businesses 
supply the sealing products and provide the necessary 
logistical and technical support, in most cases for the lifetime 
of the product.
In North America, the Industrial OEM businesses have 
continued to operate in an industrial economy which has 
shown slow steady growth since emerging from the 2009 
recession. The HFPG businesses have broadly grown with the 
market, with a stable level of demand from existing customers 
and a steady stream of new projects offsetting any business 
lost. In an increasingly competitive market for the more 
standard products, the RT Dygert business has enhanced its 
product offering through new compound certifications for 
a variety of applications, which allows it to meet the more 
stringent demands of customers and to move up the value 
chain. The J Royal and All Seals businesses have invested in 
additional technical sales resource and a new water jet gasket 
cutting machine to generate growth. All Seals has also 
obtained the AS9100 quality certification which strengthens 
its position in the Aerospace and Medical products industries.
In Europe, M Seals delivered good overall growth in its core 
Scandinavian markets which more than offset the slowing 
demand for its wind turbine seals in China. The new ERP 
system implemented this year will provide a solid platform for 
growth and more efficient management of inventory across 
the three country locations.
The acquisition of Kentek Oy will extend the reach of the 
Seals businesses into new and emerging markets. Kentek 
is a specialised distributor of filters and related products, 
based in Finland, but with 75% of revenues generated by its 
operations in Russia and the Baltic States. Kentek supplies its 
products to similar heavy mobile machinery applications as 
the Aftermarket Seals businesses, but Kentek also has a good 
proportion of its revenues in the Oil & Gas and Mining sectors, 
where the Seals businesses currently have limited involvement.

The Controls businesses increased revenues in 2013 by 5%, 
benefiting from both the acquisition in November 2012 of a 
small energy distributor based in Germany and from a full year 
contribution from Abbeychart and Amfast, acquired respectively 
in March and May 2012. After adjusting for the additional 
contribution from these acquisitions and for modest currency 
translation effects, underlying revenues decreased by 3%. 
Over 90% of Controls revenues are generated in Europe and 
the background trading conditions during the year have been 
very challenging, reflecting the economies in the principal 
markets of the UK and Germany.
Operating profits decreased by 3% and operating margins 
reduced by 150bps to 16.1%. The reduced operating margins 
resulted from the reduction in underlying revenues, combined 
with increased costs following the major relocation of the 
IS-Rayfast business in the UK and the ERP investment at 
Hawco. Overall gross margins in the Controls Sector remained 
resilient as the businesses continued to focus on specialised 
markets and added value opportunities.
The Interconnect businesses account for ca. 70% of Controls 
revenues and supply high performance wiring, connectors 
and harness components, fasteners and control devices 
along with a range of value-added services. The products are 
used in technically demanding applications and often harsh 
environments in industries including Aerospace, Defence, 
Motorsport, Energy, Medical and Industrial.  
In the first quarter of this year, IS-Rayfast completed its 
relocation from the site it had occupied since 1992 into a 
newly refurbished 37,000 sq.ft facility nearby in Swindon. The 
facility now accommodates the core IS-Rayfast business and 
acts as the central management and operational hub for the 
IS-Group businesses in the UK. 
Amfast had an excellent first year in the Group and 
consolidated its position within the Civil Aerospace sector 
as a leading supplier to the premium aircraft seating and cabin 
interior market. Later in the year, Amfast’s sales and customer 
service functions were fully integrated into Clarendon’s sales 
operation in Leicester and warehousing operations were 
combined with those of Clarendon at the new Swindon site. 
Clarendon and Amfast together now form a single fastener 
products group supplying principally to the Aerospace and 
Motorsport markets in Europe, but also with potential to 
expand into other industrial sectors and geographies.
Early in the year, the acquisition was completed of Rayquick, 
a small German distributor focused on the Energy market in 
Germany. Rayquick was successfully integrated into Sommer 
and has helped Sommer to secure its appointment as a 
German Master Distributor for its key energy products supplier. 
Sommer and Rayquick are now well positioned to benefit 
when a more normal cycle resumes in the repair and 
refurbishment of the local transmission networks.
The Fluid Control businesses account for ca. 30% of Controls 
revenues and supply a range of fluid control products used 
broadly in the Food and Beverage industry. Products are 
used in a range of applications including food retailing and 
transportation, catering equipment, vending machines, 
coffee brewing, pure water and water cooling systems.
The Hawco group businesses faced significant headwinds this 
year in challenging market conditions in the UK. Major food 
retailers continued to focus on smaller convenience stores 
which require less Hawco equipment and commercial 
catering equipment customers were overstocked with surplus 
equipment after the Olympics in London. There were also 
slowdowns in demand from a number of Abbeychart’s 
vending, water filter and catering customers, but the coffee 
brewing sector remained buoyant. 
During the year, the Hawco group made a significant 
investment in a new ERP system, which was successfully 
implemented at Hawco’s operations in Guildford and Bolton 
and which will be rolled out to Abbeychart in 2014. This 
investment will provide the Fluid Controls businesses with 
a solid modern platform to support future growth.

o perating results in 2013
Diploma achieved a robust result this year given challenging 
economic conditions in Europe and against a record 
performance last year from the Seals businesses. Revenues 
and profits increased on the prior year, free cash flow 
remained strong and the Group’s return on trading capital 
employed was again above 25%. 
Revenues increased by 10% to £285.5m (2012: £260.2m) which 
included an additional net contribution from businesses 
acquired or divested during the past two financial years of 
£11.7m. After adjusting for this additional contribution and for 
the impact on overseas revenues from the change in exchange 
rates, underlying revenues increased by 4%. An improvement 
in the trading environment in the Seals and Controls markets, 
combined with less demanding prior year comparatives led to 
an improvement in the second half, with underlying revenues 
up 6% compared with the same period last year.
Adjusted operating profit, which is before acquisition related 
charges, increased by 3% to £54.3m (2012: £52.8m) and 
adjusted operating margins decreased to 19.0% from the 
record level of 20.3% reported last year. As indicated last year, 
the ramp up in the Investment for Growth programme which 
started in early 2012 contributed to this reduction in margin. 
In addition, further revenue investment in sales and business 
development resources in the businesses, together with a 
slight weakening in gross margins in both the Healthcare 
and Fluid Controls businesses also contributed to the margin 
reduction. Underlying adjusted operating profits reduced 
by 1%, after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, the 
divestment of the small Swiss Environmental business last 
year and currency movements. 
The relative strength against UK sterling of both the US dollar 
and the Euro during the first nine months of the year benefited 
the Group’s results this year on the translation of the results of 
the overseas businesses to UK sterling. The benefit to revenues 
Finance Review
and operating profit on translation was £1.8m and £0.3m 
respectively. On a transaction basis, the weakening in both 
the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar against the US dollar 
and Euro in the last quarter of the year impacted the gross 
margin in the Healthcare businesses, since their products are 
mainly purchased in these currencies. The existing hedging 
programmes in the businesses mitigated much of this effect 
this year, such that the reduction in gross margin in the DHG 
businesses was only £0.3m compared with the previous year. 
The impact on the rest of the Group on a transaction basis 
from the change in exchange rates was broadly positive, but 
not significant. 
investment for Growth programme
As indicated last year, the Board approved a programme of 
investments, including additional management resources, of 
ca. £6m across the Group designed to secure a platform to 
sustain the profitable growth in the businesses over the next 
five years. This investment programme comprises the

During the year the refurbishment of new facilities in Swindon 
and Markham was completed and work began on the 
relocation of the Barrie facility in Canada which was 
completed shortly after the end of the year. In addition, a 
number of large IT infrastructure projects were completed in 
M Seals, Hawco and a1-envirosciences and a new ERP project 
commenced in the second half of the year in the Canadian 
Healthcare companies. 
The impact on operating profit this year from this programme 
of investments has been £2.2m which is £0.7m higher than 
was anticipated last year because certain stages of investment 
have been advanced or additional costs expensed during 
the year. This cost, which represents ca. 80bps of margin, is 
expected to continue at a broadly similar running rate in future 
years. However as we complete this Investment for Growth 
programme in the second half of 2014, we expect to start to 
realise efficiency benefits in terms of better management of

inventory and the ability to take delivery of large supplier 
shipments. We are also beginning to see the benefits from 
better service levels, as well as having increased capacity in 
facilities, information systems and management resource to 
support substantially larger businesses. 
adjusted profit before tax, earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% to £54.3m (2012: 
£52.6m). There was no net interest expense this year (2012: 
£0.2m) because the combination of the interest earned on 
cash deposits and the notional net income earned on the 
defined pension scheme of £0.3m, offset interest paid on 
bank borrowing and commitment fees. IFRS profit before tax 
was £48.5m (2012: £46.0m), after acquisition related charges 
of £5.6m (2012: £6.4m) and fair value remeasurements of 
£0.2m (2012: £0.2m). 
The notional net income earned on the defined pension 
scheme of £0.2m will no longer accrue to the Company from 
1 October 2013, following the implementation of a change in 
accounting under IAS 19 (Retirement Benefit Obligations), 
whereby the calculation of the notional return on the assets 
will be restricted to the return on high quality corporate bonds.
 
The Group’s adjusted effective accounting tax charge 
decreased in 2013 to 27.3% (2012: 28.7%) of adjusted profit 
before tax reflecting the benefit of a further reduction in UK 
corporation tax rates to 23.5% (2012: 25%), together with the 
impact from a lower proportion of profits being contributed 
by HFPG in the US, where the effective tax rate is ca. 38%. 
The Group’s adjusted cash rate of tax was 27.3% for the year.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 5% to 34.8p, 
compared with 33.1p last year reflecting the benefit from the 
lower effective tax rate this year. IFRS basic earnings per share 
increased to 30.7p (2012: 27.9p).
The Board’s policy is to pursue a progressive dividend, while 
targeting dividend cover (the ratio of Adjusted EPS to total 
dividends paid and proposed for the year) towards two times 
cover. Following this policy and recognising the strength of the 
Group Balance Sheet and strong free cash flow, the Directors 
have recommended an increase in the final dividend of 5% to 
10.7p per share; this gives a total dividend per share for the 
year of 15.7p per share with represents a 9% increase on the 
prior year dividend of 14.4p. The dividend cover moves to 2.2 
times from 2.3 times reported last year.
Free cash flow 
The Group continues to generate strong free cash flow from 
its activities which in 2013 was £31.6m (2012: £32.7m), after 
making exceptional cash payments of £4.7m (2012: £nil) to 
fund the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust in respect of 
incentive awards which had vested in earlier years. Free cash 
flow, which is before expenditure on acquisitions or returns to 
shareholders, represented 80% of Adjusted profit after tax 
(2012: 87%).
Operating cash flow increased to £55.9m (2012: £50.2m) after 
investing £1.1m (2012: £5.2m) in working capital which, at 
30 September 2013, was broadly stable at 16.7% (2012: 16.5%) 
of annual revenues, adjusted for the timing of acquisitions. The 
increase in working capital arose partly from a small increase in 
inventory and also reflected the timing of a large CPP contract 
in DHG which contributed to an increase in receivables. Group 
tax payments increased by £1.1m to £14.8m (2012: £13.7m) 
primarily reflecting the normalisation of Canadian tax 
payments which had been deferred from earlier years, 
following the amalgamation of the AMT Endoscopy business 
with Vantage. 
Capital expenditure increased to £4.6m (2012: £3.5m) with the 
Investment for Growth programme accounting for £2.0m of 
this expenditure. The completion of the facility relocations in 
Swindon in the UK and Markham in Ontario, Canada at the 
beginning of the year cost £1.4m and £0.6m was capitalised 
in connection with the IT development projects in M Seals, 
Hawco, a1-envirosciences and Somagen. The Healthcare 
businesses in Canada and Australia spent £1.7m (2012: £1.6m) 
on acquiring field equipment in support of their customer 
contracts with hospitals; this included £1.0m (2012: £1.0m) 
on funding endoscopy cost per procedure (“CPP”) contracts in 
Vantage. The remaining capital expenditure of £0.9m was 
spent on new seal cutting machinery and testing equipment 
in Seals and on general improvements to the IT infrastructure 
across the Group. The rate of capital expenditure is currently 
running well ahead of depreciation of £2.5m (2012: £2.1m), 
but this will begin to recede after next year as the Group 
comes to the end of its Investment for Growth programme.
During the year, participants exercised share options in respect 
of outstanding awards which had vested in earlier years under 
the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). In exchange 
for reduced awards to the participants, the Company paid 
the PAYE income tax liability on the awards on behalf of 
the participants. This liability, including the funding of the 
Employee Benefit Trust to acquire shares in the Company in 
respect of future LTIP awards, accounted for an exceptional 
cash payment of £4.7m by the Company. 
 
The Group spent £2.2m (2012: £22.3m) of the free cash 
flow on acquiring businesses during the year, including 
deferred consideration of £0.6m (2012: £0.8m) and 
£17 .6m (2012: £14.3m) on paying dividends to both Company 
and minority shareholders.
acquisitions completed during the year
There was a low level of acquisition activity during the  
current financial year with only £2.2m (including deferred 
consideration of £0.6m) being spent on acquiring both 
Rayquick in November 2012, a small Controls business based 
in Germany and the outstanding minority interest in BGS. In 
2012 the Group had spent £22.3m on acquiring businesses.  
In the absence of significant acquisitions, the amount of 
acquisition intangible assets held at 30 September 2013 
reduced to £26.7m from £32.2m last year; these acquisition 
intangible assets are being amortised over a period ranging 
from 5 to 15 years and acquisition related charge in the year 
was £5.6m (2012: £6.4m), which included a negligible amount  18

on acquisition expenses (2012: £0.6m). At 30 September 2013, 
the value of goodwill in the Group Balance Sheet, which is not 
amortised, was £78.5m (2012: £79.8m). 
Shortly after the year end, the Group signed contracts for  
the acquisition of 80% of Kentek Oy for consideration of 
£11.2m, subject to completion of competition approvals by the 
authorities in Russia and certain other conditions precedent. 
The business is based in Finland, but much of its activities are 
carried out across Russia in supplying filters and related 
products for a range of heavy mobile machinery and industrial 
applications. 
l iabilities to minority shareholders
At 30 September 2013, the Group’s liability to purchase 
outstanding minority shareholdings had reduced to £2.8m 
(2012: £3.2m) following the acquisition on 8 January 2013 of 
the outstanding 20% minority interest in BGS, the Australian 
Healthcare business. At 30 September 2013 this liability related 
to minority interests held in M Seals, DSL and HPS (which is a 
small subsidiary of the RT Dygert seals business). These 
liabilities arise under put and call option contracts entered into 
at the time of acquisition and are based on the Directors’ 
estimate of the Earnings before Interest and Tax (“EBIT”) of 
these businesses when these options crystallise. This liability 
was reassessed at 30 September 2013 and this led to a 
financial charge of £0.2m (2012: £0.2m) being made in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. 
The options to acquire the outstanding minorities in these 
companies are, with the exception of the 20% minority interest 
acquired in DSL last year, likely to be exercised during the 
next 12 months and account for £1.9m of the liability at 
30 September 2013.
In addition to the liability to minority shareholders, the 
Group also has a liability at 30 September 2013 for deferred 
consideration of up to £0.2m (2012: £0.6m) arising from the 
acquisition of the outstanding minority interest in BGS; this 
deferred consideration will be paid during the next 18 months. 
During the year, deferred consideration of £0.6m was paid, of 
which £0.3m was paid to the vendors of Carsen Medical, the 
Canadian endoscopy business acquired in 2010 and £0.3m 
was paid to the vendor of Amfast Limited, acquired last year.
Return on trading capital employed and Balance Sheet
The Group continued to achieve a strong return on trading 
capital employed (“ROTCE”) of 25.8% in 2013 (2012: 26.6%). 
ROTCE, is a pretax measure and includes all gross historic 
goodwill and gross intangible assets and gives an indication of 
the overall profitability of the Group and its success in creating 
value for shareholders. The slight reduction in the return of 
80bps to 25.8% largely arose from the large capital 
investments in facilities and IT systems which have yet to 
contribute to an increase in operating profits. In absolute 
terms, trading capital employed, which represents the amount 
of operational assets held by the businesses, remained broadly 
unchanged at £158.2m (2012: £159.4m). The increased 
investment in tangible assets and working capital was offset by 
a combination of amortisation of intangibles and a reduction 
in overseas capital employed following the strengthening in 
UK sterling against overseas currency exchange rates at 
30 September 2013. 
The Group also continues to maintain a strong Balance Sheet 
with net cash funds increasing during the year by £11.4m 
to £19.3m at 30 September 2013. Surplus cash funds are 
generally repatriated to the UK, unless they are required locally 
to meet certain commitments, including acquisitions. 
The Group has a £20m revolving credit facility which is 
generally utilised to provide any shortfall in cash to fund 
acquisitions. During the year, up to £7.0m was drawn down 
to fund both prior year acquisitions and short term working 
capital requirements, but these had been fully repaid by the 
end of the year. 
The Group’s bank facility of £20m can, subject to market 
pricing, be extended to £40m at the option of the Company. 
The facility, which was due to expire in November 2013, has 
been extended on the same terms until 30 June 2014 when it 
will be renegotiated in light of the acquisition pipeline existing 
at that time. 
Employee pension obligations 
Pension benefits to existing employees, both in the UK and 
overseas, are provided through defined contribution schemes 
at an aggregate cost in 2013 of £1.5m (2012: £1.1m). 
The Group also maintains a legacy defined benefit pension 
scheme in the UK which has been closed to new entrants and 
further accruals for many years. The Company continues to 
make regular cash contributions to the scheme at a rate of 
£0.3m, as agreed with the actuary, with the objective of 
eliminating the funding deficit of £2.7m over ten years. The 
triennial funding actuarial valuation of the scheme is being 
carried out as at 30 September 2013 and given the large 
reduction in bond yields since the last valuation was 
completed in 2010, the funding deficit is likely to increase 
substantially, despite the recent strong investment returns. 
However the Company will look for opportunities to provide 
sufficient security to the Trustees in order to limit any 
requirement to increase the Company’s existing cash 
contribution to the scheme. 
On an accounting basis, the strong performance of global 
equity markets during the year has led to a small fall in the 
accounting deficit in the scheme to £4.7m (2012: £5.4m) 
before the related deferred tax asset. Scheme assets which are 
largely represented by equities, increased by £2.6m to £23.3m 
while pension liabilities increased by £1.9m following a 
correction to equalisation liabilities and a small increase  
in the assumption on future inflation.  19

Life Sciences
Sector definition & scope
The Life Sciences Sector businesses supply a range of 
consumables, instrumentation and related services to 
the healthcare and environmental industries.
Healthcare
The Diploma Healthcare Group (“DHG”) in Canada comprises 
three principal operating businesses which supply to the 
ca. 600 public hospitals across the country as well as to private 
clinics and laboratories. Somagen Diagnostics (“Somagen”) 
supplies a range of consumables and instruments used in 
the diagnostic testing of blood, tissue and other samples in 
hospital pathology laboratories. It is also a leading supplier to 
the growing, assisted reproductive technology (“ART”) market. 
AMT Electrosurgery (“AMT”) supplies specialised electrosurgery 
equipment and consumables for use in hospital operating 
rooms. AMT is also building a portfolio of specialised surgical 
instruments and devices used in minimally invasive (“MI”) 
Surgery. Vantage Endoscopy (“Vantage”) supplies medical 
devices and related consumables and services to GI 
Endoscopy suites in hospitals and private clinics. 
DHG also operates in Australia and New Zealand through 
Diagnostic Solutions (“DSL ”) and Big Green Surgical (“BGS”) 
which are both located in Melbourne. BGS and DSL focus 
on similar markets respectively to the AMT and Somagen 
businesses and share a number of common suppliers.
Environmental
The a1-group is a supplier to Environmental testing laboratories 
and to Health & Safety engineers. The a1-envirosciences 
business, based in Germany, supplies a range of specialised 
environmental analysers and a range of containment enclosures 
for potent powder handling. The a1-CBISS business, based in 
the UK, supplies equipment and services for the monitoring and 
control of environmental emissions, as well as a range of gas

market drivers
The DHG businesses in Canada supply into areas of Healthcare 
which are predominantly public sector funded. Private sector 
funding in Canada is focused on areas where DHG do not 
participate, including dental, cosmetic and eye surgery and 
pharmaceuticals. The principal demand driver for DHG is 
therefore the level of healthcare spending by the Canadian 
Government.
The Canadian Healthcare industry is a proven, long term 
growth environment for medical device distribution. A 
growing, aging and well educated population demands high 
standards of service delivery, helping to ensure ongoing 
growing demand; per capita healthcare spending in Canada is 
in the top 20% of OECD countries. The Canadian Health Act 
(“the Act”) ensures universal coverage for all insured persons 
for all medically necessary services provided by hospitals, 
physicians and other healthcare providers. The Provinces are 
responsible for the delivery of the healthcare services, but 
the Federal Government controls delivery through Federal 
Provincial transfer payments, which represent the largest 
source of revenues for the Provinces.
The relative stability and consistency in funding by each of 
the Provinces, guaranteed through the Act, ensures that the 
market remains well funded through the economic cycle. Over 
many years, healthcare expenditure has grown steadily with 
annual variations mostly dependent on the periodic additional 
tranches of funding provided by individual Provinces. 
The Healthcare market in Australia shares with Canada 
many of the same attractive characteristics for specialised 
distribution. While privately funded healthcare is more 
prevalent in areas such as surgery and laboratory testing, 
public sector healthcare funding is still large and supported by 
a stable, resource based economy. As with Canada, there is a 
large geography to be covered, low population density and 
purchasing processes that vary by State. These characteristics 
necessarily demand a significant investment by manufacturers 
in technical sales and service resource which makes the 
specialised distribution model more attractive as an efficient 
way to serve the market.
The a1-group supplies to customers in the Environmental 
industry in the UK, Germany and France. The market demand 
is largely driven by Environmental and Health & Safety 
regulations and growth in recent years has been driven by the 
need to be compliant with a range of EU regulations. Since 
market demand is driven by regulation, this ensures reasonably 
steady demand for essential consumable products and 
services, though customers may defer capital expenditure 
during significant downturns in the economy.

The Life Sciences businesses increased revenues by 19% to 
£93.2m (2012: £78.4m), which included a full year contribution 
from the DSL business in Australia, acquired in June 2012. After 
adjusting for this acquisition, for currency effects and for a 
minor reshaping of the Environmental businesses, underlying 
revenues in Life Sciences increased by 15%.
Adjusted operating profits increased by 16% to £20.9m (2012: 
£18.0m), with adjusted operating margins reducing by 60bps 
to 22.4% (2012: 23.0%). In the Healthcare businesses, there was 
some weakening in gross margins towards the end of the year, 
caused by the weakening in the Canadian and Australian 
exchange rates, relative to the US dollar. The implementation 
of the Investment for Growth programme during the year also 
impacted Healthcare operating margins, although this was 
partly offset by an improvement in Environmental margins. 
Capital expenditure was £2.8m (2012: £2.3m) and included 
£1.7m invested in field equipment for placement by the 
Healthcare businesses and £0.3m invested in the new ERP 
systems in a1-envirosciences and Somagen. A further £0.6m 
was spent on completing the fit-out of the new Vantage 
facility in Markham. Free cash flow increased modestly to 
£14.4m (2012: £13.3m) with the increase limited by the adverse 
phasing of tax payments during the year, following the 
amalgamation of AMT’s Endoscopy business into Vantage 
in 2011. Working capital remained under tight control with 
additional investment of only £1.1m. 
Healthcare
Revenues from the Diploma Healthcare Group (“DHG”) 
increased by 20% in UK sterling terms. After adjusting for 
currency and for the DSL acquisition, underlying revenues 
increased by 15%. Somagen increased revenues by 8%, 
with strong double digit growth achieved from the sale of 
consumable products and services which are generally supplied 
through multi-year reagent rental contracts and account for 
ca. 80% of Somagen’s revenues. Capital equipment sales, 
which vary year-to-year depending on availability of capital 
budgets were somewhat reduced against a strong prior year 
comparative. Somagen had good sales success with placing 
new instruments in the areas of allergy testing, a1c diabetes 
testing and ART (assisted reproductive technology). Somagen 
also won contracts in three Provinces to supply testing 
equipment for their new colorectal screening programmes. 
AMT increased revenues by 15%, with the major growth driver 
being the new MI (minimally invasive) Surgery division, which 
was established last year to supply specialised surgical 
instruments and devices used in laparoscopic and other MI 
Surgery procedures. Products range from surgical instruments 
used in standard laparoscopic procedures carried out on 
the abdomen, to leading edge interventional radiology and 
oncology products for use in the treatment of cancer and 
cancer related disorders. In 2012, investment had been made 
in securing a strong portfolio of products, negotiating long 
term supplier agreements and in building a focused sales 
team. The results have been seen this year with a substantial 
increase in revenues from these new products and the MI 
Surgery division now accounts for ca. 30% of AMT’s revenues. 
AMT’s core Electrosurgery business, which represents 70% of 
AMT’s revenues, continued to grow steadily with the newly 
launched Penevac 1 product (combined electrode and smoke 
evacuation device) further penetrating the market and 
replacing more traditional products. 
Vantage increased revenues by 14%, benefiting from prior year 
investments made to combine AMT’s Endoscopy business 
with Carsen Medical (acquired in December 2010) and 
establish Vantage as a strong independent business within 
DHG. Vantage started the current financial year with a 
complete product range, an integrated and fully trained sales 
team and strengthened operational and service management. 
In the first quarter of the year, the business completed the 
integration programme by relocating all of its activities to a 
new, larger facility, close to the existing location in Markham, 
Ontario. The results of these investments have been seen in 
the strong performance this year, with steadily growing sales 
of consumable and service products, boosted by strong 
capital equipment sales of endoscope reprocessors and argon 
plasma coagulation units. Sales of endoscopes have also 
shown good growth from a combination of capital equipment 
sales and CPP (cost per procedure) based contracts. During 
the year, £1.0m (2012: £1.0m) was spent on acquiring 
instruments in support of these CPP contracts.
In Australia and New Zealand, revenues from DSL and BGS 
increased by ca. 30% on a like-for-like basis (after adjusting for 
DSL ’s pre-acquisition revenues). DSL, in its first full year in the 
Group, delivered a step change increase in revenues from 
the addition of a major new supplier (also a key supplier to 
Somagen) shortly after acquisition. DSL also had good success 
in selling auto-immune testing equipment to the leading 
private laboratory groups in Australia. In BGS, the growth was 
driven by strong sales in smoke evacuation products, building 
on the continued steady growth in electrosurgical grounding 
pads and laparoscopic electrodes. 
Sector Review continued
Life Sciences 23
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Strategic Report
During the year, senior management in Australia was 
strengthened at the country level and the BGS operations 
and back office functions were successfully relocated and 
integrated into the DSL facility in Melbourne. The DSL and BGS 
businesses continue to operate as clearly separate sales and 
marketing businesses, but now benefit from a central services 
group which gives increased efficiency and improved service 
levels. This consolidation also provides a firm foundation for 
further growth of the existing businesses and potentially other 
new businesses in Australia and New Zealand.
A number of DHG’s key supplier agreements were extended 
during the year and 12 of the 15 key suppliers (which together 
account for ca. 80% of DHG’s revenues) now have contracts 
that extend through 2016 and beyond. As part of the Group’s 
broader Investment for Growth programme, a major new ERP 
project has been initiated by DHG in its Canadian businesses. 
The implementation of this new system has started in 
Somagen in the second half of this year and will roll out across 
the other Canadian Healthcare businesses through the 2014 
financial year. 
Environmental
Revenues from the Environmental businesses increased by 
6% in UK sterling terms. In 2012, a small a1-envirosciences 
business in Switzerland was sold to its management and from 
the beginning of the 2013 financial year, the responsibility for 
the small Hitek business was transferred to a1-CBISS from 
the Controls sector. After adjusting for these changes and for 
currency effects, underlying revenues increased by 15%. 
The a1-envirosciences business based in Germany increased 
revenues by 14%, with strong demand for elemental analysers 
in Germany and continuing growth in laboratory enclosure 
sales in both Germany and France. The business also 
successfully introduced a new mercury analyser to meet 
increasingly stringent requirements to reduce mercury content 
in solids, liquids and gases. A new ERP system was implemented 
during the year to create a single platform for operational and 
accounting processes and to provide capacity for future growth. 
The core a1-CBISS business based in the UK experienced 
another strong year of trading with revenues growing by 12%. 
There was substantial growth in sales of CEMS (continuous 
emissions monitoring systems) equipment as new waste 
incineration and biomass power stations cleared planning and 
funding bottlenecks and advanced to the build stage. a1-CBISS 
also benefited from its strong positioning in preventative and 
emergency maintenance services and as a specialised 
technical distributor of a range of essential products for 
the gas detection and air quality sectors.

market drivers
The principal market drivers for both the Aftermarket and 
Industrial OEM Seal businesses is the growth in the general 
industrial economies, in particular in North America where 
almost 80% of Seal Sector revenues are generated. In 2012, the 
USA and Canada showed moderate GDP growth of 2.8% and 
1.9% respectively, continuing the slow steady growth trend that 
has been achieved since emerging from the 2009 recession.
In the UK and Northern Continental European markets where 
13% of revenues are generated, the industrial economies have 
been flat at best, which has provided a challenging 
environment in which to operate. The smaller but growing 
percentage of revenues generated in the Rest of the World are 
generated from a range of markets in South America, Middle 
East, Africa and Asia Pacific, where economic conditions have 
been variable.
For the Aftermarket businesses, activity and spending levels 
in the US Heavy Construction sector are very important, 
since this market accounts for over 50% of Aftermarket Seals 
revenues. Statistics on the Total US Construction spend 
include non-residential and infrastructure spend, as well as 
residential housing activity. The index had begun to fall sharply 
ahead of the 2008 financial crisis but recovered by 2010 and 
has since remained positive. The earlier recovery was driven 
primarily by stimulus funding on infrastructure projects with a 
solid contribution from the ground clearance phase of the 
fracking boom. More recently, improvements in the residential 
housing market have partially offset weakness in mining and 
oil and gas exploration.
US Construction Equipment unit sales of heavy mobile 
equipment (including excavators above 12 tonnes, crawler 
dozers and wheeled loaders), is an important short term 
indicator for the HKX attachment business. It is also important 
as a medium term indicator for Hercules’ replacement 
hydraulic seals activities, as the new heavy equipment will 
move out of the dealer warranty period in the coming years. 
There was an exceptional level of growth from 2009 to 2011 as 
tighter emissions legislation accelerated machine replacement 
and hire companies re-equipped their fleets. Residual 
momentum from these factors continued into 2012 
before growth levels began to moderate.
 
For the Industrial OEM Seal businesses, the best indicator is the 
US Industrial Production index, which made solid gains from 
2009 to 2011, with a mixed performance in 2012 as demand 
levelled out at below pre-recession levels.  26

The Seals business increased revenues by 6% to £106.1m 
(2012: £99.9m) which included a full year contribution from 
J Royal, which had been acquired in December 2011. After 
adjusting for the additional contribution from this acquisition 
and for currency translation effects, underlying Seals revenues 
increased by 2%. 
Adjusted operating profits decreased by 4% to £19.5m (2012: 
£20.4m) and adjusted operating margins reduced by 200bps 
to 18.4% (2012: 20.4%), reflecting the impact of investment in 
the Seals businesses, including the Group’s Investment for 
Growth programme begun last year. Significant investments 
over the past two years include the two facility relocations 
completed in the prior year in RT Dygert and All Seals, a new 
ERP system in M Seals and the general strengthening of 
management across the Seals businesses with investment in 
targeted business development resources. Aftermarket gross 
margins continued to be resilient, underpinned by essential 
product availability and added value technical service, though 
overall, Seals gross margins weakened slightly with continued 
competition in the Industrial OEM markets.
Free cash flow improved by £2.2m to £15.9m (2012: £13.7m), 
benefiting from a reduction in working capital, as the pace of 
growth moderated; this more than offset the impact from 
reduced operating profits and increased capital investment. 
Capital expenditure increased to £0.9m (2012: £0.6m) with a 
£0.3m investment made in two seal machining centres in the 
Aftermarket businesses and a water-jet gasket cutter in the 
Industrial OEM businesses; these investments allow the Seals 
businesses to deliver specialist seals and gaskets to customers 
on demand. In Europe, M Seals invested £0.2m on 
implementing a new ERP installation as part of the Group’s 
broader Investment for Growth programme.

The Aftermarket businesses, which account for ca. 55% of 
Seals revenues, saw revenues increase by 2% in UK sterling 
terms and by 1% in constant currency terms. 
In North America, the HFPG Aftermarket businesses (Hercules 
Bulldog and HKX) reported revenues broadly flat against the 
prior year. This represents a very creditable performance when 
set against the strong double digit annual growth achieved in 
the three years since emerging from the 2009 downturn. The 
businesses have significantly out-performed the relevant 
construction indices over this period, benefiting from superior 
inventory depth and advantageous long term relationships 
with key suppliers. In 2013, the uneven demand spikes from 
the economic recovery have abated, supplier product lead 
times have decreased and pricing has stabilised. Against this 
more stable market background, the businesses have 
consolidated their market share gains and are moving back 
towards more normal GDP plus rates of growth.
In the US, Hercules Bulldog continued to develop its electronic 
trading capabilities (“Webstore”) with new search and find 
capabilities, allowing the business to develop new sales 
channels to retail customers, as well as converting existing 
customers to online ordering. Online sales are up by 30% over 
the prior year and now represent 15% of revenues at US$7 .0m. 
The company also installed its third seal machining centre as the 
two existing machines reached capacity. These seal machining 
centres, which now contribute over US$1.0m to revenues, have 
proved to be successful additions to the Aftermarket customer 
service offering, enabling repairers to have access to hard-to-
find and outsized seals within 24 hours. Additional development 
engineers have also been added to broaden the product range 
and during the year over 3,000 new kit applications were 
developed. In Canada, the Hercules operation in Barrie, Ontario 
successfully completed a move in October 2013 to a new, 
custom built facility, providing Hercules in Canada with a first 
class platform for future growth.
HKX’s revenues fell marginally against an exceptional 33% 
increase in the prior year, when the combination of new 
emissions regulations and the re-equipping of hire fleets drove 
strong demand for HKX’s attachment kits. While revenues in 
2013 were sustained at close to record levels, the company 
took the opportunity to strengthen its service offering by 
adding technical staff and investing in additional CAE 
(computer aided engineering) software.
In Europe, FPE took operational responsibility for the Hercules 
Europe operation in the Netherlands, which will now provide 
the impetus to develop a more substantial, unified European 
Aftermarket group. The FPE group delivered good revenue 
growth, again following several years of steady revenue 
development. While domestic UK and Benelux demand for 
hydraulic seals was muted, there were good opportunities for 
an expanding range of hydraulic cylinder metal parts and 
selling into export markets. FPE also installed a seal machining 
centre in its Doncaster operation to complement the two 
existing machines located at Darlington.
Outside the core, directly-served markets in North America 
and Europe, the Aftermarket businesses continue to generate 
revenues by selling Hercules and Bulldog branded products 
through in-country sub-distributors. There was good growth 
in sales in Mexico, the Middle East and South Africa, though 
revenues were softer in several South American and South 
East Asian countries.

The Industrial OEM businesses, which account for ca. 45% of 
Seals revenues, reported an 11% increase in revenues. After 
adjusting for the acquisition of J Royal and for currency 
effects, underlying revenue growth of 4% was achieved. 
In North America, the HFPG Industrial OEM businesses 
(RT Dygert, J Royal and All Seals) continued to operate in 
an industrial economy which has shown slow steady growth 
since emerging from the 2009 downturn. For the HFPG 
businesses, the level of demand from existing customers has 
been generally stable with a reasonably steady stream of new 
projects. However, there were also some revenue losses 
during the year, arising from a combination of reasons 
including customer loss of business, product design changes 
and in one case, a manufacturer taking business directly. 
Overall, the business gains broadly balanced out the business 
lost, with market share not significantly impacted. In an 
increasingly competitive market for the more standard 
products, the businesses have enhanced their product offering 
through new compound certifications for a variety of 
applications which allows them to meet the more stringent 
demands of customers, as well as to move up the value chain. 
RT Dygert delivered good revenue growth as existing and new 
OEM customers introduced new products to their markets 
and the traditional Mid-West cylinder producers benefited 
from the growth in new mobile equipment demand. 
RT Dygert also invested in a range of regulatory compliant 
elastomer compounds to penetrate the pharmaceutical, water 
and petrochemical industries. All Seals had a relatively flat year 
with good new customer gains being offset by revenue 
reductions from legacy customers. All Seals invested during 
the year in the Seals businesses first water-jet gasket cutting 
machine to support the growing demand for turnaround 
custom gaskets. All Seals also obtained the AS9100 quality 
certification which strengthens its position in the Aerospace 
and Medical products industries. J Royal continued to invest in 
a significant strengthening of its management and sales 
development resources to diversify its customer base in the 
Eastern US. Development lead times can be lengthy for new 
projects, but the prospect and project pipelines are growing 
and should underpin the long term growth potential. 
 
In Europe, M Seals delivered good overall growth, with the 
core territories of Denmark and Sweden performing well. Sales 
of large bearing seals to Chinese wind power customers were 
subdued as the Chinese wind power industry appeared to take 
a pause in its development in the year. During the year, M Seals 
successfully completed the implementation of a new ERP 
software package which will provide a solid platform for future 
growth, as well as providing more efficient management of 
inventory across the three country locations.

market drivers
industrial economic background
The Controls businesses focus on specialised, technical 
applications in a range of industries, with over 90% of Sector 
revenues generated in the UK and Continental Europe 
(principally Germany). The background market drivers are 
therefore the growth of the industrial economies in the UK 
and Germany.
A good indicator of the health of the UK industrial economy 
is the UK Index of Production. This index tracks the severe 
decline in 2009 caused by the financial crisis, a partial recovery 
in 2010 and then a continued steady decline in 2011 and 2012. 
Although there has been some improvement in 2013, the 
background is still one of limited and fluctuating confidence 
among general manufacturing customers. 
 
Similarly, the German Production Sector Output Index again 
tracks the severe decline in 2008 and 2009, but shows a more 
sustained recovery before flattening out in 2011 and 2012 as 
the Euro crisis deepened and German export growth slowed. 
In comparison to the UK, production output has remained 
close to pre-recession levels. 
Specific industry drivers
Although influenced by the general industrial economic 
cycles, there are also more specific drivers within the main 
market segments served by the Controls businesses. 
The Civil Aerospace market continued to grow steadily with 
growth in World Passenger Traffic returning to the long term 
average of around 5% per annum. New aircraft continue to 
come into service and Europe has taken its share of the fit-out 
projects for aircraft interiors, including the continued upgrade 
of the technology and components used in premium cabins. 
The Defence markets in the UK and Germany remained 
subdued with programme delays, expenditure reduction and a 
general slowdown in the time taken to gain firm commitment 
to spending decisions.
The Motorsport market was underpinned by a stable grid in 
Formula 1 but demand for products used in testing was limited 
in a year when there were no major technological changes. 
New engines for Formula 1 will be introduced in the 2014 
season which should boost demand. In Energy markets, 
demand for repair components for the electricity distribution 
sector in Germany was lower; the mobile generator and 
commercial battery sectors were also slower following a 
strong performance in the previous year.
Demand for fluid control products from the UK food retailing 
sector was in line with last year but well below previous highs 
as retailers continued to focus on smaller convenience stores. 
The beverage, vending and purified waters sectors were 
steady with new coffee dispensing formats continuing to 
generate interest and growth. 30

ROTCE 39.2% 44.2%
The Controls businesses increased revenues in 2013 by 5% to 
£86.2m (2012: £81.9m), benefiting from both the acquisition 
in November 2012 of a small energy distributor based in 
Germany and from a full year contribution from Abbeychart 
and Amfast, acquired respectively in March and May 2012. 
After adjusting for the additional contribution from these 
acquisitions and for modest currency translation effects, 
underlying revenues decreased by 3%. 
Adjusted operating profits decreased by 3% to £13.9m (2012: 
£14.4m) and adjusted operating margins reduced by 150bps to 
16.1% (2012: 17.6%). The reduced operating margins resulted 
from the reduction in underlying revenues, combined with 
increased costs following the major relocation of the IS-
Rayfast business in the UK (completed in November 2012) and 
the ERP investment at Hawco. Overall gross margins in the 
Controls Sector remained resilient as the businesses continued 
to focus on specialised markets and added value 
opportunities.
Free cash flow improved by £1.9m to £11.9m (2012: £10.0m), 
with a reduction in working capital reflecting the weaker trading 
environment and from stronger management of working 
capital in the more recently acquired businesses. Capital 
expenditure increased to £0.9m (2012: £0.6m) including £0.7m 
on the completion of the new IS-Rayfast facility in Swindon 
and £0.1m on installing a new ERP system in Hawco. Both of 
these investments were part of the Group’s broader 
Investment for Growth programme. 
interconnect
The Interconnect businesses, which account for ca. 70% of 
Controls revenues, increased revenues by 4% in UK sterling terms. 
After adjusting for acquisitions and currency effects, underlying 
revenues decreased by 3%, reflecting a combination of strong 
prior year comparatives in Motorsport, a weaker Defence market 
and a generally challenging Eurozone backdrop. 
Aerospace and Defence accounts for ca. 40% of Interconnect 
revenues and in this market, there was a sharp contrast 
between the Civil and Military segments. In Civil Aerospace, 
there was good demand for the full range of electrical 
harnessing products and bonding leads for cabin interiors. 
There was also significant demand for fasteners supplied by 
Amfast, which had an excellent first full year in the Group and 
consolidated its position as a leading supplier to the premium 
aircraft seating industry. By contrast, Military Aerospace 
demand in both the UK and Germany slowed with the 
reduction in the annual production rate of Eurofighter 
Typhoon aircraft having the largest impact. 
Defence markets more broadly also remained subdued, but 
our businesses demonstrated their resilience by ending the 
year with revenues marginally ahead of the prior period. In the 
UK, there were fewer large projects but IS-Rayfast leveraged 
its excellent stocking profile to provide a rapid turnaround of 
orders to its wide customer base. IS-Rayfast, as a European 
Master Distributor for key suppliers, was also able to provide 
critical stocking support to its distribution partners across 
Europe. In Germany, Filcon saw good growth from the 
provision of connectors for specialist engines for use in the 
Puma and K9 Howitzer military vehicles, as well as from a 
return to increased production of military radios. 
Sales to the Industrial markets in the UK and Germany (ca. 25% 
of Interconnect revenues) were essentially flat, which was 
a creditable performance in a difficult UK and Eurozone 
manufacturing environment. The field sales teams in the UK and 
Germany were able to offset slower demand by winning new 
business from both existing and new customers. In Germany, 
Sommer benefited from the strengthening of its field sales 
team and made solid progress in penetrating a wider customer 
base, again supported by superior stocking and value added 
services. Examples of business gains include the supply of 
miniature solder sleeves for a fan system used in high end car 
seats and the provision of a wide range of components for 
the refurbishment and upgrade of cruise ships. 
Motorsport accounts for ca. 20% of Interconnect revenues and 
in this market, revenues reduced against strong prior year 
comparatives. In the UK there was much lower development 
and testing activity this year, ahead of the proposed introduction 
of new engines and upgraded Energy Recovery Systems for the 
2014 Formula 1 season. In the US, sales had been boosted in 
2012 by the adoption of fuel injectors for the Nascar racing 
series and a change in the chassis used in the Indy car series; 
this year, there were no such technological changes to drive 
increased demand. In Germany, Filcon delivered good growth 
in Motorsport sales through the supply of specialist connectors 
for the VW World Engine, the new car design for the Le Mans 
series and multiple developments in electric and hybrid engines 
for both racing and road cars.
In the German Energy market, Sommer supplies components 
used in repair and refurbishment of medium voltage electricity 
generation equipment. Sales slowed this year due to a 
combination of an extended period of bad weather and the 
focus by large generating companies in Germany on the high 
voltage distribution network, at the expense of a more normal 
cycle of repair and refurbishment of the local transmission 
networks. The small acquisition of Rayquick, which coincided

with this slowdown, was successfully integrated into Sommer 
and helped Sommer to secure its appointment as a German 
Master Distributor for its key supplier of energy products. In the 
UK, the Cabletec energy business focuses on high reliability 
industrial batteries mainly for use in UPS (uninterrupted power 
supply) applications. As the market is concentrated in a small 
number of key customers, demand can vary significantly and 
2013 was a relatively slow year in comparison to the prior year. 
Cabletec continued to improve its in-house manufacturing 
capabilities and competitiveness resulting in share gains on key 
components, such as its tin and nickel plated copper braiding 
used for the protection of electrical cables and harnesses in 
harsh environments. 
Operationally, this was a year of significant change for 
IS-Rayfast, as it successfully completed its relocation from 
the site it had occupied since 1992 into a newly refurbished 
37,000 sq.ft. building. The new facility not only provides an 
appropriate environment for a modern, technically biased 
company, but also substantial capacity for future growth. 
Later in the year, Amfast’s sales and customer service 
functions were fully integrated into Clarendon’s sales 
operation in Leicester and warehousing operations were 
combined with those of Clarendon at the new Swindon site.
Fluid Controls
The Fluid Controls businesses, which account for ca. 30% 
of Controls revenues, increased revenues by 14% in UK 
sterling terms. After adjusting for currency effects and for 
the acquisition of Abbeychart last year, underlying revenues 
decreased by 2%. The Hawco business faced significant 
headwinds this year as the major food retailers continued 
to focus on smaller convenience stores, which require less 
Hawco product. In addition, some key commercial catering 
equipment manufacturers were left with surplus equipment, 
having leased the products on a temporary basis to vendors 
at the 2012 Olympics’ sites. Hawco continued to have success 
with its range of space and energy saving components and 
benefited from the rise in home deliveries through increased 
sales to the refrigerated transport market. 
The Abbeychart business also faced challenges in its markets, 
but was able to offset this by utilising its expanded field sales 
team to increase the company’s share of business from smaller 
customers through superior technical support and stock 
availability. The coffee sector remained buoyant with 
consumers continuing to look for new, personal-use 
dispensing methods and from high street vendors taking an 
increasingly technical approach to brewing. With vendors 
now looking to install increasingly sophisticated equipment to 
guarantee the purity and consistency of the water used in the 
brewing process, prospects for next year remain encouraging.
During the year, the Hawco Group made a significant 
investment in a new ERP system which was successfully 
implemented at Hawco’s operations in Guildford and Bolton 
and which will be rolled out to Abbeychart next year. This 
investment will provide the Fluid Controls businesses with 
a solid, modern IT platform to support future growth. 32

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk: Strategic
Downturn in major markets
Adverse changes in the major markets in which the businesses 
operate can have a significant impact on performance. The 
effects will either be seen in terms of slowing revenue growth, 
due to reduced or delayed demand for products and services, 
or margin pressures due to increased competition.
A number of characteristics of the Group’s businesses 
moderate the impact of economic and business cycles on 
the Group as a whole:
•	 The Group’s businesses operate in three different sectors 
with different cyclical characteristics and across a number 
of geographic markets.
•	 The businesses offer specialised products and services; 
this offers a degree of protection against customers 
quickly switching business to achieve a better price.
•	 A high proportion of the Group’s revenues comprise 
consumable products which are purchased as part of 
customers’ operating expenditure, rather than through 
capital budgets.
•	 In many cases the products are used in repair, maintenance 
and refurbishment applications, rather than original 
equipment manufacture.
mitigation
The businesses identify key market drivers and monitor the 
trends and forecasts, as well as maintaining close relationships 
with key customers who may give an early warning of slowing 
demand. Changes to cost levels and inventories can then be 
made in a measured way to mitigate the effects.
l oss of key supplier(s)
For manufacturer-branded products, there are risks to the 
business if a major supplier decides to cancel a distribution 
agreement or if the supplier is acquired by a company which 
has its own distribution channels in the relevant market. There  
is also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity and either 
setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor.
In times of rapid economic expansion in activity, such as after a 
global recession, there is also a risk that the lead times to 
supply key product can become very long.
Currently no single supplier represents more than 15% of 
Group revenue and only four single suppliers represent more 
than 2% each of Group revenue.
Relationships with suppliers have normally been built up over 
many years and a strong degree of interdependence has 
been established. The average length of the principal supplier 
relationships in each of the sectors is over ten years.
The strength of the relationship with each supplier and the 
volume of activity generally ensures continuity of supply, 
when there is shortage of product.
mitigation
Actions to mitigate the risks include:
•	 Long term, multi-year exclusive contracts signed 
with suppliers with change of control clauses, where 
possible, included in contracts for protection or 
compensation in the event of acquisition.
•	 Collaborative projects and relationships maintained with 
individuals at many levels of the supplier organisation, 
together with regular review meetings and adherence to 
contractual terms.
•	 Regular review of inventory levels.
•	 Bundling and kitting of products and provision of added 
value services.
•	 Periodic research of alternative suppliers as part of 
contingency planning.
Risk assessment and evaluation is an integral part of the 
Group’s annual planning cycle and market specific risks  
are evaluated as part of the annual budgeting process.
Each operating business is required each year to identify  
and document the significant strategic, operational and 
financial and accounting risks facing the business. For each 
significant risk, a number of scenarios are mapped out and  
an assessment is made of the likelihood and impact of each 
risk scenario. 
Finally, plans and processes are established which are 
designed to control each risk and minimise its potential 
impact. The risk assessments from each of the operating 
businesses are reviewed with the Executive Directors and 
a consolidated risk assessment is reviewed by the Board.
The principal risks and uncertainties which are currently 
judged to have the largest potential impact on the Group’s 
long term performance are set out below. There have been 
no significant changes to these risks and uncertainties, or 
their potential impact on the Group, since last year. 33
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Strategic Report
Risk: Strategic
l oss of major customer(s)
The loss of one or more major customers can be a material 
risk.
The nature of the Group’s businesses is such that there is not 
a high level of dependence on any individual customers and 
no single customer represents more than 5% of Sector 
revenue or more than 2% of Group revenue.
mitigation
Specific large customers are important to individual operating 
businesses and a high level of effort is invested in ensuring that 
these customers are retained and encouraged not to switch to 
another supplier. 
In addition to providing high levels of customer service, close 
integration is established where possible with customers’ 
systems and processes.
product liability
There is a risk that products supplied by a Group business may 
fail in service, which could lead to a claim under product 
liability. The businesses, in their Terms and Conditions of sale 
with customers, will typically mirror the Terms and Conditions 
of purchase from the suppliers. In this way the liability can be 
limited and subrogated to the supplier.
However, if a legal claim is made it will typically draw in our 
business as a party to the claim and the business may be 
exposed to legal costs and potential damages if the claim 
succeeds and the supplier fails to meet its liabilities for 
whatever reason. Product liability insurance can be limited in 
terms of its scope of insurable events, such as product recall. 
mitigation
Technically qualified personnel and control systems are 
in place to ensure products meet quality requirements. The 
Group’s businesses are required to undertake Product Risk 
assessments and Supplier Quality Assurance assessments. 
The Group has also established Group-wide product liability 
insurance which provides worldwide umbrella insurance 
cover of £20m in all Sectors. 
The Group’s businesses may also elect not to supply 
products if they are not fully confident that the products 
will meet the demands of the operating environment.
l oss of key personnel
The success of the Group is built upon strong, self-standing 
management teams in the operating businesses, committed 
to the success of their respective businesses. As a result, the 
loss of key personnel can have a significant impact on 
performance, at least for a time. 
As set out on page 36, the average length of service for all 
personnel in the Group is over five years.
mitigation
Contractual terms such as notice periods and non-compete 
clauses can mitigate the risk in the short term. However, more 
successful initiatives focus on ensuring a challenging work 
environment with appropriate reward systems. The Group 
places very high importance on planning the development, 
motivation and reward for key managers in the operating 
businesses including:
•	 Ensuring a challenging working environment where 
managers feel they have control over, and responsibility 
for their businesses. 
•	 Establishing management development programmes 
to ensure a broad base of talented managers.
•	 Offering a balanced and competitive compensation 
package with a combination of salary, annual bonus and 
long term cash incentive plans targeted at the individual 
business level.
•	 Giving the freedom, encouragement, financial resources  
and strategic support for managers to pursue ambitious 
growth plans. 34

Risk: o perational
major damage to premises
The Group’s businesses mostly operate from combined office/
warehouse facilities which are dedicated to each business and 
not shared with other Group businesses. 
Major damage to the facilities from fire, malicious damage or 
natural disaster would impact a business for a period until the 
damage is repaired or alternative facilities have been established.
However, the Group has not suffered any major damage 
to premises in recent years and in Clearwater, Florida there 
has been no significant hurricane activity for at least the last 
five years.
mitigation
The business where the risk is greatest is Hercules in 
Clearwater, Florida which is most at risk from an environmental 
disaster caused by a hurricane or tornado. The building 
structure has been designed to withstand 150mph winds, 
electricity generators have been installed on site and a specific 
disaster plan has been drawn up and is regularly reviewed. 
Contingency plans include:
•	 Backup power generators.
•	 Materials on hand to secure the facility.
•	 Communications rerouted to other branches or interim 
locations.
•	 IT recovery plan using backup server in separate location.
•	 Regular building inspection and weather monitoring.
•	 Plans to drop-ship product from suppliers direct 
to customers.
The other businesses have also developed plans to prevent 
incidents, including fire and security alarms and regular fire 
drills. Insurance policies are also in place including property, 
contents and business interruption cover which would 
mitigate the financial impact.
However, the priority in such an event is to become fully 
operational as quickly as possible so as to minimise disruption  
to customers. Plans to ensure a quick and orderly recovery  
have been developed by the businesses and are periodically 
reviewed. 
l oss of information Technology (“iT”) systems
Computer systems are critical to the businesses since their 
success is built on high levels of customer service and quick 
response. A complete failure of IT systems, with the loss of
trading and other records, would be more damaging to the 
businesses than major physical damage to facilities.
mitigation
Business interruption insurance cover is held across the Group 
and contingency plans have been drawn up in all businesses. 
The recovery plans differ by individual business, but will include 
some or all of the following elements:
•	 Full data backups as a matter of routine are automatically 
taken on a regular basis each week and stored online.
•	 Backup servers identified and communication reroute 
options identified.
•	 Service contracts with IT providers with access to 
replacement servers.
•	 Uninterruptible power sources and backup generators  
where required.
•	 Virus checkers and firewalls.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
continued 35
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Strategic Report
Risk: Financial and accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial and 
accounting risks, including foreign currency, liquidity, interest 
rate and credit. The policies for managing these financial risks, 
as well as the management of capital risks, are set out in note 
19 to the consolidated financial statements. The principal 
financial and accounting risks are summarised below. The 
Group’s overall management of the financial risks is carried out 
by a central treasury team under policies and procedures 
which are reviewed and approved by the Board. 
The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, 
hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s 
operating businesses. The treasury team does not undertake 
speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no 
underlying exposure.
The principal accounting risk is that of inventory 
obsolescence which is managed by the operating business.
Foreign currency risk – Translational exposure
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in currency 
rates will affect the Group’s results. The Group operates 
internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising 
from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the 
US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the 
Euro. The net assets of the Group’s operations outside the UK 
are also exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
During the year ended 30 September 2013, ca. 75% of the 
Group’s revenue and adjusted operating profits were earned in 
currencies other than UK sterling. In comparison to the prior 
year, the net effect of currency translation was to increase 
revenue by £1.8m and increase adjusted operating profit by 
£0.3m. It is estimated that a strengthening of UK sterling by 
10% against all the currencies in which the Group does 
business, would reduce adjusted operating profit before tax 
by approximately £4.2m (8%), due to currency translation.
Currency exposures also arise from the net assets of the 
Group’s foreign operations. At 30 September 2013, the 
Group’s non-UK sterling trading capital employed in overseas 
businesses was £125.7m (2012: £131.9m), which represented 
79% of the Group’s trading capital employed. It is estimated 
that a strengthening of UK sterling of 10% against all the 
non-UK sterling capital employed would reduce 
shareholders’ funds by £12.1m.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of 
overseas earnings and of year end exchange rates, used in 
the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal 
currencies used by the Group, are shown in note 28 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
mitigation
The Group does not hedge translational exposure.
Foreign currency – Transactional exposure
The Group’s UK businesses are exposed to foreign currency 
risk on those purchases that are denominated in a currency 
other than their local currency, principally US dollars, Euro 
and Japanese yen. The Group’s Canadian and Australian
businesses are also exposed to a similar risk as the majority of 
their purchases are denominated in US dollars and Euros. The 
Group’s US businesses do not have any material foreign 
currency transactional risk.
mitigation
The Group’s businesses may hedge up to 80% of forecast 
(being a maximum of eighteen months) foreign currency 
exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group classifies its forward foreign exchange contracts, 
which hedge forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges and 
states them at fair value. 
inventory obsolescence
Working capital management is critical to success in 
specialised industrial business as this has a major impact on 
cash flow. The principal risk to working capital is in inventory 
obsolescence and write-off.
The charge against operating profit in respect of old or 
surplus inventory is ca. £1.0m p.a., but inventories are 
generally not subject to technological obsolescence.
mitigation
Inventory write-offs are controlled and minimised by active 
management of inventory levels based on sales forecasts and 
regular cycle counts. 
Where necessary, a provision is made to cover both excess 
inventory and potential obsolescence. 36

Corporate Responsibility
Employees
Building and developing the skills, competencies, motivation 
and teamwork of employees is recognised by the Board as 
being key to achieving the Group’s business objectives. The 
stability and commitment of the employees is demonstrated 
by the average length of service which has remained strong. 
In addition the number of working days lost to sickness is less 
than 1% a year. These measures remain consistent across each 
of the Group’s Sectors.

The Group values the commitment of its employees and 
recognises the importance of communication to good working 
relationships. The Group keeps employees informed on matters 
relating to their employment, on business developments and 
on financial and economic factors affecting the Group. 
This is achieved through management briefings, internal 
announcements, the Group’s website and by the distribution  
of Preliminary and Interim Announcements and press releases. 
Copies of the Annual Review and Annual Report & Accounts 
are also made available in the operating businesses. This 
communication programme enables employees to gain a 
better understanding of the Group’s business objectives and 
their roles in achieving them. Both employment policy and 
practice in the Group are based on non-discrimination and 
equal opportunities. Ability and aptitude are the determining 
factors in the selection, training, career development and 
promotion of all employees. 
The Group remains supportive of the employment and 
advancement of disabled persons. Applications for employment 
by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind 
the respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicants concerned. 
If an employee is, or becomes disabled during their period of 
employment, the Group will, if necessary and to the extent 
possible, adapt the work environment to enable the employee 
to continue in their current position or retrain the employee for 
duties suited to their abilities following disablement. At 30 
September 2013 the Group employed one disabled employee. 
Employment policies throughout the Group have been 
established to comply with relevant legislation and codes of 
practice relating to employment, health and safety and equal 
opportunities. The Group provides good quality working 
environments and facilities for employees and training and 
development appropriate to each of their roles.
Some of the Group’s operating companies have structured 
apprenticeship schemes for technical staff and the Group 
provides sponsorship for high potential employees for higher 
education courses where appropriate. Vocational training 
is also provided and some staff are enrolled on National 
Vocational Qualification (“NVQ”) level courses. Employees are 
actively encouraged to undertake Continuing Professional 
Development (“CPD”).
Health & Safety
The Group is fully committed to ensuring clean, safe and 
healthy working conditions. The Group actively promotes a 
strong safety culture and ensures a collective responsibility for 
ensuring Health & Safety standards are continually improved.
The Group Chief Operating Officer, Iain Henderson, has 
overall responsibility for Health & Safety procedures across 
the Group. However, in line with the Group’s decentralised 
management approach, accountability for Health & Safety 
is with local management to match local regulatory 
requirements, culture and specific business needs. The Group 
requires that each operating business conducts a Health & 
Safety review against its specific operational risk profile and 
local regulatory requirements.
2013 2012 2011
Minor injuries 54 21 16
Reportable lost time incidents

1 Three or more day’s absence from workplace.
The increase in minor injuries through 2012 and 2013 reflects 
the improved systems for reporting and collecting injury data, 
particularly in relation to recently acquired businesses. The 
most common types of injury relate to minor cuts, slips/trips 
and lifting injuries.
All injuries are fully investigated and corrective actions and 
preventative measures put in place to ensure that the injury 
does not reoccur and future risks are mitigated.
Health & Safety forms part of the induction process for new 
employees and where relevant, more specialist training is 
provided for specific functions. The Group has good coverage 
of employees who have formal Health & Safety training and/or 
qualifications and this will be expanded during 2014.
Human rights
The Group’s activities are substantially carried out in developed 
countries that have strong legislation governing human rights. 
The Group complies fully with appropriate legislation in the 
countries in which it operates. 37
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Strategic Report
Environmental
The Group comprises sales and marketing focused businesses 
which essentially receive products from suppliers and 
despatch them to customers. The Group’s businesses do not 
operate delivery fleets; they use third party carriers to provide 
much of their packaging requirements and to deliver their 
products to customers. The Group’s ability to control the 
environmental impact of its logistics partners is therefore 
limited. The primary impact on the environment, which is 
entirely in the Group’s control, is consumption of the normal 
business energy sources such as heating and power, which the 
Group aims to minimise.
The Group ensures it minimises its impact on the environment 
through compliance with relevant environmental legislation. 
The Group is committed to identifying and assessing 
environmental risks, such as packaging waste, arising from  
its operations. 
Waste management initiatives are encouraged and supported 
by the Group and materials are recycled where practical.
Local management are committed to good environmental 
management practices throughout our operations. 
The Managing Directors have responsibility for environmental 
performance of their operating businesses and each subsidiary 
is required to implement initiatives to meet their 
responsibilities. Some specific environmental initiatives are 
provided below:
•	 Each location participates in recycling paper, plastic, 
cardboard, and wood from pallets. 
•	 Hercules US has reduced the amount of plastic bags used 
for packaging of parts to be shipped by over 50% .
•	 Hercules Canada has worked with local waste 
management to recycle over 95% of all disposal items, 
virtually eliminating any landfill waste.
•	 HKX is in compliance with ISPM15 phytosanitary regulations 
for international shipping.
•	 Cabletec in the UK has modified all products to ensure they 
are now fully REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
and restriction of Chemicals) compliant.
Ethics
The Group recognises its obligations towards the parties with 
whom the Group has business dealings including customers, 
shareholders, employers, suppliers and advisors. 
Dealings with these groups depend upon the honesty and 
integrity of employees and the Group ensures that a high 
standard of expertise and business principles are maintained in 
all such dealings. 
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are 
important to the long term development and sustainability 
of the operating businesses. It recognises the obligation it 
has towards the parties with whom it has business dealings 
including customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees and 
advisors. In general, the interactions with these parties are 
managed at a local level by senior management and the 
Group expects a high standard of expertise and business 
principles are maintained in such dealings.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating 
business is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions 
under which they trade with their suppliers. The Group does not 
operate a formal code that it follows with regard to payments to 
suppliers. Group companies agree payment terms with their 
suppliers when they enter into binding purchasing contracts for 
the supply of goods or services.
Suppliers are, in that way, made aware of these terms. Group 
companies seek to abide by these payment terms when they 
are satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or 
services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
The Group considers the environmental and social impacts of 
conducting business on the community and this forms part 
of the business decision making process. Many community 
activities and events are fully supported by the Group and 
this relationship is managed by the local management teams.
Some examples of Group community activities include:
•	 In North America:
 – Various charitable donations made locally at each 
operating company by employees for local charities 
such as United Way (over $20k donated by employees), 
Haven House (Abused Women) and Clothes for Kids.
 – Hercules US sponsorships at charity golf challenges.
 – Adopt a Needy Family at Thanksgiving and Christmas at 
Hercules US; employees donate cash, food and gifts for 
a designated family in the community.
•	 In Europe:
 – Staff from a1-CBISS took part in the ‘Tough Mudder’ 
fund raising activity on behalf of Claire House Children’s 
Hospice in November 2012.
 – IS-Rayfast supported Prospect Hospice near Swindon 
UK, in memory of a long term colleague who was sadly 
lost to cancer last year and took part in the Swindon 
Race for Life to support Cancer Research UK.
 – Cabletec supported Weston Hospice in Weston-super-
Mare UK, again in memory of a long term colleague who 
was sadly lost to cancer. Teams from IS-Cabletec and 
IS-Rayfast took part in the national ‘Movember’ charity 
event to raise awareness of men’s health issues.
The Group also contributes to local worthwhile causes and 
charities and in 2013 the Group made donations of £32,359 
(2012: £28,285). No political donations were made. 38

Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present Diploma’s report on Corporate 
Governance on behalf of our Board. We have developed and 
expanded this report this year which I hope gives a clear and 
meaningful explanation of how the Board and its Committees 
discharge their governance duties and apply the principles of 
good governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“Code”). 
The Board is committed to ensuring the highest standards of 
corporate governance and that values and behaviours are 
consistent across the Group. As I indicated in my earlier 
Reports to shareholders, in October 2011 on joining the FTSE 
250, I set clear objectives for the Board to develop its policies 
and processes to ensure that the Board would be able to meet 
the more stringent governance standards commensurate with 
a Company that is now firmly established in the FTSE 250 
constituent group. 
The appointment of John Nicholas and Charles Packshaw in 
June as independent non‑Executive Directors, following the 
appointment of Marie‑Louise Clayton earlier in the financial 
year, has allowed the Board to refresh its Committees and 
provides a firm foundation for continued oversight and 
scrutiny of the Company’s activities. These appointments 
follow the decision of John Matthews and Ian Grice to step 
down from the Board at 30 September 2013. 
We have also made solid improvements in the Board processes 
over the past two years and further developments in policies 
and review processes are planned for the coming financial year, 
including an external evaluation of the performance of the 
Board. Towards the end of next year we will also carry out a 
further formal review of the Group’s strategy, following that 
carried out in October 2012. This will be the first opportunity for 
the new members of the Board to contribute to the Group’s 
future strategic direction, having had an opportunity to gain a 
thorough understanding of the Group’s operations.

Compliance with the Code
Diploma PLC is required to state whether it has complied 
with the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, published by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2012. Set out on pages 41 to 65 is an 
explanation of how the Company has complied with the 
Main Principles of the Code.
The Board confirms that throughout the financial year, the 
Company applied all of the Principles set out in sections 
A to E of the UK Corporate Governance Code for the 
period under review. The Board also confirms that it 
complies with all of the Provisions of the Code as at the 
date of this Report. However, as a result of the timing of 
appointments to the Board, there were two short periods 
during the year where the Company did not comply with 
three Provisions. The explanations relating to these 
exceptions are set out on page 44.
The Company’s auditor Deloitte LLP , are required to 
review whether the above statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for their review by 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if 
it does not reflect such compliance. 
John Rennocks
Chairman
Following the developments over the past two years I am 
pleased to report that at the date of this Report, the Company 
is able to comply fully with all of the principles and provisions 
enshrined in the Code. 
Finally, I would like to encourage all shareholders to find the 
time to attend our AGM on 15 January 2014. It provides an 
excellent opportunity to meet the Executive Directors and the 
independent non‑Executive Directors on the Board whose 
Committee’s reports are set out in the following pages of this 
Report on Governance.

Committee Report on page 57. The biographical details of the

independent non‑Executive Director on 13 November 2012 
and on 1 June 2013, John Nicholas and Charles Packshaw 
joined the Board as independent non‑Executive Directors. 
Following these appointments, John Matthews, a long serving 
director who had completed ten years of service and Ian Grice, 
who had been a member of the Board for six years, retired 
from the Board. Both John Matthews and Ian Grice served 
throughout the year to enable smooth hand‑ overs of their 
Committee chairmanship roles and retired as planned on 
30 September 2013. 
The role of Senior Independent Director became vacant on 
the retirement of John Matthews and on 15 November 2013 
John Nicholas was appointed Senior Independent Director.
Activities of the Board
The Company’s governance framework is set out on page 41 
together with a summary of the formal terms of reference. The 
core activities of the Board and its Committees are planned on 
an annual basis and this framework forms the basic structure 
within which the Board operates.
The Board’s terms of reference also sets out the separate and 
distinct roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership of the 
Board and the governance of the Board and ensures that the 
Directors have an understanding of the views of the 
Company’s major shareholders. The Chairman sets the 
Board’s agenda and ensures that there is a healthy culture of 
challenge and debate at Board and Committee meetings.
The Board appoints the Chief Executive and monitors his 
performance in leading the Company and providing operational 
and performance management in delivering the agreed 
strategy. The Chief Executive is responsible for developing, for 
the Board’s approval, appropriate values and standards to guide 
all activities undertaken by the Company and for maintaining 
good relationships and communications with investors.
The approval of acquisitions, for the most part, is a matter 
reserved for the Board, save that it delegates to the Chief 
Executive the responsibility for such activities to a specified 
level of authority. Similarly, there are authority levels covering 
capital expenditure which can be exercised by the Chief 
Executive. Beyond these levels of authority, projects are 
referred to the Board for approval.
Other matters reserved to the Board include treasury policies, 
internal control, risk management and the appointment or 
removal of the Group Company Secretary.
The Company has purchased insurance to cover its Directors 
and Officers against the costs of defending themselves in legal 
proceedings taken against them in that capacity and in respect 
of any damages resulting from those proceedings.
The Company also indemnifies its Directors and Officers to 
the extent permitted by law. Neither the insurance nor the 
indemnity provides cover where the Director or Officer has 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
To ensure that non‑Executive Directors can constructively 
challenge and support proposals on strategy, the Board has 
adopted a process of reviewing and approving the agreed 
strategy for the Company on a two/three yearly basis. In 
October 2012, the Board undertook a strategy development 
review at the Group’s business in Swindon, UK. The next 
strategy meeting is likely to be held later in 2014.
Meetings of the Board
The Board has six scheduled meetings each year and meets 
more frequently as required. It met on seven occasions during 
the year under review and attendance at these meetings is set 
out on page 40.
Each Director is required to attend all meetings of the Board or 
Committees of which they are a member. In addition senior 
management from across the Group and advisers attend 
some of the meetings for the discussion of specific items in 
greater depth.
This exposure to the members of senior management 
from across the businesses helps enhance the Board’s 
understanding of the business, the implementation of strategy 
and the changing dynamics of the markets in which the 
business operates.
Effectiveness
Independent non‑ Executive Directors
The non‑Executive Directors are determined by the Board to 
be independent in character and judgement and there are no 
relationships or circumstances which could affect, or appear 
to affect, a Director’s judgement. The Chairman, John 
Rennocks was considered independent by the Board both at 
the time of his appointment as Director on 12 July 2002 and 
as Chairman on 7 January 2004. In accordance with the 
Code, the ongoing test of independence for the Chairman 
is not appropriate. 
All non‑Executive Directors are advised of the likely time 
commitments at appointment. The ability of individual 
Directors to allocate sufficient time to the discharge of their 
responsibilities is considered as part of the Directors’ annual 
evaluation process, overseen by the Chairman. Any issues 
concerning the Chairman’s time commitment are dealt with 
by the Nomination Committee, chaired for this purpose by the 
Senior Independent Director.
Corporate Governance continued 43
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
Each non‑Executive Director is required to inform the Board of 
any changes to their other appointments.
During the year the Chairman has also held meetings with the 
non‑Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present.
The appointment of non‑Executive Directors are subject 
to formal, rigorous and transparent procedures which are 
described more fully in the Report from the Nomination 
Committee which is set out on page 49. 
Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts and retains 
talented people to deliver outstanding performance and 
further enhance the success of the Group. In that culture, 
diversity across a range of criteria is valued, primarily in relation 
to skills, knowledge and experience and also in other criteria 
such as gender and ethnicity. The Board has considered 
setting objectives in relation to diversity, but does not believe 
that such objectives are appropriate at this juncture, given 
the relatively small Board. The Board will however keep this 
matter under review, particularly in light of Board succession 
and development.
Information and professional development
An induction programme is agreed for all new Directors aimed 
at ensuring that they are able to develop an understanding and 
awareness of the Group’s core processes, its people and 
businesses. The non‑Executive Directors’ awareness of the 
businesses is further developed through periodic visits to the 
principal business locations and presentations to the Board by 
senior management of the businesses.
Following the new appointments to the Board this year, a 
comprehensive induction programme was set up which 
included a visit by each of the new non‑Executive Directors to 
the major business units in each of the Group’s Sectors where 
they had an opportunity to meet with senior management in 
these businesses. Further meetings were held individually 
between each of the non‑Executive Directors and the 
Executive Directors and with the principal advisors to 
the Company.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Chief Executive and 
the Group Company Secretary, is responsible for ensuring 
that Directors are supplied with information in a timely manner 
that is in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable them 
to discharge their duties. In the normal course of business, 
the Chief Executive gives an oral report to the Board at 
each meeting and information is provided and reported 
through formal Board reports that include information on 
operational matters and strategic developments. There are 
also reports on the performance of Group operations, 
financial performance relative to the budget, business 
development and investor relations.
The training needs of the Directors are periodically discussed 
at Board meetings and where appropriate, briefings as 
necessary are provided on various elements of corporate 
governance and other regulatory issues.
The Group Company Secretary acts as an advisor to the Board 
on matters concerning governance and regulatory issues and 
ensures compliance with Board procedures. All Directors have 
access to his advice and a procedure also exists for Directors 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. No such advice was sought during the year. The 
appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary 
and his remuneration are matters for the Board as a whole.
Board evaluation
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of effectiveness 
using specifically designed evaluation forms and under the 
direction of the Chairman. This exercise encompasses an 
evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole, as  
well as of the Committees and individuals. Feedback on Board 
performance is presented by the Chairman to a meeting of  
the Board and actions and objectives are agreed for the 
following year.
The Board intends to introduce periodic externally facilitated 
evaluations of the Board, commencing with the 2014 evaluation.
Re‑election
All Directors to the Board are subject to election by the 
shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following 
their appointment by the Board and in accordance with the 
Code, all Directors will also stand for re‑ election annually at 
the Annual General Meeting.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are subject to a statutory duty under the Act to avoid 
a situation where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly could conflict, with the 
Company’s interests. The Act allows directors of public 
companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where 
appropriate, where the Articles of Association contain a 
provision to this effect. The Act also allows the Articles to 
contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of 
interest to avoid a breach of duty. At the 2009 AGM, revised 
Articles that contained such provisions were adopted.
Procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue 
to operate effectively and the Board’s authorisation powers are 
being exercised properly in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association. 44
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Diploma PLC
Accountability
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report 
& Accounts present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s position and prospects.
The Board is also responsible for determining the nature and 
extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives and for maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems. They also review 
the effectiveness of these systems through the work of the 
Audit Committee as reported on in the Report of the Audit 
Committee on pages 45 to 48.
The key risks which the Board has focused on this year are set 
out in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on page 32 
to 35. The Board is committed to providing shareholders with 
a clear assessment of the Company’s financial position and 
prospects. This is achieved through this Annual Report & 
Accounts, the Annual Review and through other periodic 
financial statements and announcements.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well‑ developed investor relations 
programme managed by the Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director. Through this programme the Company 
maintains regular contact with major shareholders to 
communicate clearly the Group’s objectives and monitors 
movements in significant shareholdings.
During the past two years, these communications have been 
enhanced by the introduction of Investor Days, both in the UK 
and in Canada which were well attended. In addition Investor 
Roadshows are now held each year in the US as well as in the 
UK and formal investor presentations are made twice a year to 
groups of private client fund managers. 
Most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer 
and Group Finance Director through presentations made 
twice a year on the operating and financial performance of 
the Group and its longer term strategy. The Chief Executive 
Officer and Group Finance Director generally deal with 
questions from individual shareholders. All financial and 
trading announcements are published immediately on the 
Company’s website, including copies of the presentations 
made to analysts and key shareholders.
The non‑Executive Directors are given regular updates as to 
the views of institutional shareholders and an independent 
insight is sought through research carried out twice a year 
by the Company’s advisors, focused on both investors 
and analysts.
Through these processes, the Board is kept abreast of key 
issues and the opportunity for shareholders to meet the 
Chairman or Senior Independent Director, separately from 
the Executive Directors, is available on request.
Electronic communications to shareholders include the 
Notice of the Annual General Meeting which is sent at least 
20 working days prior to the meeting. The Company proposes 
a separate resolution on each substantially separate issue 
and for each resolution proxy appointment forms provide 
shareholders with the option to vote in advance of the AGM.
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting when the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer give a statement on the Group’s 
performance during the year, together with a statement on 
current trading conditions. The Chairman of the Board and 
of the Remuneration and Audit Committees will normally be 
available to answer questions at the meeting.
The Board has resolved, in line with emerging best practice, 
to conduct a poll on each resolution proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting. The results of the Annual General Meeting 
resolutions, including details of votes cast, are published on 
the Company’s website.
Code non‑ compliance
The Company complied with the Principles of the Code 
throughout the year, but for very short periods of time, did not 
comply with the following Provisions of the Code during the 
year under review. In each case this was attributable to the 
timing of appointments:
•	 A.4.1 – There was no Senior Independent Director 
appointed for the period from 30 September 2013 when 
John Matthews retired, until the appointment of John 
Nicholas on 15 November 2013. The candidates for Senior 
Independent Director were recently appointed as non‑ Executive Directors to the Board and this, together with the 
need to follow a fair and structured appointment process, 
meant that the appointment was delayed until early in the 
new financial year.
•	 B.1.2 – At least half the Board did not comprise 
independent non‑Executive Directors from 1 October 
2012 until the appointment of Marie‑Louise Clayton as 
an independent non‑Executive Director on 13 November 
2012. The Board narrowly missed the end of the transition 
period permitted by the Code for smaller companies, under 
which the Company was previously allowed to have at least 
two independent non‑Executive Directors. 
•	 C.3.1 – The Audit Committee did not comprise at least 
three independent non‑Executive Directors for the period 
1 October 2012 until the appointment of Marie‑Louise 
Clayton to the Committee on 13 November 2012. The 
Board narrowly missed the end of the transition period 
permitted by the Code for smaller companies, under 
which the Audit Committee was previously allowed to 
have at least two independent non‑ executive directors 
with the Company Chairman being a member of the 
Audit Committee.
As set out above in this Report, the Company was in full 
compliance with all of the Principles and Provisions of the 
Code at the date of this Report.

Dear Shareholder
I was delighted to be appointed Chairman of the Audit 
Committee in March 2013 and would like to thank my 
predecessor, John Matthews who has guided the Committee 
over many years. In June 2013, John Nicholas and Charles 
Packshaw, both of whom have substantial experience of 
corporate financial reporting, joined the Committee and I look 
forward to their support and contribution to the Committee’s 
oversight in the coming years.
In my first year as Chairman, I have devoted a large amount 
of time to gain a thorough understanding of the financial 
reporting processes in the Group and to reviewing the overall 
control environment related to the Group’s strategic, 
operational and financial activities. As part of this exercise 
I have been assisted particularly by the Group Finance Director 
and Internal Auditor, but I have also met with local 
management in the larger business units to ensure 
I understand the way in which the Group’s processes 
and controls are applied by the Group’s businesses.
I have also met separately with the Company’s auditors during 
which meetings I have sought their views on the strength and 
depth of financial reporting and internal control processes 
operating over the Group’s activities. I welcome Ed Hanson as 
the lead engagement audit partner this year and wish to thank 
his predecessor, Ian Waller who had reported on the Group’s 
financial statements for the past five years.
Set out over the following pages is my Report on the activities 
of the Committee during the year; the Committee’s agenda 
continues to grow each year and this year we have given 
further insight into the work of the Committee by expanding 
the Committee’s Report to explain how the Committee has 
dealt with the areas of financial reporting that require 
particularly careful review and judgement. None of these 
areas have proved critical in preparing the Group’s financial 
statements this year.

Audit Committee
The Committee is chaired by Marie‑Louise Clayton and 
comprises independent non‑ Executive Directors. The 
Chairman and John Nicholas are both qualified accountants, 
who have recent and relevant financial experience.
John Rennocks, the Chairman of the Company, resigned from 
the Audit Committee on 13 November 2012 in accordance 
with good governance practice, but continues to attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Committee.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Executive Directors also attend Committee 
meetings and the Internal Audit Manager also attended two 
Committee meetings. The Committee met with the external 
auditor during the year, without the Executive Directors 
being present.
Engagement of the external auditor
The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the 
Group’s and Company’s financial statements. The audit 
includes the review and test of the systems of internal financial 
control and the data contained in the financial statements to 
the extent necessary for expressing an audit opinion on the 
truth and fairness of the financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditor since their 
appointment in 2008. Deloitte LLP provides the Committee 
with relevant reports, reviews and advice throughout the year, 
as set out in their terms of engagement. 
In accordance with UK regulations, the Company’s auditor 
adheres to a rotation policy based on best practice and a new 
Group lead engagement partner was appointed this year in 
place of the previous lead engagement partner who had 
completed a term of five years in that role. 
During the year the performance of the auditor was formally 
assessed by the Committee in conjunction with the senior 
management team. In making this assessment the Committee 
focussed on the robustness of the audit, the quality of delivery 
of audit services and the quality of the auditor’s staff. The 
Committee is satisfied that the audit continues to be effective 
and provides an appropriate independent challenge of the 
Group’s senior management.
The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte continues to provide 
an effective audit and considers that the cost and disruption 
that would be caused to the Group’s businesses by an audit 
tender process, outweighs any benefit to shareholders from a 
more frequent change in the Company’s auditor. However the 
Committee remains supportive of the Code’s requirement that 
the audit should be put out to tender at least once in every 
ten years.
Audit Committee Agenda – 2013
•	 Reviews and agrees the scope of work to be undertaken 
by the external auditor and agrees the terms of 
engagement and fees to be paid for the external audit.

and understandable”.
•	 Reviews a report from the Group Finance Director on 
the controls in place to mitigate fraud risk.
•	 Reviews the Interim Management Statements and 
Trading Updates at meetings held in January, March, 
July and September.

Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of their monitoring of the integrity of the financial 
statements, the Committee reviews whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted, whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements and also seeks support 
from the external auditors to assess them. 
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 30 September 2013 
are set out below: 
•	 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets:
The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill 
and the assumptions underlying the impairment review. The 
judgements in relation to goodwill impairment largely relate 
to the assumptions underlying the calculations of the value in 
use of the business being tested for impairment, primarily the 
achievability of long term business plans and macroeconomic 
assumptions underlying the valuation process. This area is a 
prime source of audit focus and accordingly the external 
auditor provided detailed reporting to the Committee.
•	 Valuation of inventory:
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance 
Director that set out the gross balances by businesses, 
together with any related provision against the carrying value. 
The Committee reviewed the bases used to value and confirm 
existence of inventory held across the Group; they also 
considered the appropriateness of provisions held against the 
carrying value of inventory, having regard to the age and 
volumes of inventory, relative to expected usage. These 
matters were also discussed with the Group Finance Director 
and the auditor. 
•	 Recoverability of accounts receivable:
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance 
Director that set out the gross balances by businesses, 
together with any related provision against the carrying value. 
The Committee reviewed the report of work done by the 
external auditor on trade receivables to confirm both existence 
and recoverability; they also considered the appropriateness 
of provisions held against the carrying value of accounts 
receivables having regard to the age and creditworthiness of 
the customer. These matters were also discussed with the 
Group Finance Director and the auditor. 
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set 
out above had been fully and adequately addressed by the 
Executive Directors, appropriately tested and reviewed by the 
external auditor and that the disclosures made in the Annual 
Report & Accounts were appropriate. 
Risk management and internal control
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control. The system of 
internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a clear organisational structure 
with defined authority levels. The day‑to‑day running of the 
Group’s business is delegated to the Executive Directors of the 
Company. The Executive Directors visit each operating unit 
on a regular basis and meet with both operational and finance 
management and staff.
Key financial and operational measures are reported on a 
weekly and/or monthly basis and are measured against both 
budget and half year reforecasts which have been approved 
and reviewed by the Board. On an annual basis, each business 
unit is required to prepare a risk assessment process on the key 
strategic, operational, financial and accounting risks to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks to the Group’s 
business. They include common definitions of risk and ensure, 
as far as practicable, that the policies and procedures 
established by the Board are appropriate to manage the 
perceived risks to the Group. These assessments are 
supplemented by a detailed evaluation of the key financial 
controls of the business units which are critically reviewed 
by the Group’s Internal Audit Manager. The Committee will 
annually review the results of these assessments and the 
key strategic and operating risks of the Group identified by 
management. During the year, the risk assessment process 
revealed no significant risks of which the Board was not 
previously aware.
The risks and uncertainties which are currently judged to 
have the most significant impact on the Group’s long term 
performance are set out on pages 32 to 35. 
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems. Taking into 
account the processes that have been designed and 
implemented for 2013, the Board, with the advice of the 
Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems for the period from 
1 October 2012 to the date of this Report and is satisfied that 
the Group has in place effective risk management and internal 
control systems. 48

Internal audit
The Group’s finance department includes a separate internal 
audit function. This is managed by a qualified internal auditor 
who is based in Toronto, Canada. On larger audit 
engagements the Internal Audit Manager is assisted by a 
member of the Group finance team at Diploma PLC. 
A full programme of internal audit visits has been completed 
during the year. The scope of work carried out by internal audit 
generally focuses on the internal financial controls and risk 
management procedures operating within each business. In 
January, the Internal Audit Manager presents his audit plan for 
the year to the Committee for their approval. Written reports are 
prepared on the results of each visit which sets out weaknesses 
identified during the work, together with recommendations to 
improve the control environment. These reports are reviewed 
and discussed with the Executive Directors.
At the conclusion of the financial year, the Internal Audit 
Manager reports to the Committee on the results of the 
audit work carried out in the year. The Committee reviews 
management’s response to matters raised, including the time 
taken to resolve such matters. There were no significant 
weaknesses identified in the audits undertaken during the 
current year, but a number of recommendations were made to 
improve internal review processes and procedures operating 
over supplier masterfile data and credit card terminals.
The Committee continues to keep under review the need 
for a more independent internal audit function in the Group. 
The Committee remains satisfied that the Group’s system 
of internal control is appropriate for a group of the size and 
nature of Diploma PLC and the Committee’s current view is 
that a separate formal independent internal audit function 
is not appropriate to a group of Diploma’s size.
Non‑ audit fees
The Committee has an established a set of guidelines covering 
the type of non‑audit work that can be assigned to the external 
auditor. These guidelines were reviewed and updated during the 
year and relate to advisory services where the auditor’s detailed 
knowledge of the Group’s affairs means that they may be best 
placed to carry out such work. This extends to, but is not 
restricted to, shareholder and other circulars, regulatory reports, 
and on occasions, work in connection with disposals.
The external auditor may only provide such services where 
these do not conflict with their statutory responsibilities and 
ethical guidance. Work in connection with acquisitions, 
including due diligence reviews, is generally not provided 
by the auditor, but is placed with other firms.
Taxation services are generally not provided by the auditor; 
a separate firm is retained to provide tax advice, including any 
assistance with tax compliance matters generally. However 
during the year the tax department of Deloitte LLP provided 
advice to the Company in connection with the application 
of new legislation relating to Controlled Foreign Companies. 
This advice has resulted in a small assignment which will be 
concluded in the 2014 financial year. The Committee remains 
satisfied that this assignment, which largely arose from 
Deloitte’s detailed knowledge of the Group’s tax affairs, is 
sufficiently ring‑ fenced so as not to conflict with the duties 
of the auditor.
In other circumstances, proposed assignments are put out 
to tender and decisions to award work taken on the basis of 
demonstrable competence and cost effectiveness.
The Committee assures itself of the auditor’s independence 
by receiving regular reports which provides details of any 
assignments and related fees carried out by the auditor in 
addition to their normal audit work, and these are reviewed 
against the above guidelines.
Details of the external auditor’s total fees, including non‑ audit 
fees of £71,000 paid to Deloitte LLP during the year are set out 
in note 27 to the financial statement.
Anti‑ Bribery and Whistleblowing
Diploma has a group wide anti‑Bribery and Corruption policy 
to comply with the Bribery Act 2010 and it periodically reviews 
its procedures to ensure continued effective compliance in its 
businesses around the world.
During the year, the Committee formally reviewed and 
updated the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy, which provides 
the framework to encourage and give employees confidence 
to “blow the whistle” and report irregularities. Employees are 
encouraged to raise concerns with designated individuals, 
including the Executive Directors, the Group Company 
Secretary or the Chairman of the Audit Committee. All such 
reports will be investigated and reported to the Committee, 
together with details of corrective action taken. The Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy is monitored by the Committee.

The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Rennocks, the 
Chairman of the Company. The Committee would be chaired 
by the Senior Independent Director on any matter concerning 
the chairmanship of the Company. The Committee comprises 
the non‑Executive Directors.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee.
Board development
The Committee’s primary focus for 2013 was the continued 
development of the Board with the appointment of 
independent non‑ Executive Directors for succession 
and Board balance. 
The current development phase of the Board began in 2012 
with the appointment of Marie‑Louise Clayton as a non ‑ Executive Director on 13 November 2012. With John Matthews 
having completed ten years’ service and Ian Grice having 
indicated his wish to retire from the Board, two new 
independent non‑Executive Directors were appointed during 
the year to maintain Board balance and structure.
Advisors
The Committee appointed Norman Broadbent LLP , an 
external search agency in 2012, to assist with the identification 
of suitable candidates as non‑Executive Directors. Norman 
Broadbent LLP has no other connection with the Company.
Bruce Thompson, the Group Chief Executive Officer provides 
advice to the Committee to help it make informed decisions.
Diversity
The Board’s policy on diversity is set on page 43.
Appointment process
As part of the appointments process, the Committee 
determined the selection criteria for each of the new 
independent non‑Executive Directors. The Committee 
worked with Norman Broadbent LLP who drew up a list of 
candidates from a range of industries and backgrounds for 
initial appraisal by the Committee. From this, a shortlist of 
suitable candidates that met the search and selection criteria, 
was prepared and these candidates were interviewed by 
members of the Nomination Committee.
Following these interviews, the Nomination Committee 
recommended to the Board the appointments of John 
Nicholas and of Charles Packshaw as non‑Executive Directors. 
Appointment terms
All three non‑Executive Directors have been appointed for an 
initial period of three years, subject to election by shareholders 
at the first Annual General Meeting. Thereafter, and subject to 
their individual and separate re‑ election, the appointments will 
be for a term of three years unless terminated earlier by, and at 
the discretion of, either party, upon three months’ notice.

Remuneration Committee Report
John Nicholas
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
This is my first report to shareholders as Chairman of the 
Committee having joined the Board this year and taken over 
from Ian Grice at the end of July.
Diploma has again delivered a good financial performance 
in the year as set out in other parts of the Report & Accounts. 
The absence of any substantial acquisitions in the year has 
meant that growth, although good, was lower than target. 
This has been reflected in the lower bonus awards paid to 
Executive Directors this year.
However the Company’s Total Shareholder Return over the 
past three years ended 30 September 2013 was outstanding 
with growth of 193% over this period placing the Company in 
the upper quintile against the FTSE 250 benchmark. This 
strong performance resulted in 100% of the long term awards 
granted to the Executive Directors in January 2011 vesting at 
30 September 2013. It has also established the Company 
firmly in the FTSE 250 index which was one of the principal 
objectives set for the Executive Directors in earlier years.
During the year the Committee held seven meetings. 
No substantial changes were made to the remuneration 
arrangements for the Executive Directors, other than to 
introduce malus arrangements for the PSP , SMP and annual 
performance bonus arrangements. Other routine matters 
discussed at Committee meetings included the annual 
salary review, bonus target setting and long term incentive 
awards, together with the determination of prior year 
target achievements in respect of the short and longer 
term incentive plans. The Committee also reviewed the 
remuneration arrangements of the cadre of senior 
management (ca. 70 managers) across the Group.

The Committee believes it is important that remuneration 
policy and structure continues to be targeted to deliver long 
term shareholder value. The Committee is also aware of 
investors’ preference for simplicity and transparency. Against 
that background, the Committee intends to undertake a 
review of remuneration arrangements during the coming 
financial year and should there be any changes to the 
Remuneration Policy, they will be submitted for shareholder 
approval at the AGM in January 2015.
The Committee welcomes dialogue with shareholders 
on remuneration matters and aims to ensure that the 
remuneration policy supports the business strategy and is 
closely aligned to the interests of the Company’s shareholders. 
I hope you will find this report of the Committee’s work 
comprehensive and understandable and that you will join 
me in supporting the two resolutions in respect of this year’s 
Remuneration Committee Report at the Company’s AGM 
on 15 January 2014.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (”the Committee”) is chaired by 
John Nicholas and comprises independent non‑ Executive 
Directors.
Bruce Thompson, Chief Executive, attends meetings at the 
invitation of the Committee to provide advice to the Committee 
to help it make informed decisions. The Group Company 
Secretary attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
The Report which follows has been prepared in accordance 
with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium‑ sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations SI 2008/410 
(as amended) which came into force on 1 October 2013.
Changes to the Remuneration Committee Report
The Report is presented in two sections as required under the 
new regulations:
•	 Directors’ Remuneration Policy – set out on pages 52 to 57.
•	 Annual Report on Remuneration – set out on pages 58 to 65.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is subject to a binding vote 
of shareholders at the forthcoming AGM on 15 January 2014. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration continues to be subject 
to an advisory vote by shareholders at the AGM.
Remuneration principles and structure
The Committee has adopted remuneration principles which 
are designed to ensure that senior executive remuneration:
•	 is aligned to the business strategy and the achievement of 
planned business goals;
•	 supports the creation of sustainable long‑ term shareholder 
value;
•	 provides an appropriate balance between remuneration 
elements that attract, retain and motivate the right calibre 
of executive talent; and
•	 encourages a high‑ performance culture by ensuring 
performance‑ related remuneration constitutes a substantial 
proportion of the remuneration package and by linking 
maximum payout opportunity to outstanding results.
The Remuneration Policy table on pages 52 and 53 outlines 
the principles behind each key element of remuneration, the 
opportunity for each Director in the year ahead and a brief 
summary of how it works. A more detailed explanation of how 
the incentive plans work can be found on page 54.

Executive Director’s potential value of 2014 remuneration package
1 Base salary is as at 1 October 2013; benefits are as set out on page 58.
On‑ Target performance assumes an annual performance bonus of 60% of salary for the CEO and 50% of salary for the other 
two Executive Directors. It has been assumed that a face value limit of 100% of base salary applies to each PSP and SMP award. 
On‑ target vesting of the LTIPs assumes adjusted EPS performance of RPI plus 5.5% p.a. and TSR performance of median plus 
3.5% p.a. which is equivalent to 50% of the vesting under the PSP and 25% of the awards vesting under the SMP . Maximum 
performance assumes maximum annual performance bonus and maximum vesting of LTIP schemes. In all cases, for simplicity 
no share price growth is assumed.  54

acquire or pledge shares for a period of three years. These 
acquired or pledged shares are held by a nominee for the 
Executive Director and are released at the end of the three 
year performance period applying to the awards.
Awards, which are normally granted annually, must generally 
be made within 42 days after the announcement of the 
Company’s annual results. When making the decision on the 
level of award, the Committee takes into consideration a 
number of factors, including the face value of the award and 
plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or 
shares under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. The 
relevant share price will be the mid‑market closing share price 
on the day before the award. A face value limit of 100% of base 
salary applies to each PSP award to Executive Directors, 
although the Committee, at its discretion, may increase the 
face value of an award to a maximum of 150% in exceptional 
circumstances. A face value limit of up to 100% of base salary 
applies to each SMP award in respect of which the Executive 
Director must pledge shares equal to 50% of base salary 
after tax.
All awards will normally vest on the date on which the 
performance conditions are determined and confirmed by 
the Committee. The vesting of awards is conditional on:
•	 continued employment;
•	 the Company’s growth in adjusted EPS over a three year 
performance period; and
•	 the Company’s TSR performance over a three year 
performance period.
The latter two performance conditions apply to each award 
so that the vesting of 50% of the award is based on growth in 
adjusted EPS and 50% of the award is based on the relative TSR 
performance. Each performance condition is measured over a 
three year period commencing on the first day of the financial 
year in which the award is made. There is no retesting of either 
performance metric. 30% of the Performance Share Plan 
awards and 15% of the Share Matching Plan awards will vest at 
the minimum performance threshold.
The Committee will regularly monitor the continuing suitability 
of the performance conditions and may impose different 
conditions on awards granted in subsequent years, having 
regard to prevailing market conditions.
The Committee may decide, on or before the grant of a share 
incentive award, that on exercise of the award, the participant 
may receive, in addition to the shares to which he then 
becomes entitled, a payment equal in value to the aggregate 
amount of the dividends (excluding any tax credit) which 
would have been paid to the participant in respect of those 
shares between the date on which the award vests (and the 
option period commences) and the date on which the option 
is exercised, as if they had been beneficially owned by him 
over that period. These payments are referred to as dividend 
equivalent payments and may be made in cash or in an 
equivalent number of shares.
Executive Directors
Base salary
In determining the annual base salary increases which apply 
from 1 October, the Committee considers comparative 
salaries in similar companies and the range of remuneration 
increases applying across the Group and in particular for the 
Group’s senior management cadre comprising ca. 70 senior 
managers across the Group’s businesses.
Annual Performance Bonus
The Diploma PLC Annual Performance Bonus Plan is a cash 
based scheme designed to reward Executive Directors for 
meeting stretching shorter term performance targets. At the 
start of the financial year (1 October), the Board sets a financial 
performance target principally focused on achievement of a 
target adjusted EPS, which to pay‑ out at the maximum is 
significantly ahead of both internal annual budgets and market 
consensus. The Committee has discretion to reduce awards if 
minimum thresholds are not achieved for operating margins, 
free cash flow and return on trading capital employed 
(“ROTCE”). The level of bonus payable for achieving the 
minimum EPS target is 5% of the maximum.
Different performance measures and weightings may be used 
for future cycles of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan to 
those set out in the Policy Table to take into account changes 
in the business strategy.
Individual objectives are also set for the Chief Operating 
Officer and the Group Finance Director relating to factors 
including operating performance, business and management 
development activities. At the end of the financial year, the 
Committee meets to assess the performance of each 
Executive Director against the financial and individual 
objectives. Bonuses are normally paid in cash in December.
Long Term Incentive Plans
The Company operates long term incentive arrangements for 
Executive Directors. These are designed to reward and retain 
Executive Directors over the longer term, while also aligning 
their interests with those of Diploma PLC shareholders. These 
arrangements comprise two incentive plans; the Diploma PLC 
2011 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) and the Diploma PLC 
2011 Share Matching Plan (“SMP”). 
The PSP , in which the Executive Directors of the Company 
participate, provides for a grant of conditional awards of a 
specified number of ordinary shares in the Company, or an 
option to acquire a specified number of shares at an exercise 
price determined by the Committee (which may be nil or a 
nominal amount). No payment is required for the grant of 
an award.
The SMP operates for Executive Directors of the Company, as 
a form of deferred reward and again provides for a grant of 
conditional awards of a specified number of ordinary shares in 
the Company. In the case of the SMP an Executive Director 
must accept an invitation from the Committee to personally

Directors’ Remuneration Policy 55
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
•	 Vesting of award shares under the Company’s long term 
incentive plans is not automatic and the Committee would 
retain discretion to allow partial vesting depending on the 
extent to which performance conditions had been met at 
the date of cessation and the length of time the awards 
have been held. Time pro‑rating may be disapplied if the 
Committee considers it appropriate, given the circumstances.
•	 The Committee will also provide for the leaver to be 
reimbursed for a reasonable level of legal fees in 
connection with a settlement agreement.
When calculating termination payments, the Committee will 
also take into account a variety of factors, including individual 
and Company performance, the obligation for the Executive 
Director in appropriate circumstances to mitigate loss (for 
example, by gaining new employment) and the Executive 
Director’s length of service.
Change of control
Change of control provisions have been set in accordance 
with best practice at the relevant time and provide for 
compensation equal to the value of salary, pension and 
contractual benefits for the notice period.
In the event of a change in control, vesting of award shares 
under the Company’s long term incentive plans depends on 
the extent to which performance conditions had been met at 
that time. Time pro‑rating may be disapplied if the Committee 
considers it appropriate, given the circumstances of the 
change of control.
Malus
Malus provisions (also known as ‘soft clawback’) apply to 
awards made since 1 October 2012 under the Company’s 
share incentive and annual bonus plans which give the 
Committee the right to cancel or reduce unvested share 
awards (or in the case of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan, 
cash payments) in the event of material misstatement of the 
Company’s financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s 
entitlement or individual gross misconduct.
Remuneration for new appointments
The Committee has determined that under normal 
circumstances, new Executive Directors will receive 
a compensation package in accordance with Company 
remuneration policy for base salary, benefits, bonuses 
and long term incentive awards. 
The Committee has agreed the following principles that will 
apply when arranging a remuneration package to recruit new 
Executive Directors:
•	 The remuneration structure will be kept simple where 
practicable, hence the use of Base Salary, Benefits, Pension 
(or cash allowance in lieu), Annual Performance Bonus and 
Long Term Incentives;
Service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, including 
arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered 
by the Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and 
motivate directors of the calibre required to manage the 
Company and successfully deliver its strategic objectives. 
The Committee considers that a rolling contract with a notice 
period of one year is appropriate for existing and newly 
appointed directors. A longer initial period of notice, that 
would reduce to one year in accordance with the Code, may 
be used on occasion to successfully complete the recruitment 
of an external candidate.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, which were drafted 
in accordance with best practice at the relevant time, contain 
provisions for compensation in the event of early termination or 
change of control, equal to the value of salary and contractual 
benefits, including pension, for the notice period. However 
when calculating termination payments, the Committee takes 
into account a variety of factors, which will normally include 
individual and Company performance, the obligation for the 
Director in appropriate circumstances to mitigate loss (for 
example, by gaining new employment) and the Director’s 
length of service.
The Committee considers that these provisions assist with 
recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore 
in the best interests of shareholders.
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who 
served during the year are set out below:

Other remuneration policies
Payment for loss of office
The Committee has considered the Company’s policy on 
remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company 
and is committed to applying a consistent approach to ensure 
that the Company pays no more than is necessary.
The loss of office payment policy is generally in line with 
market practice and will depend on whether the departing 
Executive Director is, or is deemed to be treated as, a “good 
leaver” or a “bad leaver”. In the case of a “good leaver” the 
policy normally includes:
•	 Notice period of 12 months’ base salary, pension and 
contractual benefits or payment in lieu of notice;
•	 Bonus payable for the period worked, subject to 
achievement of the relevant performance condition. 
Different performance measures (to the other Executive 
Directors) may be set for a departing director as 
appropriate, to reflect any change in responsibility. 56
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Diploma PLC
•	 The emphasis on linking pay with performance shall 
continue; hence the use of variable pay in the form of an 
Annual Performance Bonus and a long term incentive 
award, which will continue to be a significant component 
of the Executive Directors’ total remuneration package;
•	 In setting base salary the Committee will take into 
consideration both the existing salary package of the new 
Executive Director and the level of previous experience; 
in setting the annual performance bonus, the Committee 
may wish to set different performance metrics (to those 
applying to the other Executive Directors) in the first year 
of appointment;
•	 The policy shall be set so as to align the interests of 
Executive Directors (including their direct reports) with 
those of shareholders, hence the use of Long Term 
Incentive Plans linked to growth in both total shareholder 
return and earnings per share;
•	 The maximum level of variable remuneration would be in 
line with the existing level of variable remuneration granted 
to the current Executive Directors;
•	 The Committee wishes to have the ability to make buy‑ out 
awards to a new Executive Director to facilitate their 
recruitment in accordance with the rules of the UK Listing 
Authority.  Any such award would only be made in 
exceptional circumstances, would not exceed the expected 
value being forfeited and would include performance and 
timing conditions appropriate to the Company; and
•	 Relocation costs which are reasonable and appropriate 
may be paid.
Committee discretion
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under 
which it operates. In addition, it complies with rules which 
have either been approved by shareholders (Long Term 
Incentive Plan) or by the Board (Annual Performance Bonus 
Plan). These rules provide the Committee with certain 
discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of 
the Remuneration Policy is fair both to the individual director 
and to shareholders, taking overall performance and position 
of the Company into account. The Committee also has 
discretions to set components of remuneration within a range 
from time to time. The extent of such discretions are set out in 
the relevant rules or in the maximum opportunity for 
performance metrics sections of the Policy Table.
In addition, the  Committee requires discretion to deal with 
genuinely exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. This form 
of discretion will only be applied in the best interests of the 
Company and is intended to provide for changed 
circumstances or strategy that has not been provided for in the 
Remuneration Policy, when it would be disproportionate to 
seek specific approval from a general meeting of shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee will not exercise discretion to 
reward failure and will report on any exercise of discretion that 
changes the amount of remuneration paid in any year.
Dilution
In any ten‑year period, the number of shares which are or may 
be issued under option or other share awards under any 
executive share plan established by the Company may not 
exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
from time to time. In any ten‑year period, the aggregate 
number of shares which are or may be issued under option, 
or other share awards under all share plans established by the 
Company, may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company, from time to time.
Consultation with shareholders and employees
The Committee will consult with its major shareholders in 
advance of any significant changes to the approved 
Remuneration Policy. The Committee also receives reports 
from the Group Company Secretary on correspondence 
received from shareholders relating to remuneration matters 
when their approval of the Remuneration Committee Report 
is sought at the AGM.
The Committee has not consulted with employees on setting 
the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors.
Comparison with employee conditions
In determining annual increases in base salary, annual 
performance bonuses and benefits, the Committee takes into 
account the employment conditions applying across the senior 
management cadre. This comparator group comprises ca. 
70 senior managers across the Group’s businesses. This senior 
management cadre has been chosen as a representative 
group, since comparisons drawn from across the globe and 
by differing roles, skills, experience and qualifications would 
reduce the scope for meaningful comparisons.

Recruitment and term
The Board aims to recruit non‑Executive Directors of a high calibre, with broad and diverse commercial, international 
or other relevant experience. Non‑Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee.
Appointments of the non‑Executive Directors are for an initial term of three years, subject to election by shareholders at the 
first general meeting following their appointment and subject to annual re‑election thereafter. The terms of engagement are 
set out in letters of appointment which can be terminated by either party serving three months’ notice. 
Chairman
John Rennocks was appointed as a non‑Executive Director of the Company with effect from 12 July 2002 and as Chairman 
with effect from 7 January 2004. John Rennocks was re‑appointed at the Annual General Meeting held on 16 January 2013 
and his appointment will continue to be subject to annual re‑election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Fees
The non‑Executive Directors are paid a competitive basic annual fee which is approved by the Board on the recommendation 
of the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The Chairman’s fee is approved by the Committee, excluding the Chairman. 
Additional fees may also be payable for chairing a Committee of the Board or for acting as Senior Independent Director. 
The fees are reviewed each year and take account of the fees paid in other companies of a similar size and complexity, 
the responsibilities and the required time commitment.
The non‑Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s share plans, incentive plans or pension 
schemes and there is no provision for payment in the event of early termination. 58

Performance conditions
Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the LTIP awards vesting in 2013 and the 
outstanding LTIP awards, including those granted in 2012. Performance Share Plan awards at 100% of salary and Share Matching 
Plan awards of 100% of salary will be granted in December 2013. The performance conditions applying to the awards will be the 
same as those set out below for existing awards.
The first performance condition is that the average annual compound growth in the Company’s adjusted EPS, over the three 
consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual compound 
growth rate in the UK Retail Price Index (“RPI”) by a specified amount over the same period. Currently, the performance 
conditions for all outstanding awards are as follows:
% of awards vesting
Adjusted EPS growth (over 3 years) PSP SMP
RPI + 15% p.a. or above 100 100
RPI + 12% p.a. 100 50
RPI + 3% p.a. 30 15
Below RPI + 3% p.a. Nil Nil 60
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Diploma PLC
Where the Company’s adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight line 
basis. For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The 
definition of adjusted EPS remains consistent with the definition of EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Company’s TSR over a three year period to that of the 
companies in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). Currently, the performance conditions are as follows:
% of awards vesting
PSP SMP
Median + 15% p.a. or greater 100 100
Median + 12% p.a. 100 50
Median 30 15
Below Median Nil Nil
The FTSE 250 index was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2013
The PSP and SMP awards made to the Executive Directors on 24 and 27 January 2011 respectively, were subject to independently 
operating performance conditions, assessed over a three year period ended 30 September 2013, as set out in the table above.

Long Term Incentive Plan – awards granted in the year
The Executive Directors received grants of Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan awards on 19 December 2012 
and 20 December 2012 respectively, in the form of nil‑ cost options. These awards were based on the mid‑ market price of an 
ordinary share in the Company at close of business on the day immediately preceding the award. Under the Share Matching 
Plan, the Executive Directors are required to pledge shares for a minimum period of three years; these shares are pledged on 
an after tax basis and awards are made on a pre‑ tax basis. 
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the 
end of the three‑ year measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made, and 
provided the Director remains in employment. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance 
criteria at the end of the three‑ year measurement period. The performance conditions for these awards are set out on pages 
59 and 60.
Outstanding share based performance awards 
Set out below is a summary of the share based awards outstanding at 30 September 2013, including both share awards which 
have vested during the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year. All of the awards 
set out below were granted based on a face value limit of 100% of base salary. No awards will vest unless the performance 
conditions set out on pages 59 and 60 are achieved over a three year measurement period.

The vesting date for the Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan awards granted on 24 January and 27 January 2011 
respectively, have been modified in accordance with the rules of both Plans so that such awards will vest on the date on which 
the performance conditions are determined following the end of the performance period on 30 September 2013, as opposed to 
the third anniversary of their date of grant. This change has been made to align the timing of the grant and vesting of awards with 
the announcement of Group’s annual results.
Both the Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan awards are granted in the form of nil‑ cost options (there is a notional 
exercise price of £1 per award). To the extent that the awards vest, the options are then exercisable until the tenth anniversary of 
the award date. Details of options exercised during the year and outstanding at 30 September 2013 are set out on page 64.
Services from external advisors
Stephenson Harwood LLP provides legal advice to the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters. During the current 
year, this advice largely related to the implications of the Government’s proposals to improve corporate communication on 
executive pay, formalising the Annual Performance Bonus Plan and advising on the introduction of malus arrangements in the 
incentive plans. Stephenson Harwood LLP does not advise the Group on other issues.
In September 2013 the Committee also appointed New Bridge Street to provide general advice on remuneration policy and also 
engages MEIS to provide certain data analysis to the Committee. 
The Committee has considered and is satisfied that the advice received from the external advisors it has appointed is objective 
and independent.

Executive Director’s interest in options over shares
In respect of nil cost options granted under the PSP and SMP , the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated 
on the date that the options first vest. The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the 
Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the 
vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date (he may exercise the options at any time 
up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant), any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised 
will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option. 
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded 
as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2013 and the movement during the year are as follows:

Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership. These 
specify that, over a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain 
a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary. The guideline holding for other Executive Directors is 100% of 
base salary. The guidelines also require that, in relation to LTIP awards, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the 
individual until the required shareholding level is reached. As at 15 November 2013, all Executive Directors exceeded the 
applicable shareholding guidelines.

The non‑Executive Directors received a basic annual fee during the year and there were no additional fees paid in 2013 and 2012 
for chairing a Committee of the Board or for acting as Senior Independent Director. The fees for non‑Executive Directors are 
reviewed every year by the Board, taking into account their responsibilities and required time commitment. Following a review 
undertaken in November 2013, the Board approved an increase in the Chairman’s fees to £130,000 per annum (2013: £125,000) 
and in the annual fees paid to non‑Executive Directors to £45,000 (2013: £43,000); both to take effect from 1 October 2013.

Senior Executives below the Board
The policies and practices with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors are generally 
treated consistently with the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward package 
linked to performance. Annual bonuses are linked to short term financial targets which use similar performance metrics to the 
targets for the Executive Directors. They also participate in cash based long term incentive plans which are focused on the 
operating profit growth of their businesses over rolling three year periods. The Committee reviews and monitors the senior 
executive remuneration arrangements. 66

Directors’ Report
This section contains information which the Directors are required by law and regulation to include within the Annual 
Report & Accounts.
Shareholders
Incorporation and principal activity
Diploma PLC is domiciled in England and registered in England 
& Wales under Company Number 3899848. At the date of this 
Report there were 113,239,555 ordinary shares of 5p each in 
issue, all of which are fully paid up and quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Group is the supply of specialised 
technical products and services. A description and review of 
the activities of the Group during the financial year and an 
indication of future developments is set out on pages 4 to 37; 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37 incorporates the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at midday on 
Wednesday, 15 January 2014 in the Brewers Hall, 
Aldermanbury Square, London EC2V 7HR. A Circular setting 
out the proposed resolutions, including a resolution to 
re‑ appoint Deloitte LLP as the auditor, will be set out in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting which is a separate 
document which will be sent to all shareholders and published 
on the Group’s website.
Substantial shareholdings
At 15 November 2013 the Company had been notified of the 
following interests amounting to 3% or more of the voting 
rights in its ordinary share capital:
Percentage 
of ordinary 
share capital
Mondrian Investment Partners Ltd 8.49%
F&C Asset Management plc 5.04%
Standard Life Investments Ltd 4.41%
Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd 4.06%
Fidelity Management & Research Co 4.00%

Baillie Gifford & Co. 3.95%
Royal London Asset Management Ltd 3.47%
Blackrock Inc. 3.24%
Schroders PLC 3.21%
Legal & General Investment Management Limited 3.06%
As far as the Directors are aware there were no other interests 
above 3% of the issued ordinary share capital.
Share capital
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well 
as the powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be 
obtained from the Group Company Secretary and are 
available on the Company’s website.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfers 
of securities and/or voting rights, other than those relating to 
the Company’s Share Matching Plan, described further below. 
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company’s 
Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution 
of the Company’s shareholders.
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority, all employees are required to seek approval of the 
Company before dealing in its shares.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated 
share that is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not 
prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place 
on an open and proper basis, or where the Company has 
lien over that share. The Directors may also refuse to register 
a transfer of a certificated share, unless the instrument of 
transfer is: (i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the 
registered office of the Company or any other place as the 
Board may decide accompanied by the certificate for the 
share(s) to be transferred and/or such other evidence as the 
Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer: (ii) in respect of only one class 
of shares; (iii) in favour of a person who is not a minor, infant, 
bankrupt or a person of unsound mind; or (iv) in favour of not 
more than four persons jointly.
Transfers of certificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an 
uncertified share in accordance with the regulations governing 
the operation of CREST.
Participants in the Company’s Share Matching Plan pledge 
investment shares to a nominee for a period of three years, 
during which period these shares cannot be transferred. There 
are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in 
the Company except certain restrictions which may from time 
to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example 
insider trading laws); or where a shareholder with at least a 
0.25% interest in the Company’s certified shares has been 
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares. Other than shares held by participants of the 
Company’s Share Matching Plan, the Directors are not aware 
of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
Shares held by the Diploma Employee Benefit Trust
While ordinary shares are held within the Diploma Employee 
Benefit Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are 
exercisable by the Trustees in accordance with their fiduciary 
duties. The Trustees of the Diploma Employee Benefit Trust 
also waive dividends on all shares held for the purposes of the 
Company’s long term incentive arrangements. 68
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot shares 
in specific circumstances for cash, otherwise than pro rata to 
existing shareholders, were given to the Directors by 
resolutions approved at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company held on 16 January 2013. In the year ended 30 
September 2013, the Company has not allotted any shares. 
These powers will expire at the conclusion of the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting and resolutions to renew the Directors’ 
powers are therefore included within the Notice of the Annual 
General Meeting 2014.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given 
to the Directors by a special resolution at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held on 16 January 2013. In the year 
to 30 September 2013 the Company has not acquired any of 
its own shares. This authority will expire at the conclusion of 
the 2014 Annual General Meeting and a resolution to renew 
the authority is therefore included within the Notice of the 
Annual General Meeting in 2014.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
During the year, the UK Government introduced a requirement 
that UK listed companies should report their global levels of 
Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions in their Annual Report 
and Accounts. The mandatory requirement is for disclosure 
of scope 1 and 2 only (direct emissions, e.g. heating, cooling, 
transport fuel and indirect emissions, e.g. from purchased 
electricity) and only to the extent that such emissions are the 
responsibility of the Company.
The Company has not in the past collected the data necessary 
to meet these GHG emissions reporting requirements and 
therefore is not able to comply with these new reporting 
requirements at 30 September 2013. A task force has been 
set up to establish the scope of information required and the 
processes required to collect the relevant data. The Company 
should therefore be able to meet these disclosure 
requirements when it reports to shareholders for the year 
ending 30 September 2014.
Financial 
Results and dividends
The profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders 
was £34.5m (2012: £31.3m). The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of 10.7p per ordinary share (2012: 10.2p), to be paid, if 
approved, on 22 January 2014. This, together with the interim 
dividend of 5.0p per ordinary share paid on 19 June 2013 
amounts to 15.7p for the year (2012: 14.4p).
The results are shown more fully in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 70 to 97 and summarised in the Finance 
Review on pages 16 to 18.
Directors’ assessment of going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on 
pages 16 to 18. In addition, pages 82 to 84 of the Annual 
Report & Accounts include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources, together with 
a broad spread of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas and sectors, often secured with longer term 
agreements. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Group also has a committed revolving bank facility of 
£20m which expires on 30 June 2014. The Directors are 
confident that this facility will be successfully renegotiated 
prior to expiry on 30 June 2014. At 30 September 2013, the 
Group had cash funds of £19.3m and had no borrowings.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report & Accounts.
Statement of disclosure
Each of the Directors has reviewed this Annual Report & 
Accounts and confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
& Accounts, including the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union (“EU”) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations 
and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Standards (UK Accounting Standards).
Directors’ Report continued 69
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial position 
and the performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 
provides in relation to such financial statements, that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view, are references 
to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•	 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•	 For the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted 
by the EU;
•	 For the Parent Company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Parent Company financial statements;
•	 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
•	 The Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, and the Parent Company financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group and Parent Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; 
•	 The Annual Report & Accounts includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group; and
•	 The Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2013
1. General Information
Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6AX. The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 18 November 
2013. These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except where 
otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as 
adopted by the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with “UK GAAP”, and are set out 
in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 98 and 99.
2. Alternative Performance Measures
The Group uses a number of alternative (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”)) financial measures which are not 
defined within IFRS. The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and as 
such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are 
referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts.
2.1 Adjusted operating profit
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted operating profit” is defined as operating profit before amortisation and 
impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses and adjustments to deferred consideration (collectively, “acquisition 
related charges”). The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational 
performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted profit before tax” is separately disclosed, being defined as profit before tax 
and before the costs of restructuring or rationalisation of operations, the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses or property, fair 
value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests and acquisition related charges. The Directors 
believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share
“Adjusted earnings per share” is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but excluding the tax impact 
on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit and the tax effects of goodwill in overseas jurisdictions, less profit attributable 
to minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe that 
adjusted earnings per share provides an important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow
At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, “free cash flow” is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating 
activities, after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure 
on business combinations/investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Company’s shareholders. The 
Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future investment.
2.5 Trading capital employed
In the segment analysis in note 3, “trading capital employed” is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and 
after adding back borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax, amounts in respect of future purchases of minority interests 
and adjusting for goodwill in respect of the recognition of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets. Return on trading capital 
employed is defined as the adjusted operating profit, divided by trading capital employed plus all historical goodwill and adjusted for 
the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals. Return on trading capital employed at the sector level does not include historical 
goodwill. The Directors believe that return on trading capital employed is an important measure of the underlying performance of 
the Group.
3. Business Segment Analysis
For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. 
These segments form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below. The principal activities of each of these segments is 
described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers; there is no inter-
segment revenue. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable 
basis to a business segment. Segment liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and corporate 
liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business segment. These items are shown collectively in the following 
analysis as “unallocated assets” and “unallocated liabilities”, respectively. 75

5. Group Employee Costs
The key management of the Group are the Executive and non-Executive Directors who have authority and responsibility for planning 
and controlling all significant activities of the Group. The Directors’ emoluments and their interests in shares of the Company are given 
in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 50 to 65. The amount charged against operating profit in the year in respect of 
Director short term remuneration was in aggregate £1.8m (2012: £2.0m). The charge for share-based payments of £0.5m (2012: £0.8m) 
relate to the Group’s share schemes for the Executive Directors, described in the Remuneration Committee Report. The fair value of 
services provided as consideration for part of the grant of the LTIP awards has been based on a predicted future value model and 
was £0.2m (2012: £0.3m).

7. Tax Expense

Current tax
The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises:
 UK corporation tax 2.7 3.3
 Overseas tax 12.1 11.8
14.8 15.1
Adjustments in respect of prior year:
 Overseas tax (0.3) (0.1)
Total current tax 14.5 15.0
Deferred tax
The net deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises:
 United Kingdom 0.1 (0.1)
 Overseas (0.9) (0.5)
Total deferred tax (0.8) (0.6)
Total tax on profit for the year 13.7 14.4
In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement 
benefit scheme and cash flow hedges of £0.1m (2012: £0.3m) was credited directly to the Consolidated Statement of Income and 
Other Comprehensive Income. A further £0.6m (2012: £0.6m) was credited to equity which relates to share-based payments made 
during the year. This represented a current tax credit of £1.3m (2012: £nil) less a deferred tax debit of £0.7m (2012: £0.6m credit).
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year:
The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax and 
the amounts set out above is as follows:
2013
£m
2012
£m
Profit before tax 48.5 46.0
T ax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 23.5% (2012: 25%) 11.4 11.5
Effects of:
  change in UK tax rates 0.2 0.2
  higher tax rates on overseas earnings 2.5 2.7
  adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years (0.3) (0.1)
  other permanent differences (0.1) 0.1
T otal tax on profit for the year 13.7 14.4
The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas. The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 24% to 23% on 31 March 2013; 
however as the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK 
corporation tax in respect of the year ended 30 September 2013 was 23.5% (2012: 25%) and this rate has been used for tax on profit in 
the above reconciliation. The Group’s net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the US 
are taxed at rates of up to 38%. 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and a further reduction to 20% (effective from 
1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
These reductions in the UK corporation tax rate are likely to lead to a further reduction in the future UK current tax charge. The UK 
deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2013 have been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at 
30 September 2013.

9. Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary 5p share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year of 112,454,287 (2012: 112,373,327) and the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of £34.5m (2012: £31.3m). 
There are no potentially dilutive shares.

The Directors carry out an impairment test on all goodwill generally twice a year. Goodwill is ascribed to a business which, for the 
purpose of these impairment tests, is referred to as a cash generating unit. The impairment test requires each cash generating unit to 
prepare “value in use” valuations using discounted cash flow forecasts. The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual 
budgets prepared by each business and on the Group’s five year strategic plan.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margin, growth rates and discount rates. The gross 
margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience; growth rates generally approximate to the 
long term average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such 
as start-ups. The annual growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts in respect of the next five years vary between 2% and 5% in each 
of the Sectors; these annual growth rates then trend down towards 2% over the longer term. 
The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a pre-tax discount rate of ca. 13% (2012: 13%). This rate is 
based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses with robust capital structures, which is broadly 
consistent with each of the Group’s businesses.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions to determine whether a “reasonably possible change” 
in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. This analysis indicates that a “reasonably possible change” in 
these key assumptions would be unlikely to give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the businesses in the Life Sciences 
or Controls Sectors. However, in the Seals Sector a reduction of 2% in revenue growth in the medium term in one of the businesses 
in this Sector would result in an impairment charge of up to £0.8m. Before any sensitivities and based on the original assumptions in 
respect of this business in the Seals Sector, the headroom in the cashflow valuation was £1.0m. In the prior year, the sensitivity analysis 
indicated that a reduction of 2% in revenue growth in the medium term in a business in the Controls Sector would have resulted in an 
impairment of £0.3m. This business is no longer at risk of impairment in 2013.

No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies as the Group controls the dividend policies 
of its subsidiaries. Unremitted earnings may be liable to additional overseas withholding tax (after allowing for double taxation relief)

19. Financial Instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than a limited number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and 
short term deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities. Trade 
and other receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Group’s day-to-day operations. 
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management. 
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on page 
35 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties, which has been audited. 
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations; this arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances (including 
deposits) held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small 
privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world. Trade receivable exposures are 
managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer. 
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other 
receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision is 
written off against the underlying receivable. The Group has not had any material irrecoverable trade receivables in the past five years. 
Exposure to financial counterparty credit risk is controlled by the Group treasury team in establishing and monitoring counterparty 
limits. Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is “AA” or better.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:

Trade receivables 39.5 37.0

There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date. An analysis of 
the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16. An analysis of cash and 
cash equivalents is set out in note 18.

19. Financial Instruments continued
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group continually monitors 
net funds and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, medium 
and long term. Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2013 all covenants have been 
complied with fully. 
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on 
deposits. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also 
has a committed £20m revolving bank facility (with an option to increase its facility to £40m, subject to market pricing) which expires 
on 30 June 2014. Interest on this facility is payable at between 150 and 195 bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA. At 30 September 2013, none of the facility had been drawn down (2012: £3.5m). 
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows: 
2013
£m
2012 
£m
Expiring within one year 20.0 –
Expiring after one year but within two years – 16.5
The Group’s financial liabilities are as follows:

Trade payables 23.2 20.5
Other payables 1.5 3.1
Other liabilities 3.0 3.8
Borrowings – 3.5
27.7 30.9
The maturities of the undiscounted financial liabilities are as follows:
Less than one year 26.8 26.4
One-two years 1.1 3.5
Two-five years – 1.2
27.9 31.1
Less: Discount (0.2) (0.2)
27.7 30.9
There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date. 
c) Currency risk
The Group’s currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian 
dollars, Euros and Australian dollars. The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash 
equivalents and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively. Net foreign exchange gains of £0.1m 
(2012: £0.1m losses) were recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Group’s businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure to 
movements in the US dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro. These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges 
and are stated at fair value. The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2013 was £15.4m (2012: £13.4m). The net fair 
value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2013 was negligible (2012: £0.3m liability). The amount 
removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was 
£0.2m debit (2012: £0.5m debit). The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the 
year was negligible (2012: £0.4m debit).
The currency risk arising from both translational and transactional risks are described further on page 35 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties.
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s results. The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from 
its cash funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates. All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term 
basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate. 
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one to 
six months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate. An increase of 1% in interest 
rates would not have a significant impact on the Group’s adjusted profit before tax.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents at the reporting dates is set out in note 18.  84

19. Financial Instruments continued
e) Fair values
There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value. The basis for determining 
fair values are as follows:
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contract’s value date, and gains and losses 
taken to equity. No contract’s value date is greater than 12 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
Other liabilities
The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
f) Capital management risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide strong 
returns to shareholders which will support the future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash 
and cash equivalents, short term debt (which includes bank borrowings) and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital 
management during the year. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or increase bank borrowings.

At 30 September 2013 the Group retained put options to acquire minority interests in M Seals, DSL and HPS all of which are exercisable 
within the next 18 months. On 8 January 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 20% minority interest in Big Green Surgical Pty 
Limited (“BGS”), as explained in note 21. 
At 30 September 2013 the estimate of the financial liability to acquire the outstanding minority shareholdings was reassessed by 
the Directors, based on their current estimate of the future performance of these businesses and to reflect foreign exchange rates 
at 30 September 2013. This led to a remeasurement of the fair value of these put options and the liability was reduced by £0.1m 
(2012: increased £0.1m). This reduction was offset by the charge from unwinding the discount on the liability and in aggregate 
£0.2m (2012: £0.2m) has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.

his outstanding minority interest during the year. This is payable in two instalments in November 2013 and 2014. Deferred consideration 
of £0.3m was paid on 27 September 2013 to the vendors of CMI in full and final satisfaction of their outstanding deferred consideration 
and £0.3m was paid on 17 July 2013 to the vendor of Amfast in final settlement of the performance payment.

Mr A Bennett. The maximum consideration payable is £0.9m (A$1.4m), including deferred consideration of £0.5m (A$0.8m), based on 
the achievement of certain gross profit targets for FY2013 and FY2014. On completion, the initial cash consideration paid was £0.4m 
(A$0.6m) and £0.2m (A$0.3m) has been provided as deferred consideration at 30 September 2013.
22. Acquisition of Business
On 2 November 2012, the Group acquired the trade and net assets of Rayquick GmbH (“Rayquick”) for consideration of £1.2m (€1.4m) 
from Mr S Rinas, which was settled in cash. Acquisition intangible assets of £0.6m and goodwill of £0.5m arose on this acquisition. The 
goodwill is represented by prospects for revenue growth from new customers. Goodwill and acquisition intangible assets relating to 
these acquisitions of £1.1m will be allowable for a tax deduction (£0.2m) in future years.
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2013, the Rayquick business contributed £1.3m to revenue and £0.4m to adjusted 
operating profit; if this acquisition had been completed at the beginning of the financial year, the contribution to revenue and adjusted 
operating profit would not have been materially different.

25. Retirement Benefit Obligations
The Group maintains a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK called Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”). 
The Scheme is closed to further accrual and the assets of the Scheme are held in separate trustee administered funds. The Scheme is 
funded in accordance with rates recommended by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial reviews using the 
projected unit method.

managers. This will no longer be relevant from 1 October 2013 as IAS 19 (revised) requires the replacement of the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest 
charge on pension scheme liabilities with a net financing cost based on the discount rate.

29. Subsequent Events
On 5 November 2013 the Group signed contracts in connection with the acquisition of 80% of Kentek Oy for consideration of up to 
£11.2m (€13.3m), subject to completion of competition enquiries by the authorities in Russia and certain other conditions precedent. 
The business is based in Finland, but much of its activities are carried out across Russia in supplying filters and related products for a 
range of heavy mobile machinery and industrial applications. Kentek Oy will form part of the Seals Sector.
On 17 October 2013 the Group acquired certain trade and goodwill from Sacee International SAS, based in France, for a maximum 
consideration of £0.3m (€0.3m). The business distributes connectors to the Satellite industry and will be absorbed into Filcon in the 
Controls Sector. 90

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
Group Accounting Policies
For the year ended 30 September 2013
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
endorsed by the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in 2012 and the comparative period. 
Other than presentational changes to the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income to identify amounts 
which will and will not be reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement as set out on page 71, there were no new standards, 
amendments and interpretations to existing standards which have been published and endorsed by the EU which have any impact on 
the results, financial position or presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2013.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial 
instruments which are held at fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, 
as discussed on page 68.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those 
detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interests, defined as minority interests, in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the 
Group’s equity therein. Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and 
the minority’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
1.3 Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. Goodwill at the acquisition date represents the cost of the business combination (excluding acquisition related costs, 
which are expensed as incurred) plus the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in excess of the fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Minority interests may be initially measured at fair value or, alternatively, at the minority interest’s proportionate share of the recognised 
amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made for each business combination separately.
1.4 Divestments
The results and cash flows of major lines of businesses that have been divested have been classified as discontinued businesses.
1.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services supplied to customers, after 
deducting sales allowances and value added taxes; revenue receivable for services supplied to customers, as opposed to goods, is less 
than 3% of Group revenue. Revenue is recognised when the risk and rewards of ownership transfers to the customer, which depending 
on individual customer terms, is at the time of despatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. Provision is made for returns 
where appropriate. Service revenue received in advance is deferred and recognised on a pro-rata basis over the period of the contract.
1.6 Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type. The defined benefit scheme 
is closed to the accrual of further benefits.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans: Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as an employee 
benefit expense when they fall due. 91
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
1.6 Employee benefits continued
(b) Defined benefit pension plan: The deficit recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit cost method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using 
interest rates on high quality corporate bonds. The pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plan is recognised as follows:
(i) Within the Consolidated Income Statement:
 – Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments – where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is 
recognised in operating profit;
 – Interest cost on the liabilities of the schemes – calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and major assumptions, including 
the discount rate, at the beginning of the year; and
 – Expected return on the assets of the schemes – calculated by reference to the scheme assets and long term expected rate of 
return at the beginning of the year.
(ii) Within the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income:
 – Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the scheme arising from actual experience and any changes in 
assumptions at the end of the year.
 The Group has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit scheme in the period in 
which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, but in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other  
Comprehensive Income.
 Proposed changes to IAS19 and the impact on the Group have been outlined in note 1.19 below.
(c) Share-based payments
 The Executive Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
the Directors render services in exchange for shares in the Company, or rights over shares (“equity-settled” transactions).
 Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of 
the effect of market based measures, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) targets upon which vesting of part of the award is 
conditional, and is expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding 
credit to equity. The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted to take account of shares forfeited by Executives who leave during the 
performance or vesting period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely that shares will 
vest. For the market based measure, the Directors have used a predicted future value model to determine fair value of the shares at the 
date of grant.
 The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust for the granting of shares to Executives. The cost of shares in the Company 
purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust are shown as a deduction from equity.
1.7 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each entity are translated into UK sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency:
 Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising 
on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement;
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii) Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are retranslated using the exchange rates at the date the fair 
value was determined. Where a gain or loss on non-monetary items is recognised directly in equity, any exchange component of 
that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity and conversely, where a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 92
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Diploma PLC
1.7 Foreign currencies continued
(b) Translation from functional currency to presentational currency:
 When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency, its results and financial 
position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such an average rate 
does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income; 
these cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the foreign 
operation is disposed of.
(c) Net investment in foreign operations:
 Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation 
are recognised in the Income Statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation as 
appropriate. In the consolidated financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income as a separate component of equity and subsequently recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the net investment.
1.8 Taxation
The tax expense relates to the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs from profit before taxation as reported in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Taxable profit excludes items of income and expense that are taxable (or deductible) in other years and also excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Temporary 
differences arise primarily from the recognition of the deficit on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the difference between 
accelerated capital allowances and depreciation and for short term timing differences where a provision held against receivables or 
stock is not deductible for taxation purposes. However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the tax profit, nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is possible that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group controls the 
dividend policies of its subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when the item on which the tax or charged is 
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right 
to enforce current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax relates to the same fiscal authority.

For the year ended 30 September 2013 93
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
1.9 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred 
in bringing the asset into use, but excluding interest. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the 
asset is available for use and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost, less 
residual value of the asset, over its estimated useful life as follows:
Freehold property  – between 20 and 50 years 
Leasehold property  – term of the lease
Plant and equipment  – plant and machinery between 3 and 7 years
  – IT hardware between 3 and 5 years
  – fixtures and fittings between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each 
financial year end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets 
or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount 
if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by 
comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1.10 Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at their amortised cost or fair value less any 
provision for impairment.
(a) Research and development costs
 Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development costs are written off as incurred until it can be demonstrated that the 
conditions for capitalisation as described in IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met. At which point further costs are capitalised as intangible 
assets up until the intangible asset is readily available for production and amortised on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful 
life.
 Costs are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets, such as tooling, exist when they are classified as property, plant 
and equipment.
(b) Computer software costs
 Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised as other intangible 
assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of between three and seven years.
(c) Acquired intangible assets – business combinations
 Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, including, but not limited to, customer lists, supplier lists, 
databases, technology and software and patents and that can be separately measured at fair value, on a reliable basis, are separately 
recognised on acquisition at the fair value, together with the associated deferred tax liability. Amortisation is charged on a straight 
line basis to the Consolidated Income Statement over the expected useful economic lives.
(d) Goodwill – business combinations
 Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration over 
the aggregate fair value of the identifiable intangible, tangible and current assets and net of the aggregate fair value of the liabilities 
(including contingent liabilities of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition). Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost 
and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Impairment testing is carried out annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions is not 
amortised. 94
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Diploma PLC
1.11 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value in use; its 
value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit, discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or 
cash-generating unit. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(a) Impairment of goodwill
 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to a cash-generating unit; cash-generating units for this purpose are 
the business entities which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored by the Group’s Board 
of Directors for internal and management purposes. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
 If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the goodwill attributable to the cash-generating unit.
 An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(b) Impairment of other tangible and intangible assets
 At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
 Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss for tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income 
Statement.
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, (generally calculated on a weighted average cost basis) and net realisable value, after making 
due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory. Cost comprises direct materials, duty and freight-in costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale.
1.13 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
(a) Trade receivables
 Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, do not carry any interest and are reduced by a charge for impairment for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Such impairment charges are recognised in the Income Statement.
(b) Trade payables
 Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are initially measured at their fair value.
(c)  Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, interest bearing deposits, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and can form an integral part of the Group’s cash management system.

(d) Put options held by minority interests
 The purchase price of shares to be acquired under options held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries, are calculated by 
reference to the estimated profitability of the relevant subsidiary at the time of exercise, using a multiple based formula. The net present 
value of the estimated future payments under these put options is shown as a financial liability. The corresponding entry is recognised in 
equity as a deduction against retained earnings. At the end of each year, the estimate of the financial liability is reassessed and any change 
in value is recognised in the Income Statement, as part of finance income or expense. Where the liability is in a foreign currency, any 
change in the value of the liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(e)  Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
 The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the effects of its 
exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange arising from operational and financial activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, 
the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
 Under IAS 39, hedging relationships are categorised by type and must meet strict criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. At the inception 
of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial instruments that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The Group uses cash flow 
hedges (eg forward foreign exchange currency contracts) to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast 
transaction.
 In relation to cash flow hedges, to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. For cash flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised 
in equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the 
net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income is kept in equity until the hedged transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. If a 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the 
Consolidated Income Statement for the year.
 The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities 
that are attributable to a particular risk and could affect the Consolidated Income Statement (fair value hedges). No financial 
instruments are used to hedge net investments in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).
1.14 Investments available for sale financial assets
The investment held by the Group comprises equity shares which are not held for the purposes of equity trading and in accordance with 
IAS 39 is classified as available for sale. They are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair 
value and changes therein are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
1.15 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee. Leases include hire purchase contracts which have characteristics similar to finance or operating leases. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease 
are also spread on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 96
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Diploma PLC
1.16 Other liabilities
Other liabilities are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is possible that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Other liabilities are measured at the Director’s best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
1.17 Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting; interim dividends are charged in the period 
they are paid.
1.18 Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The Group also maintains the following reserves:
(a) Translation reserve – The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign businesses.
(b) Hedging reserve – The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow 
hedging instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge. 
(c) Retained earnings reserve – The retained earnings reserve comprises total cumulative recognised income and expense attributable 
to shareholders. Bonus issues of share capital and dividends to shareholders are also charged directly to this reserve. On acquisition 
of minority interests, the liability held in the consolidated financial statements for the future purchases of those minority interests is 
released to the retained earnings reserve. In addition the cost of acquiring shares in the Company and the liability to provide those 
shares to employees, is accounted for in this reserve. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury shares or 
indirectly within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is 
deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such 
shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and 
the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. These shares are used to satisfy share 
awards granted to Directors under the Group’s share schemes. The trustee purchases the Company’s shares on the open market using 
loans made by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
1.19 Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective
The IASB has published a number of new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards which are not yet effective, 
but will be mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2013. Set out below are those which are 
considered most relevant to the Group:
•	 IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”: makes changes to the recognition and measurement of defined benefit pension expense and to the 
disclosures of certain employee benefits; 
•	 IFRS 10/11/12 “Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests in other Entities”: suite of new 
standards on consolidation and related matters; and
•	 IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”: replacement of existing guidance on fair value measurement in different IFRSs.
Other than as relates to IAS 19 which is discussed further below, the Group has considered the impact of these in future periods and no 
significant impact is expected on reported profit or net assets. 
The amendments to IAS 19, which become effective for the Group from 1 October 2013, will impact the Consolidated Income 
Statement due to the change in the interest rate used to calculate the return on assets; they will also require additional disclosure in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements. If the Group had adopted these amendments to IAS 19 in the year ended 30 September 
2013, the notional income from the defined benefit scheme of £0.2m set out in notes 6 and 25 would have been a notional charge 
of £0.2m.

1.20 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 1 above, 
management has used estimates and judgements to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded. Critical accounting 
estimates and judgements are those which have the greatest impact on the financial statements and require the most difficult and 
subjective judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and 
expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable. However given the judgemental nature of such estimates, 
actual results could be different from the assumptions used. The critical accounting estimates and judgements are set out below:
1.20.1 Goodwill impairment
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group 
over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment of the carrying value of the Group’s 
capitalised goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the “value in use” to the Group of the capitalised goodwill. This 
calculation is usually based on projecting future cash flows over at least a five year period and using a terminal value to incorporate 
expectations of growth thereafter. A discount factor is applied to obtain a current value (“value in use”). The “fair value less costs to sell” 
of an asset is used if this results in an amount in excess of “value in use”.
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are based on management’s expectations of future volumes and margins 
based on plans and best estimates of the productivity of the assets in their current condition. Future cash flows therefore exclude 
benefits from major expansion projects requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure has not been approved at the 
balance sheet date.
Future cash flows are discounted using discount rates based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted if appropriate for 
circumstances specific to the asset being tested. The weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates of interest rates, equity 
returns and market and country related risks. The Group’s weighted average cost of capital is reviewed on an annual basis.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s 
businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the 
Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
1.20.2 Taxation
The Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions around the world. Tax regulations generally are complex and in some jurisdictions 
agreeing tax liabilities with local tax authorities can take several years. Consequently, at the balance sheet date tax liabilities and assets 
are based on management’s best estimate of the future amounts that will be settled. While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates 
recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.
Deferred tax assets mainly represent timing differences that the Group expects to recover at some time in the future and by their 
nature, the amounts recorded are therefore dependent on management’s judgement about future events. Account has also been taken 
of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these deferred tax assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do 
not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the timing difference might be recognised, then 
the value of the deferred tax asset will need to be revised in a future period.
1.20.3 Inventory and trade receivable provisions
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working capital, 
principally inventory and trade receivables. Impairment charges are made against obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or doubtful 
receivables.
The decision to make an impairment charge is based on the facts available at the time the consolidated financial statements are 
approved and are also determined by using profiles, based on past practice, applied to certain aged inventory and trade receivables 
categories. In estimating the collectability of trade receivables, judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the 
current creditworthiness of each customer and related ageing of the past due balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations 
where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or 
bankruptcy.
1.20.4 Future purchases of minority interests
The Group’s financial statements include a financial liability for the net present value of the expected amount that it will pay in future 
years to acquire the outstanding shares held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries. This amount is based on the

Financial Statements
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2013
a) Accounting Policies
a.1 Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed on page 68, under the historical cost 
convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK Accounting Standards. As permitted by section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company. The Company’s profit after tax for the year 
was £22.7m (2013: £14.4m).
a.2 Investments and dividends
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Dividend income is recognised when received. Final dividend distributions 
are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
a.3 Employment Benefit Trust and employee share schemes
Shares held by the Diploma Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) are stated at cost and accounted for as a deduction from shareholders’ 
funds in accordance with UITF 38. Shares that are held by the Trust are not eligible for dividends until such time as the awards have 
vested and options have been exercised by the participants.
a.4 Cash flow statement
The Company is exempt from the requirements of FRS1 (revised) to include a cash flow statement as part of its Company financial 
statements because it prepares a Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, as part of the consolidated financial statements.
a.5 Related parties
The Company has taken advantage of paragraph 3(c) of FRS8 (“Related Party Disclosures”) not to disclose transactions with Group 
entities or interests of the Group qualifying as related parties.
a.6. Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the auditor for the audit of the Company’s accounts of £3,500 (2012: £3,500) were borne by a fellow Group undertaking.
b) Directors’ and employees’ remuneration
No emoluments are paid directly by the Company; information on the Directors’ remuneration and their interests in the share capital of 
the Company are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 50 to 65. The Company had no employees (2012: none).

Diploma PLC
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Diploma PLC
Opinion on financial statements of Diploma PLC
In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
•	 the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
 
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
related notes 1 to 29 and the Group Accounting policies. This also 
comprises the Parent Company Balance Sheet, the Reconciliation 
of Movement in Shareholders’ Funds and its related notes (a) to (d) 
and the Parent Company Accounting policies. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement on page 68 that the Group is a going concern. We 
confirm that:
•	 we have not identified material uncertainties related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern which we believe would 
need to be disclosed in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union; and
•	 we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team:
•	 the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible 
assets;
•	 the valuation of inventory including appropriateness of 
judgements applied within the obsolescence provision; and
•	 the recoverability of trade receivables.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or 
disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, 
and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and 
performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. For 
the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement we define materiality as the 
magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, 
relying on the financial statements, would be changed or 
influenced. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a 
magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would 
be material for the financial statements as a whole. We 
determined planning materiality for the Group to be £2.5 million, 
which is approximately 5% of pre-tax profit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all audit differences in excess of £50,000, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope focussed primarily on the audit work at 7 
locations. Each of these 7 locations was subject to a full scope 
audit. An additional 5 locations were subject to specific agreed 
upon audit procedures which address each of the significant 
balances and significant risks within these entities. Together the 
work at these 12 locations represent the principal business units 
of the Group and account for 79% of the Group’s revenues and 
96% of the Group’s profit before tax. Our audit work at the 12 
principal business units was executed at levels of materiality 
applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group 
materiality. 
The Group audit team has designed and implemented a rotational 
country visit programme to ensure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or another senior member of the group audit team visits 
these locations. Each year this programme of visits includes the 
three most significant territories (being the US, Canada and UK) 
which comprise 10 locations and 71% of Group revenue. Where 
no visits are carried out, the Senior Statutory Auditor or another 
senior member of the team has held discussions with the lead 
partner. We have performed analytical procedures for those 
locations making up the remaining revenue and operating profit.
The way in which we scoped our response to the risks identified 
above was as follows:
•	 we challenged management’s assumptions used in the 
impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, 
described in note 10 to the financial statements, including 
specifically the cash flow projections, the discount and 
perpetuity rates applied to those cash flows, and the 
sensitivities considered;
•	 we tested the existence of stocks and tested that the book 
value does not exceed the net realisable value of stocks. We 
challenged management’s inventory provisions and assessed 
their adequacy; and
•	 we challenged management’s calculation of the bad debt 
provision and tested the recoverability of trade receivables.
 
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on 
page 47. 101
 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if 
in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. Under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain 
elements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We have nothing 
to report arising from these matters or our review. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
•	 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
•	 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or 
•	 is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are either required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

2 Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in accordance with note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
3 Total shareholders’ equity per share has been calculated by dividing equity shareholders’ funds by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
4 Dividend cover is calculated on adjusted earnings as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
5 Acquisition expenses have been charged against profit from 1 October 2009; prior to 1 October 2009 acquisition costs were included as part of the cost of investment.
6 The Group disposed of Anachem Limited in the financial year ended 30 September 2010 and this business was reclassified as a discontinued business; the comparatives

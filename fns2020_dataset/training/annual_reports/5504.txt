Track record of delivering sustainable growth
It	is	EnQuest’s	intention	to	deliver	sustainable	growth	by	
focusing	on	exploiting	its	existing	reserves,	commercialising	
and	developing	discoveries,	converting	contingent	
resources	into	reserves	and	pursuing	selective	acquisitions.	
EnQuest	believes	it	is	establishing	a	track	record	of	
delivering	on	all	of	these	fronts.	The	reserves	table	below	
shows	EnQuest’s	strong	reserves	replacement	ratio	of	
419%	in	2011.	The	Group’s	Proven	and	Probable	Reserves	
have	been	audited	by	a	recognised	Competent	Person	in	
accordance	with	the	definitions	set	out	under	the	2007	
Petroleum	Resources	Management	System	and	supporting	
guidelines	issued	by	the	Society	of	Petroleum	Engineers.
principal assets
EnQuest’s	principal	assets	at	the	end	of	2011	were	its	
interests	in	the	Heather,	Broom,	Thistle,	Deveron,	West	Don,	
Don	Southwest	and	Conrie	producing	oilfields,	the	Alma	and

in	the	Southwest	Heather,	Cairngorm,	Pilot,	Crathes,	Scolty,	
Torphins,	Crawford,	Porter	and	Kildrummy	discoveries.	
Recent	developments	in	2012	include	EnQuest’s	acquisition	
of	interests	in	the	Kraken	discovery	and	an	agreement	to	
increase	its	interest	in	the	West	Don	producing	field.	At	the	
end	of	December	2011	EnQuest	had	working	interests	in	
22	production	licences	covering	27	blocks	or	part	blocks

market conditions
In	2011,	EnQuest’s	average	realised	
oil	price,	net	of	hedging,	was	$107.6	
per	barrel,	up	from	$81.3	per	barrel	in	
2010.	EnQuest’s	averaged	invoiced	
oil	price	in	2011	was	$111.8	per	barrel.
Oil	prices,	although	volatile,	
nonetheless	stayed	above	$100	per	
barrel	for	most	of	2011.	This	was	due	
partly to a general tightness in the 
markets	for	crude	oil,	exacerbated	by	
increased	levels	of	producer	domestic	
consumption and by supply disruption 
from	North	Africa	and	the	Middle	East,	
in	particular	Libya	and	Iran.	Despite	the	
uncertainties in the global economy 
which	continue	today,	it	seems	clear	
that	following	the	‘Arab	Spring’,	there	
have	been	structural	increases	in	the	
level	of	social	costs	in	Middle	Eastern	
countries.	Maintaining	oil	prices	at	high	
levels	will	be	critical	if	Middle	Eastern	
countries are to meet these increased 
costs.	High	prices	have	not	stimulated	
a dramatic supply expansion and the 
Organisation	of	Petroleum	Exporting	
Countries	has	adjusted	its	price	targets.
Overview
I	am	pleased	to	report	that	EnQuest	
delivered	another	strong	performance	in	
2011.	Production	was	up	12.5%	on	2010	and	
reserves	replacement,	at	a	ratio	of	over	
400%,	was	well	ahead	of	the	targets	set	
out	at	the	time	of	EnQuest’s	IPO.	The	
operational	capabilities	of	the	EnQuest	
organisation	have	grown	significantly	
during	the	year.	EnQuest’s	basic	earnings	
per	share	were	7.6	cents	in	2011,	up	by	
90%	over	2010.	EnQuest	is	continuing	to	
deliver	on	the	plans	it	laid	out	at	the	time	
of	its	inception.

EnQuest,	along	with	the	industry,	has	
been	actively	engaged	in	working	
with	the	u K	Government	to	promote	
changes	in	the	fiscal	structure	and	
is	encouraged	by	the	u K	North	Sea	
investment	incentive	measures	recently	
announced	in	the	2012	Budget.	
Macroeconomic	concerns	have	again	
focused attention on the challenges 
companies face in accessing 
capital	to	fund	developments	and	
acquisitions.	EnQuest	is	fortunate	
to be differentiated by the strength 
of its balance sheet and its cash 
flow	and	consequently	by	the	scale	
of	the	borrowing	facilities	it	can	
secure,	as	demonstrated	by	its	
new	$900	million	credit	facility.	In	
these	difficult	markets,	EnQuest’s	
technical	skills,	operational	scale	and	
considerable	financial	strength	are	
substantial	competitive	advantages.	
t he EnQuest model
EnQuest’s	development	and	
production model is focused on 
realising the untapped potential in 
mature	assets	and	undeveloped	
oil	fields.	EnQuest	concentrates	on	
production	hubs,	on	near	field	appraisal	
and	exploration,	and	on	business	
development.	Members	of	the	Board	
and	I	have	had	considerable	experience	
of	successfully	deploying	this	model.	
Reassessing	and	developing	fields	is	
a	relatively	low	risk	way	of	steadily	
generating	shareholder	value.	Now,	two	
years	post	IPO,	we	believe	it	has	been	
successfully	established	at	EnQuest.	
Indeed	EnQuest	has	created	a	powerful	
new	force	in	integrated	development.	
This has enabled us to sanction 
the	Alma	and	Galia	development,	
EnQuest’s	fourth	hub	and	a	substantial	
contributor to our expected production 
growth.	Formal	field	development	
plan	(FDP)	approval	for	Alma/Galia	
is	anticipated	in	the	coming	weeks.
t he EnQuest Board
During	EnQuest’s	critical	early	days	
it	was	invaluable	to	have	Alexandre	
Schneiter	as	a	non-executive	director,	
given	his	knowledge	of	the	Heather/
Broom	and	Thistle/Deveron	hubs	
through	his	association	with	Lundin	
Petroleum	AB.	Alexandre	was	however	
not independent for the purposes of 
the	u K	Corporate	Governance	Code,	
and	therefore	EnQuest	undertook	
that	he	would	in	due	course	stand	
down	from	the	Board.	Alexandre	
Schneiter	will	duly	be	retiring	at	the	
Annual	General	Meeting	on	30	May	
2012.	The	Board	and	I	would	like	to	
thank Alexandre for his important 
contribution to the successful 
establishment	and	subsequent	
development	of	EnQuest.	The	Board	
plans	to	appoint	a	new	independent	
non-executive	director	in	due	course.	
In	July	2011,	I	was	delighted	to	
welcome	Clare	Spottiswoode	to	
the	Board	as	a	new	EnQuest	non-
executive	director.	Clare’s	wealth	of	
experience,	from	within	and	beyond	
the	energy	industry,	makes	her	a	
valuable	addition	to	the	Board.	
The	Board	would	like	to	thank	
EnQuest’s	employees	for	their	
continuing	commitment,	enthusiasm	
and	support.	EnQuest’s	values	are	
critical	to	our	success;	respect,	focus,	
agility,	creativity,	passion,	collaboration	
and	empowerment.	EnQuest	people	
live	and	breathe	these	values	and	this	
has	been	essential	to	the	delivery	of	the	
achievements	we	are	reporting	today.
t he updated EnQuest c ode 
of Conduct
In	2010,	EnQuest	launched	its	Code	 
of	Conduct,	setting	out	the	behaviour	
EnQuest	expects	of	its	directors,	
managers	and	employees,	of	our	
suppliers,	contractors,	agents	and	
partners.	EnQuest	is	committed	
to	complying	with	the	applicable	
legal	requirements,	to	upholding	
the highest ethical standards and 
to	acting	with	complete	integrity	at	
all	times.	In	2011,	EnQuest	launched	
an	updated	version	of	the	Code	of	
Conduct.	While	the	majority	of	the	
existing	code	remains	in	place,	we	have	
augmented	the	sections	dealing	with	
business	ethics,	in	particular	those	
impacted	by	the	u K	Bribery	Act,	these	
include sections on business gifts and 
entertainment,	as	well	as	facilitation	
payments	and	how	EnQuest	must	
deal	with	partners	and	suppliers.	The	
integrity	of	EnQuest’s	employees	and	
everyone	we	work	with	underpins	
our	future	progress	and	success.
Delivering sustainable growth
2011	was	an	important	year	for	
EnQuest,	one	of	both	consolidation	
and	growth,	bedding	in	and	developing	
the	organisation	we	launched	in	2010	
and putting in place the people and 
structures to execute our long term 
growth	plans.	EnQuest’s	focus	on	
hubs	delivered	strong	production	
growth,	as	well	as	the	sanction	of	
Alma	and	Galia.	We	had	an	active	
business	development	programme	and	
consolidated	our	positions	in	Broom,	
Crawford	and	Porter	and	we	also	
farmed	in	to	the	Kildrummy	discovery.	
The	strong	2011	reserves	and	resources	
performance has already been 
materially	augmented	in	2012,	with	the	
acquisition	of	a	45%	stake	in	the	Kraken	
discovery.	The	macro	environment	
has	thrown	up	challenges,	but	also	
opportunities,	and	the	EnQuest	team	
has	been	able	to	respond	quickly	and	
effectively.	The	EnQuest	Board	remains	
as	excited	and	confident	as	ever	of	
EnQuest’s	very	considerable	potential.

Delivering strong growth
2011	was	a	strong	year	for	EnQuest,	with	
annual	production	at	23,698	Boepd,	up	
12.5% on	2010.	Our	operations	generated	an	
excellent	financial	performance	with	cash	flow	
from	operations	of	$656.3	million	and	EBITDA	
of	$629.1	million.	Profit	before	tax	and	net	
finance	costs	increased	to	$390.1	million,	up	
130.3%	on	the	prior	year	pro-forma	equivalent.	
At	the	end	of	2011,	audited	net	2P	reserves	
were	115.2 MMboe,	an	increase	of	30.2%	over	
2010	and	of	43.1%	over	IPO	levels,	well	above	
our	10%	per	annum	long	term	reserves	growth	
target.	This	115.2	MMboe	at	the	end	of	2011	
represents	an	excellent	reserve	replacement	
ratio	of	419.4%.	
This	growth	in	reserves	was	driven	
partly	by	the	Alma	and	Galia	
development	project,	and	also	by	
our	active	business	development	
programme.	These	transactions	
brought further consolidation of 
EnQuest’s	existing	asset	positions	
and also took us into a number 
of	new	development	projects.
In	2011	EnQuest	put	in	place	the	
organisational building blocks needed 
to	ensure	sustainable	delivery	of	
medium	and	long	term	growth.	
The	substantial	growth	in	reserves	
demonstrates	EnQuest’s	ability	to	
deliver	sustainable	production	growth	
for	the	medium	and	the	long	term.	
EnQuest’s	2011	production	of	
23,698	Boepd	represents	a	further	
consolidation of our position as the

Guidance range
Implementing EnQuest’s development 
and production focused strategy
With	approximately	340	undeveloped	
fields	in	the	u KCS,	there	is	a	significant	
opportunity	for	EnQuest	in	the	u K	
North	Sea,	particularly	in	the	smaller	
oil	fields	which	we	target.	EnQuest	
is	the	right	company	in	size,	scale	
and	financial	strength	to	exploit	the	
remaining opportunities in the North 
Sea	and	beyond.	We	are	focused	
on	both	existing	and	new	hubs,	
on	low	cost	near	field	exploration	
and appraisal and on business 
development	opportunities.	Our	
business	model	extends	asset	lives	
to realise the untapped potential in 
maturing	assets,	as	well	as	resources	
within	undeveloped	oil	fields.	
In	2011,	through	our	hub	focus,	we	
added	29.3	MMboe	to	EnQuest’s	
net	2P	reserves	for	the	Alma/Galia	
development.	We	delivered	exploration	
successes	with	the	Conrie	and	Crathes	
discoveries.	Our	execution	skills	are	
exemplified	by	our	Conrie	discovery	
and	development	which	took	less	than	
eight	months	between	discovery	and	
first	oil.	The	Kildrummy	appraisal	farm	
in	agreed	at	the	end	of	the	year	was	
the	last	of	a	steady	flow	of	business	
development	transactions	in	2011.	
EnQuest	significantly	increased	
its technical capabilities during 
2011,	enabling	us	to	take	on	large	
development	opportunities	such	
as	Alma	and	Galia,	and	more	
recently	Kraken.	Once	we	have	
identified	opportunities,	EnQuest	
uses its considerable expertise and 
capability	to	find	and	implement	
the	right	development	solution	
to bring projects on stream in a 
timely	and	cost	efficient	manner.	
A leading force in integrated 
development
In	2011,	EnQuest	developed	its	
operations	organisation	at	all	levels.	
In	Aberdeen	we	have	what	we	
believe	is	one	of	the	best	teams	in	
the	u K,	leaders	in	innovative	and	
cost	efficient	developments.	The	
wells	delivery	team	in	particular	
has produced a number of industry 
leading	performances,	including	
a	12,650ft	bit	run	for	the	Conrie	
exploration	well	in	the	Dons	area.	
These capabilities are a key differentiator 
and are critical to our ability to add 
value	to	the	projects	which	EnQuest	
invests	in.	We	have	continued	to	add	
highly skilled industry professionals 
with	extensive	experience.	This	scale	of	
organisational	development	is	critical	to	
delivering	EnQuest’s	ambitious	growth	
plans.	With	the	EnQuest	workforce	now	
more	than	double	its	size	at	flotation,	
we	are	ready	for	the	next	phase	of	
our	growth	and	beyond.	The	EnQuest	
development	machine	is	in	place.
Heath, safety, environment and  
quality (hs EQ) 
HSEQ	is	EnQuest’s	top	priority.	It	is	a	
critical and a deeply embedded part of 
our	culture	and	values,	and	is	integral	
to	how	we	manage	our	business,	with	
regard	to	people,	installations	and	the	
environment	in	which	we	operate.
In	2011,	EnQuest’s	safety	performance	
was	strong,	achieving	performance	
levels	which	were	in	the	top	quartile	
for	the	industry.	We	evolved	and	
strengthened	the	HSEQ	team	with	the	
appointment	of	a	new	head	of	Health,	
Safety,	Environment	and	Quality,	and	
with	the	creation	of	three	other	new	
professional	positions.	This	additional	
focus	will	help	to	bring	further	rigour	
to our performance and operational 
HSEQ	measures,	reinforcing	a	proactive	
continuous	improvement	culture	in	all	
of	our	assets	and	development	projects. EnQuest PLC

EnQuest’s first new hub – the Alma 
and galia development
In	November	2011,	EnQuest	gave	its	
internal sanction to the Alma and 
Galia	joint	development,	subject	to	
anticipated	regulatory	approvals.	
The	Alma	and	Galia	base	case	adds	
29.3	MMboe	to	EnQuest’s	net	2P	
reserves,	underpinning	our	medium	
term	production	growth.	First	oil	
is	expected	in	Q4	2013,	with	peak	
gross	production	of	over	20,000	
Boepd.	This	project	is	anticipated	
to	increase	EnQuest’s	production	
levels	to	over	40,000	Boepd	in	2014,	
approximately	a	two	thirds	increase	
on	2011.	EnQuest	intends	to	fund	
this	development	fully	from	current	
financial	resources.	EnQuest	secured	
the	Alma	and	Galia	licences	as	part	
of	the	26th	licensing	round,	and	the	
project	was	sanctioned	less	than	a	
year	after	award.	First	oil	is	targeted	
two	years	from	project	sanction.	Field	
Development	Plan	(FDP)	approval	
is	anticipated	in	the	coming	weeks,	
following	which	EnQuest	expects	
to	review	a	number	of	farm	in	
proposals	from	potential	partners.
The	Alma/Galia	project	exemplifies	
EnQuest’s	capabilities,	deploying	
many of the skills and methodologies 
used	on	the	Don	fields	development,	
with	a	fast	track	development	
solution,	reusing	an	existing	facility.	
The	development	will	be	tied	back	
to	the	modified	EnQuest	Producer,	
a	Floating	Production,	Storage	and	
Offloading	(FPSO)	vessel.	EnQuest	
took out an option to purchase this 
FPSO	from	Bluewater	Operations	
Limited,	and	this	was	duly	exercised	
in	Q1	2012,	for	a	cash	consideration	of	
$52.5	million.	Alma,	originally	named	
the	Argyll	field,	was	the	very	first	oil	
field	developed	in	the	u K	and	was	
abandoned	in	1992	at	a	70%	water	
cut.	The	EnQuest	development	plan	is	
designed to be capable of processing 
high	water	cut	levels	in	excess	of	
95%.	using	established	modern	
technology,	the	lives	of	these	two	fields	
can	now	be	extended	significantly.
Business development and EnQuest 
asset update
EnQuest’s	asset	base	continues	to	
grow,	Alma/Galia	will	be	our	fourth	
hub	and	will	take	us	from	seven	to	
nine	operated	producing	fields.	In	2011,	
our	business	development	efforts	
successfully demonstrated that there 
continue to be good opportunities in 
the	North	Sea,	where	we	consolidated	
our	positions	in	existing	assets,	as	
well	as	entering	into	new	appraisal	
and	development	opportunities.	
In	May	2011,	EnQuest	agreed	to	
increase	its	interest	in	Crawford/
Porter	from	19%	to	51%,	in	exchange	
for	carrying	the	previous	operator’s	
development	costs,	up	to	a	maximum	
of	$55.8	million.	In	August	2011,	
EnQuest	announced	an	increase	in	
its stake in the producing Broom 
field,	up	by	8%	to	63%	for	$7.5	
million,	increasing	net	2P	reserves	by	
almost	1	MMboe.	At	the	same	time,	
EnQuest	announced	its	farm	in	to	
the	Crathes	prospect,	taking	a	40%	
interest and assuming operatorship for 
zero	consideration.	The	subsequent	
exploration	well	at	Crathes	was	
successful	and	EnQuest	is	evaluating	
the potential commerciality of the 
Scolty,	Crathes	and	Torphins	area.	
Finally,	in	November	2011,	EnQuest	
agreed	to	farm	in	to	a	40%	interest	
in	the	Kildrummy	discovery,	and	to	
assume	operatorship	of	the	project.	
EnQuest’s	acquisition	model	is	
predicated	on	the	value	we	can	add	
to projects through our integrated 
development	skill	set,	rather	than	on	
being	able	to	secure	assets	below	
market	value.	EnQuest	maintains	a	
disciplined and rigorous approach 
to	reviewing	potential	opportunities,	
requiring	projects	and	acquisitions	
to meet returns criteria dependent 
on	the	specific	risk	profile.
The	Alma/Galia	project	exemplifies	
EnQuest’s	capabilities,	deploying	many	
of the skills and methodologies used on 
the	successful	Don	fields	development. EnQuest PLC

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Another strong financial performance 
– cash flow from operations of  
$656.3 million
Profit	before	tax	and	net	finance	costs	
increased	by	130.3%	on	the	prior	
year	pro-forma	equivalent	to	$390.1	
million.	Pre-exceptionals	EBITDA	rose	
by	70.3%	to	$629.1	million	and	cash	
flow	from	operations	was	up	145.2%	
to	$656.3	million,	both	driven	by	the	
increased production and the increase 
in	the	oil	price.	The	same	factors	led	to	
a	110.0%	increase	in	reported	cash	flow	
from	operations	per	issued	Ordinary	
share,	up	to	81.9	cents	per	share	from	
39.0	cents	per	share	in	2010.	EnQuest	
continues	to	have	a	strong	balance	
sheet,	with	net	cash	at	the	year	end	of	
$378.9	million,	up	substantially	from	
the	$41.4	million	at	the	end	of	2010.	
The unit cost of sales production and 
transportation	was	$31.9	per	Boe	in	
2011,	up	on	the	pro-forma	$30.4	per	
Boe	in	2010.	The	increase	was	related	
to the net impact of the costs of the 
Thistle	shutdown	programme	and	the	
Don	Southwest	well	intervention,	offset	
by production increases from the Don 
and	Thistle	fields.	Capital	expenditure	
was	$360.6	million	in	2011,	this	included	
expenditure	in	relation	to	EnQuest’s	
sanctioning	of	the	Alma/Galia	project	
in	Q4	2011,	ahead	of	first	drilling	
on	Alma/Galia	in	Q1	2012.	The	total	
investment	in	Alma/Galia	in	2011	was	
approximately	$80	million,	with	around	
$95	million	of	capital	expenditure	
on	Thistle,	$80	million	on	the	Don	
fields	and	$30	million	on	Heather.	
2012 highlights so far
Business	development	in	2012	has	
started	strongly	with	several	substantial	
transactions	already	negotiated.	
EnQuest	agreed	the	acquisition	of	
45%	of	the	Kraken	discovery,	with	
20%	being	acquired	from	Canamens	
Limited	for	$45	million	in	cash	and	a	
further	$45	million	payable	at	FDP,	
and	a	further	25%	acquired	from	
Nautical	Petroleum	plc	(Nautical)	
through	a	development	carry.	The	
Kraken	development	has	substantial	
potential,	with	the	surrounding	areas	
also bringing additional exploration 
and	appraisal	opportunities.	EnQuest	
has also agreed a farm in option for 
45%	of	the	nearby	Ketos	discovery.	
With	its	technical	skills,	operational	
scale	and	financial	strength,	EnQuest	
is increasingly becoming the natural 
partner of choice for integrated 
development	projects	in	the	u KCS	
and	beyond.	If	Kraken	proceeds	to	
sanction	and	development,	the	timing	
of	the	anticipated	cash	flows	from	
Alma/Galia	will	be	complementary	
to	the	funding	of	Kraken.
Since	the	start	of	the	year	EnQuest	
has	also	agreed	to	acquire	an	
additional	18.5%	interest	in	West	
Don,	from	JX	Nippon	Exploration	
and	Production	(u K)	Ltd	(‘JX’)	for	a	
cash	consideration	of	$34	million.	The	
acquisition	also	includes	tax	allowances	
of	$2	million.	This	transaction	takes	
EnQuest	to	a	63.45%	position	in	
West	Don.	We	are	proud	of	our	
considerable	achievement	on	the	
Don	fields	and	pleased	to	be	further	
consolidating	our	position	on	West	
Don.	Completion	of	the	transaction	
is	subject	to	co-venturer	approvals.
In	Q1	2012,	EnQuest	established	a	
new	$900	million	Multi-Currency	
Revolving	Credit	Facility,	comprising	
of	a	committed	amount	of	$525	million	
with	a	further	$375	million	potentially	
available	primarily	for	acquisitions.	This	
facility	replaces	the	previous	$280	
million	facility	which	expired	in	Q1	2012.	
EnQuest	is	pleased	with	the	support	it	
received	from	the	lending	institutions	
which	provided	the	new	facility.	
Outlook and plans for 2012 and beyond
Despite	particularly	difficult	weather	
conditions in the Northern North 
Sea	in	Q1	2012,	production	year	to	
date	in	2012	has	been	in	line	with	
expectations	and	consequently	
EnQuest	reaffirms	its	previous	annual	
production	guidance	of	between	
20,000	Boepd	and	24,000	Boepd.
Over	the	course	of	2012,	EnQuest’s	
extensive	programme	encompasses	
the	drilling	of	at	least	11	wells,	two	on	
Thistle/Deveron,	four	on	the	Dons,	
three	from	batch	drilling	on	Alma/
Galia,	an	exploration	well	at	Tryfan	
and	an	appraisal	well	at	Kildrummy.	
EnQuest	will	also	complete	the	power	
upgrade installation at Thistle and the 
rig	reactivation	programme	at	Heather.	
EnQuest’s	2012	capital	investment	will	
be	approximately	$1,000	million,	with	
around	$500	million	at	Alma/Galia.	
This	is	EnQuest’s	most	active	annual	
work	programme	so	far	and	we	believe	
that	it	is	one	of	the	largest	2012	capital	
expenditure and drilling commitments 
in	the	North	Sea.	It	is	a	programme	
which	should	provide	a	contribution	
to	reserves	and	production	in	2012	
and	also	provide	a	bedrock	for	future	
reserves	and	production	growth.	
The	substantial	growth	in	
reserves	demonstrates	
EnQuest’s	ability	to	deliver	
production	growth	for	the	
medium	and	the	long	term.

100%	interest.	There	is	also	merit	in	
diversification	and	a	farm	in	could	
improve	the	overall	economics	
of	the	project.	Following	FDP	
approval	by	the	Department	
of Energy and Climate Change 
(‘DECC’),	EnQuest	expects	to	
consider	farm	in	proposals.
Q. Setting aside the financial 
issues, simply in terms of your 
operational organisation, what 
spare capacity do you have to 
respond to other opportunities?
a . EnQuest	has	more	than	doubled	
the	size	of	its	workforce	since	
IPO,	attracting	top	industry	
talent;	we	now	have	the	
capacity and the scalability to 
deliver	additional	projects. EnQuest PLC

Q. s hould we expect EnQuest to roll 
its model out internationally?
a . In	due	course	yes,	as	we	have	
always	said	the	EnQuest	model	
will	work	outside	of	the	u KCS.	
EnQuest	will	always	seek	to	apply	
its	skill	set	to	add	value	to	the	
specific	situation	in	question,	but	
when	we	do	move	outside	the	
u KCS,	you	should	expect	to	see	
some	or	all	of	the	familiar	EnQuest	
model	features.	These	include	
proven	high	quality	petroleum	
systems,	mature	basins	being	
exited	by	the	majors,	operational	
control,	low	risk,	near	field	
exploration	potential,	bookable	
reserves,	and	no	deep	water	or	
harsh	environments.	We	would	
however	envisage	only	a	small	
number	of	additional	geographies,	
and	the	u KCS	will	remain	our	main	
area	for	many	years	to	come.
Q. EnQuest is very cash generative, 
based on analysts’ forecasts, you 
could buy back your own market 
capitalisation in two or three years. 
given that you are so cash rich why 
would you not pay a dividend now?
a . EnQuest	believes	that	it	can	
generate	more	attractive	returns	
for	investors	by	reinvesting	in	our	
core	business	and	that	we	have	a	
steady	pipeline	of	such	investment	
opportunities	set	to	drive	
sustainable	long	term	growth	in	
reserves	and	production.	Payment	
of	a	dividend	will	continue	to	be	
reassessed	on	a	regular	basis.
Q. EnQuest says that it has a 
Life of Field approach to its 
assets, what does that mean?
a . EnQuest	manages	its	fields	for	
their full maximum economic 
Life	of	Field	potential.	Some	
asset	owners	focus	only	on	
the	short	timescale	over	which	
production	from	the	fields	can	
make	a	contribution	which	is	
material to them – resulting in 
premature	decommissioning,	a	
loss	of	host	field	reserves	and	the	
effective	sterilisation	of	adjacent	
discoveries	and	prospects.	
EnQuest	on	the	other	hand	is	
focused on the full life cycle and 
will	bring	new	investment,	new	
ideas	and	a	new	enthusiasm	to	
the	field,	resulting	in	additional	
development	and	investment.
Q. t he EnQuest model may work 
when oil is priced at over $100 
per barrel but how viable 
would large projects like Alma/
Galia be at lower levels? 
a . We	naturally	test	all	of	our	projects	
at a range of oil prices and do 
not	extrapolate	what	may	be	
temporarily	high	prices	over	the	life	
of	a	development.	Our	base	case	
project assumptions for projects 
in	2011	have	therefore	been	well	
below	prevailing	oil	price	levels	and	
we	stress	test	them	at	considerably	
lower	price	scenarios	than	those	
assumed	in	our	base	case.	
Q. Is the scale of EnQuest’s 
exploration not too small to 
be worth investing in, are you 
disappointed with the results  
so far?
a . Our	exploration	strategy	is	focused	
on	low	cost	near	field	exploration	
and	appraisal	projects,	with	
reasonable	chances	of	success.	
It	is	a	component	of	our	strategy.	
Because they are usually near 
field,	our	exploration	wells	may	
cost	as	little	as	$10	million	to	
$15	million.	With	two	successes	
out	of	six	wells	drilled	since	IPO,	
our	success	rate	has	been	as	we	
anticipated.	Exploration	is	not	
EnQuest’s	main	growth	driver,	
but	it	does	provide	potential,	
sometimes	material	upside,	and	
normally	with	only	a	low	level	
of	initial	investment	at	risk.

Management of risks and uncertainties 
The	Board	has	articulated	EnQuest’s	strategy	to	deliver	shareholder	value	by:
•	 exploiting	its	hydrocarbon	reserves
•	 commercialising	and	developing	discoveries	
•	 converting	its	contingent	resources	into	reserves	and	
•	 pursuing	selective	acquisitions	
In	pursuit	of	this	strategy,	EnQuest	has	to	face	and	manage	a	variety	of	risks.	As	a	result,	the	Board	has	established	a	risk	
management	framework,	embedding	the	principles	of	effective	risk	management	throughout	the	business.	
Key business risks 
The	Group’s	principal	risks	could	lead	to	a	significant	loss	of	reputation	or	could	prevent	the	business	from	executing	its	
strategy	and	creating	value	for	shareholders.	These	risks,	along	with	mitigating	actions	are	set	out	below:
Risk Mitigation
Health Safety and Environment 
(hs E)
Oil	and	gas	development,	production	
and	exploration	activities	are	complex	
and	HSE	risks	cover	many	areas	
including	operational	safety,	personal	
health	and	safety,	compliance	with	
regulatory	requirements	and	potential	
environmental	harm.
The	Group	maintains,	in	conjunction	with	its	core	contractors,	a	comprehensive	 
programme	of	health,	safety,	environmental	asset	integrity	and	assurance	activities	 
and	has	implemented	a	continuous	improvement	programme,	promoting	a	culture	of	
transparency	in	relation	to	HSE	matters.	The	Group	has	established	a	Corporate	HSE	
committee	which	meets	quarterly.	HSE	performance	is	discussed	at	each	Board	meeting.
In	addition,	the	Group	has	a	positive,	transparent	relationship	with	the	u K	Health	and	
Safety	Executive.
production
The	Group’s	production	is	critical	to	its	
success	and	is	subject	to	a	variety	of	risks	
including	uncertain	subsurface,	operating	
in	a	difficult	environment	with	mature	
equipment	and	potential	for	significant	
unexpected	shutdowns	and	unplanned	
expenditure	to	occur.
Lower	than	expected	reservoir	
performance	may	have	a	material	impact	
on	the	Group’s	results.
The	Group’s	delivery	infrastructure	on	
the u KCS	is	dependent	on	the	Sullom	
Voe Terminal.
The	Group’s	programme	of	asset	integrity	and	assurance	activities	provides	leading	
indicators	of	significant	potential	issues	which	may	result	in	unplanned	shutdowns	or	
which	may	in	other	respects	have	the	potential	to	undermine	asset	availability	and	
uptime.	The	Group	continually	assesses	the	condition	of	its	assets	and	operates	extensive	
maintenance and inspection procedures designed to minimise the risk of unplanned 
shutdowns	and	expenditure.	The	Group	monitors	both	leading	and	lagging	key	
performance	indicators	in	relation	to	its	maintenance	activities.
Life	of	asset	production	profiles	are	audited	by	independent	reserves	auditors.	The	Group	
also	undertakes	regular	internal	peer	reviews.	The	Group’s	forecasts	of	production	are	
risked	to	reflect	appropriate	production	risks.
The	Sullom	Voe	Terminal	has	a	good	safety	record	and	its	safety	and	operational	
performance	levels	are	regularly	monitored	by	the	Group	and	other	Terminal	owners	 
and	users	to	ensure	that	operational	integrity	is	maintained.	
project Execution 
The	Group’s	success	will	be	dependent	
upon	bringing	new	developments	to	
production	on	budget	and	on	schedule.	
The	Alma	and	Galia	development	is	the	
Group’s	first	since	inception	and	it	involves	
significant	capital	expenditure.	To	be	
successful,	the	Group	must	ensure	that	
project implementation is both timely  
and	on	budget.	Failure	to	do	so	may	 
have	a	material	negative	impact	on	the	
Group’s	performance.
The	Group	has	project	teams	which	are	responsible	for	the	planning	and	execution	of	
such	new	projects	with	a	dedicated	team	for	each	development.	The	Group	has	detailed	
controls,	systems	and	monitoring	processes	in	place	to	ensure	that	deadlines	and	
budgets	are	met	and	that	design	concepts	and	Field	Development	Plans	are	adhered	to	
and	implemented.	These	are	modified	when	the	circumstances	require	and	only	through	
controlled	process	and	with	the	necessary	internal	and	external	authorisation.	In	the	case	
of	the	Alma	and	Galia	development,	the	major	contracts	have	been	procured	and	are	in	
place.	EnQuest	ensures	that	responsibility	for	delivering	time	critical	supplier	obligations	
and	lead	times	are	fully	understood,	acknowledged	and	proactively	managed	by	the	most	
senior	levels	within	supplier	organisations.
Reserve Replacement
Failure	to	develop	its	contingent	and	
prospective	resources	or	secure	new	
licences	and/or	asset	acquisitions	and	
realise	their	expected	value.
The	Group	puts	a	strong	emphasis	on	subsurface	analysis	and	employs	industry	leading	
professionals.	The	Group	has	recruited	a	significant	number	of	employees	during	the	year	
in	a	variety	of	technical	positions	which	enable	it	to	manage	existing	assets	and	evaluate	
the	acquisition	of	new	assets	and	licences.	All	analysis	is	subject	to	internal,	and	where	
appropriate,	external	peer	review.	All	reserves	are	externally	audited	by	a	Competent	
Person	every	year. EnQuest PLC

employment	market	to	provide	remuneration	packages,	bonus	plans	and	long	term	
share-based	incentives	plans	targeted	to	incentivise	performance	and	loyalty	to	 
the	Group.
To	enable	the	Company	to	meet	its	growth	aspirations,	the	Group	is	undertaking	a	
number	of	human	resource	initiatives.	These	will	offer	significant	career	development	 
and	progression	opportunities	for	the	current	workforce;	including	senior	management	
succession	planning	and	talent	management.	There	has	already	been	a	high	level	of

in	place.	EnQuest’s	experienced	HR	department	will	continue	to	seek	to	recruit	in	line	
with	current	workforce	plans	and	forecasts.	
The	Group	also	maintains	market	competitive	contracts	with	key	suppliers	to	support	 
the	execution	of	work	where	the	necessary	skills	do	not	exist	within	the	Group’s	 
employee	base.
Reputation
The reputational and commercial

are	significant.
Operational	activities	are	conducted	in	accordance	with	approved	policies,	standards

The	Group	undertakes	regular	audit	activities	to	provide	assurance	on	compliance	 
with	established	policies,	standards	and	procedures.
Oil price
A material decline in oil and gas prices may 
adversely	affect	the	Group’s	results	of	
operations	and	financial	condition.
The	Group	monitors	oil	price	sensitivity	relative	to	its	capital	commitments	and	has	 
a	policy	which	allows	hedging	of	up	to	50%	of	its	production.	
In	order	to	develop	its	resources,	the	Group	needs	to	be	able	to	fund	substantial	levels	 
of	investment.	The	Group	will	therefore	regularly	review	and	implement	suitable	policies	
to	hedge	against	the	possible	negative	funding	impacts	of	changes	in	oil	prices.

Changes	in	the	regulatory	or	fiscal	
environment	affecting	the	Group’s	ability	
to	deliver	its	strategy.
It	is	difficult	for	the	Group	to	predict	the	timing	or	severity	of	such	changes.	However,	 
the	Group	does	engage	with	government	and	other	appropriate	organisations,	through	
Oil	&	Gas	u K	and	other	industry	associations	in	order	to	ensure	the	Group	is	kept	abreast	
of	expected	potential	changes	and	takes	an	active	role	in	making	appropriate

in	an	operated	asset.
The	Group	generally	sets	out	to	be	the	operator.	The	Group	maintains	regular	dialogue	
with	its	partners	to	ensure	alignment	of	interests	and	to	maximise	the	value	of	joint

Overview
In	2011	EnQuest	delivered	a	good	
operational	performance.	Production	
increased	by	12.5%	for	the	year	2011	over	
2010.	EnQuest	started	2011	with	2P	
reserves	of	88.51	MMboe	and	produced	
8.4 MMboe	during	2011.	Audited	year	end	
reserves	grew	by	30.2%	to	115.21	MMboe,	
with	a	large	part	of	the	increase	due	to	 
the	Alma/Galia	development	which	added	
net	2P	reserves	of	29.3	MMboe.	This	is	
equivalent	to	a	reserves	replacement	 
ratio	of	419.4%.	EnQuest	increased	
contingent	resources	to	116.78	MMboe	at	
the	end	of	2011.	Nine	wells	were	finished	
during	the	year	(eight	of	these	were	
operated	by	EnQuest)	and	two	new	
exploration	discoveries	were	made	at	
Conrie	and	Crathes.
A	good	HSEQ	performance	was	achieved,	
with	top	quartile	performance	on	the	
key measures of lost time accidents 
and	recordable	injuries.	A	new	head	of	
HSEQ	was	appointed	and	a	proactive	
HSEQ	programme	with	more	emphasis	
on	leading	indicators	was	developed.
The	EnQuest	operating	organisation	was	
developed	significantly	during	the	year,	
to	prepare	for	new	projects.	During	the	
year the leadership team in Aberdeen 
was	strengthened.	In	addition,	the	
engineering	and	the	new	developments	
teams	were	trebled	in	size,	and	the	
drilling	team	was	doubled	in	size.
2011 operational summary
Two	wells	were	drilled	on	Thistle	and	
Deveron	in	2011,	following	the	2010	rig	
refurbishment and drilling facilities 
upgrade.	This	resulted	in	Thistle	
producing at its highest annual rate  
for	over	ten	years.
At	Heather	and	Broom,	following	the	
subsurface	review	in	2010,	2011	was	
focused	on	the	first	phases	of	the	oil	rig	
reactivation	programme.	Production	
at	Heather	and	Broom	delivered	the	
strongest	growth	of	all	of	our	hubs,	up	
20%,	partly	due	to	the	new	pipeline	
installed	between	the	fields	in	2010.	
The	Don	fields	contributed	over	50%	of	
our	total	production	in	2011.	Production	
for	the	year	also	benefited	from	the	
discovery	in	early	2011	of	the	Conrie	field,	
with	the	S7	well	coming	on	stream	in	
August	2011.	Both	this	S7	well	and	the

is	evaluating	the	potential	commerciality	
of	the	combined	Crathes,	Scolty	and

Outlook for 2012
The	2012	programme	is	substantially	
larger	than	the	2011	programme.	As	well	
as	continuing	to	operate	and	develop	
our	existing	seven	production	fields,	the	
drilling	programme	will	expand	to	three	
operated	drilling	rigs.	Eleven	new	wells	will	
be	drilled.	Detailed	design,	procurement	
and	construction	of	the	Alma/Galia	
project	will	continue.	Assessment	of	the	
Crawford	field	and	the	Crathes/Scolty	
area	for	development	will	also	continue.	
In	addition,	EnQuest	will	play	a	leading	
role	in	the	recently	announced	acquisition	
of	the	Kraken	field	development.	
Total	capital	expenditure	for	2012	is	
expected	to	be	around	$1,000	million.

2011
Production	at	Thistle/Deveron	
achieved	a	net	5,436	Boepd	in	2011,	up	
12.4%	on	2010,	despite	poorer	power	
generating	uptime	which	impacted	on	
water	injection.	Two	new	wells	were	
finished	during	the	year.	A56/13	was	
the	first	well	on	Thistle	to	be	completed	
with	an	electric	submersible	pump;	
this	well	came	on	stream	in	May	2011	
at	slightly	above	the	expected	rate.	
A57/58	came	on	stream	in	October	
2011	at	a	higher	rate	than	expected.	
The	Deveron	P1	well	was	delayed	into	
2012.	As	a	result	of	the	poor	power	
generation	uptime	a	new	project	was	
sanctioned	to	build	a	new	30	MW	
power	generation	turbine	due	for	
completion	at	the	end	of	2012.	This	will	
enhance	future	water	injection	uptime.

In	2012	two	new	wells	will	be	finished,	
the	DEV-P1	and	the	Area	6-P1	well,	
there	will	also	be	three	workovers	
and	an	abandonment.	In	Q4	2012	
the	rig	crew	will	transfer	to	Heather	
to	commence	drilling	and	will	later	
return	to	Thistle.	The	new	30	MW

2011
Production at the Dons and Conrie 
achieved	a	net	12,770	Boepd	in	2011,	
up	9.5%	over	2010.	This	was	somewhat	
less than expected as both the Conrie 
well	and	Don	Southwest	S8Z	wells	
had	lower	initial	production	rates	
than	expected,	although	this	has	not	
impacted	reserves.	The	Conrie	well	
discovery	was	made	early	in	2011;	
the	development	plan	was	prepared,	
the	well	completed	and	brought	on	
production less than eight months from 
discovery.	A	new	producer	injector	
pair	was	drilled	successfully	in	2011.	
The	S8Z	well	came	on	production	
in	Q3	2011	and	was	later	supported	
by	the	S9	water	injection	well.	A	
Don	Southwest	Area	26	sidetrack	
appraisal	well	was	drilled,	but	found	
sub	commercial	hydrocarbons.	
A	workover	was	performed	on	
the	Don	Southwest	S2Z	well.	
2012
In	2012	four	new	wells	will	be	drilled	
in	the	Don	fields.	At	West	Don	a	new

assumed	operatorship	of	Kildrummy	
and	will	operate	the	appraisal	well,	
which	is	expected	to	be	drilled	in	
2012.	If	the	appraisal	is	successful,	
EnQuest	will	also	operate	any

Kraken
In	early	2012,	EnQuest	acquired	a	 
45%	interest	in	the	Kraken	discovery	
and anticipates becoming the operator 
of	the	proposed	development	
of	Kraken.	The	transaction	also	
gives	EnQuest	an	agreed	farm	in

which	is	to	be	appraised.
Kraken	is	a	large	heavy	oil	
accumulation	in	the	u K	North	Sea,	
located	in	the	East	Shetland	basin,	
to	the	west	of	the	North	Viking

2011
Production	at	Heather/Broom	achieved	
a	net	5,492	average	Boepd	in	2011,	
up	20.0%	on	2010.	This	resulted	from	
the	benefit	of	the	mid-year	increase	
in	EnQuest’s	working	interest	in	
Broom	from	55%	to	63%	and	from	
better than expected performance 
from	the	existing	well	stock.	The	
Broom	field	also	had	a	full	year’s	
benefit	of	the	new	Broom	to	Heather	
flowline	which	was	installed	in	2010.
In	H1	2011	hydrocyclones	were	
successfully installed and 
commissioned on Heather to 
improve	oil	in	produced	water.	
The Heather drilling rig upgrade 
programme	started	in	H1	2011,	in	
preparation	for	a	development	drilling	
programme	planned	to	start	in	Q4	2012.
In	H2	2011	an	unsuccessful	
exploration	well	was	drilled	on	the	
Ivy	prospect,	south	of	Heather.	
2012
The	first	drilling	on	Heather	in	six	years	
will	start	in	Q4	2012	with	an	initial	
programme	of	nine	wells.	We	have	
commissioned	new	2012	seismic	across	
Heather and Broom and expect this 
will	further	enhance	our	infill	drilling	
programme,	this	analysis	will	also	cover	
the	area	between	Heather	and	Broom.

existing facilities and is designed to ensure that 
abandonment costs will be minimised. alma, 
formerly the Argyll field, was the first oil field  
in the u K, and was abandoned at relatively low 
water cut using the technology available at the

extended significantly. This type of opportunity 
fits the EnQuest model of finding fresh 
opportunities in mature assets. 
 
t he a lma and galia development provides  
a material increase of approximately 29

EnQuest’s operational capabilities 
have grown very considerably.  
In 2011, EnQuest developed its 
operations organisation at all levels, 
creating what we believe is one of 
the best teams in the business; 
leaders in innovative cost efficient 
developments, with EnQuest’s 
values deeply embedded in 
its culture. 
These capabilities are a key 
differentiator and a critical enabler 
in terms of EnQuest’s ability to add 
value to the projects it invests in. 
The steady flow of our programme 
of work has enabled us to keep our 
development teams together and 
facilitates the benefits of continuity. 
Our operational capacity is now  
in place, essentially ready to deal 
not only with all the developments 
we have sanctioned already,  
but also with the other major 
developments which we are  
now actively considering.

Financial overview
In	the	year	ended	31	December	2011,	the	
Brent	crude	oil	price	averaged	$111.3	per	
barrel,	up	$31.8	per	barrel	on	the	average	
for	2010,	despite	continued	instability	in	
the	global	economy.	
The	Group’s	financial	performance	in	2011	
reflects	good	operational	performance	
throughout	the	year,	with	revenue	up	by	
52.3%	compared	with	2010	pro-forma,	
resulting	in	a	$259.8	million	increase	in	
EBITDA	from	$369.3	million	on	a	pro-forma	
basis	for	2010	to	$629.1	million	in	2011,	
reflecting	higher	production	volumes	 
and	higher	realised	sales	prices.
The	Group	enters	2012	with	$378.9	
million cash as a result of strong 
ongoing	operating	cash	flows	from	its	
existing	portfolio	of	assets.	In	addition,	
the	Group	secured	a	$900.0	million

basis,	for	the	12	months	to	31	December	
2011	averaged	23,698	Boepd,	up	12.5%	
compared	with	2010	pro-forma.	The	
increase in production is due mainly to 
higher	volumes	on	West	Don	as	a	result	
of	having	a	full	year’s	production	from	
the	W4	well	and	a	full	year’s	increased	
equity	share	following	the	acquisition	
of	Stratic	Energy	Corporation	(Stratic)	
in	November	2010.	There	was	also	
strong performance from the Broom 
field	existing	well	stock	and	the	field	
had	a	full	year’s	benefit	of	the	new	
flowline,	which	was	installed	in	2010.	In	
addition,	two	new	Thistle	wells	came

Conrie	discovery	well	S7	and	the	Don	
Southwest	wells	S8Z	and	S9	came	
on stream	in	August	2011.	Saleable	
production	was	approximately	3%	
lower	than	the	export	meter	production	
volumes,	primarily	as	a	result	of

with	2010	pro-forma,	is	primarily	
attributable to the cost of a major 
shutdown	programme	performed	
on	Thistle	and	the	Don	Southwest	
S2Z	well	intervention	costs,	partially	
offset	by	increased	production	volume	
from	the	Dons	and	Thistle	fields.
The	Group’s	depletion	expense	per	
Boe for the year is broadly consistent 
with	the	previous	year’s	pro-forma	rate,	
with	an	increase	of	$0.4	per	Boe	(2%).
The	well	abandonment	expenses	of	$8.2	
million	which	were	reported	in	2010	
have	been	credited	in	2011	following	
a	further	review	of	options	to	recover	
these	funds	from	the	previous	owners.
The	Group’s	change	in	lifting	position	
expense	was	$14.6	million	for	the	year	
ended	31	December	2011,	compared	
with	$1.3	million	in	2010	on	a	pro-
forma	basis.	The	increase	in	expense	
of	$13.3	million	has	arisen	primarily	
due	to	over-lifting	of	Dons	volumes	
at	31	December	2011,	compared	to	
under-lifting	at	31	December	2010.
Exploration and evaluation expenses
Exploration	and	evaluation	expenses	
were	$37.0	million	in	the	year	ended	
31	December	2011,	compared	with	
$23.0	million	reported	in	the	previous	
year,	excluding	exceptional	items.	The	
expenses primarily relate to the cost 
of	unsuccessful	exploration	wells	at	
Don	Southwest	Area	26,	Ivy,	Moon	and	
the	non-operated	Tudor	Rose	well.
general and administrative expenses
General	and	administrative	expenses	
were	$16.0	million	in	the	year	ended	
31	December	2011	compared	with	
$13.8	million	reported	in	the	previous	
year,	excluding	exceptional	items.	The	
expenses	primarily	relate	to	the	Group’s	
general management and business 
development	expenses	and	the	
increase is mainly due to the increased 
levels	of	business	development	activity.
taxation
The	tax	charge	for	the	year	of	$239.4	
million	excluding	exceptional	items,	
represents	an	effective	tax	rate	of	64%	
compared	with	51%	in	the	previous	year.	
The	increase	in	the	Group’s	effective	
tax rate in the year results from the 
increase	in	the	u K	supplementary	
corporation	tax	from	24	March	2011

Exceptional items and depletion of fair 
value uplift
Exceptional	costs	totalling	$12.6	
million	before	tax	have	been	disclosed	
separately	in	the	year	ended	31	
December	2011	relating	to:
•	 non-cash gain on disposal of 
$8.6	million	resulting	from	the	
disposal	of	the	Slovenian	Petisovci	
asset,	which	was	obtained	on	
acquisition	of	Stratic,	to	Ascent	
Resources	plc	on	11 February	2011	
in	return	for	an	equity	stake;
•	 non-cash impairment of 
$12.5	million	in	relation	to	
the	accounting	valuation	of	
the	Group’s	shareholding	in	
Ascent	Resources	plc;	and
•	 non-cash	well	abandonment	
credit	of	$8.2	million	recognised	
following	further	review	of	options	
to	recover	these	funds	from	the	
previous	Thistle	field	owners.
In	addition,	a	one-off	deferred	tax	
adjustment	of	$68.1	million	in	respect	
of the increase in the supplementary 
charge	on	u K	oil	and	gas	production	
has also been reported as an 
exceptional	item.	The	effective	tax	rate	
including the one-off charge for the 
increase in supplementary corporation 
tax	rate	was	83%.	The	u K	government	
has also released draft legislation 
to	restrict	the	tax	relief	available	on	
decommissioning expenditure to 
50%	in	2012.	This	change	is	not	yet	
substantively	enacted	but	would	
be	likely	to	give	rise	to	a	one-off	
exceptional additional tax charge in 
2012	in	the	order	of	$21.6	million.
Additional	depletion	costs	of	$17.0	
million	($3.8	per	Boe)	have	resulted	
from	the	fair	value	uplift	of	the	Dons	oil	
and	gas	assets	on	acquisition	at	IPO	and	
are	reported	as	a	fair	value	adjustment.
Finance costs
Finance	costs	of	$18.6	million	include	
$7.8	million	unwinding	of	discount	
on	decommissioning	provisions,	
$4.8	million	of	costs	associated	with	
the	Group’s	revolving	credit	facility	
and letter of credit utilisation during 
the year and a one-off premium of 
$5.9	million	following	a	decision	to	
re-price	the	Group’s	2011	oil	collars	
in	the	second	half	of	the	year.
Finance income
Finance	income	of	$4.0	million	includes

valuation	of	the	mark	to	market	gain	
of	$2.1	million	on	the	Group’s	2012	oil

FInanc Ial REVIEW CONTINuED
Earnings per share
The	Group’s	reported	basic	earnings	
per	share	were	7.6	cents	for	the	year	
ended	31	December	2011	compared	
with	4.0	cents	in	2010.	The	increase	
of	3.6	cents	is	attributable	to	the	
combined impact of an increase in 
production	volumes	and	realised	oil	
price	in	the	year	ended	31	December	
2011	compared	with	the	previous	year.	
Cash flow and liquidity
The	Group’s	reported	cash	generated	
from	operations	in	2011	increased	
by	$388.6	million	to	$656.3	million	
(2010:	$267.7	million),	generating	an	
increase	in	the	reported	cash	flow	
from	operations	per	issued	Ordinary	
share	of	110%	to	81.9	cents	per	share	
compared	to	the	previous	year	(2010:	
39.0	cents	per	share).	This	increase	
results mainly from the combination 
of	higher	average	reported	realised	
oil prices and additional production 
volumes	in	2011	compared	with	2010.	
During	the	year	ended	31	December	
2011,	$10.9	million	of	income	tax	
payments	were	made,	mainly	in	
settlement	of	Stratic	pre-acquisition	
Italian	tax	liabilities.	As	a	result	of	
acquisitions	and	transactions	made	
since	the	year	end,	it	is	expected	that	
the	underlying	effective	tax	rate	for	
2012	will	be	around	62%,	excluding	
one-off	exceptional	tax	items,	and	
that	there	will	be	no	cash	outflow	
for	u K	income	tax	before	2014.
Significant	projects	were	undertaken	
during	the	year,	including:
•	 expenditure on the Alma and 
Galia	joint	development;
•	 drilling and completing 
Don	Southwest	S8Z	and	
S9	development	wells;
•	 drilling and completing Conrie 
S7	development	well;
•	 West	Don	W1	intervention	
well	drilling	programme;
•	 drilling and completing Thistle 
A56/13	and	A57/58	development	
wells,	and	drilling	of	the	Thistle	
DEV-P1	development	well	which	
was	completed	Q1	2012;	
•	 Thistle	power	generation	
upgrade programme;
•	 Heather	rig	reactivation	programme;
•	 Crathes exploration and 
appraisal	well;	and
•	 unsuccessful	Don	Southwest	Area	
26,	Ivy,	Moon	and	Tudor	Rose	
exploration	and	appraisal	wells.
Net	cash	at	31	December	2011	
amounted	to	$378.9	million	
compared	to	$41.4	million	in	2010.
On	6	March	2012,	in	anticipation	of	
the	maturity	of	the	existing	Revolving	
Credit	Facility	Agreement,	the	Group	
established	a	$900.0	million	Multi-

Bank	of	America	Merrill	Lynch,	
Barclays,	BNP	Paribas,	Crédit	Agricole

Scotland.	The	facility	comprises	a	
committed	amount	of	$525.0	million	
for	three	years,	extendable	to	four	
years at the option of the Company 
and	a	further	year	with	consent	of	
the	lenders.	A	further	$375.0	million

increased	to	$1,273.6	million	at	31	
December	2011	from	$1,134.2	million	
at	31	December	2010.	The	increase	
of	$139.4	million	is	mainly	due	to	oil	
and	gas	asset	additions	of	$291.7	
million,	additional	decommissioning	
provisions	arising	on	drilling	new	
development	wells	of	$33.8	million	and

(PEDL)	and	Stratic	respectively.	
During	2011	the	PEDL	fair	value	
allocation	was	reviewed	and	updated	
to	reflect	the	finalisation	of	working	
capital	adjustments,	resulting	in	a	
$2.8	million	decrease	in	the	recorded	
goodwill.	Similarly,	the	Stratic	fair	
value	allocation	was	reviewed	and	
updated	to	reflect	the	finalisation	of	
tangible	and	intangible	asset	valuations	
and tax estimates; resulting in an 
increase	in	goodwill	of	$8.7	million.

Following	the	disposal	of	the	Slovenian	
Petisovci	asset	on	11	February	
2011	and	the	purchase	of	a	further

Ascent	Resources	plc	which	is	valued	
at	$6.7	million	based	on	the	quoted

Asset held for sale
During	2011,	$1.3	million	of	costs	
associated	with	the	Group’s	Dutch

The decrease is primarily due to a 
reduction	in	joint	venture	receivables	
in	relation	to	the	Don	fields.

provisions
The	Group’s	decommissioning	
provision	increased	by	$41.1	million	
to	$181.2	million	at	31	December	2011	
(2010:	$140.1	million).	The	increase	
is due to the combined impact of 
additions	of	$33.8	million	during	the	
year	resulting	from	the	Group’s	drilling	
programme,	$16.9	million	resulting	from	
a change in decommissioning estimates 
and	unwinding	of	the	discount	of	
$7.8	million,	offset	by	utilisation	of	
the	provision	of	$17.4	million	on	well	
abandonment	and	various	small	facility	
decommissioning	workscopes.
Deferred tax liability
The	Group’s	deferred	tax	liability	(net	
of	deferred	tax	asset)	has	increased	
by	$295.9	million	to	$577.4	million	at	
31	December	2011	from	$281.5	million	
in	2010.	The	increase	is	due	mainly	to	
a one-off deferred tax adjustment of 
$68.1	million	in	respect	of	the	increase	
in	the	supplementary	charge	on	u K	
oil	and	gas	production	which	has	
been	reported	as	an	exceptional	item,	
the	significant	capital	expenditure	
programme	undertaken	by	the	Group	
during	the	year	which	provides	the	
Group	with	100%	first	year	capital	
allowance	claims,	and	partial	utilisation	
of	taxation	losses	brought	forward.	
Total	losses	carried	forward	at	the	year	
end	amount	to	approximately	$185	
million	of	which	$34	million	relates	
to	losses	carried	forward	relating	to	
the	Don	assets	and	$123	million	in	
respect	of	the	Stratic	acquisition.
t rade and other payables
Trade	and	other	payables	have	
increased	to	$234.3	million	at	
31 December	2011	from	$135.7	million	
at	31	December	2010.	The	increase	
of	$98.6	million	is	primarily	due	to	an	
increase	in	accruals	of	$71.7	million	
and an increase in trade creditors of 
$14.5	million	resulting	from	the	Group’s	
drilling and capital project programmes 
which	were	ongoing	at	the	end	of	2011	
and an increase in other payables of 
$12.5	million	which	was	mainly	due	
to	the	increase	in	the	year	end	over-
lift	position	compared	with	2010.
Financial risk management
The	Group	is	exposed	to	the	impact	of	
changes in Brent crude oil prices on its 
revenue	and	profits.	During	2010	the	
Group	entered	into	four	zero	premium	
oil	price	collars	covering	approximately	
4	million	barrels	of	2011	production	
with	an	average	floor	price	of	$75	per	
barrel	and	an	average	cap	of	$100	per	
barrel.	In	August	2011,	two	of	the	oil	
price	collars	were	re-priced	to	give	a	
revised	average	cap	of	$108	per	barrel.
In	November	2011,	a	further	five	put	and	
call	options	covering	approximately	
3	million	barrels	of	oil	production	in	
2012	were	entered	into	partially	to	
hedge	the	exposure	to	fluctuations	in	
the	Brent	oil	price.	The	2012	oil	price	
hedge contracts consist of put spreads 
at	$95	per	barrel	and	$70	per	barrel	
and	calls	at	an	average	of	$122	per	
barrel,	all	executed	on	a	costless	basis.
EnQuest’s	functional	currency	is	u S	
dollars.	Foreign	currency	risk	arises	
on purchases and the translation of 
assets and liabilities denominated 
in	currencies	other	than	u S	dollars.	
During	the	second	half	of	2011,	the	
Group	entered	into	a	number	of	
forward	currency	contracts	to	hedge	
a	total	of	£123.0	million	(at	an	average

 GOVERNANCE
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Safeguarding our people and 
our environment
Our	focus	on	the	safety	of	our	
staff	and	our	environmental	
impact	remains	critical	to	the	way	
we	operate	as	a	business.	This	is	
embedded	in	our	culture,	in	the	way	
we	manage	the	Company	and	how	
our	employees	organise	their	work	
every	day.	Our	standards	are	high.	
We	expect	to	exceed	them	and	
constantly	strive	to	improve	them.
Personal	Safety	performance	during	
2011	was	good	with	just	two	Lost	
Time	Incidents	(LTI)	recorded,	both	
hand	injuries,	and	this	put	us	once	
again	in	the	top	quartile	of	industry	
performance	with	a	Lost	Time	Injury	
Frequency	Rate	(LTIFR)	of	0.44	
compared	with	the	latest	industry	
average	of	1.82.	Key	achievements	
include a four year unbroken record 
for	the	Thistle	Drilling	Rig	without	any	
LTIs,	the	Northern	Producer	completed	
a	second	LTI	free	year,	and	the	John	
Shaw	Drilling	Rig	achieved	one	year	LTI	
free;	records	that	we	are	all	proud	of.
Safety	leadership	is	critical	to	our	
success.	Each	member	of	the	leadership	
team	makes	frequent	offshore	safety	
visits,	auditing	specific	activities	and	
generally	raising	the	safety	profile.	
We	continue	to	invest	in	this	area,	
we	strengthened	the	Health,	Safety,	
Environment	and	Quality	(HSEQ)	team	
with	a	new	manager,	John	Atkinson,	who	
was	formerly	asset	manager	of	Heather	
and	Broom,	so	he	brings	considerable	
operational	experience	to	the	role.
Our	environmental	performance	remains	
in	line	with	the	industry	average.	The	
installation of hydrocyclones has 
significantly	improved	the	oil	in	water	
(OIW)	performance	on	Heather	bringing	
our	OIW	emissions	back	in	line	with	our	
target.	During	the	year,	a	number	of	
minor	OIW	incidents	occurred,	relating	
to	the	transfer	of	fluids	from	supply	
vessels.	A	specific	project	to	tackle	this	
issue	has	recommended	modifications	
to	the	bunkering	processes.	CO
2
 
emissions	were	marginally	ahead	
of last year as a result of additional 
flaring	on	Thistle,	but	gas	flaring	overall	
remained	below	permitted	limits.
We	are	on	track	to	achieve	ISO	14000	in	
2012	as	our	environmental	management	
system	continues	to	develop.	Our	
Alma	Development	Environmental	
Submission	was	a	clear	demonstration	
of	our	progress.	This	comprehensive	
report includes a rigorous and detailed 
risk	assessment	with	mitigating	
strategies,	setting	the	standard	for	all	
of	our	installations	going	forward.
Our	efforts	to	promote	a	healthy	
working	environment	across	
the	Company	achieved	external	
recognition	this	year	when	we	were	
awarded	the	Healthy	Working	Lives	
Bronze	award,	part	of	a	Scottish	
Government	initiative,	and	we	are	now	
working	towards	the	Silver	award.
A high performance team
Since	flotation,	we	have	focused	
on building the high performance 
organisation	essential	to	delivering	
EnQuest’s	ambitious	growth	plans.	
Scaling	up	the	business	has	been	
critical.	We	have	more	than	doubled	
in	size	since	IPO,	in	2011	we	recruited	
around	200	people	and	we	expanded	
into	a	second	office	in	Aberdeen.	We	
ended	the	year	with	a	core	staff	of	
just	under	300	high	calibre	individuals	
and	a	total	workforce	of	around	1,300	
including	our	offshore	contractors.
Our	objective	has	been	to	attract	
the	best	in	the	industry,	and	we	have	
succeeded in attracting not only people 
who	are	highly	skilled	in	their	field,	but	
also	people	for	whom	EnQuest’s	values	
resonate	strongly	and	positively.	During	
the	year	we	enhanced	our	remuneration	
framework	to	ensure	that	we	had	the	
right	salary	and	incentives	package	to	
compete successfully for highly sought 
after	skills	in	the	subsurface,	well	drilling	
and	project	engineering	disciplines.	In	
addition	to	these	enhanced	incentives,	
our	strong	production	growth	
and	active	business	development	
programme,	in	particular	the	new	Alma	
and	Galia	hub,	has	helped	to	raise	our	
profile	and	build	our	reputation	as	
an	innovative,	dynamic	employer.
Whilst	recruitment	has	been	a	key	
focus	over	the	last	12	months,	retention	
is	clearly	of	equal	importance.	To	
ensure	that	this	remains	high,	we	
have	begun	to	develop	a	series	of	
technical ladders to facilitate technical 
career	progression.	The	first	of	these	
is	for	subsurface	disciplines,	such	as	
geophysicists,	geologists,	and	reservoir	
engineers.	Career	ladders	for	other	
disciplines	will	be	rolled	out	during	2012.
We	have	now	built	what	we	believe	to	be	
a	centre	of	excellence	in	Aberdeen,	with	
one	of	the	best	integrated	development	
teams	in	the	industry.	The	EnQuest	
development	machine	is	well	and	truly	in	
place,	underpinned	by	in-depth	expertise	
and	firmly	focused	on	execution.
We	believe	that	open,	frequent	
communication is key to employee 
engagement	and	nurturing	our	culture.	
Short	weekly	bulletins	keep	staff	up-
to-date	with	progress	on	production,	
health	and	safety,	and	our	share	price,	
aligning	the	workforce	behind	our	key	
performance	indicators.	These	are	
supplemented	by	‘Town	Hall’	events	
where	employees	are	briefed	directly	
by	EnQuest	executive	directors	and	
get	the	opportunity	to	ask	questions	
on	a	range	of	topics.	A	new	feature	
this year has been the introduction 
of	a	series	of	high	quality,	engaging	
videos	that	give	staff	a	real	insight	
into	projects	going	on	offshore.
Operating	to	the	highest	ethical	
standards has been part our culture 
from	the	day	we	started.	We	put	a	
detailed Code of Conduct in place in 
2010	and	this	year	we	updated	this	
significantly,	augmenting	the	section	
on	business	ethics	to	reflect	the	
requirements	of	the	u K	Bribery	Act.	
This reinforces our commitment to 
ensure	our	employees	act	with	complete	
integrity	at	all	times,	including	how	we	
interact	with	our	partners	and	suppliers.
Working with our local community
The	highlight	of	the	year	was	probably	
our participation in the Aberdeen 
Corporate	Decathlon.	This	was	a	hugely	
successful	event	for	us	on	several	
levels.	Raising	a	substantial	sum	for	
a	local	cancer	charity	was	a	fantastic	
result,	but	of	equal	importance	was	
the team building that supported 
this.	It	was	particularly	pleasing	
to	be	nominated	as	the	winning	
company	of	the	Charity	Challenge.
We	have	continued	to	develop	our	
relationship	with	Tullos	primary	school	
in	Aberdeen,	providing	funds	for	books,	
school	trips	and	contributing	towards	an	
Active	Maths	Scheme	that	is	part	of	the	
‘Curriculum	for	Excellence’	programme.	
Contributions	were	also	made	towards	
the purchase of children’s mountain 
bikes,	in	conjunction	with	Aberdeen	City	
Council’s	Go	Mountain	Biking	initiative.
We	also	focused	on	environmental	and	
youth projects including supporting 
two	local	swimming	clubs,	football	
clubs	and	the	Solstice	Garden	
Centre	that	helps	people	who	have	
experienced mental health problems 
return	to	the	workplace,	by	offering	
work	experience	and	horticultural	
training.	This	was	complemented	by	
corporate donations to a number 
of	local	and	national	charities.
We	see	positive	benefits	for	our	staff	
from	these	activities	and	intend	to	
build	on	this	in	2012	by	forming	a	
new	committee	to	decide	the	best	
way	to	allocate	the	funds	we	raise. EnQuest PLC

Audit and auditors
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the 
auditors, the audit committee has recommended to the 
Board that the existing auditors, Ernst & Young LLP be 
reappointed. Ernst & Young LLP has expressed their 
willingness to continue as auditors. An ordinary resolution to 
reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors of the Company 
and authorising the directors to set their remuneration will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Financial risk and financial instruments
Information on financial risk management, including credit 
and liquidity risks and information about financial 
instruments, is set out in the Financial Review on pages 30 
to 33 and the notes to the financial statements on pages 58 
to 86 respectively.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Business Review on pages 6 to 35. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flow, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described in the 
Financial Review on pages 30 to 33. In addition, note 27 to 
the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together 
with 2P reserves of 115.2 MMboe. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.

 OVERVIEW
 BUSINESS REVIEW
 GOVERNANCE
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Board delegates the execution of its strategic objectives 
to the executive committee, which comprises the executive 
directors and senior management. Operational management 
of the Group on a day-to-day basis is managed by the 
operational committee, which comprises members of  
the executive committee, asset managers and selected 
senior management. 
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant 
information to enable it to perform its duties. The company 
secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the 
chairman, on all governance matters. In addition, each 
director has access to the advice and services of the 
company secretary. There is also a procedure agreed by the 
Board, in furtherance of the duties, to take independent 
professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense, 
up to a pre-determined limit. 
Board diversity
The Board is aware of the provisions of the Governance 
Code and has due regard for the benefits of diversity, 
including gender, on the Board. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board has in place a procedure for the consideration 
and authorisation of conflicts or possible conflicts with the 
Company’s interests. In accordance with the directors’ 
interests provisions in the Companies Act 2006, all the 
directors are required to submit details to the company 
secretary of any situations which may give rise to a conflict, 
or potential conflict, of interest. The Board monitors and 
reviews potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis. 
Re-election of directors
In accordance with the Governance Code, all of the directors 
will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the 
AGM on 30 May 2012, with the exception of Alexandre 
Schneiter. 
Senior independent non-executive director
Helmut Langanger continues to be the senior independent 
non-executive director. The main responsibilities for the 
senior independent non-executive director are as follows:
• to be available to shareholders in the event that they may 
feel it inappropriate to relay views through the chairman, 
chief executive or the chief financial officer; 
• to provide a sounding board for the chairman and to 
serve as an intermediary with other directors when 
necessary; and
• to meet with the other non-executive directors without 
the chairman present at least annually in order to evaluate 
the performance of the chairman. 
Board meetings
During 2011, seven scheduled meetings of the Board were 
held, six of which were held at the Company’s registered 
office in London and one meeting held offsite. Details of 
attendance at each of those meetings, and at meetings of 
the Board committees, are set out in the table on page 44. 
During the year, a number of other meetings took place  
to deal with specific matters that required consideration  
at short notice, and in each case, notice was duly given  
to all the directors. Any director who is unable to attend 
scheduled or short notice Board meetings in person  
is invited to join the meeting by video or telephone 
conferencing facilities, or is given the opportunity to  
be consulted and comment in advance of the meeting  
by telephone or in writing. 
EnQuest’s commitment to corporate governance 
EnQuest is committed to achieving compliance with the 
principles and provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in June 2010 (Governance Code) which applies to 
listed companies with financial years beginning on or after 
29 June 2010, and ensuring that high standards of corporate 
governance are maintained. 
Set out below is a statement of how the Company applied 
the principles of the Governance Code for the year ended 31 
December 2011. The Board considers that the Company 
complies and has been in compliance during the preceding 
12 months, with all provisions of the Governance Code, other 
than as detailed below.
The EnQuest Board 
The Board currently comprises the chairman, the chief 
executive, two executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. The directors’ biographies are set out on pages 36 
and 37. Robin Pinchbeck served as a non-executive director 
during part of the year, and retired at the AGM held on 
25 May 2011. The Board appointed a new independent 
non-executive director, Clare Spottiswoode, with effect  
from 1 July 2011. 
No group of individuals dominate the Board’s decision 
making process and none of the directors has any conflict 
of interest between their duties to the Company and their 
private interests. The division of responsibilities between 
the chairman and the chief executive has been clearly 
established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
In the opinion of the Board, Jock Lennox, Helmut Langanger 
and Clare Spottiswoode are fully independent for the 
purposes of the Governance Code. However, the remaining 
non-executive director, Alexandre Schneiter, due to his 
association with Lundin Petroleum AB (being the entity that 
the Company partly demerged out of in 2010), is not deemed 
to be independent for the purposes of the Governance Code. 
Notwithstanding the fact that Alexandre Schneiter is not 
deemed independent for the purpose of the Governance 
Code, the other directors, having given full consideration to 
this issue, agreed that his knowledge of the Company’s 
business and the experience he brings to his role, outweighed 
the resulting non-compliance with the Governance Code. The 
Board is also satisfied that it maintained a sufficient degree 
of independence throughout the year to enable it to 
discharge effectively and properly its obligations under the 
Governance Code. 
In order to achieve full compliance with the Governance 
Code, it was stated in the Company’s listing Prospectus 
dated 18 March 2010 and re-affirmed in last year’s Corporate 
Governance Report, that Alexandre Schneiter will be retiring 
as a non-executive director at the AGM on 30 May 2012 and 
the Board plans to appoint a new independent non-
executive director as a replacement for Alexandre Schneiter. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision, which was approved by the Board 
in 2010. Its reserved matters include determination of the 
overall strategy of the Group, to review business plans, trading 
performance and overhead costs, to approve major capital 
investment projects, examine acquisition opportunities and 
divestment possibilities, review significant financial and 
operational issues, and review and approve the Company’s 
financial statements, control and risk management systems. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2011
44
Set out below are reports from the audit committee, 
remuneration committee and nomination committee. 
Audit committee
The audit committee currently comprises three non-
executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board 
to be independent and have recent and relevant financial 
experience.
The members of the audit committee during the year were 
as follows:
• Jock Lennox (Chairman)
• Helmut Langanger
• Dr James Buckee (ceased to be a member of the 
committee on 1 July 2011)
• Clare Spottiswoode (joined the committee on 1 July 2011)
The audit committee met three times in 2011. At the request 
of the audit committee, the chief financial officer and a 
senior member of the finance department attended each of 
these meetings. The chief executive also attended the 
meetings when invited to do so by the committee. In 
addition, all three meetings were attended by the external 
auditors, who receive copies of all the audit committee 
papers. Deloitte, in their role as internal auditors, attend as 
appropriate. The chairman of the committee regularly meets 
with the external audit partner and the internal audit partner 
to discuss matters relevant to the Company.
The main responsibilities of the audit committee include:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements, 
including annual and interim reports and any other formal 
announcement relating to the Company’s financial 
performance;
• monitoring and reviewing the process of audit of the 
Group’s Proven and Probable Reserves by a recognised 
Competent Person;
• monitoring and reviewing the Company’s internal control 
procedures and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the external 
and internal audit activities;
• making recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment, review and removal of external auditors;
• establishing the external auditors’ remuneration;
• monitoring external auditors’ independence;
• monitoring the policy on external auditors’ non-audit 
services; and
• identifying any matters in respect of which it considers 
that action or improvement is needed and making 
recommendations to the Board as to the steps to 
be taken.
In fulfilling its responsibility to monitor the integrity of 
financial reports to shareholders, the audit committee 
reviewed the accounting principles, policies and practises 
adopted in the presentation of public financial information. 
During the year under review, the Group’s half year financial 
report and full year Annual Report were reviewed by the 
audit committee before recommending publication to the 
Board. In carrying out this review the committee discussed 
with management how they had applied the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements, including key 
assumptions regarding decommissioning, oil price, goodwill 
impairment testing and taxation. The committee also 
considered the reports from the external auditors. The 
committee also reviewed the Group’s approach to estimating 
and auditing of the oil and gas reserves. The committee held 
private meetings with the external auditors without 
management present. These meetings provided the 
opportunity for direct feedback and discussion between the 
committee and the external auditors. The committee also 
considered the performance of the external auditor and 
internal audit and the effectiveness of its own performance. 
Various improvements were identified and adopted.
The formal agenda for each scheduled Board meeting is 
drawn up by the company secretary in consultation with the 
chairman and with agreement from the chief executive. 
Formal minutes of all Board and committee meetings are 
circulated to all directors prior to the next Board meeting 
and are considered for approval at that Board meeting. In 
addition, the chief executive is in frequent contact with the 
non-executive directors between meetings in order to keep 
them updated with progress on the Group’s business. The 
chairman also meets the non-executive directors informally, 
without any executives present, to discuss matters in respect 
of the business.

 OVERVIEW
 BUSINESS REVIEW
 GOVERNANCE
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Nomination committee
The nomination committee currently comprises the 
chairman, three independent non-executive directors and, to 
ensure input from the executive, the chief executive.
The members of the nomination committee during the year 
were as follows:
• Dr James Buckee (chairman)
• Helmut Langanger 
• Jock Lennox
• Clare Spottiswoode (joined the committee on 1 July 2011)
• Amjad Bseisu
The main responsibilities of the nomination committee 
include:
• reviewing the size, structure and composition of the 
Board in order to recommend changes to the Board and 
to ensure the orderly succession of directors; 
• formalising succession planning and the process for new 
director appointments; 
• identifying, evaluating and recommending candidates for 
appointment or reappointment as directors or company 
secretary, taking into account the balance of knowledge, 
skills and experience required to serve the Board; and
• reviewing the outside directorships/commitments of 
non-executive directors.
The nomination committee met once in 2011, in order to deal 
with the appointment of Clare Spottiswoode as a non-
executive director of the Company. The following procedure 
was followed in respect of this appointment:
  The committee evaluated the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience of the Board with a view to identifying 
any gaps in the skill set of the Board and also where gaps 
would exist following Robin Pinchbeck standing down as 
a director at the 2011 AGM. The committee then decided 
to conduct a search for a new non-executive director with 
a commercial and/or financial background and with 
relevant oil and gas sector experience. The committee 
instructed Heidrick & Struggles to conduct the search, 
from which a list of candidates was provided to the 
chairman and chief executive. Following this, a shortlist 
was prepared and candidates were first interviewed by 
the chairman and chief executive, and the preferred 
candidates were interviewed again by other members 
of the committee and the executive directors.
  This process identified Clare Spottiswoode as the preferred 
candidate based on her business and commercial skills and 
her experience in the oil and gas sector (her biographical 
details are set out on page 37). The nomination committee 
then recommended to the Board that Clare Spottiswoode 
be appointed a non-executive director of the Company 
and her proposed appointment was unanimously approved 
by the Board. Consequently, Clare was appointed with 
effect from 1 July 2011, and at the same time was appointed 
a member of the Company’s audit, nomination and 
remuneration committees. 
The Board and nomination committee are satisfied that  
the individuals currently fulfilling key senior management 
positions in the Group have the requisite depth and breadth 
of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that orderly 
succession to the Board and executive committee can 
take place. 
Induction and training
New directors receive induction on their appointment to  
the Board covering the activities of the Group and its key 
business and financial risks, the Terms of Reference of the 
Board and its committees and the latest financial information 
about the Group.
In its role of monitoring and approving the level and type of 
non-audit services to be delivered by the external auditor, 
the committee had regard to consideration whether through 
its knowledge of specific transactions, the external auditor 
was best placed to deliver the services to the Group. 
Assessment of the continuing independence of the external 
auditor was also undertaken. As a result of these 
considerations a number of projects were approved to be 
performed by the external auditors during the year and a 
number were not. It is the policy that the Group has 
relationships with a number of service providers that can 
provide similar services to the external auditors.
During the year the internal audit approach was reviewed 
and found to be effective. Accordingly Deloitte developed 
an audit plan for 2011 based on their review of the significant 
risks identified by the Group, discussion with senior 
management and with the audit committee. The plan 
centred on the risks around the establishment of the Group 
as an independent organisation. The approach to internal 
audit will be considered again in 2012 and its link with other 
aspects of risk management assurance that are conducted in 
the Group.
In 2011 the Group updated its Code of Conduct policy which 
all employees and contractors are required to comply with 
and the new Code was rolled out across the organisation. 
The Code includes procedures for whistle-blowing whereby 
concerns can be raised in confidence about possible 
financial wrong doing or other misconduct. The committee 
is satisfied that arrangements are in place for concerns to be 
raised, how these are investigated, and that the appropriate 
follow-up action is taken.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee currently comprises three 
non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the 
Board to be independent.
The members of the remuneration committee during the 
year were as follows:
• Helmut Langanger (Chairman)
• Jock Lennox
• Dr James Buckee (ceased to be a member of the 
committee on 1 July 2011)
• Clare Spottiswoode (joined the committee on 1 July 2011)
The remuneration committee met four times in 2011. The 
chief executive, at the request of the committee, attended 
the meetings. The chairman also attended meetings after he 
ceased to be a member of the committee, as an observer, at 
the request of the committee. The chief executive did not 
participate in any discussions relating to his own 
remuneration. 
The main responsibilities of the remuneration committee 
include:
• setting the remuneration policy for the chairman, 
executive directors and senior executives; 
• assessing and determining total compensation packages 
available to the executive and non-executive directors; 
• monitoring the remuneration of senior management other 
than the executive directors whose remuneration it sets; 
• making recommendations to the Board for its approval, 
and that of shareholders, on the design of long-term 
share incentive plans and making recommendations for 
the grant of awards to executives under such plans; and 
• determining policy and scope for pension rights and any 
compensation payments and ensuring compliance with 
the Governance Code in this respect. 
Further information on the remuneration committee can be 
found in the Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 51.  EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2011

Details of principal risk and uncertainties are discussed in the 
Business Review on pages 16 and 17. 
Auditor independence 
The audit committee and Board recognise the importance 
and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors, Ernst & 
Young LLP, when performing their role in the Company’s 
reporting to shareholders. The external auditors are expected 
to provide the audit committee with information about 
policies and processes for maintaining independence and 
monitoring compliance with current regulatory requirements, 
including those regarding the rotation of audit partners 
and staff. 
The overall performance, independence and objectivity of 
the auditors is reviewed regularly by the audit committee. 
The audit committee has a policy in respect of the provision 
of non-audit services to the Company by the external auditor. 
Fees payable to Ernst & Young LLP during 2011 amounted to 
$263,000 (2010: $369,000) for audit related services and 
$991,000 (2010: $794,000) for non-audit services including 
tax advice on asset and corporate acquisitions. 
Communication with shareholders 
Communications with shareholders are given high priority  
by the Board. In 2011 EnQuest sent its maiden Annual Report 
and Accounts to all registered shareholders. In order to 
ensure that the Board developed a strong dialogue with 
shareholders, during 2011 the executive directors and senior 
management met with institutional investors in London and 
across the UK as well as other European and North 
American cities. These roadshows, combined with the 
attendance of various directors and senior management  
at several oil and gas sector conferences, provided for 
comprehensive and engaging dialogue with shareholders.
The Company issues its results and other news releases 
promptly and publishes them on the Company’s website  
at www.enquest.com. Other corporate information issued 
during the year is also available on the website. Shareholders 
and other interested parties can subscribe to receive news 
updates by email by registering online on the website. 
At the 2012 AGM, a business presentation will be provided 
for the benefit of shareholders. The chairman will aim to 
ensure that the respective chairmen of the audit and 
remuneration committees attend the AGM to answer 
questions and that the other directors also attend. 
Compliance with the governance statement
Throughout 2011, the Company complied with the provisions 
of the Governance Code, except in the following areas: 
• up to 1 July 2011, less than half the Board, excluding  
the chairman, comprised independent non-executive 
directors. Following the appointment of Clare 
Spottiswoode with effect from 1 July 2011, as an 
independent non-executive director, there are an equal 
number of executive and independent non-executive 
directors; and 
• the chairman was a member of the audit committee up  
to 1 July 2011, when he ceased to be a member, following 
the appointment on the same date of Clare Spottiswoode, 
as an independent non-executive director. 
On behalf of the Board
Dr James Buckee
Chairman of the Board
26 March 2012
The chairman ensures that directors update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Company in order to fulfil 
their roles on the Board and on Board committees. Ongoing 
training is provided as necessary and includes updates from 
the company secretary on changes to the Listing Rules, 
requirements under the Companies Act and other regulatory 
matters. Directors may consult with the company secretary 
at any time on matters related to their role on the Board.
Board performance evaluation 
An evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
committees, the individual directors and the chairman, was 
conducted in the first quarter of 2012 by the chairman and 
the results of the review were then fed back to the Board  
as a whole. The evaluation focused on the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the members 
of the Board, including its diversity, how the Board functions 
and other factors relevant to its effectiveness. The 
biographies of each director, together with the skills and 
experience that each director brings to their role, including 
all other directorship appointments held by such individuals, 
is included on pages 36 to 37. The Company intends to 
conduct an externally facilitated Board evaluation process  
at the end of 2012, at which time the Board will have been  
in operation for three financial years, since its formation 
in 2010. 
Following the evaluation, the directors concluded that the 
Board and its committees operate effectively and also 
consider that each director is contributing effectively and 
demonstrates commitment to the role. 
Internal controls
The Company’s system of internal controls is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and  
not absolute reassurance against misstatement or loss.  
The Board will continue to review and improve the system  
of internal controls.
The Board recognises the need for effective internal controls 
and for evaluating and managing the risks of the Company. 
Such matters are brought to the attention of the Board at  
its formal Board meetings or ad hoc discussions. 
High level controls in operation include:
• review of management accounts with comparison of 
actual performance against prior periods and budget; 
• approval of orders, authorisation of invoices and the 
requirement of two signatures to make a transfer from  
the principal bank accounts;
• reconciliation of all control accounts; 
• prior approval by the Board for major investments; and 
• segregation of duties between relevant functions and 
departments. 
The Board has ensured that the process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group accords with the Turnbull Guidance, and that the 
process has been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board is aware of the need to conduct regular risk 
assessments to identify any deficiencies in the controls 
currently operating over all aspects of the Company. 
The financial reporting procedures were reviewed during  
the year, following which the Board were able to confirm  
that the financial reporting procedures established provided 
them with a reasonable basis on which to make proper 
judgements on the financial position and prospects of  
the Company on an ongoing basis.

• the remuneration framework should reflect the growth 
focus of EnQuest and provide emphasis on long-term 
sustainable growth;
• total remuneration should be competitive versus 
compensation benchmarks of UK oil and gas companies 
of a similar size to EnQuest; and
• the remuneration structure should be consistent with UK 
corporate governance principles and best practice. 
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on 
Responsible Investment Disclosure, the committee will 
ensure that the incentive structure for executive directors 
and senior management will not raise environmental, social 
or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour. More generally, the remuneration committee will 
ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not 
encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
Within the framework, executive directors, senior 
management and key technical, commercial and professional 
staff are incentivised by having the various components of 
reward benchmarked as follows:
• basic salaries would typically be median or below 
benchmarked salaries against UK oil and gas companies 
of a similar size to EnQuest; however to be able to attract 
key technical staff in a competitive market, upper quartile 
base salaries may be offered; and
• the variable elements of remuneration are above median 
when expressed as a percentage of the at or below 
median salaries and are structured so that individuals can 
achieve total remuneration that is upper quartile subject 
to achievement of challenging performance by both the 
Company and the individual.
The remuneration committee believes establishing a 
remuneration framework which sets the fixed elements  
at median or below and provides incentives capable of 
delivering upper quartile pay for delivery of superior 
performance is the most effective way in which to ensure 
that the executive directors and senior management are 
incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic goals and 
thus deliver long-term shareholder value.
The Company’s annual remuneration programme currently 
consists of three primary components: base salary and 
benefits, annual performance pay, and long-term incentive 
awards granted under the Company’s current share  
incentive plans. 
The chart below illustrates the relationship between base 
salary and the variable elements of remuneration for 
executive directors at different levels of performance. For 
on-target performance, a bonus award of 100% of salary  
and a Performance Share Plan (PSP) award worth 50% of 
the normal maximum Long Term Incentive award, i.e. 100% 
of salary, has been assumed. For stretch performance, a 
bonus award of 200% of salary is assumed and a PSP award 
in line with the normal maximum, i.e. 200% of salary, has 
been assumed.
Introduction 
The Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (the ‘regulations). The report also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Financial Services Authority’s Listing 
Rules and describes how the Board has applied the Principles 
of Good Governance relating to directors’ remuneration. 
A resolution to approve the report will be put to 
shareholders at the AGM on 30 May 2012.
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee is a formal committee of the 
Board, and has powers delegated to it under the Company’s 
Articles. Its Terms of Reference were formally adopted by 
the Board in March 2010, a copy of which is available on the 
Company’s website. The primary purposes of the 
remuneration committee, as set out in its Terms of 
Reference, are to:
• recommend to the Board the broad policy in respect  
of senior management remuneration; 
• ensure that the levels of remuneration are appropriate  
in order to encourage enhanced performance; 
• approve the design and set the targets for any 
performance-related pay scheme;
• review the design of all share incentive plans before 
approval by the Board and shareholders, to monitor the 
application of the rules of such schemes and the overall 
aggregate amount of such awards; and
• set the remuneration of the chairman, executive directors 
and senior management including annual cash bonus and 
share incentive arrangements. 
The members of the remuneration committee up until the 
date of this Report were Helmut Langanger (chairman), Jock 
Lennox and Clare Spottiswoode. Clare Spottiswoode was 
appointed onto the remuneration committee in July 2011 and 
at the same time Dr James Buckee stood down from the 
remuneration committee. All members of the remuneration 
committee are considered by the Board to be independent 
as explained in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 
43 to 46. The chairman, chief executive, HR director and the 
company secretary attend meetings of the remuneration 
committee by invitation but are not present for any 
discussions that directly relate to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy – overview
EnQuest’s remuneration policy is designed to encourage 
behaviour and performance among executive directors and 
senior management which the remuneration committee 
believes is in the best interest of shareholders. 
A key objective of the remuneration committee is to establish 
a level of remuneration which is sufficient to attract, retain 
and motivate the executive directors and senior management 
and to align their remuneration with the achievement of the 
Company’s strategic, business and financial objectives and 
thereby enhance shareholder value. 
During 2011, EnQuest undertook a study of remuneration 
within the oil and gas sector and FTSE 250 companies. New 
Bridge Street (a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited) provided 
advice and information on EnQuest’s remuneration policy 
and practices for employees during the year. Neither New 
Bridge Street, nor any other part of Aon Hewitt or its 
ultimate parent Aon Corporation, provided other services  
to the Company during the year. A remuneration framework 
was devised and introduced that focused on the key 
managerial, technical, commercial and professional staff 
populations. The framework was underpinned by the 
following key principles:
REMUNERATION REPORT EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2011
48
Executive directors are able to receive performance pay  
of up to 100% of salary for performance that is in line with 
expectations. For outstanding individual and Company 
performance, bonuses of up to 200% of salary may be  
paid. At least one third of performance pay is paid in shares 
which vest after two years, subject to continued employment. 
The actual level of performance pay awarded to the 
executive directors in 2011 ranged between 84% and 93%  
of salary taking into account a blend of Company and 
individual performance.
Long term share incentives 
In order to incentivise executive directors and selected 
senior management to deliver superior levels of long term 
performance for the benefit of shareholders, the remuneration 
committee’s policy is to award these individuals with share 
incentives under the long term incentive plans. The current 
plans are the EnQuest PLC Performance Share Plan 2010 
(2010 PSP), the EnQuest PLC Restricted Share Plan 2010 
(2010 RSP) and the EnQuest PLC Deferred Bonus Share Plan 
2010 (2010 DBSP). Executive directors received initial awards 
relating to the IPO under the 2010 RSP and subsequent 
long term share incentives under the 2010 PSP only.
2010 PSP
The 2010 PSP enables executive directors and selected 
senior employees to be granted conditional awards over 
Company shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent 
on both continued employment with the Company and the 
extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are 
met over a specified period of three financial years. The 
scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create 
shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the 
underlying financial performance of the Company and to 
align their interests closely with those of shareholders. The 
value of share awards to a participant under the 2010 PSP in 
any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of base salary, 
although a 300% of salary limit can be awarded to an 
individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional 
circumstances.
In 2011 PSP awards with a market value of 213% of salary 
were granted to Amjad Bseisu and Nigel Hares, and 211% for 
Jonathan Swinney. These awards were above the 200% limit 
to reflect the strong performance of the Company during 
the 2010 financial year.
Under the PSP, the shares vest subject to the achievement  
of performance conditions. The 2010 PSP share awards 
granted in 2011 had three sets of performance conditions 
associated with them. One third of the award relates to Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group of 36 
oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 
and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX; one third relates to 
production growth per share, and one third relates to 
reserves growth per share, over a three year financial 
performance period.

on page 50.
Reward component 
Base salary and benefits
The base salary and benefits of the executive directors are 
reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any 
changes take effect from 1 January each year. In conducting 
the base salary review, the committee takes into consideration 
factors such as the current competitive market conditions, 
pay and conditions among the wider workforce, and 
particular skills, such as leadership ability and management 
effectiveness, experience, responsibility and proven or 
expected performance of the particular individual. The 
committee obtains information regarding competitive market 
conditions from external benchmarking agencies, as required. 
The chief executive (with the assistance of the chairman of 
the remuneration committee and the HR director) annually 
evaluates the performance of each of the executive directors 
and their direct reports and recommends adjustments to 
base salary which are reviewed by the remuneration 
committee for approval. Compensation of the chief 
executive is reviewed by the chairman of the remuneration 
committee and subsequently approved by the committee.
Prior to the 2012 financial year, the salaries of the executive 
directors had not been reviewed since before the IPO in April 
2010. The committee carried out a review of salaries, and for 
2012 the executive directors salaries were increased to the 
lower quartile of the FTSE 250 benchmark companies: 
£395,000 for Amjad Bseisu (5.3% increase), £290,000 for 
Nigel Hares (1.8%) and £255,000 for Jonathan Swinney 
(15.9%). The average increase for the Company’s other 
employees was 3.7%.
The Company provides a defined contribution pension plan 
for certain employees below executive director level. In lieu 
of such benefits for the executive directors, the Company 
pays an allowance of £30,000 per annum (£40,000 for the 
chief executive). These remained the same as prior years.
Annual performance pay 
The discretionary performance pay scheme applies to all 
employees and executive directors and is based on individual 
and Company performance against objectives. Each measure 
is given a respective weighting, with the executive directors 
receiving 80% of performance pay based on Company 
performance targets and 20% based on individual 
performance targets. The executive directors’ individual 
performance is measured through personal performance 
contracts which were set and approved by the remuneration 
committee in January 2011 and then reviewed by the 
remuneration committee in January 2012. The Company’s 
performance objectives are based on annually defined Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs), which require the achievement 
of operational targets, financial performance, HSE standards, 
portfolio growth and share price performance. These 
measures were met or exceeded for financial performance, 
portfolio growth and HSE standards; and between the 
threshold and on-target levels for operational and share  
price performance. 
The choice of the Company performance targets for 2011 
and their respective weightings, reflects the committee’s 
belief that any short-term performance pay should be tied 
both to the overall performance of the Company and the 
individual’s performance. Similar targets will be used for  
the 2012 scheme.

For performance between median and upper quartile 
vesting is determined on a pro-rata basis.
Production growth per share condition
Performance against this condition is measured from a base 
net export production per share of 21,074 Boepd as at 
31 December 2010. The targets for the 2011 awards are 
as follows:

For performance that is between 105% and 110% of base, 
vesting is determined on a pro-rata basis.
Reserves growth per share condition
Performance against this condition is measured from a base 
of net 2P reserves of 88.51 MMboe as at 31 December 2010. 
The targets for the 2011 awards are as follows:

125% of base 65%
150% of base 100%
For performance that is between 110% and 150% of base, 
vesting is determined on a pro-rata basis.
It is intended that the targets attached to the awards to be 
granted in 2012 will be similar to those used in 2011.
The remuneration committee granted an aggregate of 
1,722,022 share awards to executive directors and senior 
management on 19 April 2011 and 18 August 2011.
2010 RSP
The 2010 RSP was established for use at the time when the 
Company became listed on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange in April 2010 in order to facilitate the 
deferral of IPO bonuses and to grant retention focused 
awards. Other than being subject to continued employment, 
the RSP awards have no performance targets, and vest in 
tranches over two, three and four years from the date of 
grant. The 2010 RSP is available as a retention tool for 
selected employees below executive director level, whereby 
awards may be made to selected individuals who join the 
Company part way through the year, having left accrued 
benefits with a previous employer. In this regard, the 
remuneration committee granted an aggregate of 829,845 
share awards to selected employees on 19 April 2011 and 
18 August 2011.
2010 DBSP
Under the 2010 DBSP, employees, below executive director 
level, who achieve a pre-determined rating under the annual 
appraisal system, are invited to defer a proportion of their 
annual performance pay into Company shares. Under the 
plan, the shares which are acquired with a participant’s 
performance pay are called ‘Invested Shares’. Following  
such an investment, the Company will generally grant the 
participant an additional award over a number of shares 
being a specified ratio to the number of Invested Shares and 
these awards are called ‘Matching Shares’. The remuneration 
committee granted an aggregate of 175,742 Matching Shares 
on 19 April 2011, which were awarded to participants on the 
basis of a 1:1 ratio to the Invested Shares. No further awards 
were granted under the 2011 DBSP during the year.
Non-executive directors 
The remuneration of each of the non-executive directors 
(other than the chairman) is determined by the chairman  
and the executive members of the Board within limits set  
out in the Articles and having taken independent advice  
on appropriate levels. The remuneration of the chairman is 
determined by the committee (in his absence), again based 
on independent advice. The Company’s policy is to set levels 
of fees so as to ensure that they are sufficient to attract 
experienced individuals and reflect the increased 
responsibilities of the non-executive directors. 
The non-executive directors’ annual fees for 2011 were 
£200,000 for Dr James Buckee and £45,000 for each of  
the other non-executive directors. In addition to this, an 
annual fee of £8,000 is payable to Jock Lennox and Helmut 
Langanger for their roles as chairman of the audit and 
remuneration committee respectively. Actual fees paid  
for the year ended 31 December 2011 are shown in the 
remuneration table on page 50. 
The non-executive directors cannot participate in the 
Company’s share incentive arrangements and are not 
entitled to a bonus or pension contribution. 
Service contracts/letters of appointment 
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have 
contracts of service which can be terminated by either the 
director concerned or the Company on giving 12 months’ 
notice of termination. In the event of termination by the 
Company (other than as a result of a change of control), the 
executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary and 
cash benefit allowance for the notice period. Depending on 
the circumstances of termination, the executive directors 
may be entitled, or the remuneration committee may 
exercise its discretion to allow the executive directors, to 
receive a pro-rated proportion of their outstanding awards 
under the long-term share incentive plans. 
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the 
termination of an executive director’s employment, the 
executive director is entitled to compensation of a sum  
equal to his/her annual basic salary as at the date of 
termination of employment. 
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts 
but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their 
terms of appointment may be terminated by each party 
giving three months notice in writing. The letters of 
appointment set out the time commitment expected by  
the Company and the Board is satisfied that each of the  
non-executive directors commits sufficient time to fulfil  
their duties as a director of the Company. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and the non-
executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection on request and will be available for inspection 
before and during the AGM to be held on 30 May 2012.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN  
RELATION TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law and those International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union.
Under Company Law the directors must not approve the 
Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing the 
Group financial statements the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 
8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the Group’s financial 
position and financial performance;
• state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the Group financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. EnQuest PLC

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE ANNUAL REPORT  
AND ACCOUNTS TO THE MEMBERS OF ENQUEST PLC 
(REGIStEREd NUm BER: 07140891)
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
EnQuest PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the Group statement of comprehensive income, 
Group balance sheet, the Group statement of changes in 
equity, the Group statement of cash flows and the related 
notes 1 to 29. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities in respect of the Group financial statements 
set out on page 52, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies

1. Corporate information 
EnQuest PLC (EnQuest or the Company) is a limited 
liability Company registered in England and is listed on  
the London Stock Exchange and Stockholm NASDAQ  
OMX market. 
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for,  
and extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the  
UK Continental Shelf.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2011 were authorised for issue in accordance 
with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 26 March 2012.
A listing of the principal Group companies is contained  
in note 29 to these Group financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The Group financial information has been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to 
the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2011 and applied in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow 
set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The Group financial information has been prepared on a 
historical cost basis. The presentation currency of the Group 
financial information is United States dollars and all values in 
the Group financial information are rounded to the nearest 
thousand (US$’000) except where otherwise stated. 
Going concern concept
The directors’ assessment of going concern concludes  
that the use of the going concern basis is appropriate 
because there are no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the ability of the Group to continue 
as a going concern. 
Group formation
The Company was incorporated on 29 January 2010  
as a holding Company to effect a business combination 
between Lundin North Sea BV (LNS) and Petrofac Energy 
Developments Limited (PEDL). On 5 April 2010 the 
Company acquired 100% of the voting shares of PEDL  
and on 6 April 2010 acquired 100% of the voting shares  
of LNS. Both acquisitions were satisfied by the allotment 
and issuance of Ordinary shares in the Company.
The combination of LNS with EnQuest in 2010 has been 
accounted for as a capital restructuring under the pooling 
of interests method. 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised) requires the 
identification of the acquirer. Legally EnQuest acquired 
both PEDL and LNS, however in considering this 
transaction management looked to the application 
guidance provided by IFRS 3 (Revised) which applies 
where a new entity is formed to effect a combination 
between two or more existing entities. The guidance 
indicates where such a new entity issues equity 
instruments in itself in exchange for equity instruments  
in the acquired subsidiaries, then one of the acquired 
subsidiaries should be identified as the acquirer. As 
EnQuest did not meet the definition of a business 
combination then the combination of EnQuest with  
LNS was accounted for as a capital restructuring.
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR th E y EAR ENd Ed 31 dECE m BER 2011
The combination of PEDL with LNS has been accounted  
for using the acquisition method, with LNS identified as  
the acquirer after considering the following principles:
i. the relative voting rights in the combined entity after  
the business combination;
ii. the existence of a large minority voting interest in the 
combined entity;
iii. the composition of the governing body of the combined 
entity;
iv. the composition of the senior management of the 
combined entity;
v. the terms of the exchange of equity interests.
The approach adopted has a number of consequences 
including that:
• the Group’s financial statements are prepared on the 
basis that EnQuest and LNS had always been combined, 
with the results of LNS being included for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and EnQuest results being included 
from its incorporation date of 29 January 2010; 
• the Group’s equity reflects the capital restructuring of 
EnQuest and LNS at the beginning of 2009 and LNS’s 
retained earnings carry forward within Group equity 
together with EnQuest’s retained earnings;
• the carrying value of LNS net assets are unadjusted for 
the combination with EnQuest under the pooling of 
interests method; no goodwill arises as a result of the 
combination of LNS with EnQuest;
• the additional share premium resulting from capitalisation 
of LNS’s long term loans payable is eliminated by transfer 
to the Group merger reserve;
• the consideration for the acquisition of PEDL is derived 
from the market value of EnQuest Ordinary shares issued 
to effect the acquisition;
• the identifiable net assets of PEDL are measured at fair 
value at the date of the acquisition; and
• the Group merger reserve represents the difference 
between the market value of shares issued to effect the 
business combinations less the nominal value of shares 
issued; and consolidation adjustments which arise under 
the application of the pooling of interests method. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole 
right to exercise control over the operations and govern the 
financial policies generally accompanying a shareholding of 
more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect 
of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered when assessing the Group’s 
control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date  
on which control is transferred to the Group and are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany profits, transactions and balances are 
eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of 
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Unincorporated jointly controlled assets
Oil and gas operations are conducted by the Group as 
co-licensees in unincorporated joint ventures with other 
companies. The Group’s financial statements reflect the 
relevant proportions of production, capital costs, operating 
costs and current assets and liabilities of the joint venture 
applicable to the Group’s interests. The Group’s current joint 
venture interests are detailed on page 4. EnQuest PLC

 OVERVIEW

 FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured 
at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any 
controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Those petroleum reserves and resources that are able to be 
reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair 
values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources 
and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably 
determined, are not recognised.
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted new and revised IFRS that are 
relevant to its operations and effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The principal 
effects of the adoption of these new and amended 
standards and interpretations are discussed below:
IAS 24 Related Party Transactions (Amendment)
The IASB issued an amendment to IAS 24 that clarifies 
the definitions of a related party. The new definitions 
emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships 
and clarify the circumstances in which persons and key 
management personnel affect related party relationships 
of an entity. The adoption of the amendment did not have 
any impact on the financial position or performance of 
the Group.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments
The IASB issued an amendment that alters the definition of a 
financial liability in IAS 32 to enable entities to classify rights 
issues and certain options or warrants as equity instruments. 
The amendment has had no effect on the financial position 
or performance of the Group because the Group does not 
have these types of instruments.
Amendments to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from 
Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-Time Adopters
The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 1 which provides  
a limited exemption for first-time adopters from providing 
comparative fair value hierarchy disclosures under IFRS 7. 
The adoption of the amendment did not have any impact 
on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Improvements to IFRSs (Issued in May 2010)
The IASB issued improvements to IFRS, an omnibus of 
amendments to its IFRS standards. The adoption of the 
following amendments resulted in changes to accounting 
policies, but no impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – The amendment 
clarifies that an entity may present an analysis of each 
component of other comprehensive income either in the 
statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the 
financial statements.
IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements – Emphasises that 
disclosure about significant events and transactions in 
interim periods should update relevant information 
presented in the most recent financial report and how to 
apply this principle in respect of financial instruments and 
their fair values.
Other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs 
to the following standards did not have an impact on the 
accounting policies, financial position or performance of 
the Group:
• IFRS 7 Financial Instruments – Disclosures
Interpretations
The following Interpretations did not have any impact on 
the accounting policies, financial position or performance  
of the Group:
• IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet 
effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are listed below. This listing is of Standards and 
Interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects 
to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt 
these Standards when they become effective. The directors 
do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards will 
have a material impact on the Group’s accounts in the period 
of initial application.
IAS 1 Presentation of items of other comprehensive income 
– Amendments to IAS 1
The amendments change the grouping of items presented in 
the statement of comprehensive income. Items that would 
be reclassified to profit or loss at a future point in time would 
be presented separately from items that will never be 
reclassified. The revisions become effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. 
IFRS 7 (Amended) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets
The revision requires enhancements to the existing 
disclosures in IFRS 7 where an asset is transferred but not 
derecognised and introduces new disclosures for assets that 
are derecognised but the entity continues to have continuing 
exposure to the asset after sale. The revisions become 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification 
and Measurement
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work 
on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification 
and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. 
The Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will 
address classification and measurement of financial liabilities, 
hedge accounting and derecognition. The adoption of IFRS 
9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement 
of the Group’s financial assets. However, the Group 
determined that the effect shall be quantified in conjunction 
with the other phases when issued to present a 
comprehensive picture.  EnQuest PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements/IAS 27 (Revised) 
– Separate Financial Statements
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies  
to all entities and introduces changes which will require 
management to exercise significant judgement to determine 
which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to 
be consolidated by a parent. The consolidation requirements 
forming part of IAS 27 will be revised and contained within 
IFRS 10. These Standards are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 11 establishes a clear principle that is applicable to the 
accounting for all joint arrangements. The Standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2013. The most significant change is that IFRS 11 requires the 
use of the equity method of accounting for interests in jointly 
controlled entities thereby eliminating the proportionate 
consolidation method.
IAS 28 (Revised) – Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures
The Standard will be revised due to the introduction of 
IFRS 10 and 11. The revision will become effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
Includes disclosure requirements for interests in subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated 
structured entities. The Standard is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
The Standard defines fair value, provides guidance on its 
determination and introduces consistent requirements for 
disclosures on fair value measurements. The Standard does 
not include requirements on when fair value measurement  
is required but prescribes how fair value is to be measured  
if another Standard requires it. The Standard is effective  
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and 
judgements when preparing the financial statements of the 
Group. Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could 
have an impact on the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities and the Group’s result. The most important 
estimates and judgements in relation thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is the exploration for, development 
of and production of oil and gas reserves. Estimates of oil and 
gas reserves are used in the calculations for impairment tests 
and accounting for depletion and decommissioning. Changes 
in estimates of oil and gas reserves resulting in different 
future production profiles will affect the discounted cash 
flows used in impairment testing, the anticipated date of 
decommissioning and the depletion charges in accordance 
with the unit-of-production method.
Estimates in impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
For details of policy see Impairment of assets (excluding 
goodwill) and refer to the further economic assumptions 
above within Estimates in oil and gas reserves.
Group formation
For details see Group formation under the basis of 
preparation section of the accounting policies.
Determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment 
on business combinations
The Group determines the fair value of property, plant and 
equipment acquired based on the discounted cash flows  
at the time of acquisition, from the proven and probable 
reserves. In assessing the discounted cash flows the 
estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects the market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset at the time of the 
acquisition. In calculating the asset fair value the Group will 
apply the long term oil price assumption, escalated for 
inflation and discounted at the pre-tax rate. The oil price 
assumption will represent management’s view of the long 
term oil price at the time of the transaction.
Decommissioning provision 
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning 
are estimates based on current legal and constructive 
requirements and current technology and price levels for the 
removal of facilities and plugging and abandoning of wells. 
Due to changes in relation to these items, the future actual 
cash outflows in relation to decommissioning are likely to 
differ in practice. To reflect the effects due to changes in 
legislation, requirements, technology and price levels, the 
carrying amounts of decommissioning provisions are 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior 
year adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While the 
Group uses its best estimates and judgement, actual results 
could differ from these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group applies 
an annual inflation rate of 2% (2010: 2%) and an annual 
discount rate of 5% (2010: 5%).
Estimates in impairment of goodwill
Determination of whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units (CGU) to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The present value calculation requires the entity  
to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
CGU and a suitable discount rate. In calculating the present 
value in use of the CGU, the Group has used forward curve 
prices for the first four years before reverting to the Group’s 
long term pricing assumption and discounted at a pre-tax 
rate of 21.3% (2010: US$85 per barrel, escalated at 2% and 
discounted at a pre-tax rate of 19%).

Taxation
The UK’s corporation tax legislation is relatively complex. 
The Group’s operations are subject to a number of specific 
rules which apply to UK North Sea exploration and 
production. In addition, the tax provision is prepared before 
the relevant companies have filed their UK corporation  
tax and supplementary charge returns with HMRC and 
significantly, before these have been agreed. As a result of 
these factors the tax provision process necessarily involves 
the use of a number of estimates and judgements including 
those required in calculating the effective tax rate arising  
on exceptional items. In considering the tax on exceptionals, 
the Company considered varying rates depending on the 
category of expense but believes that using the effective 
rate, after adjusting for significant one-off charges, gives an 
overall approximation to the tax rate on exceptional items.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax 
losses where it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available for utilisation. This requires management to make 
judgements and assumptions regarding the amount of 
deferred tax that can be recognised, as well as the likelihood 
of future taxable profits. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(functional currency). The Group financial statements are 
presented in United States dollars, the currency which the 
Group has elected to use as its presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual subsidiaries, 
transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange  
on the date of the transaction. At the year end, monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the 
initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was 
determined. All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken 
to the statement of comprehensive income. 
Classification and recognition of assets and liabilities
Non-current assets and non-current liabilities including 
provisions consist, for the most part, solely of amounts that 
are expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve 
months after the balance sheet date. Current assets and 
current liabilities consist solely of amounts that are expected 
to be recovered or paid within twelve months after the 
balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost 
comprises the purchase price or construction cost and any 
costs directly attributable to making that asset capable of 
operating as intended. The purchase price or construction 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any 
other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a field-by-field basis, 
using the unit-of-production method based on entitlement to 
proven and probable reserves, taking account of estimated 
future development expenditure relating to those reserves. 
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and 
equipment is provided on a straight-line basis at the 
following rates:
Office furniture and equipment 25%–100%
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method 
of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at 
each financial year end.
No depreciation is charged on land or assets under 
construction. 
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.  
The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is included in the statement 
of comprehensive income when the item is derecognised. 
Gains are not classified as revenue.
Capitalised costs
Oil and gas assets are accounted for using the successful 
efforts method of accounting.
Intangible oil and gas assets
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation or appraisal 
activities is capitalised as an intangible asset. Such costs 
include the costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well 
drilling costs, payments to contractors and an appropriate 
share of directly attributable overheads incurred during the 
evaluation phase. For such appraisal activity, which may 
require drilling of further wells, costs continue to be carried 
as an asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered 
capable of commercial development. Such costs are subject 
to technical, commercial and management review to confirm 
the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value. 
When this is no longer the case, the costs are impaired and 
any impairment loss is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. When exploration licences are 
relinquished without further development, any previous 
impairment loss is reversed and the carrying costs are written 
off through the statement of comprehensive income. When 
assets are declared part of a commercial development, 
related costs are transferred to property, plant and 
equipment oil and gas assets. All intangible oil and gas assets 
are assessed for any impairment prior to transfer and any 
impairment loss is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Oil and gas assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure 
facilities such as platforms, pipelines and development wells, 
is capitalised within property, plant and equipment. EnQuest PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production 
calculations are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate 
adjustment of prior years’ amounts.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of 
qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use, 
are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use. All other 
borrowing costs are recognised as interest payable in the 
statement of comprehensive income in accordance with the 
effective interest method.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is 
an indication that those assets may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows attributable to the asset are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. In calculating the asset fair 
values the Group has applied an oil price assumption of 
US$119.25 per barrel in 2012, US$112.08 per barrel in 2013, 
US$104.73 per barrel in 2014, US$98.67 per barrel in 2015, 
US$97.42 per barrel in 2016 and inflated at 2% per annum 
thereafter (2010: US$85 per barrel, escalated at 2% per 
annum) and a discounted pre-tax rate of 21.3% (2010: 19%).
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but only so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal  
of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
entity at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that such carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is 
allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or 
units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored  
for internal management purposes.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill 
relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
cash-generating unit and related goodwill, an impairment 
loss is recognised.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating  
unit and part of the operation within the unit is disposed of, 
the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is 
included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based 
on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating units retained.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured 
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable  
and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition. Management must be committed to the sale 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as  
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available for sale 
financial investments, or as derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets 
at initial recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus 
transactions costs, except in the case of financial assets 
recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery  
of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the market place (regular way trades) are 
recognised on the trade date.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short term 
deposits, trade and other receivables, loans and other 
receivables, quoted and unquoted financial instruments  
and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on 
their classification as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial 
asset is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are 
acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the 
near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments 
as defined by IAS 39. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any 
gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in 
profit or loss.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL 
are designated at their initial recognition date and only if the 
criteria under IAS 39 are satisfied.
The Group evaluates its financial assets held for trading, 
other than derivatives, to determine whether the intention  
to sell them in the near term is still appropriate. Where  
the Group is unable to trade these financial assets or 
management’s intention to sell them in the foreseeable 
future changes significantly, the Group may elect to 
reclassify these assets. The reclassification to loans and 
receivables, available for sale or held-to-maturity depends 
on the nature of the asset. This evaluation does not affect 
any financial assets designated at FVTPL using the fair  
value option at designation, these instruments cannot  
be reclassified after initial recognition.
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-
maturity when the Group has the positive intention and 
ability to hold them to maturity. After initial measurement, 
held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method (EIR), less 
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees  
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation and losses arising from impairment are  
included in the profit or loss. 
Available for sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded 
in an active market are classified as being available for sale 
and are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the available for sale reserve 
with the exception of impairment losses which are 
recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in the available for sale 
reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables 
that have fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market and are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short term receivables 
when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there  
is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.  
A financial asset is deemed to be impaired where there is 
objective evidence of impairment that, as a result of one or 
more events that have occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset, the estimated future cash flows of the 
investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as 
available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair 
value of the security below its cost is considered to be 
objective evidence of impairment. When an available for sale 
financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains 
and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period. In 
respect of equity securities, impairment losses previously 
recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or 
loss. Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment 
loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount  
of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount is reduced 
through use of an allowance account and the amount of  
the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative 
is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair 
value hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or loss, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit or 
loss. Amounts accumulated in shareholders’ equity are 
transferred to the profit or loss in the period when the 
hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When the hedged 
item no longer meets the requirements for hedge accounting, 
expires or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss recognised  
in shareholders’ equity is transferred to profit and loss when 
the forecast transaction which was the subject of the  
hedge occurs.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are 
accounted for in a similar manner as cash flow hedges.  
The gain or loss accumulated in shareholders´ equity is 
transferred to the profit or loss at the time the foreign 
operation is disposed of. EnQuest PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit 
or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision 
for impairment. 
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value, cost being determined 
on a first in first out (FIFO) basis. Inventories of hydrocarbons 
are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under/over-lift
Under or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued  
at market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An 
under-lift of production from a field is included in current 
receivables and valued at the reporting date spot price or 
prevailing contract price and an over-lift of production from 
a field is included in current liabilities and valued at the 
reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in 
hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest 
bearing securities with original maturities of three months 
or less. 
Equity
Share capital
The balance classified as equity share capital includes the 
total net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) 
on issue of registered share capital of the Parent Company. 
Share issue costs associated with the issuance of new equity 
are treated as a direct reduction of proceeds. 
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the market 
value of shares issued to effect business combinations less 
the nominal value of shares issued and the consolidation 
adjustments that arise under the application of the pooling 
of interest method.
Cash flow hedge reserve
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as 
other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve. 
Upon settlement of the hedged item, the change in fair value 
is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are 
measured at the fair value of the services received, and the 
corresponding increase in equity is recorded directly at 
the fair value of the services received. The share-based 
payments reserve includes treasury shares.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results 
attributable to the shareholders of the Parent Company. 
Employee benefit trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from 
the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is 
also recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken  
to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue  
or cancellation of equity shares.
Provisions
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full 
when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove  
a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which 
it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability 
can be made. The amount recognised is the present value  
of the estimated future expenditure. An amount equivalent 
to the discounted initial provision for decommissioning costs  
is capitalised and amortised over the life of the underlying 
asset on a unit-of-production basis over proven and 
probable reserves. Any change in the present value of the 
estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the 
provision and the oil and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future 
decommissioning provisions is included under finance costs 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events,  
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required  
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial 
asset) is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired;
• the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the 
asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of 
the asset.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from  
the same lender, on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of 
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability such 
that the difference in the respective carrying amounts 
together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised  
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially 
at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised 
on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating  
the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or a shorter period to the net carrying 
amount of the financial liability where appropriate. 
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured. 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales 
from the processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an 
entitlement basis, when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership have been passed to the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the 
services are provided at the agreed contract rates. 
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial 
Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items 
that the Group separately presents as exceptional on the face 
of the statement of comprehensive income are those material 
items of income and expense which because of the nature 
and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, 
merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to 
understand better the elements of financial performance in 
the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and 
to assess better trends in financial performance.
Depletion of fair value uplift to property, plant and 
equipment on acquiring strategic investments
IFRS requires that a fair value exercise is undertaken 
allocating the cost of acquiring controlling interests to the 
fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. Any difference between the cost of 
acquiring the interest and the fair value of the acquired net 
assets, which includes identified contingent liabilities, is 
recognised as acquired goodwill. The fair value exercise is 
performed as at the date of acquisition.
The directors have determined that for strategic investments 
it is important to separately identify the earnings impact of 
increased depletion arising from the acquisition date fair 
value uplifts made to property, plant and equipment over 
their useful economic lives. As a result of the nature of fair 
value assessments in the oil and gas industry the value 
attributed to strategic assets is subjective, based on a  
wide range of complex variables at a point in time. The 
subsequent depletion of the fair value uplifts bears little 
relationship to current market conditions, operational 
performance or cash generation. Management therefore 
reports and monitors the business performance of strategic 
investments before the impact of depletion of fair value 
uplifts to property, plant and equipment and the uplift is 
excluded from the business result presented in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income.
Leases
For a lease to qualify as a finance lease, substantially all of 
the risks and benefits of ownership must pass to the lessee. 
In all other cases the lease will be classified as an operating 
lease. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lesser) are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease.
Employee benefits
Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefits such as salaries, social 
premiums and holiday pay, are expensed when incurred. 
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of defined 
contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension 
plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions.  
The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The amount charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income in respect of pension 
costs reflects the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable during the year 
and contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued 
liabilities or prepaid assets in the balance sheet. EnQuest PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled 
transactions) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which 
they are granted. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no 
account is taken of any service or performance conditions, 
other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 
EnQuest PLC (market conditions) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, 
if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over 
the period in which the relevant employees become fully 
entitled to the award (the vesting period). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income 
charge or credit for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and  
end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon  
a market or non-vesting conditions, which are treated  
as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards 
cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date  
of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the 
award at that date is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. 
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction  
other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit  
or loss. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able  
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it  
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legal right exists to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the 
deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority 
and that authority permits the Group to make a single 
net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s financial 
statements also include and disclose production taxes on  
net income determined from oil and gas production. 
The Group distinguishes between income tax and 
production tax. Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue 
Tax (PRT) and is accounted for under IAS 12 since it has the 
characteristics of an income tax as it is imposed under 
Government authority and the amount payable is based on 
taxable profits of the relevant fields. Current and deferred 
PRT is provided on the same basis as described above for 
income taxes. 
3. Segment information 
Management have considered the requirements of IFRS 8, 
in regard to the determination of operating segments, and 
concluded that the Group has only one operating segment 
being the exploration for, and the extraction and production 
of hydrocarbons in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf.
All revenue is generated from sales to customers in the 
United Kingdom. Details of the Group’s revenue components 
are provided in note 5(a). All crude oil revenue is received 
from two customers; Shell International Trading and 
Shipping Company Limited is the major customer and 
revenue receivable amounted to US$954,051,000 or 98%  
of total revenue (excluding oil hedge gains and losses) in the 
year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: US$570,518,000 or 
98% of total revenue).

Gain on disposal of asset held for sale
During the year the Group disposed of its held for sale interest in the Petisovci project in Slovenia in return for 150,903,958 
new ordinary shares in Ascent Resources plc (Ascent) at a market value of US$18,422,000 creating a gain of US$8,644,000.
Impairment of available for sale assets
Following disposal of the held for sale Petisovci asset, the Group held an investment in Ascent. The accounting valuation of 
this shareholding at 31 December 2011 resulted in a non-cash impairment of US$12,497,000.
Initial Public Offering and acquisition costs
In 2010, expenses relating to the acquisition of LNS and PEDL and the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange and 
Stockholm NASDAQ OMX market of US$8,143,000 were included in general and administration expenses in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Costs relating to the acquisition of Stratic
In 2010, costs of US$5,289,000 relating to the acquisition of Stratic Energy Corporation (Stratic) were included in general 
and administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of oil and gas assets
There were no exceptional oil and gas assets impairment expenses during the year ended 31 December 2011. In the year 
ended 31 December 2010, impairment expenses were recognised on the Scolty (US$25,034,000) and Peik area 
(US$34,957,000) assets, of which US$2,121,000 related to property, plant and equipment oil and gas assets (note 10)  
and US$32,836,000 related to intangible oil and gas assets (note 13).
Well abandonment expenses
During the year a credit of US$8,194,000 (2010: debit of US$8,194,000) was recognised following a further review of 
options to recover funds from the previous Thistle field owners, relating to partial decommissioning of two wells covered  
by the Intervening Period and Decommissioning Liability Agreements.
Depletion of fair value uplift
Additional depletion arising from the fair value uplift of PEDL’s oil and gas assets on acquisition of US$16,973,000  
(2010: US$16,319,000) is included within cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.
Tax
In 2011, the enactment of the increase in the UK supplementary corporation tax rate on oil and gas activities in the North Sea 
increased the deferred tax charge in the income statement by US$78,149,000, of which US$68,086,000 relates to the 
revaluation of the opening deferred tax corporation tax balance. After adjusting for significant one-off charges, the Group 
has applied the Group’s effective tax rate of 64.4% (2010: 51%) on exceptional items where appropriate. EnQuest PLC

7. Income tax (continued) 
(d) Tax losses (continued)
During the prior year, deferred tax assets of US$9,669,000 were recognised on the acquisition of Stratic (note 11) in relation 
to unutilised tax losses. The tax losses relate to UK trading losses arising in Stratic Energy UK Limited prior to 2010, 
recoverability of which is dependent on future taxable trading profits in excess of those arising from the reversal of deferred 
tax liabilities in that company. It is anticipated that Stratic Energy UK Limited will generate taxable trading profits in the 
future in excess of the losses carried forward, and this company had taxable trading profits in 2011.
The Group has unused overseas tax losses in Canada of approximately CAD$76,577,000 (2010: CAD$77,361,000) and in 
Holland of ¤920,000 (2010: ¤920,000) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date.  
The tax losses in Canada have expiry periods of between 7 and 20 years, none of which expire in 2012, and are subject to 
utilisation in restricted circumstances following the change in control of Stratic. Tax losses in Holland can be carried forward 
for a period up to nine years and are likely to expire in 2012. The overseas tax losses result from the Stratic acquisition on 
5 November 2010 and there was a high degree of uncertainty in relation to the tax loss position of the acquired overseas 
entities following acquisition as the tax compliance in the overseas entities had not been completed for a number of years. 
The Group undertook a significant exercise to update the tax compliance history of the overseas entities acquired, which 
completed in December 2011, giving a basis for estimating the unused tax loss position as at 31 December 2010 and 2011.
(e) Change in legislation
The UK government has released draft legislation to restrict the tax relief available on decommissioning expenditure to 50% 
in 2012. This change is not yet substantively enacted but is likely to give rise to a one-off exceptional additional tax charge in 
2012 in the order of US$21,600,000.
8. Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary shares 
in issue during the period.

development assets under construction which are not being depreciated. 
During the year ended 31 December 2011 there were no tangible asset write offs. During the prior year, capitalised pre-
development costs of US$2,121,000 and intangible asset licence costs of US$32,836,000 (note 13) associated with the Peik 
area were written off based on the Group’s latest economic evaluation of the asset which did not support the delivery of an 
economic development.
11. Business combinations 
Acquisition of Stratic
The acquisition of Stratic was completed on 5 November 2010 whereby the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital 
for a consideration of US$54,163,000, satisfied by the issue and allotment of 24,434,983 EnQuest Ordinary shares. The fair 
value allocation of the former Stratic assets and liabilities was accounted for using the acquisition method in 2010. The fair 
value was provisional at 31 December 2010 and has been reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (Revised).
The fair value of the purchase consideration was derived from the opening share price of EnQuest shares on 5 November 
2010, as quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The initial fair values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition have been updated to reflect the finalisation of tax 
estimates and working capital adjustments and revisions to the valuation of intangible assets. The 48.75% interest in the 
Petisovci project was initially fair valued at the 30 day average market value of the 150,903,958 new ordinary shares in 
Ascent, which were received in return for the disposal of the asset on 11 February 2011. Following further review of the 
trading levels and price volatility of the Ascent shares, this valuation has been amended resulting in a reduction to the 
acquisition fair value of US$8,886,000. Also, following our unsuccessful sale process during the year, the fair value of 
the Dutch Sector P8 (Horizon West) area was reduced to nil.
The changes to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Stratic are as follows:

recognised goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes.

No business combination expenses relating to the above transactions have been expensed in the year (2010: US$5,289,000). 
During 2010, from the date of acquisition, Stratic contributed US$6,511,000 to revenue and US$70,000 to the net profit 
before tax of the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of 2010, net profit of the Group for 2010 would 
have been US$28,767,000 and revenue would have been US$608,210,000.
Acquisition of Petrofac Energy Developments Limited
The acquisition of Petrofac Energy Developments Limited (PEDL) was completed in 2010 whereby the Group acquired 100% 
of the ordinary shares satisfied by the issue and allotment of 345,629,916 EnQuest Ordinary shares. The fair value allocation 
was accounted for using the acquisition method in 2010. The fair value allocation of the former PEDL assets and liabilities 
was provisional at 31 December 2010 and has been reviewed in accordance with the provision of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (Revised).
The fair value of the purchase consideration transferred to acquire PEDL was derived from the opening day share price of 
EnQuest shares on 6 April 2010, as quoted on the London Stock Exchange.

activities of PEDL with those of the Group including the benefits of operational scale, access to a wider technical skill base 
and greater financial strength. None of the recognised goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes.
No business combination expenses relating to the above transactions have been expensed in the year (2010: US$1,733,000).
During 2010 from the date of acquisition, PEDL contributed US$281,612,000 to revenue and US$75,759,000 to the net profit 
before tax of the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of 2010, the net profit before tax of the Group 
for 2010 would have been US$54,311,000 and revenue would have been US$614,357,000. EnQuest PLC

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit (CGU), the UKCS, 
being the Group’s only operating segment and therefore the lowest level that goodwill is reviewed by the Board. 
Impairment testing of goodwill 
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill was reviewed for impairment at the year end. In assessing whether 
goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill, is compared with its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined on a value in use basis using a discounted cash flow model 
comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections. The discount rate used is derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital and is reassessed each year. Risks specific to assets within the CGU are reflected within the cash  
flow forecasts. 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of value in use of the CGU are:
• oil prices
• production volumes
• discount rates
Oil prices are based on forward price curves for the first four years before reverting to the Group’s long term pricing 
assumptions. For the purposes of calculating value in use, management has applied an oil price assumption of US$119.25 per 
barrel in 2012, US$112.08 per barrel in 2013, US$104.73 per barrel in 2014, US$98.67 per barrel in 2015, US$97.42 per barrel in 
2016 and inflated at 2% per annum thereafter. In 2010, oil prices were based on management’s assessment of oil price using 
publicly available forecast commodity prices; US$85 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum.
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU. The production  
volumes used in the value in use calculations were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve 
assessment experts.
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC 
takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the 
Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing borrowings. Segment risk is incorporated by applying a 
beta factor based on publicly available market data. The discount rate applied to the Group’s pre-tax cash flow projections  
is 21.3% (2010: 19%).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
There are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could erode the estimated amount of US$984,000,000  
by which the calculated value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU. These are discussed below:
• oil price: management has considered the possibility of lower oil prices in the future. Revenue for the Group’s future oil 
production is directly linked to the market price of Brent blend oil. A fall in the price for Brent blend would directly impact 
the Group’s revenue and potentially the economic life of assets in the CGU. It is estimated that the long term price of oil 
that would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the CGU would be US$80.71 per barrel, 
escalated at 2% per annum (2010: US$65 per barrel, escalated at 2% per annum). 
• production volumes: estimated production volumes were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent 
reserve assessment experts. On a weighted average basis, production would need to fall by 13% (2010: 24%) to cause  
the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying amount of the CGU (using a simplified oil price assumption of US$90 
per barrel).

During the year ended 31 December 2011, US$34,127,000 of costs relating to relinquished licences were written off. These 
had previously been impaired in full. Also, during the year costs of US$36,962,000 were impaired relating to dryhole wells  
or uneconomic assessment on evaluation of the assets.
During the prior year, capitalised intangible asset licence costs of US$32,836,000 and pre-development costs of 
US$2,121,000 (note 10) associated with the Peik area were impaired based on the Group’s initial evaluation of the asset which 
did not support the delivery of an economic development.
Also, during the year ended 31 December 2010, following a decision taken to discontinue field specific exploration activities 
on certain licences, US$48,021,000 of capitalised evaluation costs were impaired and written off including US$25,034,000 
in relation to the Scolty area.
During 2011, the Group acquired a 40% farm in interest in the Crathes area. Following a successful Crathes exploration well  
in Q4 2011, the Group is evaluating the potential commerciality of the combined Crathes, Scolty and Torphins area; however

trade receivables was necessary (2010: nil). 
Joint venture receivables relate to billings to joint venture partners and were not impaired. There were US$705,000 of joint 
venture receivables past due and not impaired at 31 December 2011 (2010: US$547,000 past due but not impaired). 
As at 31 December 2011 other receivables of nil (2010: US$8,194,000) were determined to be impaired. During the year, the 
prior year impairment was reversed following a further review of options to recover these expenses (note 4).
The carrying value of the Group’s trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable 
approximation to their fair value.

20. Share-based payment plans
On 18 March 2010, the directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of directors and employees, 
being a Deferred Bonus Share Plan, a Restricted Share Plan and a Performance Share Plan.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP)
Directors and selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or in 
some cases, be required, to receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest (Invested Awards). Following 
such award, EnQuest will generally grant the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified 
ratio to the number of his or her invested shares (Matching Shares). The awards granted in 2011 will vest 33% on the first 
anniversary of the date of grant, a further 33% after year two and the final 34% on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
The awards granted in 2010 will vest 25% on the second anniversary of the date of grant, a further 25% after year three and 
the final 50% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the 
period to which the bonuses relate. The costs relating to the matching shares are recognised over the four year vesting 
period and the fair values of the equity-settled matching shares granted to employees are based on quoted market prices 
adjusted for the trued up percentage vesting rate of the plan.
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rates of the DBSP scheme are shown below:

20. Share-based payment plans (continued)
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period, 
which may or may not be, at the direction of the remuneration committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, subject to 
the satisfaction of performance conditions. Awards made in 2010 and 2011 under the RSP will vest over periods between one 
and four years. At present there are no performance conditions applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention 
to introduce them in the future. The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year 
are based on quoted market prices adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period. 
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rate of the RSP scheme are shown below:

The charge recognised in the year ended 31 December 2011 amounted to US$3,767,000 (2010: US$2,997,000). 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Under the Performance Share Plan, the shares vest subject to performance conditions. The 2010 PSP share awards granted 
in 2011 had three sets of performance conditions associated with them. One third of the award relates to Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) against a comparator group of 36 oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 and Stockholm 
NASDAQ OMX; one third relates to production growth per share, and one third relates to reserves growth per share, over the 
three year performance period.
The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market 
prices adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.

Long Term Incentive Plan scheme (LTIP)
Prior to the formation of EnQuest PLC, LNS participated in the Lundin Petroleum Group LTIP scheme which consisted of an 
annual grant of units that converted into cash payment at vesting. The cash payment was determined at the end of each 
vesting period by multiplying the number of units by the share price. The LTIP had a three year duration whereby the initial 
grant of units vested equally in three tranches; one third after one year, one third after two years and the final third after 
three years. The demerger of LNS from the Lundin Petroleum Group resulted in all LTIP awards vesting due to the change  
in control in 2010, resulting in total costs of US$717,000 for the year ended 31 December 2010. There were no costs incurred 
in the year ended 31 December 2011.
Share Option Programme
LNS participated in the Lundin Petroleum Group Share Option programme prior to the formation of EnQuest PLC, whereby 
warrants were issued to employees enabling them to buy shares in Lundin Petroleum AB. All incentive warrants issued under 
this scheme expired by 30 June 2010.

(i) Revolving credit facility
At 31 December 2011 the Group had a two year US$280,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with Bank of Scotland 
and BNP Paribas which is secured on the assets of the Group and due to mature on 17 March 2012. Under the terms of the 
facility agreement, the Group has the ability to draw loans to a maximum value of US$156,250,000 and utilise Letters of 
Credit (LoC) to a maximum aggregate value of US$123,750,000. 
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at US LIBOR (relative to each agreed loan period) plus a margin of 2.25% to 
3.25%, dependent on specified covenant ratios. A facility non-utilisation commitment fee is payable at 50% of the 
interest margin.
At 31 December 2011 there were no borrowings under the Group’s facility agreement (2010: nil) and LoC utilisation of 
US$123,750,000 (2010: US$74,000,000).
(ii) Term loan
At 31 December 2009, LNS had a term loan under the Lundin Petroleum AB Group term loan facility with BNP Paribas.  
On 31 March 2010, in anticipation of the combination of LNS with EnQuest, this term loan was assigned from LNS to Lundin 
Petroleum BV. The resulting liability between LNS and Lundin Petroleum BV, net of a long term loan receivable by LNS and  
a working capital settlement payable by LNS, was capitalised on 6 April 2010.

The fair value measurements of the financial instruments held by the Group have been derived based on observable market 
inputs (as categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7).
Commodity forward contracts
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Group entered into four zero premium oil price collars to partially hedge its exposure 
to fluctuations in oil prices in 2011. Each collar hedged the price of approximately 1,000,000 barrels of oil in 2011. Losses of 
US$36,509,000 (2010: nil) on the unwinding of these contracts during the year are included within revenue in the 
comprehensive income statement.
In November 2011, the Group entered into five separate put and call options in order to hedge the changes in future cash 
flows from the sale of Brent oil production for approximately 3,000,000 barrels of oil in 2012. These instruments were 
deemed to be ineffective and are therefore designated as at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The derivative 
instruments had a net asset fair value of US$2,147,000 (2010: nil) and gains of US$2,147,000 (2010: nil) were taken into  
profit and loss during the year and are included within other financial income.
Forward foreign currency contracts
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group had also entered into 11 forward currency contracts to partially hedge 
the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies, namely Sterling and Euro, of which nine will mature in 2012 
and 2013. 
These contracts qualify for hedge accounting. At 31 December 2011 the total fair value of these derivatives was a liability of 
US$6,842,000 (2010: nil). An unrealised loss of US$2,600,000 (2010: nil) relating to the hedging instruments is included in 
other comprehensive income net of deferred tax of US$4,242,000 (2010: nil). There was no impact in profit or loss during 
the year (2010: nil) in respect of these contracts.

Provision for decommissioning
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its oil production facilities and pipelines on a 
discounted basis. With respect to the Heather field, the decommissioning provision is based on the Group’s contractual 
obligation of 37.5% of the decommissioning liability rather than the Group’s equity interest in the field.
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs, which are expected to be incurred up to 2030 
assuming no further development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 5.0% (2010: 5.0%). The 
unwinding of the discount is classified as a finance cost (note 6).
These provisions have been created based on internal and third party estimates. Assumptions, based on the current economic 
environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. 
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual 
decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required 
which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to 
depend on the dates when the fields cease to be economically viable. This in turn depends on future oil prices, which are 
inherently uncertain.

25. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
Leases
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for office premises. These leases have

Lease payments recognised as an operating lease expense during the year amounted to US$2,066,054 (2010: US$1,163,446). 
Under the Dons Northern Producer agreement a minimum notice period of twelve months exists, whereby the Company 
expects the minimum commitment under this agreement to be approximately US$47,000,000 (2010: US$53,000,000).
Capital commitments

27. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short term deposits, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables. The main purpose of 
these financial instruments is to manage short term cash flow and raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign currency 
risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are 
summarised below. Also presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the 
Group’s financial instruments and to show the impact on profit and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. The sensitivity 
has been prepared for periods ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 using the amounts of debt and other financial assets and 
liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil. 
During 2010, the Board of EnQuest approved a policy to hedge up to a maximum of 50% of annual oil production. During the 
fourth quarter of 2010, four zero premium oil price collars were entered into to hedge the Group’s exposure to fluctuation in 
oil prices, hedging approximately 4,000,000 barrels of oil in 2011. In November 2011, the Group entered into five separate put 
and call options to hedge approximately 3,000,000 barrels of oil in 2012. 
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and total equity of a reasonably possible change in 
the Brent oil price, with all other variables held constant:

31 December 2010 69,746 (69,746) 20,661 (33,478)
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the 
Group’s functional currency. The Group manages this risk by converting US$ receipts at spot rates periodically and as 
required for payments in other currencies. Approximately 2% (2010: 6%) of the Group’s sales and 86% (2010: 79%) of costs 
are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group had entered into 11 forward currency contracts of which nine mature in 
2012 and 2013 to partially hedge the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies, namely Sterling and Euro. These 
contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have been disclosed within note 22. 
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and equity (due to change in the fair value of 
monetary assets and liabilities) of a reasonably possible change in United States dollar exchange rates with respect to

31 December 2010 (22,664) 22,664 (10,879) 10,879
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2011 there were no trade 
receivables past due (2010: nil), and US$705,000 of joint venture receivables past due but not impaired (2010: US$547,000). 
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.  EnQuest PLC

At 31 December 2011, the Group had one customer accounting for 92% of outstanding trade and other receivables (2010: 
one customer, 97%) and six joint venture partners accounting for 80% of joint venture receivables (2010: three joint venture 
partners, 82%). 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, 
the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying 
amount of these instruments.
Cash balances can be invested in short term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits 
and with a view to minimising counterparty credit risks.
Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its 
existing bank facilities and the maturity profile of these facilities. Specifically the Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient 
liquidity or committed facilities exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group 
can service its debt and adhere to its financial covenants. Throughout the year and at 31 December 2011 the Group was in 
compliance with all financial covenant ratios agreed with its bankers. 
At 31 December 2011, the Group had US$156,250,000 (2010: US$206,000,000) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
available which were due to expire in March 2012. On 6 March 2012, a new US$900,000,000 Multi-Currency Revolving Credit 
Facility Agreement with Lloyds TSB Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole CIB, NICB 
Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland was established. The new facility comprises a committed amount of US$525,000,000 for 
three years extendable to four years at the option of the Group (provided conditions are met) and a further year with the 
consent of the lenders. In addition, US$375,000,000 is available primarily for investment opportunities also with the lenders’ 
consent. The Letters of Credit of US$123,750,000 under the old facility have been rolled into the new facility. An upfront 
arrangement fee of 1.75% was payable. 
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at LIBOR relative to each agreed loan period plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25% 
dependent on the Group’s leverage ratio. Facility non-utilisation commitment fees are payable at 40% of the interest margin.

27. Risk management and financial instruments (continued)
At 31 December 2011, the Group held commodity forward contracts for which, based on the oil price at 31 December 2011,  
there were no projected contracted cash flows.
At 31 December 2010, the Group did not hold any foreign exchange forward contracts. In respect of the oil price collars held 
at 31 December 2010 the oil price was between the cap and floor prices and therefore there were no projected contracted 
cash flows.
Capital management
The Group’s management is committed to delivering and enhancing shareholder value, and building upon the progress 
made during the current year. The Board believes that this can best be achieved by reinvesting in the Group’s core business 
and through pursuing selective acquisitions and development opportunities. In light of the Group’s commitment to 
investment in ongoing production operations development, exploration projects and acquisitions, the directors do not 
recommend payment of a dividend at this time. This is, however, reassessed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group seeks to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency  
whilst also maintaining flexibility for future acquisitions. The Group keeps under review the costs and access to debt  
funding to ensure it has appropriate flexibility. Note 21 to the financial statements provides further details of the Group’s 
financing activity.
Capital for the Group is equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent Company, and is in the Group statement of 
changes in equity on page 56.

28. Post balance sheet events
On 9 January 2012, the Group announced its agreement with Canamens Limited to acquire two of its companies, whose 
assets include a 20% interest in the Kraken oil discovery. The Group paid an initial consideration of US$45,000,000 in cash 
and a further payment of US$45,000,000 is contingent upon approval of the Kraken Field Development Plan (FDP) by the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Due to the proximity to the year end, an assessment of whether this 
acquisition should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination has still to be made and will be reviewed 
prior to the Group’s 2012 half year results announcement.
On 13 January 2012, the Group entered a Sale and Purchase Agreement with JX Nippon Exploration & Production (UK) 
Limited to purchase 18.5% working interest in the West Dons Field for US$34,000,000.
On 24 January 2012, the Group announced an agreement with Nautical Petroleum plc (Nautical) to acquire a further 25% 
interest in the Kraken oil discovery, together with interests in surrounding exploration acreage. This agreement is subject to 
the normal regulatory and partner consents. EnQuest will pay Nautical between US$150,000,000 and US$240,000,000 
(dependant on a future determination of the gross 2P reserves), by way of a development carry arrangement in relation to 
Nautical’s remaining interest in the discovery.
The Uisge Gorm Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) was procured on 25 January 2012 for 
US$52,500,000.
On 6 March 2012, in anticipation of the maturity of the existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, EnQuest PLC established 
a three year US$900,000,000 Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the details of which can be found within 
note 27 to the financial statements under liquidity risk. EnQuest PLC

The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements  
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the Company financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible  
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR 
THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EnQuest PLC
Annual Report 2011
88
We have audited the parent Company financial statements 
of EnQuest PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 
1 to 13. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 87, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the parent Company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us  
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are  
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware  
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO  
THE MEMBERS OF ENQUEST PLC
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year 
then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent Company 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of EnQuest PLC for the year ended  
31 December 2011.

1. Corporate information
The Company financial statements of EnQuest PLC (the 
Company) for the year ended 31 December 2011 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
directors on 26 March 2012.
EnQuest PLC (EnQuest or the Company) is a limited liability 
Company registered in England and is the holding Company 
for the Group of EnQuest subsidiaries (together the Group). 
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for, and 
extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the UK 
Continental Shelf.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards on  
a historical cost basis. The functional and presentation 
currency of the separate financial statements is United 
States dollars and all values in the separate financial 
statements are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) 
except where otherwise stated.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company  
as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
EnQuest reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 
December 2011 of US$436,000 (2010: loss US$8,371,000). 
There were no other recognised gains or losses in the period 
(2010: nil).
Going concern concept
The directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that 
the use of the going concern basis is appropriate because 
there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a 
going concern.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for 
impairment.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events have occurred at that date 
that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay 
less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it 
is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries are non-interest bearing 
short term funding to and from subsidiaries. These are 
recognised at the fair value of consideration received or 
paid, less any provision for impairment.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in 
hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest 
bearing securities with original maturities of three months 
or less.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative 
is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair 
value hedging instruments are recorded in the profit and loss 
account, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised 
through the statement of total recognised gains and losses. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. 
Amounts accumulated in shareholders’ equity are 
transferred to the profit and loss account in the period when 
the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When the 
hedged item no longer meets the requirements for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss 
recognised in shareholders’ equity is transferred to the profit 
and loss account when the forecast transaction which was 
the subject of the hedge occurs.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the  
profit and loss account.
Employee benefit trust
EnQuest shares held by the Group are deducted from the 
share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken  
to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and 
loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation  
of equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled 
transactions) of EnQuest. EnQuest PLC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they 
are granted. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of EnQuest (market conditions) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The profit and loss account charge or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market 
or non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition  
is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting 
immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the 
profit and loss account.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on behalf of the employees of the Group which are described  
in detail within note 20 of the Group financial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded  
to employees and transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.

7. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company had entered into four zero premium oil price collars on behalf of its 
subsidiaries partially to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in oil prices in 2011. On maturity of the hedges the associated loss 
was recharged to EnQuest Heather Limited, EnQuest Thistle Limited and EnQuest Dons Limited.
In November 2011, the Company entered into five separate put and call options on behalf of its subsidiaries; EnQuest Heather 
Limited, EnQuest Thistle Limited, EnQuest Dons Limited and Stratic Energy (UK) Limited; in order to hedge the changes in 
future cash flows from the sale of Brent oil production in 2012. These instruments were deemed to be ineffective and are 
therefore designated as at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). Gains of US$2,147,000 (2010: nil) were taken into profit 
and loss during the year.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Company had entered into nine forward currency contracts on behalf of its 
subsidiaries; EnQuest Heather Limited, EnQuest Thistle Limited and EnQuest Dons Limited; of which seven mature in 2012 
and 2013 to partially hedge the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies, namely Sterling and Euro. These 
contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have been disclosed within note 22 of the Group financial statements. At the 
balance sheet date the fair value of these derivatives was a liability of US$5,440,000 (2010: nil). There was no impact in 
profit or loss during the year in respect of these contracts. An unrealised loss of US$4,026,000 has been taken to equity 
during the year net of deferred tax of US$1,414,000.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OUR STRATEGY OF CONTINUING TO INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING
BUSINESSES THROUGH TOUGH TRADING CONDITIONS HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO A STRONG UPTURN IN OUR PERFORMANCE.
I am pleased to report good results. The Group’s adjusted profit*
before tax rose 27% from £185 million to £234 million in the year
to 3 October 2004. Net debt fell by £93 million to £780 million,
despite spending £214 million on acquisitions to nurture 
our businesses. 
The year saw some important developments. 
We spent much time and money considering an acquisition 
of the Telegraph Group. At the right price, this would have been 
a good deal for DMGT but the price went beyond what we thought
was right. A consequence of the sale of the Telegraph was 
the departure of Murdoch MacLennan, Managing Director of
Associated Newspapers for the last 10 years. I thank Murdoch
for his achievements and wish him well in his new role. I am
pleased that we have such able replacements in Kevin Beatty,
who has moved across from Northcliffe Newspapers to
Associated, and Michael Pelosi, who takes over as MD of
Northcliffe. I am confident that they will lead their divisions 
to new heights.
The year also saw two broadsheet titles become tabloids
creating new challenges for our newspapers. To their credit, the
Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday maintained their circulations,
thereby again increasing their market shares. 
We are just completing a £90 million programme of investment
in our press facilities in London, Stoke, Derby and Bristol. So far,
everything has been finished ahead of time, under budget and 
is working well. John Bird, and his team at Harmsworth Quays,
and Mark Ellington, and his team at Northcliffe, deserve much 
of the credit. As a result we look forward to better papers and
higher advertising revenues. 
Our broadcasting division faced major decisions. Even though
our shareholding will be diluted from 29.9% to 14.3%, we
decided to support the proposed merger between GWR and
Capital Radio, because it seemed the best way of increasing the
value of our investment. The OFT is considering whether to refer
the merger to the Competition Commission but we hope it will
be cleared without too many conditions. If it is not, the good
intentions of the 2003 Broadcasting Act will be further diluted.
The Viscount Rothermere
Chairman
Key points
➜ Newspapers remain at the 
heart of DMGT. 
➜ Continued growth by our newer
businesses means that 40% of 
this year’s adjusted operating profit 
has been generated by our non-
newspaper divisions. 
* Adjusted profit (before exceptional items and amortisation and
impairment of intangible assets) 09 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
In Australia, DMG Radio was successful in bidding for further
licences in Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. These
acquisitions were neatly balanced by the sale of our chain of
regional radio stations for an excellent price. We now have the
number one FM station in both Sydney and Melbourne and 
will complete our Nova network during 2005.
Among our other divisions, dmg world media had a strong
trading year and continued to make small fill in acquisitions
which generate high marginal returns. DMG Information was 
still the fastest growing division with a further 50% increase 
in operating profit. Risk Management Solutions was again the
largest contributor to this growth.
Convinced that the internet will become more and more
important in our lives, I am encouraging our consumer publishing
enterprises to increase their investments in it with the aim of
building a leading presence in key channels.
Klaus Schwab has this month retired from the Board after 
six years’ service. He has a busy schedule as President of the 
World Economic Forum and I am grateful for his advice and
guidance during his time as a Director . 
After five years marking time in difficult markets, it is good to
see a big growth in profits properly reflecting the strength of the
Group. These results are largely due to the skill and dedication 
of our excellent employees. I thank them and hope to report
good figures again next year . 
The Viscount Rothermere
Chairman
£90 million investment
We have completed a £90 million
programme of investment in our
press facilities in London, Stoke,
Derby and Bristol. This was finished
ahead of time and under budget.
Number one FM stations
We now have the number one 
FM station in both Sydney and
Melbourne and will complete our
Nova network during 2005.
DMG Information: the fastest 
growing division
DMG Information was again the 
fastest growing division with a further
50% increase in operating profit. Risk
Management Solutions was again 
the largest contributor to this growth.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S INTRODUCTION
SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN SOUND BUSINESSES 
THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC CYCLE NOW PUTS US IN 
A STRONG COMMERCIAL POSITION.
Q: Your results this year are good. Is this because your
businesses have been operating in booming sectors?
A: It’s down to a combination of factors. Certainly some of our
business sectors have been showing strong growth – UK
regional newspaper and Australian radio advertising would be
two examples. But in addition most of our businesses have been
growing their market share and operating more efficiently, and
we’ve made some helpful acquisitions.
Q: How did the Board set the dividend in such a good year?
A: DMGT has a policy of seeking to increase the dividend in 
real terms every year, regardless of the results within reason, 
as long as we continue to have confidence in the strength of our
businesses. This year, the Board decided to go to the top of the
range that they hope to maintain. It means that the compound
dividend growth over the last ten years is 10%. 
Q: Can you outline the reasons behind the largest acquisitions
and disposals DMGT has made this year?
A: The biggest moves this year have been in Australian radio. We
bid successfully for licences in Adelaide and Brisbane, which will
enable us to complete our national Nova network of stations, and
in Sydney and Melbourne, where we will be able to run a second
station alongside Nova. Finally we sold our regional stations
because someone offered us a very good price and we wished 
to focus on metropolitan markets. Elsewhere, Euromoney added
to its thriving conference business with the purchase of IMN, and
DMG Information bought Trepp and, since the year end, Lewtan,
to add to its fast-growing business to business information
division. Generally we look for acquisitions that will expand or
extend existing successful operations in the Group. Of course,
the biggest deal would have been the one we did not do, namely
the Telegraph Group. Lord Rothermere has referred to that 
in his statement.
Q: What do you see as the greatest risks facing DMGT?
A: This is a question that occupies a lot of our time, and rightly
so. Inevitably we face economic risks in terms of the health of
the economies and the markets in which we operate. There 
is little that we can do about these in the short term, but for
some time we have pursued a policy of investing as willingly 
in selected overseas markets as in the UK, and we watch the
long term health of the markets we serve. We consider that 
our businesses have two essential assets, our brands and our
people. The key risks over which we can have some control 
are reputation, our capacity to compete and retention of staff. 
On each of these we have a good record, but we are never
complacent. They are all a regular focus of the Group Risk
Committee, which I chair and about which you can read on 
page 31. But we never forget that we are paid to take risks, 
but manage them.
Q: On the issue of staff retention, DMGT is very unusual in
continuing to keep open final salary pension schemes, almost
unique in the media sector . Why is this and how are they doing?
A: We believe in trying to provide the appropriate form of pension
provision to all our employees. Thus we have retained final salary
pension schemes for our UK newspaper divisions where people
tend to stay with us for a long time and where we have a lot of
employees over 35. In the other divisions, where many of the
employees are younger, and which are more international, we
believe defined contribution schemes are more appropriate.
For the final salary schemes, it’s been another interesting year,
with pensions regularly creating newspaper headlines, ever
more schemes being closed and ever more legislation. During
the year, we have been undertaking the triennial actuarial review
➜ Compound dividend growth over the
last ten years is 10%
Charles Sinclair
Chief Executive of our schemes. They remain in better shape than many, at
worst only marginally in deficit, and, importantly, continue to
have an excess of cash inflows over cash outflows to finance
benefit commitments. But the cost of providing the benefits 
they promise continues to grow, mainly because people are 
living longer .
We have decided once more to keep our schemes open, because
we believe they are appropriate. However, in view of the cost
pressures, we are informing members of changes we will be
making next year . Any employee who wants to continue earning
pension benefits at the same rate as now will be asked to
increase their contributions; if they pay the same as now, they
will in future earn benefits at a lower rate, as will new employees,
at least for their first five years with us. The Group will also be
increasing again its contributions into the schemes, but we have
been able to hold the cost to an acceptable level, while also
being able to focus the investment on our long term employees.
Q: Your share price has performed well in the last twelve
months, up 17% in the year to November 2004. Is this in your
view a sensible reflection of the Company’s performance?
A: This short term increase does mirror the improvement in 
our trading results over the same period and represents 13%
outperformance of the media sector . However, we believe 
it is more appropriate to look at the long term share price
performance against the market and our peers. As you can 
see in the graphs opposite and on page 39, we have done well
over five years and even better over longer periods.
Q: In which direction do you see DMGT going over the 
next few years?
A: More of the same. I am sure that newspapers will continue 
to be a vibrant media form for many years and will remain at 
the heart of DMGT. At the same time we hope to continue to
grow our non-newspaper divisions and we may well find more
acquisitions in these areas than in newspapers.

ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS
Associated Newspapers achieved its highest ever profits* 
(even after adjusting for the extra trading week this year).
The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday both achieved solid
circulation performances, outperforming markets in overall
decline, proving once again the value of long term investment 
in editorial quality together with innovative, targeted and
attractive promotions.
The Daily Mail circulation of 2,430,000 was down 0.5% despite a
10p cover price increase on Saturday, comparing favourably to 
a total market decline of 2.6%, consolidating its position as the
second highest selling national daily newspaper and increasing
its share of the total market by 0.42%, the highest market share
growth of any national newspaper .
At 2,361,000, The Mail on Sunday circulation was only 
0.25% down on the previous year, despite the overall Sunday
newspaper market declining by 1%. It also increased its 
market share to 16.7%, which is the highest ever recorded and
reaffirmed its position as the second highest selling national
Sunday newspaper . At the 2004 Newspaper Awards The Mail 
on Sunday was awarded the print industry’s top design award
“Newspaper Design of the Year”.
The Evening Standard average daily net sale of 385,000, was
down by 6.6%. The overall financial performance of the title,
however, showed a dramatic improvement as a result of
improved advertising revenues and the effects of last year’s 
cost reduction flowing through. After a difficult start to the 
year, classified was by the end of the year showing year on 
year increases.
Metro had an excellent year . The successful launches of two new
franchises in the East Midlands and South West, with Northcliffe
Newspapers, resulted in distribution reaching one million. This
makes Metro the fourth highest circulation Monday to Friday
daily newspaper . Readership has grown to 1.9 million, of which
61% are ABC1. The average age of a Metro reader is 31.
Associated’s total advertising revenues increased by 10.7%, with
display up 10.6% and classified up 11.0% (including Jobsite). The
Daily Mail produced record total advertising revenue, whilst The
Mail on Sunday was up 8% year on year . The Evening Standard
increased display revenues by 14.7% but classified was down 
6%. Metro increased its display revenue by 27% and classified 
by 21.4%. New Media, Loot and Ireland on Sunday all achieved
excellent year on year growth.
The press enhancement project at Harmsworth Quays was
completed within budget and on schedule. The last two presses
have been installed and were operational in November 2004,
whereupon the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and the Evening
NEWSPAPERS ARE THE HEART OF DMGT. CONTINUED INVESTMENT
IN OUR MARKET-LEADING TITLES, EVEN IN TIMES OF CHALLENGING
TRADING CONDITIONS, MEANS THAT THE POSITION OF OUR
NATIONAL NEWSPAPER DIVISION HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER.

Quays continues to work closely with its key suppliers to increase
efficiency and to improve printing quality. During the financial
year the contract for the printing of Associated’s titles at Bradford
ended, with the production being transferred to a site operated
by Northcliffe Newspapers in Stoke.
ANM, the digital division of Associated Newspapers, made
significant progress during the year, having pursued a strategy 
of building content around the newspaper brands as well as
vertical classified listings' sites. Advertising revenue grew 30%
year on year and paid for content services were launched for the
first time. Two new products were launched in the year – the Daily
Mail/The Mail on Sunday online and Homesandproperty.co.uk.
Jobsite, the UK’s leading recruitment website, was acquired in
March and is exceeding all expectations. Since the year end 
Find a Property has been acquired which further broadens the
division’s portfolio. 
Ireland on Sunday continued to make progress and retains its
position as number three in the Irish Sunday newspaper market.
Average weekly circulation was slightly down at 152,000, but
readership increased to 481,000, an 11% increase on last year .
Advertising revenue was up 48% and trading losses were
reduced by 22%.
Loot had a good year, with advertising revenue up 7.8% and
profit up 20%. Circulation again proved difficult, falling 12.9%,
which was much in line with the market. Significant investment
is being made in Loot.com to provide buyers and sellers with
access to a growing online audience. Buy and Sell, Loot’s
equivalent in Ireland, also had a good year, increasing revenue 
by 18% and profit by 9%.
The new financial year has started encouragingly for Associated
but with upward pressure on newsprint prices, an extremely
competitive circulation market and advertising still somewhat
short term, it could be a challenging year . However, with our
strong, market-leading editorial products and continued focus 
on costs, the outlook for the next twelve months is 
cautiously optimistic.
Online Mail
Online Mail was launched in May
offering an outstanding news, lifestyle
and entertainment service. It attracts
504,000 unique visitors a day,
creating another channel to our
outstanding editorial output.
Digital media acquisitions
As part of the Group’s continuing
strategy to develop a powerful
portfolio of digital media properties,
Jobsite and Find a Property were
acquired in March and November
2004 respectively. Jobsite is the UK’s
leading multi-sector online job board
and Find a Property is its largest
independent property website.

Metro is now fourth highest Monday

NORTHCLIFFE NEWSPAPERS
Northcliffe enjoyed another record year in 2004, achieving growth
in adjusted operating profit* of 7%. Most publishing centres
reported progress including Aberdeen and Bristol. Their
performances were particularly encouraging following difficult
market conditions in 2003. Other notable performances were
from titles in Nottingham, Derby, Tamworth, Devon and Hungary
and from electronic publishing.
In the UK, advertising revenues recorded growth of 5.9% with
recruitment up by 10% and property improving by 11% on the 
back of a buoyant housing market. However, motors advertising
reflected the overall marketplace and, despite a number of
initiatives, declined by 1%. 
Newspaper sales revenues grew by 1.5%. A limited number of
titles increased their cover prices during the year but this was
partly offset by continued gentle declines in circulation,
particularly by the evening titles.
Much emphasis continues to be placed on a drive to stabilise 
the circulation of the 17 evening titles. A programme of
evaluating and improving the circulation basics of distribution,
canvassing, home delivery, street vending and retail has provided
some positive results. The drive to reduce bulk sales continued
so as to reach our internal target of actively purchased sales 
of between 98% and 100% for all titles. Northcliffe’s morning 
and evening titles, which recorded declines of 1.9% and 2.5%
respectively, and its weekly titles, which showed an increase of
0.1%, outperformed the industry in the July to December 2003
ABC period. During the January to June 2004 ABC period, the
mornings and evenings continued this trend. However, the
weekly titles fell below the industry average by 0.7%, despite 
14 of the group’s 24 weekly titles showing increases.
In a broader context readership has increased. Comprehensive
audience research has reported an increased audience reach to
seven in ten adults over the course of a week for evening titles.
After 257 years, the Press & Journal, Northcliffe’s much
respected morning title published from Aberdeen, and its only
daily broadsheet, launched a compact format in August for 
the Saturday edition. Initial results seem promising, although
further research is required before extending this initiative
across the week.
In June, Northcliffe launched two editions of the popular and
successful free distribution morning title, Metro; one in the East
Midlands; and the other in Bristol, Bath and Gloucestershire.
Both these titles are already profitable. 
Northcliffe Electronic Publishing continued to grow its offering
and its audience. Registered users increased by approximately
60% over the year . Unique users totalled in excess of 1.3 million.

Extra services like online booking of classified advertisements
and letters to the Editor have all helped to enhance the benefits
to the users. Breakeven was achieved in September and this
performance is expected to improve in 2005. 
The press enhancements at Stoke and Derby were completed
ahead of schedule and on budget. This project was part of a
wider group initiative to provide additional colour for the Daily
Mail and The Mail on Sunday. Our other major engineering
project – adding extra colour to Plymouth’s press – has
progressed smoothly and will be completed before the end of
this year . Titles in Devon and Cornwall, plus The Mail on Sunday,
will benefit from this investment. During 2005, Northcliffe plans
to start its next major printing development so as to provide
enhanced colour and publishing opportunities for titles in
Lincolnshire and Humberside.
Once again, the Hungarian business reported encouraging
growth and a new profit record, assisted by the acquisition
of Avízo, a classified publication in Slovakia. Overall, strong
advertising revenues and buoyant contract printing led to profit
growth in excess of 30%. We continue to seek acquisition
opportunities in Hungary, Slovakia and neighbouring countries. 
In the UK, we completed the acquisition in September of Bargain
Pages, a classified publication circulating in Birmingham,
Coventry and The Black Country. Bargain Pages sells in excess
of 45,000 copies per week. Existing management has been
retained and a link with our successful East Midlands operation,
Ad-Mag, promises both operational and commercial synergies. 
We are aware of the need to listen to the views and concerns of
staff. For the first time a synchronised staff opinion survey was
conducted in every centre. Such surveys are not new, but doing
them everywhere at the same time greatly increases their use
because it enables appreciation of common attitudes. They 
also form part of a series of initiatives aimed at reducing staff
turnover at a time when competition for staff is ever increasing.
Not unsurprisingly, a number of deficiencies were highlighted
and are currently being addressed. We plan a follow-up survey 
in late 2005.
The new financial year has continued the momentum recently
established. Advertising revenues, driven by strong demand 
for property advertising, are showing a 5% increase. However,
recent evidence of a slowdown in the housing market makes it
difficult to forecast the prospects for property advertising beyond
the near-term. Recent interest rate rises appear to be having 
a calming impact on consumer expenditure and business
confidence. Therefore, at this stage, we take a cautious view 
of prospects for 2005.
New presses in Stoke and Derby
The recently extended Colorliner 80
press at Stoke is one of the largest
single press lines in the country. At
full capacity it is capable of running
192 pages of back to back colour .
New format a success
After 257 years, the Press & Journal
changed from broadsheet to a
compact edition on Saturdays. Initial
reader reactions have been very
positive and sales figures have
increased.
Revamped thisis websites
Throughout 2004 Northcliffe
Electronic Publishing have
successfully revamped and updated
the 22 thisis websites within the

The profits of many of Euromoney’s publishing businesses fell
due to a combination of weak advertising revenues and the
decline in the US dollar . However, advertising revenues showed
signs of recovery and there was a continued strong performance
from the events and training businesses. 
In general, Euromoney’s traditional financial advertisers have
been slow to increase their advertising spend in spite of better
market conditions. Financial advertising revenues, excluding
Hedge Fund Intelligence (HFI), fell 4%. Institutional Investor was
the only major title to increase advertising revenues over the
year although Euromoney magazine saw a marked improvement
in the second half. Both titles were helped by strong
performances from emerging markets, particularly Eastern
Europe and Asia. In contrast, the recovery in advertising 
from the key London and New York financial centres has 
been slow. 
The weakness in advertising meant that profits* from financial
publishing (excluding HFI) fell by £1 million. However HFI,
acquired in August 2003, has performed well ahead of
expectations since acquisition. 
Profits* from business publishing increased by £0.9 million
despite a fall in revenues. Gulf, the Houston-based energy
publisher, the legal publishing business, and Engel, the
pharmaceutical marketing publisher, all experienced a strong
second half advertising recovery. 
The conference businesses had an excellent year, helped by a
better than expected contribution from Information Management
Network (IMN). Excluding IMN, conference revenues increased
25%. Euromoney Conferences was the best performer .
Euromoney Seminars and Institutional Investor Memberships
also had good years. Adhesion’s profits increased as a result of 
a good contribution from the biennial Vinisud wine exhibition.
The results of the last three years have demonstrated the 
value of conference businesses, particularly ones that are
predominantly sponsor-driven, as a more robust revenue stream
than advertising. This has reinforced Euromoney’s strategy of
expanding its portfolio of market-leading annual events through
a mixture of organic and acquisition growth. IMN’s performance
since acquisition in February has exceeded expectations. 
Euromoney’s training businesses also had an excellent year,
continuing the growth begun in 2003. The businesses benefited
from continued investment in new courses and marketing to
increase delegate numbers. The financial and legal training
businesses depend heavily on the performance of the global 
and emerging market financial institutions. Both have increased
hiring and training budgets during the year which, combined
with an improved travel outlook, has helped trading conditions. 
Operating profits* from databases and information services
increased by £0.6 million. Stronger emerging markets helped ISI,
the electronic information service on emerging markets, have
one of its best sales periods for several years. Subscription
revenues increased by 14%. During the year, ISI expanded its
service to cover a further 15 countries, bringing the total to more
than 60, with nearly 9,000 information sources now available 
to subscribers. 
The benefits of this investment, and the contribution from high
growth businesses such as ISI, HFI and IMN, will form the base
for stronger organic growth in 2005 and beyond.

Teletext: New Revenue Streams
The launch of Teletext on 4 in Sky
and Freeview homes expanded the
company’s presence on digital TV
and paves the way for agreements
with other commercial broadcasters.
Teletextholidays.co.uk
During July the teletextholidays.co.uk
website increased unique users by
86% year-on-year with over 2 million
visitors to the site, confirming its
position as the UK's biggest travel
marketplace and one of the top three
travel sites in the UK.
TELETEXT IS BUILDING A
STRONG POSITION TO GROW
AUDIENCES AS DIGITAL
SWITCHOVER APPROACHES.
+86%
Teletext's revenues were broadly flat despite difficult trading
conditions in its key market of package holidays, where the
industry was down by 8%. Operating profit was held back as the
business continued to invest in its future, launching Teletext
Holidays TV, Teletext on 4, together with further investment in
teletextholidays.co.uk. Excluding these investments, operating
profit was up by over 10%. As digital switchover approaches,
Teletext is building a strong position to continue to grow
audiences and revenues via the web and digital TV. 
On the web, teletextholidays.co.uk is routinely attracting over 
two million unique users and continues to maintain its position
within the UK’s top three travel web sites. To date the site has
been confined to package holidays. However, investment in the
site continues and the company recently launched a new flights
channel which will significantly increase its addressable market
in the independent travel sector . The channel capitalises on the
growing trend for consumers to search online for great value
flight deals by providing a unified search function. This allows
users to search multiple scheduled, charter and low cost airlines
all at the same time, negating the need to visit numerous
different web sites.
Teletext on analogue television (available on ITV1, Channel 4 
and Five) continues to be popular, with over a third of the UK
adult population using the services each week. During the year
Teletext expanded its presence in digital homes with its launch 
of Teletext on 4. This digital text service is now accessible to
viewers by pressing the text button when watching any Channel 
4 programme on Sky or Freeview platforms. The company is
actively pursuing opportunities to expand its digital distribution
arrangements with other broadcasters.
The Teletext Holidays brand, which accounts for the majority of
the company’s revenue, also launched the Teletext Holidays TV
channel during the year . The channel is accessible to viewers 
in Sky homes and provides inspirational travel programming,
sitting alongside a digital holidays’ text service to offer a 
marketplace for the best holiday deals. Early viewer response 
to the new channel has been positive. 
Also during the year Teletext’s mobile phone information service
continued to deliver growth, increasing its distribution of
messages to its subscriber base by 20%.
In the year the company completed a detailed review of all
service offerings and concluded that some were unlikely to
generate the commercial returns required. In particular the
decision was taken to close its online news service and curtail 
its digital cable services. 
Independent Television News (ITN), a company in which the
Group retains a 20% stake, has performed in line with
expectations and the British Pathe archive, for which ITN
handles the sales and marketing, continues to deliver a steady
revenue stream. 
In conclusion, in a difficult market DMG Broadcasting
maintained revenue levels while continuing to invest in its core
business and develop strategic initiatives on digital television 
and the web.

RADIO
DMG Radio Australia returned strong performances in all
aspects of its business. Revenues from its metropolitan stations
continued to increase, this year by more than 30%, which drove
an increase in adjusted operating profit* from metropolitan
stations of more than 200%.
Our Nova stations in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth all recorded
strong increases in advertising revenues. Growing recognition 
of Nova’s low clutter advertising environment and its “never
more than two ads in a row” policy enabled all Nova stations 
to increase their market share. This recognition appears to be
extending internationally with leading US networks announcing
intentions to embrace the low clutter advertising environment 
pioneered by DMG Radio in 2001. Nova 969 in Sydney was also
recognised by listeners in becoming the number one station
overall in 2004 in Australia’s largest city.
DMG Radio’s metropolitan talk (speech) station, Five AA in
Adelaide, also continued to grow its revenues and profits,
resulting in another record year for both.
In October 2003, DMG Radio bid successfully for a new FM
licence in Adelaide which launched on 31st August 2004 as Nova
919. In April, it secured a Brisbane FM licence at auction. This
licence will launch early in 2005 as Nova 106.9 and will complete
the national Nova network.
DMG Radio also acquired additional FM licences in Sydney and
Melbourne, both of which will launch in 2005 under a new brand.
In Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, the group now
holds two licences, the maximum allowed by regulations.
It also launched Star 1045 FM in New South Wales’ Central
Coast in March. The Central Coast is one of the fastest growing
regions in Australia and is located 120 km North East of Sydney.
This year saw the culmination of an investment programme
which began in 1996 when DMGT bought an AM station in
Adelaide and a handful of regional stations in New South Wales
and Victoria as the basis for what became DMG Regional Radio.
Prior to the sale of DMG Regional Radio, the group consisted of
eight metropolitan FM licences, one metropolitan AM licence 
and fifty nine regional licences.
After enjoying a seven-year association with regional radio, DMG
Radio sold fifty seven regional stations in September . The sale
did not include the near metropolitan markets of Sunshine Coast
and Central Coast. This portfolio was acquired for a total of
A$169 million and the sale price of A$193.5 million represented
a multiple at a substantial premium to the market average.
Since making its initial investment in 1996, DMG Radio has been
widely recognised for its commitment to local communities and
the improved standards of broadcasting it brought to the regional
markets. The sale represented a return to the focus of the
Group's original strategy in Australia which was based around
the high growth, high population, high revenue and high margin
metropolitan markets.
In the UK, GWR Group plc, in which the Group holds a 29.9%
stake, became the first to respond to the new regulatory
environment by announcing its planned merger with Capital
Radio plc. Subject to any regulatory approvals, the merger 
will create the UK’s largest single commercial broadcaster .

DMG WORLD MEDIA
dmg world media is one of the world’s leading international
exhibition companies. It aims to be its customers’ first choice,
helping them to do business together and make informed
choices through its range of exhibitions and related print and
new media products.
2004 was a record year, reporting an increase in operating profit*
of 26% over last year . This was due in part to a number of large
non-annual events taking place, including the Global Petroleum
Show in Calgary, the reporting of two Index shows in Dubai (Index
2004 was brought forward from October 2004 to September 2004
due to Ramadan) and to a number of acquisitions. This strong
result was despite the fact that half of dmg world media’s 
revenue was generated in the North American market where the
continuing weakness of the US dollar had a significant adverse
effect. Adjusting for these non-annual shows and foreign
exchange, the underlying operating profit grew year on year 
by 12% on a turnover which grew by 6%.
2004 was a much better year for the exhibition business overall,
when compared with 2003. Despite the conflict in Iraq, dmg world
media’s business performed well in the Middle East. However,
the four hurricanes in Florida this September did affect a number
of shows, forcing two shows to be cancelled, one show to close
early and reducing visitor levels at the September Surf Expo
Show. Continued strong management, tight cost control and 
the high level of commitment from its staff has meant that dmg
world media has held some of its largest events ever this year,
including both Index shows and The Big 5 in Dubai, Surf Expo
(January) in Orlando and the Daily Mail Ideal Home Show in
London. For the second year running, Surf Expo was honoured by
Trade Show Week as one of the 50 fastest growing shows in the
US. The Suburban Home and Garden show in Philadelphia also
made the list this year .
Launches and acquisitions are an integral part of dmg world
media’s growth strategy. In 2004 there were 12 new product
launches compared with 11 in 2003. The 2004 launches included
five new home shows – two in the US, and one each in the UK,
Canada and Australia; a number of new shows at its Business
Media division including shows in South Korea, China and
Morocco; and a new antiques fair in France. In addition, dmg world
media completed seven fill in acquisitions – five in North America
and one each in the UK and New Zealand. dmg world media is
planning to launch a further eight shows in the coming year .
dmg world media is expecting continued strong growth in its
underlying business, although overall profits are likely to be lower
due to a number of large non-annual shows and Index not
reporting in 2005. The new financial year has already started well,
with a successful second edition of the Autumn Ideal Home Show
in London, which again beat expectations in terms of both
exhibitor space sales and visitor attendance.
Operating profit increases
dmg world media reported an
increase in its underlying operating
profit* of 12% in 2004.

Landmark Information Group
enjoyed a successful year . Sales
increased by over 60% as Sitescope
was successfully integrated and 
the need to consider environmental
factors when buying property was
increasingly recognised.
DMG Information (DMGI) had another outstanding year, 
growing operating profits* by 54%, with rapid growth in business
to business and recovery in the careers division.
Business to Business Division
Risk Management Solutions continued the strong growth of
previous years, and margins improved further .
The new US hurricane and earthquake models introduced in
2003 have been widely adopted by customers. Penetration of the
Lloyds market has been a notable achievement. Sales of newer
models, in particular those dealing with terrorism and workers’
compensation saw increasing rates of take up. 
All four companies in the Property Data and Analytics Group
produced favourable results. 
Environmental Data Resources posted solid growth in an
improving commercial real estate market. 
Landmark Information Group successfully integrated the
Sitescope business, acquired in September 2003. The market 
for home environmental reports grew rapidly, benefiting 
the combined business, although demand weakened in the 
final quarter .
Property & Portfolio Research performed well in its second 
year under DMGI ownership. Revenue continued its satisfactory
growth trend and margins improved. 
In April Trepp was acquired and performance exceeded
expectations. The Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities
market served by the company remains buoyant. 
Dolphin Software made progress in establishing a new range 
of product offerings in the area of hazardous chemical 
inventory management.
Under new leadership Sanborn underwent a turnaround in its
performance. Bookings increased by 50% and the backlog
carried into the new financial year has strengthened significantly. 
RMSI had a satisfactory year . Particularly successful were sales
into the UK government geographic information market, made 
in conjunction with Landmark.
In November 2004, the Boston-based Lewtan Technologies was
acquired. The company is a leading information provider in the
asset backed securities markets.
Careers Division
Hobsons had its most encouraging year for some time. The US
business again grew strongly. Academic Engine was acquired
and successfully integrated into Hobsons’ Cincinnati operation.
After a number of tough years in the UK, profits moved ahead
and in Continental Europe Hobsons maintained market leading
positions in difficult markets.
Study Group made encouraging progress in its recovery from 
the low point in its fortunes immediately following the 2001 US
terrorist attacks. Once again, the UK and Australia operations
did well, whilst in the US recovery continued but at a modest
pace. During the year changes to student visa issuance
processes and requirements had an adverse impact on student
volumes entering the UK and Australia, but management 
actions have started to improve visa approved rates.

FINANCIAL AND TREASURY REVIEW
THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO OUTLINE KEY ASPECTS 
OF THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST YEAR AND OF 
ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.
Accounts
The Accounts reflect the introduction of two changes in financial
reporting requirements published this year . First the Group 
has had to reclassify its investment in its own shares within
shareholders' funds. Secondly its policy in respect of revenue
recognition has been amended so that the earnings of
exhibitions are recognised over the life of the event, where
appropriate, and advertising revenues from DMG Information’s
websites are spread over the term of contract. These changes
are mainly to the balance sheet only.  
Otherwise the Accounts have been prepared in accordance with
the accounting policies adopted last year . Once again they have
been prepared under SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’
with additional information included in Note 39 as required by
FRS 17, ‘Retirement Benefits’. 
Next year will be the last time that the Group Accounts will be
prepared on the basis of UK accounting standards. From its year
to 1st October 2006 DMGT, as a listed company, will be required
to adopt international accounting standards in order to comply
with a directive from the European Union. We have a transition
project in place to enable the Accounts for that year to be
reported on that basis, progress on which is well advanced. 
Turnover
The Group’s turnover in the year of £2,109 million was 9% higher
than the previous year . For our newspaper divisions, we produce
our accounts each year to the Sunday nearest 30th September;
this year that meant 3rd October and thus the inclusion of an
extra week, compared to 2003. There was turnover growth from
each division.  
Taking out the effect of this extra week and excluding the impact
of acquisitions and disposals, underlying turnover growth was 7%.
The analysis of turnover by activity, illustrated in graph 1, shows
that there has been no change in the shape of the Group in terms
of revenues. Graph 2 shows the geographic split of turnover.
Key figures
➜ Underlying turnover grew by 12% 
➜ Operating profit* grew by 26%
➜ Earnings per share* grew by 25% 
Peter Williams
Finance Director
* Adjusted (before exceptional items and amortisation and
impairment of intangible assets) 22 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
Operating Profit
The Group’s adjusted operating profit* (before amortisation 
and impairment of intangible assets and exceptional items)
amounted to £234 million, an increase of 26% on the equivalent
figure for last year . This figure is stated before charging £18
million of exceptional operating costs as a consequence of the
decommissioning of press equipment at Harmsworth Quays. The
charge for amortisation of intangible assets increased from £54
million to £71 million and an impairment charge was made of
£12.9 million due to a more conservative approach being taken to
asset lives and to the carrying value of goodwill. As a result, the
Group’s statutory operating profit rose by 4% to £182 million.
The analysis of adjusted operating profit* by activity is shown 
in graph 3. This shows excellent growth from our national
newspapers, exhibitions and business to business information
divisions and from Euromoney Institutional Investor . 
Continued growth by the Group’s newer businesses means that
40% of this year’s adjusted operating profit has been generated
by its non-newspaper divisions, up from 37% last year . 
Profit before Tax
The Group’s share of net adjusted operating profits* of its joint
ventures and associates increased by £3.4 million due mainly 
to an increased contribution from GWR Group plc, its 29.9%
associate. There were also improved performances from nearly
all of the Group’s other interests including GLM, the North
American gift exhibition organiser . 
Profits on sale of fixed assets arose mainly from the sale of 
two million shares in Reuters Group plc. Profit on disposal of
businesses was mainly due to the sale of DMG Regional Radio.
Income from fixed asset investments fell by £1.6 million to £3.4
million due to a lower distribution from the Press Association.
The slight fall in net interest payable was due to a lower average
level of debt, offset by a higher average interest rate, caused by
the impact of a bond issue in the prior year . 
The statutory profit before tax of £125 million was 15% higher
than last year’s figure. Excluding amortisation and impairment
and exceptional items, the adjusted profit* before tax figure was
£234 million, up 26% on last year . 
Taxation
The tax charge of £57 million represents 45.9% of profit before 
tax and 25.1% of profit before amortisation and impairment. The
underlying tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of
intangible assets, exceptional items and significant non-recurring
or prior year items, amounted to £62.2 million and the resulting
rate is 26.6%, up from 25.3% last year due to a different mix of
profits. This is well below the UK corporate tax rate, where the
Group currently makes most of its profit. The Group’s effective tax
rate in the UK is higher than this due to expenditure disallowed
for tax purposes. This is offset by a lower rate of tax on our US
profits, largely due to the recognition of prior year US tax losses.
This is likely to remain the case for a number of years.
Cash Flow and Net Debt
Net debt at the end of the financial year was £780 million, a
decrease of £93 million over last year . The fall in debt was due to
strong trading cash flows which, with the proceeds of disposals,
exceeded the outflow from capital expenditure, acquisitions,
taxation, interest and dividends. 
Graph 4 summarises the Group’s sources and use of funds
during the year . The net cash inflow from trading was £382
million, which represented 108% of operating profit before
depreciation and amortisation and impairment of intangible
assets. In general, the Group’s profits are converted rapidly into
cash, but the positive cash flow was particularly high due to the
timing of the year end.  
Capital expenditure of £103 million was higher than last 
year’s level reflecting the final year of the UK press expansion
programme that was completed in November 2004. Acquisitions

of intangible assets and exceptional items).

and investments cost £214 million (£64 million in 2003), the
largest items being the purchase of Australian radio licences 
of £106 million, Jobsite (£36 million), Trepp (£23 million) 
and IMN (£16 million). Disposal proceeds amounted to 
£101 million, principally being the sale of DMG Regional 
Radio for £77 million.
The Group’s interest cover, calculated as the ratio of adjusted
profits before interest and depreciation (EBITDA) to net interest
payable, was 6.1 times this year, an improvement on 2003 (see
Graph 5) and above the Group’s current target of six times. 
The Group’s ratio of year end net debt to EBITDA was 2.1 times.
The Group’s Standard & Poor’s credit rating remains at BBB.
At the year end, the Group had £181 million of Bonds and bank
facilities maturing in 2005 and £658 million of Bonds due for
repayment in 2013, 2018 and 2021. In October 2004, it signed
£300 million of new five-year committed banking facilities. 
These have replaced the existing bank facilities, thereby
extending the maturity of the Group’s debt. Consequently, 
the Group has sufficient committed debt facilities to meet its
foreseeable requirements. It had surplus committed facilities 
of £198 million at the year end. 
Treasury Policies
The following paragraphs are a summary of the Group’s treasury
policies. Detailed information is given in Note 27 to the balance
sheets. DMGT aims to have sufficient liquidity to meet both
operational and capital cash flows and to impose the minimum
cash constraints on the management and operation of the
Group. Financial instruments, including derivatives, are used 
by the Group in order to manage the principal financial risks 
that arise in the course of business. These risks are liquidity 
or funding risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and
counterparty risk. The instruments are used within the
parameters set by the Finance Committee of the Board, 
and are not traded for a profit.
Overview
The Group has adequate committed debt finance to meet
current trading requirements. Foreign exchange risk is not a
large issue for the Group as the majority of its businesses are
domestic. In principle the underlying currency of net debt is 
in proportion to the EBITDA in each currency. The Group has 
a prudent level of fixed interest rate debt to reduce the impact 
of interest rate fluctuations.
(a) Liquidity Risk
It is the Group’s policy to have sufficient surplus borrowing
headroom such that its development is not constrained. The
Group is funded by a mixture of equity, debt and retained profits.
Debt consists mainly of committed bank facilities and bonds. 
The bank facilities provide the Group with flexibility for operational
requirements and acquisitions. Uncommitted and overdraft
facilities are also utilised. The bonds currently in issue consist of
four sterling Eurobonds. Maturities of debt are spread in order to
avoid the requirement for significant repayments at any point in
time, as shown in Graph 6. Surplus funds are generally used to
pay down debt; when they do arise, they are generally deposited
in money market accounts with banks that provide bilateral
credit lines. 
Covenants on debt instruments are kept to a minimum, even 
if this results in marginally higher interest costs. Apart from
lease finance, external finance is unsecured and is usually an
obligation of the central holding companies rather than of
trading subsidiaries. This gives management maximum flexibility
to run the business without the distraction of meeting short term
financing requirements.
(b) Foreign Exchange Risk
(i) Transaction Risk
Most of the Group’s businesses do not transact cross-border:
hence multi-currency transaction risk is not substantial. The
main exception is Euromoney which has net receipts in US
dollars and net payments in sterling. Euromoney has a series 
of US dollar forward sale contracts in place up to 18 months

forward to meet its sterling outgoings. Other than Euromoney
there were no significant foreign currency contracts in existence
that hedge revenues or costs.
The sterling value of capital expenditure in foreign currency is
fixed using forward currency purchases. Tax on non-trading
exchange rate movements is hedged.
(ii) Translation Exposure
Borrowings are principally incurred in sterling, with lesser
amounts in US dollars and Australian dollars. Generally, the
proportion of foreign currency debt (after allowing for any
hedging instrument) to total net debt is kept approximately equal
to the proportion of foreign EBITDA, compared to total Group
EBITDA. This is expected to continue. A large proportion of US
dollar and Australian dollar liabilities are created through the
use of foreign exchange derivatives. 
(iii) Netting
The Group may offset currency risks on trading, capital expenditure,
tax and borrowings and only hedge the net exposure.
(c) Debt Levels
The Group has previously aimed to have a 5:1 ratio of EBITDA 
to net interest costs. However, in view of the position of the
advertising cycle this target has been tightened to 6:1. In
addition, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA should not normally
exceed 2.5:1. It is believed that this achieves the optimum level 
of gearing for the Group and keeps the Group’s quoted debt as
investment grade. This ratio will not be met consistently but
generates a medium term target level of net debt.
(d) Interest Rate Risk
The Group aims to have approximately 70% of forecast net debt
to 80% of target net debt as fixed interest rate liabilities. It aims
to achieve this ratio over the medium term and it is applied 
to each of the Group’s main currencies. The predictability of
interest costs is deemed to be more important than the possible
opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates.
Borrowings are made in either fixed or floating rates. Interest
rate swaps, cross currency swaps, caps and collars are used 
to help attain the Group’s target level of fixed interest rate debt. 
The maturity dates are spread in order to avoid interest rate
basis risk and also to negate short term changes in interest
rates. At the year end, fixed interest rate debt represented
approximately 90% of total net debt. 
(e) Counterparty Risk
The Group has a deposit limit for banks with long term credit
ratings of ‘AA’ or better, and a lower limit for single ‘A’ rated
banks. Institutions below this rating are not usually used for
deposits. The Group is also exposed to credit related losses on
financial instruments used for hedging purposes. The Group
does not expect any counterparties to be unable to meet their
obligations. Counterparties and their credit ratings are regularly
reviewed by Group Treasury.
Going Concern
The Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis
for the preparation of the accounts. This has been done since,
after considering relevant information, they have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future.

DMGT AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
AS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUSINESS, DMGT IS AIMING
TO SET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN ITS APPROACH TO
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY. OUR APPROACH IS BASED
ON ALLOWING LOCAL MANAGEMENT TO TAKE LOCAL
DECISIONS IN A LOCAL CONTEXT.
How DMGT manages Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
DMGT’s activities are diverse, with each of its businesses
providing important channels of communication and media focus
to different sections of society throughout the world.
The DMGT Board reviews its performance in this area through
the Risk Committee, with CSR risks discussed at its meetings.
Overall responsibility for CSR at Board level lies with the Finance
Director . The Board has adopted policies on equal opportunities,
whistleblowing, health and safety and the environment.
DMGT owes much of its success to the entrepreneurial ability 
of the management teams leading its six divisions. These
businesses have thrived by allowing local management to take
local decisions in a local context, whilst benefiting from the
global outlook and financial resources of the wider Group.
This approach has delivered benefits to a wide range of
stakeholders. The success of many of the Group’s businesses 
is inextricably linked with understanding and engaging with the
communities that they serve, and this allows them to identify
needs and to campaign effectively on the issues relevant to their
customer base. 
The report below provides more detail of divisional activities
focused around the following key stakeholder groups:
• our readers and listeners;
• the community;
• our employees;
• the environment.
Reported here is a summary of our disclosure in this area. 
DMGT has a dedicated section on its website with further CSR
information available at www.dmgt.co.uk. We welcome your
feedback. Please send any comments to:

Highlights of the year
➜ Entered the FTSE4Good Index
in September 2004.
➜ £902,000 donated to charity.
➜ Launched online payroll
giving scheme.  26 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
Charities involving the media and relevant to the communities
within which the Group operates are favoured. In the last year
Associated Newspapers launched an online Payroll Giving
scheme, working in partnership with Workplace Giving UK which
enables staff to make more tax efficient personal donations to
their preferred charities. In addition, recipient charities save the
administration costs of applying for Gift Aid on the donations.
A few examples of our involvement during the year are 
shown above.
DMGT and our Employees
DMGT Group is an equal opportunities employer . In addition to 
a Group policy, each division has its own policies and practices
across a range of employee issues. Training is taken seriously
across the Group. 
Staff communication
A variety of approaches to staff communications exist within the
Group, including the use of the intranet, regular communication
events, face-to-face communications with management, and
programmes related to specific key events such as major
changes in operations or equipment. 
Health and safety 
The Group's health and safety policy applies across DMGT. It sets
out to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees and
all others who could be affected by the activities of the Group.
Whilst the Chief Executive has overall responsibility at Board
level for health and safety matters throughout the Group, day to
day responsibility is devolved to the managing directors of each
division. The Group has had no fines or prosecutions for health
and safety failures over the last year . There are many examples
of good practice across the Group, in terms of health and safety
management systems, the use of independent consultants and
initiatives focused on business specific health and safety risk
areas. Health and safety is particularly critical in all printing
press facilities which have appropriate policies and management
and monitoring programmes. 
Hobsons and Raleigh International
Hobsons, part of the careers division
of DMG Information, continues 
to support the work of Raleigh
International. This year, six employees
travelled to Borneo for two weeks to
assist in building a school. Associated
Newspapers’ Classified Advertising
staff also raised over £20,000 for
Raleigh International.
Award winning newspapers
The Bristol Evening Post was named
Newspaper Society Campaigning
Newspaper of the Year for 2004. The
Nottingham Post won the Trading
Standards Institute newspaper award
in 2004 for its campaign to tackle
doorstep crime and rogue traders. 
Our Readers and Listeners
Editorial standards
There are a number of standard setting bodies that have
established codes to which DMGT's divisions adhere.
Compliance with these codes ensures that our published and
broadcast material reaches the editorial standards expected and
agreed by the industry and other stakeholders. The main code is
established and monitored by the Press Complaints Commission
for the Group's UK newspapers. Teletext works to the standards
set by the Independent Television Commission, OfCom, the
Broadcasting Standards Commission and Channel 4’s own
codes. DMG Radio complies with the Australian Broadcasting
Authority Codes of Conduct.
Responding to reader and listener needs
Within the established editorial framework, editors and
journalists have the freedom to operate as appropriate. The
media industry is highly competitive; therefore, remaining in
touch with and championing the interests of the diverse groups
who make up our communities is critical to DMGT's success.
Reader and listener satisfaction is monitored through a number
of mechanisms, such as timely responses to complaints, regular
in-house programming and sales research, readership surveys
and other processes to receive feedback from customers. 
Compliance with editorial standards is strictly monitored within
the divisions through various mechanisms which include
compliance committees, editorial responsibility, compliance
audits and training. 
DMGT and the Community
Community involvement is integral to our business as well as 
to the personal motivation of our employees. We donate money,
time and in-kind donations such as air time and Teletext pages,
as well as staff giving time to areas such as fundraising and
trusteeships. The use of our media channels and activities for
fundraising is driven through participation in the communities
we serve and the concerns and contributions of our readers 
and listeners. The Group is a member of the Per Cent Club and
donated £902,000 to charity in 2004. Charitable donations are
allocated by a Charities Committee at DMGT, as well as being
made on a smaller scale by divisional and local managements.
Environmental credentials
98% of virgin fibre products are

DMGT has a CSR section on its
website which provides information
about our community and
environmental activities.This is a
summary of our disclosure in this
area, with further information
reported below available at
www.dmgt.co.uk. 
DMGT and the Environment
The direct environmental impacts from most of our divisions are
relatively low. They arise mainly in our printing divisions. In the
FTSE4Good index, which DMGT entered in September, Media 
is ranked as low impact; printing and newspaper publishing is
ranked as medium impact; and as a ‘B’ in Morley’s sustainability
matrix (defined as business that has low impacts and some
benefits and may contribute to enabling a more sustainable future). 
Since our non-printing operations are primarily office-based,
their environmental impact is considered low. Our offices around
the world practise paper recycling and there are some schemes
in place for the recycling of plastic cups, toner cartridges, mobile
phones and IT equipment. 
Our report therefore focuses on how we manage the impacts
in the printing businesses. In addition, we acknowledge our
responsibility in ensuring that our paper supplies come from
paper manufacturers that manage their environmental impacts,
including the sustainable sourcing of virgin fibres. These two
elements are the focus of our environmental reporting.
In our printing operations, key environmental impacts are 
waste generation, particularly waste newsprint; energy use; 
ink use; Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions; and 
paper purchasing.
DMGT has two divisions which include printing operations,
Associated Newspapers, which owns the Group’s largest printing
works, Harmsworth Quays, and Northcliffe Newspapers, which
owns twelve printing centres around the UK and two printing
centres in Hungary. All printing centres have environmental
management practices. The use of energy, newsprint, ink 
and plates and waste disposal have cost implications for the
businesses and are, therefore, managed for reasons of good
business sense as well as to reduce our environmental impacts.
Waste newsprint and ink use is measured and reported to
divisional board meetings on a monthly basis. 85% of the
printing presses are Computer to Plate processes. The
environmental benefits of this system are improved efficiencies
in the use of ink, plates and paper and a reduction in the
chemicals used during photographic processes. 
Digital photography is used in an increasing number of the printing
centres. In addition the IT equipment at Northcliffe printing centres
is either collected and recycled if re-useable, or is collected and
disposed of by licensed waste management companies. 
Absolute energy consumption remained relatively consistent with
last year . Overall efficiency has improved, reflecting the good
practices in energy reduction efforts at a number of printing centres.
Targets for waste paper are set for each product printed. This
percentage varies according to certain criteria such as the
numbers of copies required and edition changes. Actual waste
volumes are compared against budgeted levels, with the results
provided for monthly review at the appropriate Board level.
Newsprint production waste efficiency remained relatively
consistent in relation to last year . The trend to increase numbers
of colour pages printed resulted in more waste production as 
a result of greater numbers of runs required to achieve the
appropriate print quality. This makes overall gains in newsprint
waste reductions difficult to achieve. 100% of the production
paper waste is recycled.
Improvements were made in water efficiency for the Group
during the year . Northcliffe saw the most significant reductions
this year (18% improvement over 2003) as a result of a
benchmarking study of water use which identified where
improvements could be achieved. Ink efficiency remained
relatively consistent with prior years.
Newsprint supply and the environment
DMGT is aware of the responsibility it has along the supply chain,
in particular for one of its largest purchases, newsprint. The Group
has a central Newsprint Committee and paper is purchased for all
the Group’s newspaper operations, allowing co-ordinated review of
the environmental credentials of paper suppliers and the sourcing
of their products. Where virgin fibres are used in the paper
manufacture, DMGT requires that the forests are certified either
by the Forest Stewardship Council, or the Pan European Forestry
Commission, both of which run schemes that provide credible
guarantees that the product comes from well managed forests.
DMGT sources its paper from European mills, most of which
hold the environmental management standard ISO14001. 
98% of virgin fibre products are sourced from managed forests.
Free exhibition space
dmg world media provides free space
at many exhibitions to charitable
and/or non-profit organisations
including Breakthrough Breast
Cancer, the Uphill Ski Club and the
Nature Conservancy Council. 
Recycling
100% of production paper waste 
is recycled. Our offices around the
world practise paper recycling and
there are some schemes in place 
for the recycling of plastic cups,
toner cartridges, mobile phones 
and IT equipment.

The Directors present their Report and Accounts for the year
ended 3rd October, 2004.
Trading Results and Dividends
The profit after taxation of the Group amounted to £67.4 million.
After charging minority interests of £5.7 million, the Group profit
for the year amounted to £61.7 million.
An interim dividend of 3.45 pence per share was paid on the Ordinary
and ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares and the Directors recommend
that a final dividend of 7.55 pence per share be paid on 11th February,
2005 making 11.0 pence per share for the year (2003 10.0 pence).
Activities
The principal activities of the Group are set out in the ‘Group at a
Glance’ section at the front of the Annual Report.
The analysis of turnover and operating profit for the years ended
3rd October, 2004 and 28th September, 2003 are included as Notes
1 and 2 to the Profit and Loss Account. A review of the development
of the business of the Group during the year, of its position at the
end of the year and of likely future developments in its business
is given in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 10 to 24.
Directors
Biographical details of the Directors of the Company at 1st
December, 2004 are set out on page 28. The Directors remained
unchanged throughout the year, with the exception of Messrs
Gillespie and Verey who were appointed to the Board on 4th
February, 2004 and the retirement of Sir Patrick Sergeant and Mr
Hakkarainen on the same day. On 1st December, 2004, Professor
Schwab, a non-executive Director since 1998, stood down 
from the Board, having decided not to seek re-election. On 1st
December, 2004, Mr Beatty was appointed an executive Director .
The number of shares of the Company and of securities of other
Group companies, in which the Directors or their families had an
interest at the year end, are stated in the Remuneration Report 
on page 42.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Viscount
Rothermere, Messrs Hemingway, Williams, Dacre and Dunstone
retire by rotation at the Annual General meeting on 9th February,
2005. In accordance with the Companies Act, Mr Gray, who has
reached the age of 70 years, is also required to stand for re-election
at the Annual General Meeting. Ordinary shareholders will be
asked to confirm the appointment of Mr Beatty.
Each of the Directors being eligible, offers himself for 
re-election with special notice having been given that Mr
Hemingway, who is over 70 years of age, and Mr Gray who is 
70 years of age, will be proposed, given their continuing relevant
experience and helpful contribution to the Board. 
Post Balance Sheet Events
On 4th October, 2004, the Company signed £300 million of new 
five-year committed banking facilities. These will replace existing
facilities which were due to mature in the near future, thereby
extending the maturity of the Group’s debt. 
Tangible Fixed Assets and Investments
Changes in tangible fixed assets and investments (other than
associates and joint ventures) during the year are set out in
Notes 20, 23 and 24 to the balance sheets.
Share Capital
Details of allotments in share capital during the year, which
arose solely from the exercise of options, are given in Note 32.
Employees
Under the Group’s general policy of decentralised management,
it is the responsibility of the management in each subsidiary to
encourage the involvement and participation of employees in
their company. The methods used depend on the wide variety 
of the companies, but the linking to performance targets of a
significant portion of remuneration is one widely used means.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to suitable applications
from disabled persons for employment. If existing employees
become disabled they will continue to be employed, wherever
practicable, in the same job or, if this is not practicable, every
effort will be made to find suitable alternative employment and
to provide appropriate training.
Policy on Payment of Suppliers
The Group’s policy on supplier payments varies across its
subsidiaries. These companies have no formal code or standard
which deals specifically with the payment of suppliers. However,
their policy is to ensure that the terms of payment, as specified
by, and agreed with the supplier at the outset, are not exceeded.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year end date.
The Group’s average payment period, calculated on the basis of
year end trade creditors, is 57 days (2003 56 days), although 
this is dependent on the year end date and cannot therefore 
be regarded as meaningful.
Donations
Charitable donations made by the Group in the year amounted 
to £902,000 (2003 £548,000). No political donations were made 
by the Group.
Substantial Shareholdings
As set out in Note 32, the Company has two classes of share
capital – Ordinary shares and ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares. 
On 1st December, 2004 the following were interested in more
than 3% of the issued Ordinary shares:
Rothermere Continuation Limited
(and other parties to an agreement which 
comes within section 204 of the Companies Act 1985) 63.1%
Codan Trust Company Ltd and Codan Trustees (BVI) Ltd 
(trustees of the Esmond Harmsworth 1998 Family Settlement) 29.3%
Auditors
The Company’s auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have indicated
their willingness to continue in office and, in accordance with
section 385 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing
their reappointment will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on 
9th February, 2005 at 9.00 a.m. at the Kensington Roof Gardens,
99 Kensington High Street, London W8. Details of all resolutions
to be put as special business are set out in the enclosed circular
to shareholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Messrs Hemingway, Gray, and Gillespie are not regarded by the
Board as independent in terms of the Code because they have
advised the Company over many years; nor is Mr Park due to 
his recent Group responsibilities. The Board believes that these 
non-executive Directors have invaluable experience of the
Company, its business and its staff. The Board has not, as
required by the Code, identified a senior independent non-
executive Director since it believes that to identify such an
individual is potentially divisive to a unitary body, as the Board 
is, and disruptive to the role of the Chairman.
The Company’s Articles of Association require all Directors to
submit themselves for the re-election at least once every three
years. The Articles require that a Director appointed by the Board
must stand for election at the next Annual General Meeting. Under
the Companies Act, a Director is also required to stand for re-election
when he first reaches the age of 70. The Board has chosen not to
adopt the additional provision in the Revised Code that non-executive
Directors who have served for more than nine years should be
subject to annual re-election since the existing practice, which
complies with Company law and with the Articles, works well. 
The Board meets at least on a quarterly basis and at such other
times as are necessary. There is a schedule of matters reserved
to the Board which is published on the Corporate Governance
section of the Company’s web site at www.dmgt.co.uk.
In October, 2004, the Board reviewed its performance and 
agreed to establish an internal procedure to enable a formal and
rigorous evaluation of its individual Directors to be carried out
and reported upon in next year’s Annual Report. The Board also
reviewed the schedule of matters reserved for it.
Procedures are established to ensure that the Board receives
timely and appropriate information both for its meetings and
regularly between meetings.
The Board has established Nominations, Remuneration, 
Audit and Risk Committees with mandates to deal with specific
aspects of its business. The remits of these committees are 
also published on the Corporate Governance section of the
Company’s web site. Details of the membership of these
committees are given on page 28. Each committee reports to 
the Board at every regular meeting. In October, 2004, the Board
carried out a review of the performance of its committees and
concluded that they had been effective in the year . 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary and are offered such training as is considered
necessary, both on appointment and at any subsequent time.
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense, if necessary.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee, which was established as a
separate committee in May 2003, met three times during the
year and all meetings were attended by all serving Directors. 
The members of the Committee are the Viscount Rothermere, 
its chairman, Mr Hemingway and Mr Balsemão. Mr Balsemão 
was appointed in November 2003, replacing Mr Gray and 
Mr Hakkarainen. The Deputy Finance Director, Mr Perry, acts 
as secretary to the Committee.
During the year the Committee nominated Mr Gillespie and 
Mr Verey as non-executive Directors. These Directors and others
were identified as suitable candidates, and neither external
advice nor advertising was required in these instances.
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. This statement describes how the Board has applied
the principles of good governance set out in the Combined Code
(‘the Code’) issued by the Hampel Committee on Corporate
Governance. The Code is part of the listing rules of the Financial
Services Authority. It applied to the Company throughout the year .
In July 2003, the Financial Reporting Council revised the Code
(the Revised Code). The Revised Code is not applicable to 
the Company in the year under review, but the Company has
continued the process of further formalising its procedures to
enable the Board to report, as required, under it in the year
beginning 4th October, 2004.
The paragraphs below and in the Remuneration Report on pages
33 to 44 set out how the Company has applied the principles laid
down by the Code. They also explain procedural changes that
have been made in response to the Revised Code. The Company
has substantially complied with the provisions of the Code,
except where stated below or in the Remuneration Report.
The Board
The membership of the Board and individual attendance by
Directors in the 2003/04 financial year is set out below:

meetings held meetings attended

The Board met five times during the year, four of which were
regular meetings. Five Directors were unable to attend a special
meeting, held at short notice in June.
Following the changes made on 1st December, 2004, the Board
comprises seven executive Directors, including the Chairman
and Chief Executive, and eight non-executive Directors. 
The Board believes that four non-executive Directors may be
considered to be independent in the sense used in the Code,
namely Messrs Lowy, Dunstone, Balsemão and Verey. This
represents half of the non-executive Directors, rather than a
majority as recommended by the Code. Although Mr Lowy has
been a non-executive Director for longer than nine years, he 
has continued to demonstrate his independence in terms of
character and judgement.  31 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Continued
The Committee continues to review succession planning for both
executive and non-executive Directors. It has also assessed the
most appropriate method of evaluating Directors’ performance. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains a regular programme of contact with 
its institutional shareholders. In the past year, this has included
meetings in London, Scotland, Ireland, Continental Europe and
the U.S. Partly to assist private shareholders, the Company posts
all announcements and general presentations given to analysts
and institutions on its corporate web site at www.dmgt.co.uk.
Shareholders and others interested in the Group are encouraged
to use the site and to email questions which they might have.
Questions to particular Directors should be addressed through
the Company Secretary.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Annual General
Meeting, of which twenty working days’ notice is given.
Internal controls and management of risk
The Group adopts a prudent risk strategy, weighing opportunities
for potential gain against threats to overall business objectives
and profitability. Senior management addresses the opportunities
and uncertainties relating to the business activities of the Group.
The risk management process consists of the identification,
evaluation and control of risks, which could threaten the
achievement of the Group’s strategic, operational and financial
objectives, as well as the active management of opportunities.
The Group operates on a divisional basis with each of the divisions
described at the front of the Annual Report having considerable
autonomy as regards its operation and establishment of 
control systems. Overseeing the divisional structure is a central
management responsible to the Board. Certain functions are
undertaken centrally, notably newsprint buying, insurance,
treasury, tax and pensions.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control. This system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance of the safeguarding of assets 
and shareholders’ investment and the reliability of financial
information. Any such system can, however, provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance of these matters. 
The Directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness
of the Group’s system of internal control for the period up to 
the date of the approval of the Accounts.
The Board has delegated responsibility for the evaluation of the
benefits and risks of investment opportunities and financing
proposals to an executive committee, the Finance Committee.
Above certain defined levels, however, the Board must approve
programmes relating to acquisition and divestment proposals
and capital expenditure. In 2000, the Board established a process
for the management of significant risks across the Group by
means of a Risk Committee which accords with the guidance
provided by the Code.
Risk Committee
Whilst the ultimate responsibility for the system of internal
control and the review of its effectiveness resides with the Board,
the Risk Committee assists the Board by giving assurance on
risk management issues and processes. The Risk Committee is
chaired by Mr Sinclair, the Chief Executive. Its other members
are the Viscount Rothermere, Messrs Williams, Gray and Dutton
and the legal director of the Group’s largest subsidiary. Mr Gray
provides a non-executive perspective to the review of risk
management processes within the Group, as well as providing a
direct link to the Audit Committee. The Group’s Risk Manager,
Mr Brett, acts as secretary to the Committee. It met three times
during the year under review. 
The Risk Committee considers reports prepared by central
management, by each of the divisions of the Group and by
central functions, on a half-yearly basis. These reports identify
business risks for the Group as a whole and within the divisions
and assess the controls in place to manage those risks. The
Committee operates a rotational programme of presentations 
by the divisions on specific risk management issues, as well as
identifying topics for consideration across the Group. An example
of this is Corporate Social Responsibility on which a report was
given in September .
Members of the Risk Committee also maintain direct links with
each of the main divisions through attendance at divisional board
meetings. The Committee reports to the Board at each of its
meetings on the results of these processes to enable the Board to
determine the overall effectiveness of the system of internal control.
In the last year, the specific risk items addressed by the Risk
Committee, which are common to all subsidiaries, were the
Control of Asbestos Regulations 2002, Disability Discrimination
Act 1995, health and safety risks relating to the use of mobile
phones and business continuity. Other risks were also addressed
by the Committee on an individual divisional basis, such as
computer security.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which has been in existence since 
1989, comprises four non-executive directors: Messrs Gray (its
chairman), Hemingway, Park and Verey. Mr Verey joined the
Committee in February. In September Mr Dunstone resigned
from the Committee due to his external commitments so 
that only Mr Verey is considered to be independent in the sense
used by the Code. Nevertheless the Board believes that the
Committee operates independently. Members’ qualifications are
set out in their biographies on page 28. The Board is satisfied
that Mr Gray, formerly senior partner of a firm of chartered
accountants, has recent and relevant financial experience. The
Company Secretary, Mr Jennings, is secretary to the Committee. 
The Audit Committee met four times during the year and all
meetings were attended by all serving Directors, except that 
Mr Dunstone was unable to attend two of them.
Last year, the Committee reported that it had made a number 
of procedural changes in response to the Smith Guidance to 
the revised Combined Code and had devised a policy on 
whistle blowing. Procedures were established to monitor the
independence of the external auditors. This has been extended to
include a policy on employment of former audit principals. There
is also a policy on the provision of non-audit services with which
the Group’s head office and each division complies. The choice of
firm is normally determined on the basis of professional expertise
and competitiveness. The Group may engage the external auditors
to perform audit-related work, accountancy advice and corporate
tax services. Non-audit services in other areas are decided on
their merits and are put out to tender where the amounts in
question are significant. The external auditors are excluded from
the following areas: where they are auditing their own work; where
a mutuality of interest is created; or where the external auditor
would be put in the role of advocate for the Company. 
Non-audit fees payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP (‘Deloitte’) in
2004 amounted to £3.3 million, compared to £1.0 million the
previous year . The Audit Committee regards this as an unusually
  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Continued
high level due to the extent of corporate tax advice given and
Deloitte’s involvement in the examination of the potential
acquisition of certain assets of Hollinger International. Since
Deloitte’s appointment in 2001, non-audit fees have been on
average lower than audit fees. Excluding the 2004 audit and non-
audit fees, the average as a percentage of audit fees is 58%.
In September, the Audit Committee carried out an annual review
of its terms of reference and of its effectiveness and concluded
that it did not need to recommend to the Board any changes to
its remit or operations. In October, 2004, the Board conducted 
its own review of the Committee’s performance and agreed that
the Committee had been effective in the year under review.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has responsibility
for the review of financial risk management and of internal
financial controls during the year, as these directly relate to the
quality of financial reporting. In addition, the Committee reviews
a summary of letters to management prepared by the Group’s
external auditors following their audit procedures, considers
significant financial reporting issues and approves any changes
to Group accounting policies, which are set centrally. During the
year, the Committee received reports from the Group Accountant
on the progress being made to enable the Group to implement
international accounting standards in the year beginning 3rd
October, 2005. Apart from these specific responsibilities, the
Committee is mandated to review all announcements of results
issued by the Group and to consider the appointment of external
auditors and to review their remuneration.
Last year the Committee reported that a central internal audit
function was being established to co-ordinate the internal audit
activities carried out across the Group. In November 2003 a Group
Internal Audit Manager was appointed, who joined the Company
in January, to perform the functions set out in the Smith
Guidance, building on the Company’s existing control and risk
management process. In May, an internal audit charter and an
internal audit plan were approved by the Committee. The charter
covers the purposes and objectives of the Group’s internal audit
function, its authority and scope; independence issues; standards
of professional practice and performance monitoring; planning
and reporting; and the expectations of divisional management.
Following each review, a formal report will be issued to divisional
management with the audit findings and, where appropriate,
management’s response. At each Audit Committee meeting, 
the Internal Audit Manager reports on the internal audit activity
completed, including an overview of the work done, a summary 
of the control assessments and any major issues or findings.
The Group does not maintain common detailed accounting or
operations manuals because of the diverse operations carried
out by its divisions. Where applicable, divisions maintain their
own manuals. A number of the divisions also undertake regular
control review work as part of their control process.
As a consequence of the Group’s risk management process,
the Board has taken the view that control processes in place

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE PREPARATION OF ACCOUNTS
The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare
accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at the
end of the financial year and of the profit or loss, total recognised
gains and losses and cash flows of the Group for that period.
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have
been used and applied consistently, and that reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates have been made in the
preparation of the Accounts for the year ended 3rd October,
2004. The Directors also confirm that applicable accounting
standards have been followed and that it is appropriate that 
the Accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records, for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and of the Group and for taking reasonable
steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
On behalf of the Board
N D Jennings, FCA
Secretary
1st December, 2004
  REMUNERATION REPORT
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve
the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the
Company at which the approval will be sought for the adoption of
the Accounts. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee, which was established in 1992, 
is responsible inter alia for overall Group remuneration policy
and for setting the remuneration, benefits and terms and
conditions of employment of the Company’s executive Directors.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were revised by the
Board in October, 2004, are available on the Company’s website.
The members of the Committee are the Viscount Rothermere, 
its chairman, Mr Gray and Mr Park. Mr Park was appointed in
November 2003, replacing Mr Hakkarainen and Mr Hemingway.
The Combined Code recommends that a remuneration
committee should be composed entirely of independent non-
executive directors. The Board considers it wholly appropriate
that the Viscount Rothermere, as Chairman of the Board and 
as the Company’s largest shareholder, is a member of the
Committee. He does not participate in discussions regarding 
his own remuneration. While Mr Gray and Mr Park are not
considered by the Board to be independent as defined by 
the Revised Code, the Board does consider them to act
independently as regards remuneration issues. The Committee
met six times during the year and all meetings were attended by
all serving Directors, except that Mr Park was unable to attend
one brief meeting held at short notice.
The Committee seeks the recommendations of the Chief
Executive, who usually attends meetings of the Committee 
by invitation other than when his own remuneration is being
discussed, as regards the remuneration of the other executive
Directors and of the divisional managing directors. It also seeks
input from the Finance Director regarding financial performance
and other issues and who also acts as secretary to the
Committee. Other executives who attended meetings during 
the year were the Company Secretary, who presented proposed
changes to the DMGT 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme, 
and the Pensions director who explained forthcoming changes to
UK pensions legislation.
The Committee makes reference, where appropriate, to pay and
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when
determining annual salary increases, and to external evidence 
of remuneration levels in other companies, particularly in the
media field. It also makes reference to advice sought from
external advisors. During the year such advice was received from
Watson Wyatt, Deloitte & Touche LLP (‘Deloitte’), Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer (‘Freshfields’) and Independent
Remuneration Solutions (‘IRS’). Watson Wyatt provided advice on
Directors’ and senior executive pensions, advised the Company
and its pension funds on pension issues and provided services
on actuarial and investment matters and on overseas benefits.
Deloitte, who are the Company’s auditors and also provided
other services, as set out on page 31, were appointed by
management to advise on non-executive Directors’ fees.
Freshfields, who also provided other legal services, advised 
on contracts. IRS provided market data and gave advice on 
best practice. Watson Wyatt, Freshfields and IRS were appointed
by the Committee.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee seeks to structure remuneration packages on 
an individual basis appropriate to the level of responsibility, but
generally designed to retain and motivate the individual. 
The Chairman is also the largest shareholder in the Company.
He has been and will continue to be a long term shareholder . 
His shareholding provides an alignment with long term
shareholders that is not always the case in other companies. 
In setting his remuneration the Committee has adopted the
same policy as for other executive Directors. In the case of 
Mr Fallon, the Committee considers that his remuneration 
as executive chairman of Euromoney Institutional Investor plc
(‘Euromoney’), a separately listed company, should be set by 
the remuneration committee of that company. The report on 
this is set out in Euromoney’s Annual Report.
The Committee also sets the remuneration packages for the
managing directors of the Company’s operating divisions and
oversees the bonus arrangements established in each division.
These are designed individually to reflect the targets and
objectives of each division. 
The Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy
needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of commercial
demands, changing market practice and shareholder
expectations. Consequently the policy will apply for 2005, 
but may require to be amended. Investors will be consulted 
about any key issues that arise and Ordinary shareholders will 
be provided with the opportunity to endorse the Company’s
remuneration policy on a regular basis through the annual 
vote on the Remuneration Report. Any new long term incentive
schemes for the executive Directors would be submitted 
to shareholders.
Remuneration Components
A significant proportion of the remuneration is performance-
related. In 2004, excluding pension entitlements, the target
composition of each executive Director’s remuneration is shown
in the table on page 34. In preparing this table the target figure
shown for bonus is 30% of salary, which represents the average
payout of the last five years; the LTIP maximum award of 200%
salary is averaged over five years and the maximum option
award of four times annual earnings is averaged over ten years.
Mr Dutton does not have a bonus plan and has a maximum 
LTIP award of 150% of salary.

The main components of the remuneration package for executive
Directors are:
(i) basic salary, reviewed annually;
(ii) where appropriate, annual performance related bonus. The
Viscount Rothermere, Mr Sinclair and Mr Williams are members
of the DMGT Executive Bonus Scheme (‘the Scheme’). The
Scheme, introduced in 1993 and renewed in February, 2003, is
intended to reward executives for excellent growth in earnings
per share by the Group. Earnings per share each year are
compared with the equivalent figure three years earlier indexed
up by reference to the Retail Price Index. A bonus, calculated as
a percentage of salary, is paid for growth in real terms with a
higher percentage for higher growth. The maximum bonus which
can be earned is 60% of salary for which real growth in earnings
per share of 33% over the three years must be achieved. In
addition, earnings per share have to increase over the previous
year; if they do not, the earned bonus is frozen until there is an
increase. The bonus is paid, net of the amount required to meet
the related PAYE and employee national insurance liability, in 
a combination of cash and ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares of
DMGT, which must be retained for three years. Participants are
asked to specify the proportion of the after-tax bonus which is to
be applied in the form of shares which must be at least 50%. For
other executive Directors, bonuses are paid at the discretion of
the Remuneration Committee to reward individual performance;
(iii) share options, designed to provide a long term incentive
which aligns their interests to those of shareholders. Share
option awards are modest in size. The maximum of all awards
for any individual over a ten year period is limited to four times
his annual earnings. Options are granted in phased blocks over a
number of years. Each award of options has a maximum life of
ten years. Awards do not normally vest until three years after the
award and two performance conditions have been met. The first
condition is that, in respect of four out of six consecutive monthly
calculation dates (which start in the thirtieth month following the
date of grant of a particular option), the total shareholder return
(‘TSR’) of the Company must exceed that of the FTSE 100 index.
Secondly, there must be real growth in earnings per share 
(‘eps’) over a period of three consecutive financial years. The
Committee believes this approach helps to retain and motivate
executives, particularly when an option is in the money, but the
performance conditions have not yet been met. It is extremely
rare for FTSE 100 companies to have a double test so this makes
DMGT’s criteria more difficult to achieve than for other
companies. In addition the award sizes are relatively modest
compared to some other companies. Ordinary shareholders
approved this approach in 1997. The Committee firmly believes
that, in this context, retesting is appropriate; and
(iv) where appropriate, a long term incentive plan (LTIP). 
Under this scheme, established in 2001, executives are invited 
to commit shares in the Company at a market price equal to a
maximum of twice the value of their basic annual salary. If they
hold those shares for five years, they will be eligible to receive
matching shares on a sliding scale up to 200% of the value of the
shares held, dependent on the total shareholder return of the
Company compared with a peer group. The peer group which
operates was chosen to reflect a range of listed companies in
the businesses and locations principally occupied by DMGT. 
Awards under the LTIP are subject to stringent performance
conditions, which will determine whether, and to what extent,
shares under awards will vest. The performance conditions
relate to the TSR of the Company initially over a five-year period
against a peer group of UK and overseas companies determined
by the Committee. TSR is the aggregate of share price growth
and dividends paid (assuming that such dividends are reinvested
in shares during the five year period), and is commonly adopted
as a measure of comparative performance.
This comparator peer group is as follows:
Emap plc
Independent News and Media plc
Pearson plc
Reed Elsevier plc
SMG plc
The News Corporation Ltd
The Thomson Corporation plc
Trinity Mirror plc
United Business Media plc
Gannet Co.inc.

Pensions
The Group operates a two-tier defined benefit pension scheme
for senior employees (including most of the Company’s executive
Directors), details of which are given on page 41. One of the
Company’s executive Directors is subject to the Inland Revenue
pensionable earnings’ cap and a funded unapproved retirement
benefits scheme has been put in place for him on the same
terms as for other capped senior executives. The assets of this
Scheme are held independently from the Group’s finances and
are administered by Trustees. It is the Company’s policy that
annual bonuses, payments under the Executive Bonus Scheme
and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The current arrangements have been successful in helping to
retain and reward long serving executives. The Committee has
reviewed in detail the impact of the proposed new pensions
regime from 6th April, 2006, which will be significant, and is
developing a new policy designed to maintain the benefits to the
Company as far as is possible, taking account of the potential
additional costs involved.
Non-Executive Directorships
The Company allows its executive Directors to take a very limited
number of outside directorships. Individuals retain the payments
received from such services since these appointments are not
expected to impinge on their principal employment. This does
not apply where a Group executive serves as a non-executive
director of a company because the Group has a significant
interest, as in the case of GWR Group plc. In this case, all 
fees are paid to the Company. The revised Combined Code
recommends that executives should normally hold only one 
non-executive directorship. Mr Sinclair previously held two, 
but stood down as a director of Schroders plc in April.
Service Contracts
Contracts of service are negotiated on an individual basis as part
of the overall remuneration package and their length is inevitably
conditioned by external competitive pressures. For this reason,
the contracts of some of the executive Directors exceed the 
one year recommended in the Combined Code. The Committee
believes that the length of contract should be appropriate to the
individual. Thus where DMGT employs individuals with unique
talents within the areas of business within which it operates, 
the Committee believes that they should have longer contracts.
The Chairman and Mr Dutton have contracts of up to one year 
in duration. Mr Sinclair and Mr Williams have agreed to reduce
their contract length from two years to one year over a four-
year period. Mr Dacre has a rolling two-year contract which 
the Committee considers wholly appropriate for his particular
responsibilities and for the industry in which he works. 
The Committee differentiates between what might be termed
“corporate executives” and “media executives” whom it wishes to
tie in to the Group and to prevent from working for competitors.
Mr Dacre is a media executive, whereas Messrs Sinclair and
Williams are corporate executives, operating in a market where
one year contracts are increasingly the norm. Mr Fallon also has
a rolling two-year contract; as explained on page 33, this is a
matter for the Euromoney remuneration committee.
35 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
At the end of the five-year performance period, participants 
may elect either to realise their awards at that time or to extend
the performance period to seven years. If they elect to extend 
the performance period, the level of committed shares must 
be maintained throughout the extended period. At the end of 
the seven-year performance period, the Company’s TSR
performance will be measured. The awards will be realisable
after the performance period to the extent of the percentage in
the right-hand column below according to the Company’s place
in the list of comparator companies as indicated in the left-hand

Share Ownership Guidelines
The Company encourages Directors to own shares in the Company.
In total the Directors own 23% of the Company (excluding
treasury shares; see page 42 for details of individual holdings).
Executive Directors have a target shareholding of 1.5 times their
salary, to be built up over a suitable period. The design of the
LTIP encourages executive Directors to achieve this goal which
aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The shares held
and valued at 3rd October, 2004 as a multiple of salary were:

* The notice periods of Messrs Sinclair and Williams will reduce

year as of 1st October, 2006.
In the event of earlier termination of their contracts, each Director
is entitled to compensation equal to their basic salary, benefits,
pension entitlement and, as appropriate, bonus or profit share 
for their notice period. In the case of Mr Sinclair, the pension
entitlement is for a two-year period, regardless of his notice period.
The contracts of Mr Sinclair and Mr Williams include mitigation
arrangements in the event of the Director obtaining alternative
employment during the notice period. This mitigation does not
apply to their pension benefit, given their uncapped status that
cannot be replicated elsewhere. Share options would be treated
as for any member of the scheme, depending on the reason for
termination of the contract. Mr Sinclair is entitled, on a change
of control of the Company, to give notice under his contract
within sixty days of the change of control, and to receive
compensation for basic salary and benefits for a two-year period.  
Mr Fallon has a second service contract with Euromoney
Publications (Jersey) Limited (‘EP J’), a subsidiary of Euromoney
dated 4th May, 1993. This contract has the same terms as his
first contract, except that termination does not include a car
allowance as Mr Fallon does not receive this benefit from EP J. 
Non-executive Directors are appointed for specified terms and
are subject to re-election by the Ordinary shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting following appointment, and thereafter 
at least every three years. Each appointment can be terminated
before the end of the three-year period, with no notice or fees
due. The dates of the appointment or subsequent re-appointment

Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The remuneration of non-executive Directors is determined 
by the Board. Fees payable are reviewed annually, including a
comparison with the level of fees paid by other companies of
similar size and complexity; these fees are shown in the table
below. A recommendation to the Board on this subject is then
made. The basic fee as a Director was raised to £24,000 per
annum on 1st January, 2003 and an increase to £25,000 per
annum has been made with effect from 1st October, 2004.
In addition, fees are paid for membership of Board committees.
These have been reviewed and changes were introduced with
effect from 1st January, 2004 to reflect the differing workloads
and responsibilities of the committees. Committee fees range
from £4,000 per annum to £12,500 per annum. In addition the
Audit Committee chairman receives a fee of £25,000 per annum.
No increase is being made for the year to 2nd October, 2005.

Daily Mail and General Trust Long Term Incentive Plan
The Daily Mail and General Trust Long Term Incentive Plan 
(the LTIP) is designed to align the interests of participants and
shareholders by requiring participants to make a substantial
investment in the Company as a condition to participating in the
LTIP. Further, the LTIP will only provide rewards for participants
if the Company achieves exceptional returns for shareholders;
this is achieved by calibrating participants’ rewards by 
reference to the Company’s performance against a peer group 
of comparable media companies.The LTIP is supervised by the
Committee and is operated in conjunction with an employee
discretionary trust (the ‘Trust’). The Trust will acquire ‘A’ Ordinary
Non-Voting Shares in the Company (‘shares’) to satisfy awards
under the LTIP. The Committee intends to operate the 
LTIP annually.
Prospective participants are invited by the Committee to agree 
to commit shares to the LTIP. Usually invitations are made in
tranches over a period of two to four years, and individuals are
given six months to make commitments in order to allow for
them to make purchases of shares, where appropriate. Once 
an individual has agreed to commit shares which are owned by
him or by his close family, the Trustee of the Trust (‘the Trustee’)
decides whether to make an award of an equal number of
shares to those committed.
Awards under the LTIP have been made to five executive
directors. In 2001, Messrs Sinclair, Williams and Dacre were
invited to commit shares in two equal annual tranches in the
case of Messrs Sinclair and Dacre, and in three equal annual
tranches in the case of Mr Williams. In 2002, Mr Dutton was
invited to commit shares in three tranches and the Viscount
Rothermere was invited to commit shares in four tranches. 
In June 2004, each Director was invited to commit further 
shares so as to include an allowance for increases in their 
salary since the original grants. Having received agreements 
to commit shares, the Trustee made the awards set out in 
the table below:

The awards made to Messrs Sinclair, Williams and Dacre, prior
to 2004, were made at the market price at the date of the initial
invitation in 2001. All other awards have been made at the
market price at the date of each invitation. The invitations 
to Messrs. Sinclair, Williams and Dacre in 2004 included an
amount of shares designed to remove this inconsistency. 
On 14th October, 2004, Mr Dacre was awarded 32,974 shares at 
£7.035, increasing his committed shares to 218,574; the initial
performance period on this further award ends on 31st
December, 2008.

The graphs on page 39 compare the DMGT total shareholder
return with that of the FTSE 100 index and of the media 
index over a period of five years, as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. As a constituent of 
both indices, the Directors regard them as the most appropriate
indices for purposes of comparison of the Group’s performance.
Additional graphs on that page illustrate performance over 
an eighteen year period for which data is available.
The graphs on pages 39 and 40 are unaudited.

Notes to Directors’ Pension Entitlements
(i) The DMGT Senior Executives Pension Fund, of which four
executive Directors are members, does not currently require 
a contribution from its members. The normal retirement age
under the Fund for this group is sixty. For each Director, the
accrued entitlement at 3rd October, 2004 represents the annual
pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement,
given the length of service and salary of each Director at this
date. A spouse’s/dependant’s pension equal to two thirds of the
Director’s pension is incorporated and the Director can elect 
to receive the pension from age fifty, subject to a discount if
retirement takes place before sixty. The pension, when in
payment, will receive annual increases in line with inflation,
which may be limited when inflation exceeds 5% per annum. 
(ii) All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of
actuarial advice in accordance with ‘Retirement Benefit Schemes
– Transfer Values (GN11)’ published by the Institute of Actuaries
and the Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer values of the accrued
entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension
scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on
transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the Directors’
pension benefits. They do not represent a sum paid or payable to
individual Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully
to annual remuneration.
41 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
(iii) The Viscount Rothermere is subject to the Inland Revenue
pensionable earnings cap. To mitigate the impact of this pension
restriction, the Company has formulated a policy under which
assets are being held under trust and invested in a funded
unapproved retirement benefits scheme. During the year,
£89,750 (2003 £84,700) was paid into this trust on his behalf.
(iv) Mr Fallon waived profit share in respect of the current year
and of future years of £538,800 (2003 £138,800). This waived
profit share was paid into a pension scheme on Mr Fallon’s
behalf. His pension benefit in the above table relates to a
deferred pension in the Mail Newspapers Pension Scheme 
for pensionable service between 1st April, 1978 and 1st April,
1986. Neither the Group nor Mr Fallon continues to make any
contributions to this scheme.
(v) The Company does not make any pension contributions on
behalf of Mr Dutton.

  REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of 
Daily Mail and General Trust plc
We have audited the financial statements of Daily Mail and
General Trust plc for the year ended 3rd October, 2004 which
comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the
cash flow statement, the statement of total recognised gains
and losses, reconciliation of movement in Group shareholders’
funds, the accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 42.
These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the part of the Remuneration Report that is
described as being audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the Company’s Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also
responsible for the preparation of the other information
contained in the Annual Report including the Remuneration
Report. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and
the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been
audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and
regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having
been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985. We also report if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company and
other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information
contained in the Annual Report for the above year as described
in the contents section including the unaudited part of the
Directors’ remuneration report and consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having
been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation
of the financial statements and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company
and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report described as having been audited are free

  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Accounting
The accounts have been prepared:
(a) under the historical cost convention modified to include the
revaluation of certain assets; 
(b) in accordance with Section 227 of, and Schedule 4 to, the
Companies Act 1985; and 
(c) in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the
United Kingdom.
Basis of Consolidation
(a) The Group accounts comprise a consolidation of the accounts
of the Company and of all its subsidiaries, together with the
Group’s share of its interest in its joint ventures and associates.
All major Group undertakings present accounts up to a date
within seven days of 30th. Results of subsidiaries acquired or
disposed of during the year are incorporated from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the date of their disposal.
The net assets of subsidiaries acquired are recorded at their fair
values, reflecting their condition at that date, which gives rise to
purchased goodwill.
Changes in Presentation of Financial Information 
The Group has changed its accounting policy to reclassify the
Group’s investment in its own shares within shareholders funds
in accordance with UITF Abstract 38. As a consequence, provision
is no longer made for the cost of shares formerly purchased to
match options, granted under the Company’s 1997 Executive
Share Option Scheme, in excess of the option exercise price.
As a result of these changes, the prior year primary statements
and shareholders’ funds have been restated to show the
Company’s own shares of £27.5 million as a negative reserve,
offset by a prior year adjustment to release the provision held
and hence to increase revenue reserves by £2.5 million at 28th
September, 2003. Group operating profit for the prior year has
also been restated, being increased by £0.4 million. The sale of
these shares in August resulted in a loss of £3.8 million being
taken through shareholders’ funds, of which £2.5 million had
been charged against operating profits under the previous policy.
Furthermore, the Group’s policy in respect of revenue recognition
has been amended to reflect the publication in November 2003 of
Application Note G to FRS 5 so that the earnings of exhibitions
straddling the year end are recognised over the life of the event,
where appropriate, and advertising revenues from the business 
to business careers division’s web sites are spread over the term
of contract. The effect of this change is that the prior year Group
balance sheet has been restated so as to increase net assets by
£0.2 million. This change is one of timing only and has no impact
on the results of the prior year .
Other than these changes of policy, the accounts have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted 
last year . The Group continues to comply with the transitional
arrangements for the implementation of FRS 17, Retirement
Benefits and, as permitted, to prepare its accounts under SSAP
24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
(a) Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions,
prior to the adoption of FRS 10 on 28th September, 1998, 
was written off against reserves in the year of acquisition. 
On disposal or closure of businesses, goodwill previously written
off against reserves is taken through the profit and loss account
in arriving at the gain or loss on disposal.
(b) Goodwill arising on consolidation, in respect of acquisitions
made since 28th September, 1998, is capitalised and amortised
through the profit and loss account over the lower of their useful
economic lives and a period of 20 years.
(c) In calculating the goodwill, the total consideration, both
actual and deferred, is taken into account. Where the deferred
consideration is payable in cash, the liability is discounted to its
present value. Where the deferred consideration is contingent
and dependant upon future trading performance, an estimate 
of the present value of the likely consideration payable is made.
This contingent deferred consideration is re-assessed annually
and corresponding adjustment is made to the goodwill arising 
on acquisition. The difference between the present value and 
the total amount payable at a future date gives rise to a finance
charge which is charged to the profit and loss account and
credited to the liability over the period in which the consideration
is deferred. The discount used approximates to market rates.
(d) Impairment reviews of goodwill and other intangible assets
are carried out at the end of the first financial year after
acquisition and where there is any indication of impairment.
Purchased intangible assets relating to newspaper publishing rights,
titles, radio licences and certain other intangible assets are capitalised
and amortised through the profit and loss account over the lower of
their useful economic lives, if any, and a period of 20 years.
Foreign Exchange
(a) Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Revenue
items are translated at average rates for the year, except 
where they are covered by forward contracts in which case the
forward rate is used. Differences on exchange, arising from 
the re-translation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries
and associates and from the translation of the results of those
undertakings at average or forward rates, are dealt with as
movements on reserves.
(b) Foreign currency borrowings are matched against net assets
(adjusted to include goodwill arising on acquisitions) and the
resulting translation differences are dealt with as movements 
on reserves.
(c) Translation differences on the excess of foreign currency
borrowings over matching net assets (adjusted to include goodwill
arising on acquisitions) are taken to the profit and loss account.
(d) All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and 
loss account.
Tangible Fixed Assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation, adjusted for revaluations of certain properties at
30th September, 1994.
Specialised buildings, being those constructed specifically 
for use in the business, are carried at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation. 
Non-specialised buildings are carried at their frozen 1994
valuations, as permitted by FRS 15, Tangible Fixed Assets, as
adjusted for subsequent additions, disposals, depreciation and
impairment, if any.
51 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Continued
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of tangible fixed
assets by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful
lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 10 to 50 years
Short leasehold properties Period of lease
Plant and equipment 3 to 25 years
Depreciation on freehold buildings and leasehold properties is
based on cost, or valuation where properties have been re-valued.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are 
not depreciated.
Leased Assets
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements which give rights
approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had
been purchased. The present value of minimum lease payments
payable during the lease term is capitalised as a tangible asset and
the corresponding leasing commitment is included in obligations
under finance leases. Rentals payable are apportioned between
interest, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and
capital, which reduces the outstanding commitment.
Rentals payable relating to all other leases are charged to the profit
and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Joint Ventures and Associates
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group holds a long
term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or
more venturers under a contractual arrangement. Joint ventures
are accounted for using the gross equity method of accounting.
Associates are those undertakings, other than subsidiaries and
joint ventures in which the Group holds a long term participating
interest and exerts a significant influence. The Group’s share of
profits less losses of associates is included in the Group’s profit
and loss account and the Group’s share of their net assets,
together with goodwill arising on acquisition, is included in the
Group balance sheet. 
The basis in which these joint ventures and associates are equity
accounted is set out in Note 23.
Investments
Listed and unlisted investments are held at cost, less any
provision for impairment. 
Investments in Group undertakings are held by the Company at
cost, less any provision for impairment.
Stocks and Work in Progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and
net realisable value. Cost of work in progress includes overheads
attributable to the cost of production.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result 
in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a
right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply
when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and on law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income
and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different
from those in which they are included in financial statements. 
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from
the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment 
to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and
associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Timing differences arising on tax deductible goodwill written off
to reserves are recognised. Due to the indefinite nature of these
timing differences the Group believes it appropriate to discount
the resultant deferred tax assets and liabilities as they arise on
businesses expected to be held for the long term. As a consequence,
all other deferred tax assets and liabilities are also discounted.
Pension Costs
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements
of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, which permit the costs, accruals
and prepayments recorded in the accounts to be reported under
the requirements of SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension Costs. 
This is consistent with the basis adopted last year . The cost 
of providing pensions is calculated using actuarial valuation
methods, which reflect the long term costs of providing pensions.
Thus, the amount charged to the profit and loss account is
calculated so as to produce a substantially level percentage of
the current and future pensionable payroll. Variations from the
regular cost so calculated are allocated to the profit and loss
account over the average remaining service lives of employees. 
The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 are explained in
Note 39.
Financial Instruments
The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to
manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
These have included currency swaps, forward foreign currency
contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest
rate floors. The Group considers its derivative financial
instruments to be hedges and matches them with the relevant
hedged item. Cash flows relating to these derivative financial
transactions are netted against hedged transactions in the Cash
flow statement within net cash inflow from operating activities,
or returns on investment and servicing of finance, or disclosed
within financing, as appropriate.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts or cross currency
swaps are used to hedge borrowings, the borrowings hedged are
translated at the year end at the exchange rate implicit within
the respective derivative. Any exchange differences arising are
taken to the profit and loss account to match the accounting
treatment of exchange gains or losses on the borrowings.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge
future revenues or costs, the gain or loss is not recognised until
the revenues arise or the costs are incurred.
Payments or receipts on interest rate swaps, caps or floors are
accrued with interest payable. The derivatives are not revalued.
Arrangement fees on Eurobonds are amortised over the
estimated life of the Bonds.
Own Shares
The Company’s own shares, held as treasury shares and at the
prior year end within the DMGT Share Trust, are shown as a
deduction from shareholders’ funds.

information and careers division comprised £34.8 million from business to business information and £4.9 million at careers, offset by
unallocated central costs of £3.0 million. 
The Directors do not consider these results to be sufficiently material to require the presentation of a separate segment, but have
provided this additional information to assist the understanding of the performance of these divisions.
The Group’s review of its portfolio of investments has led to an impairment charge of £12.9 million (2003 £9.4 million). The impairment
charge has been assessed by reference to the value in use of the intangible fixed assets as required by FRS11, Impairment of Fixed
Assets. The discount rates applied to the cash flows varied, depending on the type of business, but were in the range of 7.5% and 10%.
Exceptional items comprise the write off of press equipment.

to £62.2 million (2003 £47.0 million) (Note 14) and the resulting rate is 26.6% (2003 25.3%). There was a tax credit of £5.0 million 
(2003 £1.5 million) relating to exceptional and non recurring items in the current and prior years. This included a credit of £3.4 million
(2003 £4.1 million) which arose on the sale of fixed assets, a charge of £Nil (2003 £0.7 million) on the disposal and closure of businesses, 
a credit of £6.0 million (2003 £4.9 million) following the agreement of certain prior year open issues with the UK Inland Revenue in relation
to the Group’s international structure, a charge of £4.4 million (2003 £Nil) in respect of the write off of irrecoverable overseas tax losses
and a charge of £Nil (2003 £6.8 million) in respect of increased provisions for certain prior year open issues.
(iii) The net current tax prior year credit of £4.1 million (2003 charge £1.0 million) arose largely from a reassessment of the level of tax
provisions required.
(iv) In subsequent years the Group’s tax charge may be affected by the movement in currently unrecognised deferred tax assets, the
largest of which relates to the Group’s accumulated tax losses in the US.

As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included in

13 Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share of 15.5 p (2003 15.3 p) are calculated, in accordance with FRS 14, on Group profit for the financial year of
£61.7 million (2003 £60.8 million) and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, as set out below.
As in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative measure
gives a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings per share of 41.6 p (2003 33.3 p)
are calculated on profit before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and exceptional items, after charging the taxation
and minority interests associated with those profits, of £165.3 million (2003 £132.3 million), as set out in Note 14 below, and on the
basic weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year .

Note £m £m £m £m
Other timing differences i (29.9) (32.4) – –
(i) The deferred tax assets disclosed in note 26 in respect of overseas tax losses, relate primarily to trading losses incurred in the 
US and have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient
suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered more likely
than not than these assets will be recovered. The unrecognised deferred tax asset of £29.9 million (2003 £32.4 million) above relates
primarily to overseas tax losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the immediate future.
(ii) No deferred tax has been provided on revalued assets due to the availability of realised capital losses for which no deferred tax
asset has been recognised.
(iii) There are additional unprovided capital losses carried forward which have not yet been agreed with the Inland Revenue.
(iv) The Group is able to obtain tax relief in some overseas territories for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some
businesses. In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10. Utilisation of the
available tax relief in the overseas territories gives rise to a timing difference as set out above. The potential timing differences will
only reverse on sale of the relevant businesses. As the relevant businesses are considered core to the Group there is currently no
intention to dispose of them. The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes
insignificant. The effect of discounting the Group’s accelerated capital allowances is a credit of £3.2 million (2003  £4.1 million). 
The effect of discounting the Group’s other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.

(iv) These options were granted at market value at the date of grant and none required any payment. They are not normally
exercisable before the third anniversary of the date of grant and in all circumstances will lapse if not exercised within ten years. 
(v) In the case of the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme, they are normally exercisable only when the relevant performance
conditions have been met. The first condition is that, in respect of four out of six consecutive monthly calculation dates (which start 
in the thirtieth month following the date of grant of a particular option), the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of the Company must
exceed that of the FTSE 100 index. Secondly, there must be real growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive
financial years. 
(vi) The TSR condition has not been met so far in respect of the options granted in December 1999 or June 2000. As a consequence,
these options have not vested yet. The eps condition was met in the year ended 28th September, 2003.
(vii) Options granted on 18th December, 2000 at £8.34 per share vested on 29th February, 2004 when the TSR condition was met,

(ii) As required by UITF Abstract 38 the Group’s investment in its own shares is now classified within shareholders’ funds as an other
reserve. At 3rd October, 2004 this investment comprised the cost of 4,213,000 ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares (2003 3,627,687 shares).
The market value of these shares at 3rd October, 2004 was £30.7 million (2003 £20.1 million).
The Treasury shares are considered to be a realised loss for the purposes of calculating distributable reserves.
(iii) At 3rd October, 2004, cumulative goodwill of continuing businesses of £626.6 million (2003 £683.9 million) had been written off

38 Contingent Liabilities
Four writs claiming damages for libel have been issued in Malaysia against Euromoney Institutional Investor and three of its
employees in respect of an article published in one of Euromoney’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November
1995. The writs were served on Euromoney in October, 1996. The total amount claimed is 280 million Malaysian ringgits, £40.7
million (2003 £50.0 million). No provision has been made in these accounts since the Directors do not believe that Euromoney has
any material liability in respect of these writs.
At 3rd October, 2004 the Group had outstanding commitments under forward foreign exchange derivatives amounting to 
£488.5 million (2003 £108.5 million).
At 3rd October, 2004 the Company had guaranteed borrowing facilities and finance leases of subsidiaries under which £85.2 million
(2003 £114.4 million) were outstanding. The Company had also guaranteed a subsidiary’s interest rate derivatives with a principal
value of £16.7 million (2003 £30.1 million) and letters of credit of £5.2 million (2003 £6.3 million).
In June 2003, California Market Centre LLC (“Cal Mart”), a joint venture of the Group, signed a five year US$82 million loan
agreement. As manager of Cal Mart, the Group is liable for any default on Cal Mart’s loan caused by illegal activities, wilful or gross
negligence, misrepresentation or similar circumstances. The Directors believe that the circumstances under which such a liability
may arise are unlikely. The Group has also indemnified Cal Mart’s lenders for up to US$6.5 million through letters of credit.
39 Pension Arrangements
The Group operates several pension schemes covering most major UK group companies under which contributions are paid by the
employer and employees.
The schemes for most employees are funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on
final pensionable salary. The assets of the schemes are held independently from the Group’s finances and are administered by
trustee companies. Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary following triennial valuations 
using the projected unit method.
A valuation of the principal schemes was carried out as at 31st March, 2001 and the long term assumptions having the most
significant effect on the pension costs reported under SSAP24 are shown in the following table:
Price Inflation 2.5% p.a.
Salary Increases 4.3% p.a.
Pension Increases 2.5% p.a.
Investment Return 6.75% p.a.
Dividend Growth 3.5% p.a.
The surpluses or deficits identified from the valuation of the principal schemes are amortised over a period of eleven years using 
the straight line method.
The results of the triennial valuation of the principal schemes as at 31st March, 2004 have not yet been finalised. However, interim
valuations carried out as at 31st March of each year have highlighted the impact on the schemes of changing market conditions 
and falling investment returns. As a result, the Company agreed with the Trustees to increase cash contributions to the principal
schemes from 12% to 15% of pensionable salaries from 1st October, 2003. Additionally, pending completion of the 2004 actuarial
valuation, it has been agreed to increase the pension cost charged in these accounts to 15% of pensionable salaries for the principal
schemes, in line with the cash contribution rate.
The contribution rate paid by employees in the principal schemes is 5% of pensionable salaries. These schemes remain open to
eligible new employees. 
The pension charge for the year ended 3rd October, 2004 was £34.7 million (2003 £23.8 million).

A prepayment of £53.1 million (2003 £41.1 million) is included under debtors, representing the excess of accumulated contributions paid
over the equivalent pension charge. This includes an advance payment into the Group’s pension schemes amounting to £26.9 million 
in respect of the 2005 contributions (2004 £21.4 million). A provision of £1.1million (2003 £0.7 million) is included in provisions,
representing the excess of the accumulated pension charge over pension contributions paid. 
The effect of UITF 6, ‘Accounting for post-retirement benefits other than pensions’, is not material.
FRS 17
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 17, ‘Retirement Benefits’, this note sets out the main financial assumptions made in
valuing the liabilities of the schemes and the fair value of assets held. Additionally, this note discloses the amounts that would be
charged or recognised in the accounts under FRS 17, together with an analysis of the movement in scheme surpluses or deficits
which would result. As permitted by FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the accounts continue to be reported
under the requirements of SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’.
Defined Benefit Schemes
The figures in this note are based on the calculations carried out in connection with the formal actuarial valuation of the main
schemes as at 31st March, 2004, currently in progress, and updated to 3rd October, 2004 by the actuary.
The main financial assumptions used for FRS 17 purposes are shown in the following table:
2004 2003 2002
Price inflation 2.75% 2.5% 2.3%
Salary increases 4.3% 4.3% 4.1%
Pension increases 2.75% 2.5% 2.3%
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.5% 5.4% 5.5%
The fair value of the assets held by the pension schemes, the long term expected rate of return on each class of assets and the value
of the schemes’ liabilities assessed on the assumptions described above are shown in the following table:

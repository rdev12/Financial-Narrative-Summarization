“I am delighted to report, for the year to 30 April
2005, a record year in terms of turnover, pre-tax
profit and earnings per share.”  03 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
In my first communication with you as Chairman, I am
delighted to report, for the year to 30 April 2005, a 
record year in terms of turnover, pre-tax profit and
earnings per share. 
The adjusted pre-tax profit, which totals £34.5m, 
has again exceeded market expectations. 
Prospects for further progress remain good.
Financial overview
On turnover up 7.3% at £236.0m, adjusted pre-tax profit
increased by 62.0% to £34.5m – a record by a wide
margin. Adjusted basic earnings per share were 54.7%
higher at 6.28p, reflecting an increased effective tax rate.
“ Adjusted” excludes an exceptional charge (in connection
with restructuring in Japan) of £0.8m (2004: exceptional
credit of £0.4m) and a goodwill amortisation charge of
£0.7m (2004: £0.5m). The reported figures are a pre-tax
profit of £33.0m (2004: £21.1m), up 56.4%, and EPS of
5.96p (2004: 4.01p), up 48.6%.
After £34.5m of capital expenditure and financial
investment, net cash balances increased to £4.1m 
from £2.9m.
Dividends
A final dividend per share of 1.2p (2004: 1.0p) 
is proposed. T ogether with the interim dividend of 
0.8p (2004: nil), dividends per share are doubled at
2.0p (2004: 1.0p) and are three times (2004: four 
times) covered.
If approved at the AGM on 28 September 2005, the 
final dividend will be paid on 2 November 2005 to
shareholders on the register at close of business on 
7 October 2005. The ex-dividend date is 5 October 2005. 
Business overview
In the Vending Division (which has an unrivalled network
of 28,000 sites worldwide), operating profit improved
although turnover decreased by 2.4%.
Manufacturing turnover increased by 24.8% to 
£98.0m, representing 42% (2004: 36%) of total 
turnover. Manufacturing contributed the bulk of the 
pre-tax profit and its increase, benefiting from increased
volumes and higher margins following the transfer of
minilab manufacture to a sub-contractor in Poland in
January 2004.
Board
On 1 February 2005, Dan David retired as Chairman,
having fulfilled that role for the past 12 years. Mr David
continues as a non-executive director and has been
appointed Life President. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 June 2005, David
Scotland resigned as a non-executive director, having
made a valuable contribution during his four years in that
role. He is succeeded by Hugo Swire who brings to the
Board wide-ranging experience in business development
in international markets. 
Employees
On behalf of my fellow Directors, I would like to thank
PMI's employees, who number more than 1,600
worldwide, for their tremendous efforts in helping to
achieve another hugely successful year.
Prospects
In the current year, in Vending, both photobooths and
Digital Media Kiosks should continue to make a positive
contribution. In Manufacturing, another good
performance is expected. Overall, the Directors are
confident of further progress.
Further out, in Vending, photobooths will benefit from
changes in ID regulations in France and Japan, two of
PMI’s principal markets. Additionally, the roll-out of
Digital Media Kiosks is expected to contribute
significantly to Group performance. In Manufacturing, 
the DKS 3 minilab (which is the first digital minilab of 
the third generation) enhances the product range, whilst
the North American market represents a significant
opportunity. Overall, prospects for sustained profitable
growth remain good.

“I am confident that PMI has good opportunities 
for sustained profitable growth.” 05 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Chief executive’s review
In my 2004 Chief Executive’s Review, I said that the year
to 30 April 2004 represented a turning point in PMI’s
history. The Board’s financial objectives had been
exceeded in an outstanding year and beyond its initial
expectations. Additionally, PMI’s product platform had
put PMI in a unique position to continue to benefit from
the digital revolution.
Happily, in the year to 30 April 2005, my confidence was
vindicated. The financial upwards momentum has been
maintained, with increases in adjusted pre-tax profit and
earnings per share of over 50% to figures which are a
record by a wide margin and ahead of market
expectations. Vending produced a solid performance,
increasing its contribution to profit, further upgrading its
operating equipment, and extending its service offer.
Manufacturing had an excellent year, in particular the
minilab business in its first full year of manufacture by a
sub-contractor in Poland, and also the Imaging Solutions
wholesale lab business in Switzerland.
Perhaps of considerable relevance for the future of
Vending was the encouraging start achieved by PMI’s
Digital Media Kiosks, in particular in France. Subsequent
to the year-end, production was transferred to a sub-
contractor in China, thereby reducing costs significantly.
The volume roll-out of Chinese manufactured Digital
Media Kiosks has recently begun. 
PMI has a unique Vending network and a unique
Manufacturing product range which will be
supplemented in the next year or so by a new generation
of digital minilab. PMI’s digital imaging market is
substantial, fast growing and changing to PMI’s
advantage. I am therefore confident that PMI has good
opportunities for sustained profitable growth.
Business review
Continental Europe, which includes the great majority of
the Manufacturing turnover, contributed 60% (2004:
59%) of Group turnover and, again, substantially all of
pre-tax profit. 
In the UK and Ireland, the result has been depressed by a
small reduction in profits from operating divisions, by an
increase in Head Office overheads, and by a decrease in
both profit on foreign exchange and other income.
The improved profitability in Asia – which is primarily
Japan – mainly resulted from a reduction in depreciation,
old technology photobooths having been fully
depreciated by 30 April 2004.
As the table below indicates, the 7.3% increase in Group
turnover was the net of a small decrease in Vending and
a 24.8% increase in Manufacturing. Vending accounted
for 58% (2004: 64%) of Group turnover.
Although the Board believes that detailed disclosure of
the results of the individual activities could be prejudicial
to the Group’s commercial interests, certain trends are
commented on below.
Vending
The Vending business comprises the operation of
photobooths and other vending equipment. During the
year, the total number of Vending sites worldwide
increased by approximately 2,000 to 28,000, including
some 20,000 photobooths. PMI is a global company,
operating in 20 countries, with three major Vending
territories: France, the UK and Ireland, and Japan – in all
of which it continues to enjoy a leading market position.
Globally, the turnover of the Vending Division, whose
photobooth operations are mature, decreased by 2.4%. 
Its contribution to profits, however, improved and it again
generated substantial cashflow.

Geographical Analysis
Vending turnover in France (with 9,300 sites, including
5,900 photobooths, of which 98% are digital) increased
by 1%. The increase in the number of sites, from 8,500
last year, reflects the siting of Digital Media Kiosks.
Demand for ID photographs in France will be boosted by
the planned introduction of photo-identity on personal
National Health cards, resulting in 48 million replacement
cards from calendar 2006.
Vending turnover in the UK and Ireland (with 9,300 sites,
including 5,600 photobooths, of which 78% are digital)
was flat. The increase of 1,000 sites over the year mainly
reflects expansion in the area of kiddie rides.
Vending turnover in Japan (with 4,700 sites, including
4,600 photobooths) decreased by 5% despite a 12%
increase in the number of machines and an increase in
the proportion of digital machines from 72% to 84%.
Despite the reduction in turnover, profits in Japan have
increased. During the year, the maintenance workforce
was reduced by one-third, reducing annual costs by
£1.5m. The Japanese Government announced during the
year that ID photographs will play an integral part in the
new generation of passports to be introduced in March
2006. These two developments are expected to improve
Japan’s profitability.
Digital Media Kiosks
Following successful trials, mainly in Continental Europe,
the roll-out of Digital Media Kiosks commenced in May
2004. Digital Media Kiosks are capable of printing from
both digital cameras and digital camera phones. By the
year end, 3,000 had been manufactured; 1,600 had been
sold and 1,400 were operated by PMI, of which 1,000 in
France. T o date, results have been encouraging.
The manufacture in China of thermal (i.e. dry process)
Digital Media Kiosks commenced in May 2005 and by 
31 December 2005 it is planned that 5,000 of these will
be in operation or sold. The move of production to China
reduces the cost of Digital Media Kiosks significantly
whilst improving a number of features.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing turnover primarily derives from the 
sale to third parties of photo-processing equipment
manufactured by PMI or, increasingly, by sub-contractors
located in low cost territories. PMI has a unique and
comprehensive range covering all market segments, 
from wholesale labs, via professional and retail labs, to
end-consumer vending kiosks. In output terms,
processing labs range from 250 to 20,000 prints per hour.
This Division increased its turnover by 24.8% in the full
year; in the second half, the increase was 40.5%.
Manufacturing contributed the bulk of the Group profit
and its increase.
Wholesale Labs
Imaging Solutions’ wholesale lab business was acquired 
in April 2003 and comfortably repaid its purchase price 
in the first year of ownership. Based near Zurich in
Switzerland, Imaging Solutions is involved in the
development, manufacture, sale and technical support 
of equipment and systems for high volume photo-
finishing laboratories (up to 20,000 prints per hour). 
In the year, Imaging Solutions increased its turnover by
16.9% to £15.9m and made another useful profit. An
increased contribution is anticipated in the current year.
Professional Labs
A substantial majority of Manufacturing turnover is
represented by sales of the DKS 15xx range of minilabs.
Their success reflects their quality, as evidenced by the
award of the DIMA minilab prize at the Photo Marketing
Association (PMA) Convention and T rade Show in
Orlando, Florida in February 2005, uniquely for a third
successive year. These minilabs have an output of 800 
to 1,500 prints an hour.
In the year, unit sales of minilabs increased by 40%. 
A significant proportion of the growth was in relation to
contracts signed in September 2004 and November 2004
with T esco, the UK’s largest retailer, and Klick, the UK’s
largest independent photo-processing retailer,
respectively. Margins benefited from the full year effect
of the move of production to PMI’s sub-contractor in
Poland, Flextronics, in January 2004. 
T rialling of PMI’s minilabs in North America continues
satisfactorily.  07 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Chief executive’s review
Retail Labs
PMI’s retail lab is the DKS 900, the world’s first thermal
digital minilab, capable of printing from 250 to 1,000
prints per hour. Its compactness, reliability, ease of use
and price make it particularly suited for offering a digital
printing capability in a small retail environment.
The first deliveries of the DKS 900 were made in 
August 2004. An increased rate of sale is expected in 
the current year.
Consumer Labs
Digital Media Kiosks provide vending machine
convenience for digital camera and camera-phone
customers.
Manufacture of Digital Media Kiosks in Grenoble, France
ceased in April 2005 and commenced at a sub-contractor
in Shanghai, China in May 2005.
The digital imaging market
PMI believes that it enjoys a strong position in a
substantial and fast growing market which is developing
to its advantage:
– The installed base of digital cameras is expected shortly
to exceed that of analogue equipment;
– The installed base of camera phones is rising fast, 
as is the average of the megapixels offered, improving
the quality of photographs taken;
– Home printing is fast losing market share, for reasons
mainly of cost, quality and convenience; and
– Digital photographers are printing an increasing
proportion of the photographs that they take.
PMI is positioned optimally to exploit these trends:
– PMI benefits from a unique vending infrastructure 
of 28,000 sited machines worldwide, with related
arrangements for maintenance and cash collection. 
This network greatly facilitates the roll-out of Digital
Media Kiosks; 
– PMI is the only manufacturer globally to offer a
comprehensive digital range, covering the entire
spectrum of client needs with an outstanding and
recognised quality at realistic pricing points, for both
customers and the Group;
– PMI has only two significant competitors to its minilab
manufacturing business and only one competitor,
currently in receivership, for its wholesale lab
manufacturing business;
– PMI has two products of particular potential: the Digital
Media Kiosk, whose volume roll-out of lower cost,
Chinese-manufactured models has recently commenced,
and the next generation of DKS minilab, which is
expected to be available in the middle of calendar 2006;
and
– PMI, with its long track record of technical innovation,
has the capability to develop further market-leading
products.
Strategic objectives
PMI has reached a stepping-stone: financially, with its 
net cash balance and strong cash generation, and
commercially, with its extensive Vending network,
principally imaging-based, and proven and
comprehensive digital imaging manufacturing range.
PMI intends to use its financial strength to grow
organically and through acquisitions. 
In Vending, PMI intends to leverage its infrastructure and
extend its product range beyond photobooths, increasing 
its relevance to key site owners.
In Manufacturing, PMI intends to strengthen its footprint
and commercial network with a view to obtaining a
substantial and rewarding share of the world market for
digital photo-processing equipment.

Vending
PMI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nippon Auto-
Photo K.K., has been successfully operating in Japan for
over 43 years. Throughout this period, it has been the
market leader in the coin-operated photobooth market.
The 4,600 photobooths operated by Nippon Auto-
Photo throughout Japan are used year after year by 
many millions of customers who prefer our technology
and photographic quality to those of our Japanese
competitors.
Nippon Auto-Photo will increase the number of
photobooths it operates to more than 6,000 within 
the next two years.

Over the last two years, Nippon Auto-Photo has been
assembling its new ND30 and ND50 photobooths in
Japan, making good use of PMI’s technology and
manufacturing expertise and taking advantage of the
fact that the main components are developed and
manufactured by leading Japanese companies.
The ND30 and ND50 photobooths have a printing speed
of 19 seconds (the fastest on the market) and offer four
different sizes of ID photographs, an exciting range of
fun photographs and, in the near future, printing from
digital cameras and camera phones.

is to broaden our position 
in the marketplace
Building on our position as the number one operator 
of photobooths, PMI’s intentions are to also establish
itself as the market leader in the operation of both 
digital photo printing kiosks and children’s rides. Offering the only stand-alone digital media kiosk 
vending equipment, PMI is well positioned to 
consolidate its position in the rapidly growing digital
photo-printing market.
1,400 Digital Media Kiosks were operated by the 
Group by April 2005. 1,000 of these are located in 
France and have generated encouraging revenues.

Our equipment
p
Minilabs with digital capabilities are in demand as
customers realise the quality and convenience of having
their digital images printed as “real” photographs.
This demand has fuelled the growth in the Manufacturing
division, as major supermarkets such as T esco and large
independents like Klick start to see real growth in their
photographic print business after the recent years of
declining film sales. 15 Photo-Me International plc

Manufacturing
is making inroads in the high street
The profile of the digital camera user has also seen some
changes in recent years, with the main user now being
the female within the family. This market segment is more
likely to use conventional methods of printing their
photos, which in turn, has lead to an increase in digital
prints purchased at “high street” processors. The last year
has seen a 300% increase in digital photos printed at
retail outlets compared to only a 37% increase in digital
photos printed at home.
The high street is not, however, just about minilabs.
Kiosks that act as the interface between the customer
and the minilab allow the customer to select which
images to print and their size, and can even turn them 
into fun gifts such as calendars and greetings cards. 16 Photo-Me International plc

Our R&Dp
Research and Development is the “cornerstone” from
which the Group’s success has been built.  Every year,
more than 7% of Manufacturing turnover is devoted 
to R&D.
Comprising more than 80 engineers and technicians who
are at the forefront of a complex mix of technologies,
including optics, digital, photographic film and chemistry,
software and hardware,  the R&D team has kept the

This achievement has been recognised by the industry, in
the form of the DIMA award. This award is presented by
the Photo Marketing Association at its annual show in the
USA, where all manufacturers are judged anonymously by
a panel of experts; looking at print criteria such as flesh

Annual Report 2005
Profit & loss 
The profit and loss account for the year to 30 April 2005 may be summarised as follows:
2005 2004 Change
Turnover (£m) 236.0 219.9 +7.3%
EBITDA (£m)† 58.9 52.1 +12.9%
Operating profit (£m)† 35.8 22.8 +57.2%
PBT (£m)† 34.5 21.3 +62.0%
Basic earnings per share (p)† 6.28 4.06 +54.7%
Dividends per share (p) 2.00 1.00 +100.0%
† excluding exceptional items and, where appropriate, goodwill amortisation
The turnover figure, up 7.3% on the previous year, was a record.
Demonstrating the usual strength of PMI’s cash generation, EBITDA, before exceptional items, was £58.9m (2004:
£52.1m). This represents 25.0% of turnover – a high proportion.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 57.2% to £35.8m (2004: £22.8m). “ Adjusted” excludes an exceptional charge 
(in connection with restructuring in Japan) of £0.8m (2004: exceptional credit of £0.4m) and a goodwill amortisation
charge of £0.7m (2004: £0.5m). The adjusted operating margin increased to 15.2% (2004: 10.4%).
The net interest charge reduced to £1.3m (2004: £1.5m), reflecting reduced average indebtedness. The net interest
charge was covered 46 times (2004: 34 times) by EBITDA and 27 times (2004: 15 times) by profit before interest and
tax. The average interest rate was 5.7% (2004: 4.6%) and the average gross debt was £29.5m (2004: £36.9m).
Adjusted pre-tax profit advanced by 62.0% to £34.5m (2004: £21.3m).
Adjusted EPS were 54.7% higher at 6.28p (2004: 4.06p), reflecting an increased effective tax rate of 32.6% 
(2004: 28.5%).
The reported figures are an operating profit of £34.3m (2004: £22.3m), up 53.9%, a pre-tax profit of £33.0m 
(2004: £21.1m), up 56.4%, and EPS of 5.96p (2004: 4.01p), up 48.6%. 
On both adjusted and reported bases, the pre-tax profit was a record by a wide margin.
The adjusted pre-tax profit in the second half (traditionally, the weaker half of the year for Vending) of £16.2m 
compared with £6.3m in 2004 and a pre-tax loss of £3.3m in 2003, reflecting in large part the increased importance 
of Manufacturing. 
Net assets 
The Group balance sheet further strengthened.  At the year end, shareholders’ funds had increased by 20.7% to 
£83.5m  (2004: £69.1m), whilst shareholders’ funds less intangible assets totalled £59.2m (2004: £47.7m). 
The largest individual asset category remains fixed assets. The £96.4m of fixed assets can be analysed as to £71.9m
tangible assets, £24.2m intangible assets, and £0.3m investments. T angible assets include £57.9m of operating
equipment, notably £41.0m of photobooths and £11.1m of Digital Media Kiosks. An impairment review has been
undertaken as at 30 April 2005 in respect of intangible and tangible fixed assets. No adjustment to the carrying value 
of such assets was required.
Current assets increased to £99.8m (2004: £87.4m). They are represented by, in order of value, debtors, stocks, cash at
bank and in hand, and investments and short-term deposits. The principal reason for the increase in current assets is the
increase in debtors to £42.7m from £32.3m, which reflects the increase in Manufacturing turnover towards the end of
the year.
Cash and borrowings 
The net cash balance rose to £4.1m (2004: £2.9m), after capital expenditure and financial investment of £34.5m 
(2004: £21.0m).  This was principally in the following areas:  Digital Media Kiosks (£12.1m), photobooths (£10.9m), the
purchase of kiddie ride activities which leverage off PMI’s UK infrastructure (£2.2m), and the acquisition of the 30.3%
minority interest in PMI’s German subsidiary, Fotofix-Schnellphotoautomaten GmbH (£2.5m).
The year end net cash of £4.1m compares with net cash of £2.9m at 30 April 2004, net debt of £33.4m at 30 April 2003
and net debt of £51.4m at 30 April 2002. This remarkable turnaround reflects the cash-generative nature of the Vending
business, the improved Manufacturing result in the last two years, and the receipt of a payment on account from the
Group’s insurers in respect of a claim for the Bookham fire of 22 December 2004.
Financial review 22 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Financial review
Funding and treasury policy 
The £1.2m improvement in net cash is explained in the following summarised cash flow statement:
2005 2004
£m £m
Opening net cash/(debt) 2.9 (33.4)
Gross cash inflow 58.3 52.8
Working capital movement (6.5) 5.9
Returns on investments and servicing of finance (1.3) (1.6)
Tax (5.9) (1.1)
Capital expenditure and financial investment (34.5) (21.0)
Acquisitions and disposals (2.5) (0.2)
Dividends (6.5) –
Other movements – net 0.1 1.5
Closing net cash 4.1 2.9
The Group’s funding policy is to maintain a timely flow of funds to meet investment requirements. The Board regularly
reviews the cash requirements of the Group and sets guidelines and policy, which are then monitored and managed by
the Finance and T reasury Committees. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases and overdrafts. These instruments are
used to raise finance for the Group’s operations and to cover capital expenditure and working capital requirements. 
Details of the financial instruments are shown in note 16 to the accounts, including currency and interest rate analysis.
The Group takes the view (as permitted by FRS13) that short-term debtors and creditors are not financial instruments
that play a significant medium to long-term role in the financial risk profile of the Group. They are excluded from the 
FRS13 disclosures, other than currency analysis. 
The Bookham fire
On 22 December 2004, the Group’s 62,000 sq.ft. warehouse and workshop at Bookham, Surrey were destroyed by 
fire, together with their contents. These principally comprised minilabs for resale, vending equipment being refurbished,
spare parts and consumables. The adjacent Group Head Office building was undamaged by the fire.
The Group successfully minimised the disruption caused to its business.
A substantial payment on account was received during the year from the Group’s insurers, and the Board is confident
that the risk was fully covered.  Furthermore, since the insurance cover is based on replacement cost, a material
accounting surplus could arise.  However, as parts of the claim will not be finalised for some months, no gain has been
recognised in these accounts.
Financial risks
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise
potential risks for the Group. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing risks.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries whose functional currency is not Sterling, being principally Euro, Swiss
Francs and Japanese Y en.  As a result, changes in exchange rates can impact on the net assets of the Group’s balance
sheet. Borrowings by subsidiaries in local currency help to mitigate the effects of exchange movements.  Individual
subsidiaries are exposed to exchange rate movements as a result of selling or purchasing in foreign currencies. Subject to
approval of the Risk Management Committee, hedges may be taken out to cover forward foreign exchange contracts to
assist in managing the exchange risk from trading. During the year under review, hedging commenced and this policy is
likely to continue in the current year. Generally, the amounts hedged are short term (less than one year) and are
monitored for their effectiveness.  23 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Financial review
Interest rate risk
The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in interest rates. The Group
finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired
currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest. The Group regularly monitors the possibility of switching from
floating to fixed rate and from fixed to floating. It also monitors the possibility of using cap and floor arrangements.
The Group may also take out derivative contracts to limit interest rate exposure and this activity commenced during
the year.  At the year end, 13% of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates (2004: 19%).
Liquidity risk  
The Group’s objective is to ensure adequate facilities are available and to maintain a balance between continuity of
funding and flexibility through use of overdrafts, bank loans and finance leases. At 30 April 2005, £34.1m  (2004:
£35.0m) of undrawn committed facilities were available. At 30 April 2005, 16.1% (2004: 15.3%) of total borrowings
will mature after two years. Surplus funds are placed in bank deposit accounts and other investments with high credit
ratings. 
International Financial Reporting Standards
Financial statements for EU quoted companies for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 have to
be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). PMI will thus publish accounts for
the year ended 30 April 2006 in accordance with IFRS. The interim results to 31 October 2005 will be the first reported
in line with IFRS. The accounts for the year ended 30 April 2005 will be the last to be produced under UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) finalised in early 2004 the standards to be applied for IFRS
conversion for 2005. Since then, new standards and amendments have been issued. These standards have to be
endorsed by the EU before they can be applied.  Most standards have been endorsed and the process is continuing. 
PMI’s IFRS conversion project is on schedule. The IFRS conversion project team has examined the implementation
aspects, including examination of changes in accounting policies, the presentation of the Group’s results, system
changes and wider business issues arising from the changes. The Group’s IFRS project conversion team will be shortly
finalising the restatement of the results for the year ended 30 April 2005. 
It is our current view that IFRS will have an impact in the following principal areas: expensing of the fair value of share
options, accounting for goodwill acquired in business combinations, and the translation of results at average exchange
rates. The net impact on both profits and the balance sheet is not expected to be significant.
Financial objective
Having achieved a healthy financial structure, our main target for future years is to use the strength of the balance
sheet for expansion, generating sustained improvement in shareholder value.

ended 30 April 2005.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group continue to be the manufacture, sale and operation of coin-operated automatic photobooths
for identification and fun purposes, copiers, express print services and children’s rides together with the manufacture (including by
sub-contractors) and sale of photo-processing equipment (mainly minilabs and central processing laboratories), throughout the
world. The Group’s activities are increasingly based on digital photographic applications.
The principal subsidiary and associated undertakings of the Group are shown on page 63.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out in the Group profit and loss account on page 36.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 1.2p per Ordinary share which, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid
on 2 November 2005 to shareholders on the register at 7 October 2005 (ex-dividend date: 5 October 2005). This, together with the
interim dividend of 0.8p per share paid on 8 April 2005, makes a total dividend for the year of 2.0p per Ordinary share.
Review of the business and future developments
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review and the Financial review, all of which form part of this Report, describe the
activities of the business during the financial year, recent events and the outlook for the future.
Market value of land and buildings
The directors consider that the market value of the Group’s interest in land and buildings exceeds, by around 50%, its aggregate net
book value of £9,264,000 that is included in these accounts.
Research and development
The Group is committed to its research and development programme in order to maintain its position as a market leader. 
The expenditure incurred on the development of new vending equipment and photo-processing equipment is shown in Notes 
3 and 9 to the accounts.
Employees
The Group’s loyal and skilled workforce is essential for its future prosperity. Where appropriate, employees are provided with
information on matters of interest and concern to them. The Group encourages contact and interaction between all members of
staff at all levels.
The equal opportunities policy followed by the Group gives full and fair consideration to applicants for employment who are
disabled, for continuing the employment of those who become disabled and for training and developing disabled employees.
The Company continues to support Investors in People, thus demonstrating its commitment to the ongoing development of its staff
at every level of the organisation within the UK.
Health, safety, the environment and social responsibilities
Photo-Me International recognises its responsibilities to the environment and believes that health, safety and environmental (‘HSE’)
issues are integral and important components of best practice in business management.
The Group’s commitment to HSE matters is demonstrated through the appointment of François Giuntini as the responsible director
and through the activities of committees and advisers. This structure establishes HSE objectives, reviews significant issues,
recommends policy and provides strategy and direction. National training centres have been set up to provide effective training of
employees, including HSE awareness. The involvement of the whole workforce in HSE procedures is actively encouraged.
The Group’s environmental policies include:
– the management of operations to meet relevant legal regulations;
– the minimisation of energy, road transport and waste;
– the minimisation of exposure to any potential environmental liabilities.
The most significant environmental impacts by the Group have been reduced by:
– the safe destruction of all waste;
– using diesel fuel in most company vehicles;
– reviewing transport-related impacts by improved route planning;
– elimination of the use of halons for fire extinguishing;
– increased use of electronic communications to reduce paper consumption.
The Group’s social responsibilities include the sponsorship of VALIDATE UK, a voluntary proof of age scheme for young people 
aged 12 years and over. One of the aims of the scheme is to reduce under-age sales of age-restricted products and, in so doing, 
it helps to control many health and social problems associated with early addiction to alcohol, smoking, solvents and gambling.
Working with Trading Standards Officers, Health Professionals, Community Safety Officers and the Police, the scheme has been
awarded PASS accreditation (‘Proof of Age Standards Scheme’), the UK Government standard for proof of age. VALIDATE UK 
now operates in 73 local authorities and various police authorities across the United Kingdom. More information is available at

Although the Company has no current intention to make any market purchases of its own shares, approval will be sought from
shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting to renew and extend the authority up to 10% of the shares in issue, being
36,428,912 shares.
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are set out in Note 26 to the accounts.
Creditor payment policy
The Company does not follow a universal code which deals specifically with payments to suppliers but, where appropriate, the
Company’s practice is to:
(a) agree the terms of payment at the start of business with the supplier;
(b) ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment;
(c) pay in accordance with its contractual and other legal obligations.
United Kingdom subsidiaries follow the same policy and overseas subsidiaries are encouraged to adopt similar policies, by applying
local best practices. The Company’s average creditor payment period at 30 April 2005 was 57 days.
Going concern
The directors consider that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly the directors continue to operate the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Auditors
The auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have expressed their willingness to continue in office. It is intended to move resolutions at the
Annual General Meeting to re-appoint them and authorise the directors to fix their remuneration.

Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
The Financial Services Authority requires listed companies to disclose, in relation to Section 1 of the Combined Code, how they have
applied its principles and whether they have complied with its provisions throughout the financial year.
Statement of application of the Principles of Good Governance
The Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code by complying with the
Code of Best Practice as reported above. Further explanations of how the Principles have been applied are set out below and, in
connection with directors’ service contracts, in the Remuneration report.
The Board
For the period under review and to date, the Board comprised the non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, three other
executive directors and a further four non-executive directors. Dan David served as Chairman until 1 February 2005 when he retired
from this position, then being appointed Life President and continuing as a non-executive director. Vernon Sankey, previously
Deputy Chairman, was appointed Chairman on that date. David Scotland, a non-executive director, resigned from the Board on 
1 June 2005 and was replaced by Hugo Swire who was appointed with effect from that date.
The Chairman has the overall responsibility for managing the Board. The Chief Executive Officer has responsibilities for strategy,
operations and results. Clear division of responsibility exists such that no one individual or group of individuals can dominate the
Board’s decision-making process.
The Company readily acknowledges that certain non-executive directors (Dan David, Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson and Francis Wahl)
are considered by the Combined Code not to be ‘independent’, due to a previous executive position (Dan David), their business
relationships with the Group (Dan David and Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson) or their having served on the Board for more than nine
years (Dan David and Francis Wahl). However, the Company does consider that Vernon Sankey (until his appointment as Chairman),
David Scotland(until his resignation) and Hugo Swire (appointed on David Scotland’s resignation) are independent non-executives.
Thus, the Company has had, until Vernon Sankey’s appointment as Chairman, two independent non-executive directors and has
three non-executive directors who are not independent, as defined by the Code. Despite this apparent departure from the Code, the
Board has recognised the contribution made by each of these non-independent non-executive directors which, in most instances,
has been of greater benefit to the Group and to all shareholders due to the very factors which are deemed to make a director non-
independent – including their depth of knowledge of the unique business of the Group. The Board also believes that these directors
are independent in character and judgement.
The senior independent non-executive director was Vernon Sankey until his appointment as Chairman on 1 February 2005, when
David Scotland assumed the role. Following the resignation of David Scotland on 1 June 2005 no senior independent non-executive
director has been selected, pending the appointment of additional independent non-executive directors.
Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson will be retiring from the Board at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. At around that time it is intended
that additional independent non-executive directors will be appointed, at least one of whom will have recent and relevant financial
experience.
In the event of the appointment of a new director, the Company would ordinarily appoint someone who, it believes, has sufficient
knowledge and experience to fulfil the duties of a director. If this were not the case, an appropriate training course would be
provided. An appropriate induction programme is undertaken for all newly-appointed directors. All directors have access to the
advice and services of the Company Secretary. Any director, wishing to do so in furtherance of his duties, may take independent
advice at the Company’s expense. All directors are required to stand for re-election, at a maximum of every three years and newly
appointed directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. Apart from this requirement,
non-executive directors are not appointed for specified terms.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman review the performance of each executive director. The Chairman reviews the
performance of the Chief Executive and each non-executive director. Following the recent appointment of a new Chairman, his
effectiveness will be assessed in future years by the senior independent non-executive director in a meeting with other non-
executive directors, without the Chairman being present. A formalised process to review the effectiveness of the Board and its
Committees is due to be introduced within the coming year.
The Chairman meets with non-executive directors on an informal basis. Such meetings will be formalised, going forward.
The Board usually meets five or six times a year and ad-hoc meetings are convened to deal with urgent matters. The Board has a
formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision. These include approval of the financial statements, dividend policy, major
acquisitions and disposals and other transactions outside delegated limits, significant changes in accounting policies, the
constitution of Board committees, risk management and corporate governance policy. 
The Board has delegated various matters to Committees, as detailed below. These Committees of the Board also meet regularly and
deal with specific aspects of the management of the Company. The Board has delegated authority to the Committees and they have
defined terms of reference which are available on request. Decision-making relating to operational matters is delegated to senior
management.

Board Committees
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors, current membership being detailed on page 24; in addition David
Scotland served on the Committee until his resignation as a director. Whilst no member of the Committee has “recent and relevant
financial experience” as required by the Code, the members do have a broad range of experience. As noted above, it is intended to
appoint a new non-executive director who will possess the relevant qualities. Meetings are normally held twice per year. The Group
Finance Director, representatives of the external auditors and the Internal Audit Manager are generally invited to attend meetings.
The minutes of the meetings are circulated to all directors. 
The Committee meets with the external auditors, without executive directors present, at least once a year. The Committee reviews
the Group’s accounting and financial reporting practices, the reports of the internal and external auditors and compliance with
policies, procedures and applicable legislation. In addition, the Committee monitors the effectiveness of both the external and
internal audit functions and reviews the Group’s internal financial control and risk management procedures. It also sets a policy for
safeguarding the independence of the external auditors and reviews their work outside of the audit itself.
The Audit Committee has not established a procedure by which staff may raise concerns about possible impropriorities in matters of
financial reporting or other matters. This matter will be addressed in the near future.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive directors, current members being detailed on page 24; in addition
David Scotland served on the Committee until his resignation as a director. The Committee meets at least once per year. The
Committee makes recommendations to the full Board in respect of the Group’s remuneration policy. The Committee also keeps
under review the remuneration of the Group’s executive directors and senior executives to ensure that they are rewarded fairly for
their contribution. The Committee also makes awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme. 
The Remuneration report on pages 31 to 34 provides details of how the Committee applies the Directors’ remuneration principles of
the Combined Code and explains the area of non-compliance with the Code in respect of the notice periods of some overseas
service contracts.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee now consists of Vernon Sankey (Committee Chairman), Serge Crasnianski, Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson and
Dan David. Dan David served as Committee Chairman whilst he was Chairman of the Company. The Committee, which meets as
required, makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new directors.
Having served for four years as Deputy Chairman, the Nomination Committee were unanimous in their recommendation of Vernon
Sankey as Chairman of the Company upon the retirement of Dan David and did not consider it necessary to seek external
candidates. Vernon Sankey did not participate in this process.
The appointment of Hugo Swire was made following a personal introduction to the Committee Chairman, with the Committee taking
full account of his past experience and personal achievements.
It is the Committee’s intention, in respect of future appointments of independent non-executive directors, to prepare a description
of the role and the capabilities required and to utilise external search consultants.

Relations with shareholders
The Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance Director have regular meetings with the Company’s major institutional shareholders.
The Chairman also meets with major shareholders and has contact with them, as and when required. The senior non-executive
director (Vernon Sankey) met with shareholders during the period. The senior non-executive director and, where appropriate, other
non-executive directors, are made available to meet with major shareholders, on request. Any pertinent feedback arising from such
meetings is reported to the Board at its regular meetings.
Private investors are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting and have the opportunity to question the Board. 
All members of the Board usually attend the Annual General Meeting. The notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders at least 
20 days before the Meeting. Shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on each separate issue. The number of proxy votes
lodged are announced after the vote on a show of hands for each resolution.
Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management, and for reviewing its
effectiveness. This is effected by receiving reports from the Audit Committee following its review. The Board is satisfied that such
systems have operated adequately throughout the period.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
Such a system can, however, provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has in place processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks which are applicable to the business.
The Board regularly reviews these processes. The procedures necessary to follow the Turnbull Guidance have applied during the year
under review and to the date of this Report.
The Board has appointed François Giuntini as the director with specific responsibility for co-ordinating risk management and for
reporting key risks and the risk management process to the Board. Executive managers of individual Group companies are
responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of the key risks applicable to their areas of responsibility. The risks
are assessed on a regular basis.
The managers of Group companies are aware of their responsibility to operate systems of internal control which are effective and
efficient for their businesses, to provide reliable financial information and to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system with actual results being reported monthly and variances reviewed.
The effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control is monitored by the Group Internal Audit Manager who reports directly to
the Audit Committee. A programme of visits to review operations in many Group companies has been undertaken in 2004–05.
The Audit Committee reviews reports from internal and external auditors and reports its conclusions to the Board.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code 
The Company has complied throughout the year with the provisions of the Combined Code with the exception of those matters
which have been identified and explained above, being:
– a majority of non-executive directors were not independent, as defined by the Code;
– the Remuneration and Audit Committees do not comprise only independent non-executive directors and the Nomination
Committee does not contain a majority of independent non-executive directors, there is no member of the Audit Committee with
recent and relevant financial experience;
– non-executive directors are not appointed for a specified term;
– there is no formal procedure in place to review board effectiveness;
– the terms of reference of the Audit Committee need to be updated in order to comply with the new Code;
– there is no “whistle-blowing” procedure in place;
– some existing overseas service contracts for directors contain notice periods of more than one year.

Annual Report 2005
Corporate governance The Remuneration Committee
In line with the requirements of the Combined Code, the Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and has responsibility
for determining the remuneration of the executive directors and the Group’s other senior executives. With the exception of the
constitution of the Remuneration Committee which, as explained below, includes two non-executive directors who are considered
by the Combined Code not to be independent, the Board confirms that the Company has complied throughout the relevant year 
with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to directors’ remuneration.
The Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors and held one meeting during the year. The directors who served on the
Committee throughout the year were as follows:
Vernon Sankey (Committee Chairman)
Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson
David Scotland
Francis Wahl 
The Board acknowledges that Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson (due to a past business relationship with the Group) and Francis Wahl
(due to length of service as a non-executive director) will not be deemed ‘independent’. However, they have, and will continue to,
apply entirely independent judgement in connection with executive remuneration issues.
The Committee is advised by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who have been appointed by the Committee and who advise it on
various matters relating to senior executive remuneration. New Bridge Street Consultants have provided no other services to the
Company. The Committee also received advice from Serge Crasnianski in relation to the remuneration of certain senior executives
(but not in relation to his own remuneration).
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Committee’s remuneration policy for the executive directors is to have regard to the directors’ experience and the nature and
complexity of their work in order to provide a competitive remuneration package that attracts, retains and motivates high calibre
executives from whom first class performance is expected. The remuneration policy is also intended to be consistent with the
Company’s business objectives and shareholder interests.
In order to align the interests of shareholders and executive directors, a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive
directors is performance-related through an annual bonus plan and the grant of share options.
The remuneration packages of the executive directors comprise the following main elements:
– Basic salary
– Annual bonus
– Share options
– Pensions
– Other benefits
Basic salary
The basic salaries of the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Committee. In conducting this review, the Committee 
takes account of the terms of existing service contracts and the performance of the individual executive director concerned.
The Committee also has regard to the pay of staff and management generally within the Group and takes into consideration 
the levels of basic salary paid by other relevant companies of similar size and standing, and market levels generally.
Annual bonus
In 2003 an annual bonus scheme was introduced, whereby executive directors may receive an award of up to 50% of basic salary,
subject to the extent to which annual performance targets are met. Such targets take account of current business plans and are
based largely on pre-tax profit and other objective financial tests. A threshold performance level is set, below which no bonus 
is payable.
With effect from May 2004 the Committee increased the maximum award level to 75% of basic salary; any bonus in excess of 50%
only being paid in return for outstanding performance. 
The first bonuses under the scheme were paid in the year to 30 April 2005.
Share options
In recent past years (until February 2004), the Company issued share options under the rules of the Approved and Unapproved
Senior Staff Share Option Schemes which were introduced in 1997. These schemes were the sole share-based long-term incentive
arrangement for senior executives. Existing options granted under the Schemes can only be exercised subject to the achievement of
a performance criterion. 
At the Annual General Meeting of 4 November 2004 the 1997 Approved and Unapproved Senior Staff Share Option Schemes 
were replaced with a new Photo-Me Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Scheme”), which will operate as the sole long-term
incentive arrangement for the Company’s executive directors and senior employees and which is more reflective of current best 
and market practice. 
The main features of the new Scheme are that options may be granted over shares worth up to 150% of a participant’s salary, each
year. The vesting of options is subject to an EPS-based performance condition relating to the extent to which the Company’s EPS
for the third financial year end, following the date of grant, reaches a sliding scale of challenging EPS targets. 
Remuneration report

Annual Report 2005
Remuneration report
Remuneration report Remuneration policy for executive directors (continued)
Share options (continued)
These absolute EPS targets are used as the Committee believes that the Company’s senior executive team should focus on
delivering substantial EPS growth over subsequent three year periods. The extent to which these targets are met will be determined
by the Committee, with the assistance of external consultants to ensure independent verification. The Committee will take advice as
to the best approach to adopt to take account of new International Financial Reporting Standards, in relation to any EPS-based
targets that are set.
As yet, no options have been issued under the new scheme.
Pensions
Executive directors with salaries paid by the Company in the UK are entitled to join the Company’s Group Stakeholder Pension Plan,
to which the Company contributes 5% of their basic UK salaries. Serge Crasnianski, François Giuntini and Jean-Luc Peurois are
members of the Plan. Company contributions at the rate of 5% of their basic UK salaries were:

François Giuntini 960 939
Jean-Luc Peurois 3,357 3,285
9,187 9,015
Other benefits
Executive directors are provided with employment related benefits which can include a company car, private medical insurance and
life assurance.
Service agreements
The following executive directors have service contracts which are terminable by the Company on giving 12 months’ notice. 
None are appointed for a specified period. The dates of these service contracts are as follows:
Serge Crasnianski 23 October 2000
François Giuntini 23 October 2000
Jean-Luc Peurois 23 October 2000
The overseas service contracts of François Giuntini and Jean-Luc Peurois provide for notice periods of 12 and 9 months respectively
and for the payment of a liquidated amount equal to 6 and 9 months of their overseas basic salary, respectively. The provisions in
Messrs Giuntini’s and Peurois’ service contracts are consistent with local practice in France, where these executives carry out a
significant proportion of their duties. Therefore, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to alter these existing contractual
entitlements.
Riccardo Costi has no service contract with the Company, but has a contract dated 16 June 1999 with the Group’s subsidiary
company, Nippon Auto-Photo KK. This contract is not for a specified period, is terminable by the company without notice but
provides for payment of a liquidated amount equal to 18 months of basic salary. Such a provision is consistent with local practice in
Japan for a senior executive with his length of service of over 30 years. Therefore, the Committee does not consider it appropriate
to alter this existing contractual entitlement.
The Committee’s policy is that no future executive director’s service contract shall be of a fixed term nor shall be terminable on
giving more than 12 months’ notice and that such contract shall contain no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages on
termination, which the Committee considers appropriately reflects market and best practice.
Within the restrictions imposed by the relevant service contracts, the Committee will apply the principle of mitigation when
determining any payment of compensation on an executive director’s termination.
Dan David, who served as non-executive Chairman until 1 February 2005, had service contracts with the Company (dated
23 October 2000) which were subject to 6 months’ notice from either party. In accordance with his contracts Dan David was
paid at the contracted rate until 4 May 2005, in order to ensure a smooth handover to the new Chairman. On 1 February 2005
Dan David was appointed Life President of the Company and remains a non-executive director, with no service contract, on
similar terms as other non-executive directors. The only difference to other non-executive directors is that Dan David is to be 
paid an additional £1,000 per annum and will continue to benefit from private health insurance, in recognition of his position as 
Life President. 
None of the non-executive directors are appointed for a specified term and none have service contracts, although they are subject
to re-election by shareholders at least every 3 years (as are the executive directors). None of the non-executive directors will be
entitled to compensation upon termination of their involvement with the Company.
Non-executive directors’ fees
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive directors, taking into account the level of fees paid by
companies of a similar size and standing. Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any Group pension scheme nor
will they be granted any awards under the Company’s option schemes or annual bonus plan.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board as a whole (excluding the Chairman) and not by the Remuneration
Committee. The Board believes that this procedure is appropriate for the Company.

It is the Committee’s policy that, in appropriate circumstances, executive directors will be allowed to accept outside appointments.

such outside appointments currently exist.

No other directors have been granted options over shares of the Company.
No new options were granted and no existing options were exercised or lapsed during the year to 30 April 2005 (the gains on 
the exercise of share options during the year to 30 April 2004, calculated on the difference between the exercise price and the
closing market price on the day of exercise, totalled £214,000). There have been no movements in directors’ share options since 
30 April 2005.
Each tranche of options granted to an individual was granted for a total consideration of £1. Options which are shown as being
exercisable from dates of 8 September 2003 and 10 January 2007 are subject to a performance criterion that, over a 3 year period,
the Company achieves real earnings per share growth averaging 2% a year, or more. Options shown as being exercisable from 
13 December 2007 and 13 February 2009 are subject to a performance criterion which requires real earnings per share growth
averaging 3% a year, or more, over a 3 year period.
The middle market price of an Ordinary share at the close of business on 30 April 2005 was 94.75p (2004: 119.0p). The highest and
lowest middle market prices of an Ordinary share during the year to 30 April 2005 were 122.75p and 83.5p respectively.
Performance graph
The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the Remuneration report to contain a graph showing the performance
of the Company and a ‘broad equity market index’ over the past 5 years. As the Company was a constituent of the FTSE Mid 250
Index at the start and end of the relevant period, this index is considered an appropriate form of ‘broad equity market index’ against
which the Company’s performance should be compared. Performance, as required by the Regulations, is measured by Total
Shareholder Return (share price growth plus dividends reinvested).
Pension contributions, tables 1 and 3 and related footnotes and paragraphs are audited information.

Source: Thompson Financial FTSE Mid 250 Index Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the directors
are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Photo-Me International plc
We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2005 which comprise the Group profit and loss account,
Group balance sheet, Company balance sheet, Group cash flow statement and related notes, Group statement of total recognised gains
and losses, Reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and the related notes 1 to 27. These financial statements have been
prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the directors’ Remuneration
report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements which are required to be prepared in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in
relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises the Report of the directors, the unaudited part of the directors’ Remuneration report, Chairman’s
statement, Chief executive’s review, Financial review, Board of directors and secretary and Corporate governance statement. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’
Remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 30 April 2005 
and of its profit for the year then ended; and
– the financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

for the year ended 30 April 2005 1 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards (UKGAAP). 
A summary of the more significant Group accounting policies is set out below.
The accounts for the year-ended 30 April 2006 will be presented under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as noted
on page 23. 
The Group continued to adopt the transitional arrangement of FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. FRS17 is not fully effective until
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2005,
together with the appropriate share of the results of associated undertakings and of joint ventures made up to 30 April 2005. 
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers
under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures. In the Group accounts, joint ventures are accounted for using the
gross equity method.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures, in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose
operating and financial policies the Group exercises a significant influence are treated as associated undertakings. In the Group
accounts, associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group accounts include income from current asset investments as follows; dividend income on a dividend received basis, 
and other investment income on an accruals basis.
Where the accounts of subsidiary, associated undertakings and joint ventures do not conform with the Group’s accounting policies,
appropriate adjustments are made on consolidation to prepare the Group accounts on a consistent basis.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 230 (4) of the Companies Act 1985.
(c) Foreign currencies
Group
The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves. All other
translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings 
to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are
taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises. Tax charges and credits
attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in reserves.
Company
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the
transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate. All differences 
are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they
are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the
exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences
on those borrowings are also dealt with in reserves.
(d) Goodwill
Goodwill or negative goodwill, which represents the difference between the fair value of net assets acquired and the fair value of
the amount paid, is capitalised in the balance sheet as an intangible asset. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over the
useful life of the asset with a maximum period of 20 years. Negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of companies is written back
to the profit and loss account evenly over the period in which the non-monetary assets are recovered. Goodwill relating to
acquisitions prior to 1 May 1999 was charged directly to reserves and, in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS10,
has not been restated.
If an undertaking acquired before 1 May 1999 is subsequently divested, the appropriate goodwill is dealt with through the profit
and loss account in the period of the disposal as part of the calculation of gain or loss on investment.
(e) Other intangible assets
Research and development expenditure is written-off in the year in which it is incurred where the commercial viability of the item
being developed is uncertain. Development expenditure relating to a specific project is carried forward when its future recoverability
can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Intellectual property, such as acquired patents and licenses, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Notes on the accounts
for the year ended 30 April 2005
41 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Notes on the accounts 1 Accounting policies (continued)
(f) Amortisation and depreciation
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis to write-off the assets at the following rates:
Goodwill – over the estimated life of the asset with a maximum period of 20 years;
Development expenditure – amortised in line with the expected future sales from the related project, 
with a maximum period of 4 years following commercial production;
Intellectual property – over the estimated life of the asset with a maximum period of 20 years.
Depreciation is charged on either a straight line basis or on a reducing balance basis to reduce the cost of tangible fixed assets 
to their net realisable values over their estimated useful lives at the following rates:
Freehold land – nil
Freehold buildings – 2% – 5% straight line
Long lease property – 2% straight line
Short lease property – over the lives of the leases on a straight line basis
Photobooths, etc. – 10% – 30% straight line
Plant, etc. – 12.5% – 25% straight line or reducing balance
(g) Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
When indicators of impairment exist, the carrying value of intangible and tangible fixed assets is compared to the higher of the
value in use and the net realisable value. If the carrying value exceeds the higher of the value in use and net realisable value, 
the asset is impaired and its value reduced by charging additional amortisation or depreciation.
(h) Leased assets
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account, as incurred, over the term of the lease. An asset
acquired under a finance lease agreement is capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
its estimated useful life, on a straight line basis.
(i) Derivatives and other financial instruments
Foreign exchange contracts
The Group uses forward exchange contracts as part of its strategy to minimise foreign exchange exposure. Usually such contracts
are of a short-term nature and cover foreign currency purchases. The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are off-set against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities.
Debt instruments 
Financial instruments, mainly loans, are utilised to raise finance for the Group’s trading operations. Interest on borrowings is charged
to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Interest rate swaps 
Interest rate swaps are recognised where an instrument changes the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to 
a fixed rate or vice versa. Interest differentials are recognised by accruing with net interest payable. Interest rate swaps are not 
revalued to fair value nor shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end. If they are terminated early, the gain or loss is spread
over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
(j) T axation
Corporation tax chargeable on profits assessed to taxation is provided for at current rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
(k) Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions and events have occurred by that date and which could give rise to an obligation to pay, or right to receive, more
or less taxation in the future with the following exceptions:
– Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not
that there will be adequate taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses from which the future reversal of
underlying timing differences can be deducted;
– Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of retained earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, associated undertakings
and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rate expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are expected to
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred taxation
balances are not discounted.
(l) Turnover
Turnover comprises the net invoiced value of sales to third parties and the revenue from cash takings in vending companies, 
stated net of value added tax.
Sales of operating equipment by the Group’s Manufacturing division to Group undertakings, which is then capitalised within the
accounts of Group undertakings, is excluded from sales as noted in the analysis of turnover (Note 2).
Revenue is recognised at the point of sale.
42 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Notes on the accounts (m) Own work capitalised
The Group manufactures vending equipment which is used by Group vending companies. This is shown in cost of sales as own 
work capitalised and this figure includes direct costs associated with manufacture and applicable overheads attributable to the
Manufacturing facility but excludes general overheads and administration costs.
(n) Investments
Investments are stated in the balance sheet at cost less amounts written-off.
(o) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows:
Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition:
Raw materials and consumables – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis
Work-in-progress and finished goods – cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based 
on the normal level of activity
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
(p) Cash and liquid resources
In the cash flow statement, ‘Cash at bank’ and ‘Overdrafts’ are balances with banks, repayable on demand. ‘Liquid resources’
include term deposit accounts and other investment instruments used by the Group to manage its overall cash position.
In the balance sheet, ‘Current assets – Investments and short-term deposits’ include liquid resources and other investments held 
for resale.
(q) Pension costs
Some of the Company’s longer serving employees belong to a pension scheme, which is closed to new entrants. The scheme is
funded by both employer’s and employees’ contributions and is of the defined benefit type. The defined benefits are based upon 
an employee’s years of service and final pensionable salary. The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of an
independent qualified actuary. Actuarial valuations are undertaken at least every 3 years. Any difference between the cost charged
and amounts paid by the Company is treated as a prepayment or accrual. Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and
loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives with the Company, in accordance with SSAP 24
‘Accounting for Pension Costs’.
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme for senior employees. One overseas subsidiary undertaking
operates a defined contribution pension schemes for employees. The profit and loss account is charged with the contributions
payable in respect of all such schemes.
Certain overseas companies are required by local legal circumstances to make provision for employee retirement. Provision for costs
are based on local circumstances, length of service and salaries of employees.

Notes on the accounts Fire loss
On 22 December 2004, the Group’s 62,000 sq ft warehouse and workshop building at Bookham was destroyed by fire, together
with its contents. The contents principally comprised minilabs for resale, spare parts and consumables, together classified within
stocks, and vending equipment being refurbished, classified as tangible fixed assets. The Group’s head office building, on the same
site, was undamaged.
The destroyed building and its contents were adequately insured and the directors are entirely satisfied that no loss will arise, either
in relation to the loss of stocks and tangible fixed assets or a loss of profits to the business as a result of the disruption caused.
The Group’s insurers have already advanced £10 million on account, in respect of the claim, which supports the directors’ view that
the losses are fully covered. Furthermore, since the insurance cover is based on replacement cost, a material accounting surplus
could arise. However, as the claim has not been finalised, no gain has been recognised in these accounts.
The cash flows in respect of the insurance receipts and payments in order to re-stock have been recognised in working capital
cash flows within the cash flow statement.

Notes on the accounts 8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated as the profits available to shareholders for the year divided by the weighted average number
of Ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all
dilutive potential Ordinary shares. The Group has only one category of dilutive potential Ordinary shares: the share options granted
to senior staff, including directors, as detailed in Note 20, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the
Company’s Ordinary shares during the year.
The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out in the table below:

All the Group’s creditors falling due within one year (other than bank and other borrowings) are excluded from the above 
tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as
taxation balances.
Included in the above analysis for fixed rate US Dollar denominated liabilities is the issued value of the US$ 3% (cumulative)
preference shares in Auto Photo Systems Inc. not owned by the Group, of £590,000 (2004: £636,000).
The Company has in issue 8,040,000 (2004: 8,040,000) Deferred shares with a nominal value of £201,000 (2004: £201,000) which
are non-equity interests. They have no voting and no dividend rights and can be redeemed for 1 penny in aggregate. They are not
shown in the above analysis.
Liabilities on which no interest is paid include other creditors, accruals and deferred income falling due after one year. In 2004, they
also included liabilities which were linked to research and development projects.

in accordance with approved limits on security and liquidity. Generally these are of a short-term nature and earn interest based on
current interest rates for such instruments.
Cash at bank and in hand includes non-interest earning cash and cash in transit.
Other investments consist of investments in equity. These are held for the long-term and, by their nature, they have no fixed maturity.

For the purpose of the above table, the fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying value
because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of all items have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value and book value of minority non-equity interests only includes the 3% preference shares in Auto Photo Systems Inc.
owned by the minority. It does not include the arrears of dividends which, together with the principal amount, are shown as non-
equity interests in the balance sheet.

(g) Currency exposures
Overseas subsidiary undertakings have local borrowings in their domestic currency and this mitigates the effect of currency
exposures arising from the net investment in overseas operations. Exchange differences on the retranslation of overseas net assets 
is recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group undertakings have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than
their local currency. Exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account.

Factors that may affect future tax charges
Based on current capital expenditure plans, the Group expects that capital allowances will be lower than depreciation charges and
that the deferred tax provision will reduce in the future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and the joint venture, except to the
extent that dividends have been accrued for in the parent company.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in future periods in which the timing
difference will reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets amounting to £4,985,000 (2004: £4,912,000) in respect of unrelieved tax losses, have not been recognised as
their future economic benefit is uncertain.

58 Photo-Me International plc 
Annual Report 2005
Notes on the accounts 25 Pensions
The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement schemes including both defined benefit schemes,
whereby retirement benefits are based on the employee’s final remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution
schemes, whereby retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees. 
Defined benefit schemes
The Company operates a defined benefit scheme for a few long-serving employees. This pension scheme (the Photo-Me
International plc Pension and Life Assurance Fund) is closed to new entrants.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of
triennial valuations using the Attained Age method. The most recent valuation of the scheme was prepared as at 1 June 2003 for
the purpose of SSAP 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs”. The principal assumptions which have the most significant effect on the
valuation were: investment returns on equities of 7.5% per annum, investment returns on gilts/bonds of 5% per annum, salary
increases of 3.5% per annum, and price inflation of 2.5% per annum. The market value of the scheme’s assets at the valuation date
was £4,055,000, representing 91% of the value of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected
future increases in salaries. 
The deficit identified above is being recognised over 10 years, being the average remaining service lives of employees. With
agreement from the actuary, the Company will make contributions to the Scheme at 13.1% of pensionable salaries for the year
ending 30 April 2006, plus an additional payment of £56,000 (2004: £51,000) to reduce the deficit revealed in the actuarial
valuation as at 1 June 2003, which is planned to be removed over a 5 year period.
The total pension cost (as disclosed in Note 4) amounted to £111,000 (2004: £100,000) and included an amount in respect of 
the amortisation of the deficit in the scheme as at 1 June 2003.
The next actuarial valuation of the scheme is due as at 1 June 2006. 
Other retirement provisions
Provisions for obligations to make termination payments on retirement, to staff who are not members of the pension and retirement
schemes, are included in provisions for liabilities and charges (Note 17), as follows:   
– The Group’s Japanese subsidiary undertaking, Nippon Auto-Photo K.K., has a retirement provision, based on employee’s length of
service with the company and their current salary. The allowance is paid to employees when they leave the company. This has
been provided for in full within the accounts.
– To meet the legal obligations within France, the Group’s subsidiary undertakings have retirement provisions which have been
valued by an actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Following the latest valuation in the year to April 2004, the
estimated obligation has been fully provided for within the accounts.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of these obligations is £296,000 (2004: £727,000).
Defined contribution schemes
The total pension cost for the year for defined contribution schemes (as disclosed in Note 4) is reconciled as follows:

In respect of the Company’s United Kingdom defined contribution scheme, £6,000 of contributions were outstanding at 
30 April 2005 (2004: £5,000).
Disclosures in respect of FRS17 – Retirement benefits
The above figures have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SSAP24. FRS17 “Retirement Benefits” will replace
SSAP 24 for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005. The accounting requirements of FRS17 are broadly as follows:
– Pension scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date
– Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high
quality (AA) corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability
– For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the pension scheme surplus (to the extent it is considered
recoverable) or deficit will be recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet; and
– The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit will be split between operating charges, financing items and, in the statement of
total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.

Notes on the accounts 25 Pensions (continued)
The transitional disclosures in respect of FRS 17 are set out below:
A full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2003 and updated to 30 April 2005 by a qualified
independent actuary.
The principal actuarial assumptions were:

Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.8 3.0 2.5
Discount rate 5.3 5.7 5.5 
Inflation assumption 2.8 3.0 2.5 
The Company contributions during the accounting period amounted to £85,000 (2004: £49,000) and the agreed Company
contribution rate for the coming year is 13.1% of pensionable pay plus an additional amount of £56,000 (2004: £51,000) to reduce
the deficit revealed in the actuarial valuation as at 1 June 2003, which is planned to be removed over a 5 year period.
The scheme is closed to new entrants. In accordance with FRS17, using the projected unit method for closed schemes, the
contribution rate underlying the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

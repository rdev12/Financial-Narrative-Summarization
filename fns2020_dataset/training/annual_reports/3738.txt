Cohort plc was established early in 2006 to take 
advantage of opportunities to grow a business in the 
international defence technical services market. 
The business ﬂ oated on AIM (the London Stock 
Exchange’s specialist market for growth companies) 
in March 2006 following the merger with Systems 
Consultants Services Limited (SCS). 
SCS is a leading independent defence technical 
services business based in Henley-on-Thames and is 
Cohort’s current sole trading subsidiary. Further 
targeted acquisitions of complementary businesses 
will follow, with the aim of building shareholder value 
over the medium term.
CORPORATE STATEMENT  2 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
I am pleased to announce this maiden set of results for Cohort plc 
since listing on AIM in March 2006. Cohort has traded in accordance 
with our expectations at ﬂ otation.
KEY FINANCIALS
In the year ended 30 April 2006, Cohort achieved turnover of £18.0m 
(2005: £14.6m) representing a 23% increase on the level achieved by 
Systems Consultants Services Limited (SCS), Cohort’s sole operating 
subsidiary, in 2005.
Group operating proﬁ t before accounting for the share of joint ventures 
and exceptional items was £1.8m (2005: £2.0m). This reduction was 
due primarily to an increase in staff costs as new revenue generating 
personnel and support staff were recruited to manage the increased 
scale of the business, provide a base for further expansion and meet 
the reporting and governance requirements of a public company.
Proﬁ t before interest and tax was £1.3m (2005: £1.6m), after accounting 
for the Group’s share of joint venture losses and exceptional items 
in relation to venture capital activities of £467k (2005: £401k).
As a private company , SCS had invested in some venture capital activities. 
At ﬂ otation, the decision was taken to provide fully for the maximum 
commitment to these activities so that Cohort could go forward 
on a ﬁ rm ﬁ nancial and strategic basis.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 3 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
The proﬁ t after tax and before share of joint ventures and exceptional 
items was £1.3m (2005: £1.5m). Proﬁ t after interest and before tax 
was £1.4m (2005: £1.6m) and proﬁ t after tax was £0.9m (2005: £1.1m). 
Basic earnings per share were 5.47 pence (2005: 6.97 pence).
The Cohort cash balance at year end was £5.6m, reﬂ ecting primarily 
the proceeds of the share placing net of costs.
DIVIDENDS
The Group plans to pay an initial dividend of 0.4 pence, being approximately 
one third of the dividend which would have been paid had the Company’s 
shares traded publicly for the whole of the ﬁ nancial year. This will 
be payable on 6 September 2006 to shareholders on the register at 
4 August 2006 subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting 
on 31 August 2006. The Group plans to follow a progressive dividend 
policy in future and to pay interim and ﬁ nal dividends in respect of 
the current ﬁ nancial year in March and September 2007.
BOARD AND PERSONNEL
We were pleased to welcome Simon Walther , who joined as Finance Director 
in May 2006. Simon has experience in the defence industry and in mergers 
and acquisitions as well as in the ﬁ nance function in a quoted company 
environment. This has released Andrew Thomis, who handled the ﬁ nance 
function during the listing, to concentrate on his intended roles in strategic 
and business development.
The new Board of Cohort, brought together speciﬁ cally to pursue the 
strategy of ﬂ otation followed by expansion, both organic and through 
acquisition in the defence technical services market, has bedded 
in well. The operating team under Stanley Carter is busy and productive 
and the transition from a private to a quoted company environment 
is being well handled. Whilst Stanley is in the day to day charge of the 
business, I am spending signiﬁ cant time with the Company, particularly 
in relation to acquisitions and business development.
OUTLOOK
Cohort’s business is at present largely concentrated in the UK defence 
market. In overall terms the market is reasonably stable but growth 
is concentrated in certain areas. The view set out at the time of ﬂ otation, 
namely that the provision of independent technical services to the 
UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) and industry is one such growth 
area, has been borne out by the many customer contact meetings 
which have been held since March. SCS has a strong business 
model and we will continue to push for organic growth. At the 
same time we will seek complementary acquisitions of businesses 
which can benefit from the Cohort group concept.
Overall the Board is positive about the outlook.
NICK PREST CBE
CHAIRMAN 4 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
The formation of Cohort, whose sole trading subsidiary is currently 
Systems Consultants Services (SCS), and its listing on AIM in March 
this year marked another successful year for SCS. It led to changes 
in the composition of the SCS Board and other senior posts and placed 
increased demands on SCS senior management. Despite the potentially 
unsettling effect common in these circumstances, SCS achieved 
a creditable 23% growth in revenue and 17% in gross proﬁ t. Employee 
response to the change in status of SCS and to the staff changes 
has been very positive and is reﬂ ected by the high take-up of shares 
and the SAYE share option scheme in June 2006. This augurs well 
for the continuing organic growth of SCS.
Notable contract awards won in competition during the year include: 
a year’s contract as part of a five year support agreement to the 
Joint Warfare Training Centre with SCS heading a consortium of EDS 
Defence and Titan; a two year exclusive agreement to provide support 
to the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency in the Hague 
with SCS heading a consortium of six companies; SCS’s key membership 
of a consortium of QinetiQ, Thales and others to provide human 
factors support in an exclusive pan-MOD agreement and SCS winning, 
with Roke Manor, an urban warﬁ ghting research support contract with 
the MOD Research Acquisition Agency. SCS continues to play a central 
role in two major Network Enabled Capability programmes: 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 5 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
the Land Environment Air Picture and the Joint Effects Tactical 
Targeting System in consortiums headed by Lockheed Martin 
and Raytheon respectively. Another notable contract was won 
to support the National Audit Office study into a major defence 
communications programme. The Company is alert to opportunities 
to apply its expertise in non-defence areas and was awarded a contract 
to supply crisis management advice to a cruise liner operator.
The recent and continuing trends to integrate and consolidate in the 
wider defence market have included the absorption of some private 
technical advisory businesses by major international defence suppliers. 
This has led to a signiﬁ cant reduction in the availability of impartial 
and independent technical advice available to the MOD and correspondingly 
increased opportunities to companies remaining in the ﬁ eld. Also the MOD 
has declared an intention to compete in future much of the research work 
historically mandated to QinetiQ, which will result in opportunities both 
in the research programme itself and in related advisory work. At the same 
time the sustained high levels of operational commitment of HM Forces 
coupled with a natural “front-line ﬁ rst” policy is tending to leave gaps 
in military technical posts in the MOD, which is already having to cope 
with reduced technical support arising from the signiﬁ cant reduction 
of the scientiﬁ c civil service brought about by privatisation. All of these 
factors have beneﬁ ted the Group and will continue to do so in the future.
I am conﬁ dent that the comprehensive, ﬁ rst-hand defence market 
knowledge and experience of the Cohort team make it well able 
to recognise and respond to these and future trends and to meet 
the increasing need for independent technical advice and support.

The Directors submit their report and the audited ﬁ nancial statements of Cohort plc (registered number: 05684823) for the year ended 30 April 2006.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activity of the Group is as a provider of independent technical 
consultancy support and services, primarily although not exclusively to the defence sector.
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND RELATED MATTERS
The Company was incorporated on 23 January 2006 as Cohort plc with an authorised share capital of 2,000,000 £1 ordinary shares.
On 9 February 2006 the authorised share capital was increased to £4,000,000 by the creation of 2,000,000 new £1 ordinary shares.
On 9 February 2006, one £1 ordinary share in the Company was issued, credited as fully paid to each of A E S Carter (Director), J W Lyde 
and J D Tydeman (all three being the owners of System Consultants Services Limited (SCS)). A further 1,583,997 £1 ordinary shares were 
issued to the owners of SCS in return for the entire share capital of SCS (see note 17).
Shares were issued to the other Directors of the Company as follows:
      Number of  
     Date of issue shares issued
A S Thomis     9 February 2006 22,230
Sir Robert Walmsley     9 February 2006 16,670
All shares were issued as credited, fully paid. On 9 February 2006, the authorised and issued £1 ordinary shares were sub-divided into ten ordinary 
shares of 10 pence each, creating authorised share capital of 40,000,000 10 pence ordinary shares. 
On 15 February 2006, 1,959,580 10 pence ordinary shares were issued as credited, fully paid to N M Prest. Of N M Prest’s holding, 979,790 10 pence 
ordinary shares were issued as credited, fully paid in return for an unsecured receivable of £750,000, payable at a date no later than 31 January 2007. 
261,276 of N M Prest’s issued share capital was to his wife. Further interests of the Directors are disclosed in note 23.
The combination of Cohort plc and SCS has been accounted for as a merger. In accordance with merger accounting, the results of the Group have 
been reported for the year ended 30 April 2006 with comparatives for the corresponding period restated accordingly.
The Group’s performance was in line with expectations. The Group’s performance and future developments, including acquisition strategy are 
further explained in the Chairman’s Statement (pages 2 and 3) and the Chief Executive’s Review (pages 4 and 5).
The trading performance of the Group represents the trading result of the Group’s 100% subsidiary SCS less the corporate costs of the Company.
The operating result includes the Group’s share of the losses of its joint venture investments, 50% of SCS Mothership Limited (SML) and 25% 
of Digital Millennium Map LLP (DMM). The 2005 ﬁ nancial statements have been restated accordingly. The exceptional items (see note 3) arise 
from losses on costs accrued by related parties (see note 23), sale of the Group’s freehold property to The Court House Partnership and 
release of provision in respect of joint ventures where the loss is now recognised in the Group’s share of joint ventures. A E S Carter is a partner 
in The Court House Partnership (see note 23).
Other relationships with related parties exist and are explained in detail in note 23. The actual and committed investment in these related 
parties is fully provided for at 30 April 2006.
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share are disclosed in the proﬁ t and loss account statement. In addition, note 9 shows an earnings 
per share before exceptional items of 6.77 pence (2005: 8.77 pence).
The Group has a prudent approach to revenue risk and any work done at risk is minimal, authorised at the appropriate level and reviewed 
on a monthly basis. The calibre of the Group’s customers and the control processes in respect of revenue capture and invoicing ensures minimal 
bad debts. The 2006 bad debt charge was £6,000 (2005: £Nil) on Group turnover of £17.8m (2005: £14.4m).
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND RELATED MATTERS (CONTINUED)
The Group takes a very prudent approach to the management of its ﬁ nancial instruments which are described in note 15. The Group’s cash is 
held with at least AA rated institutions and on deposits not exceeding one month. This ensures very low risk to capital and a reasonable balance 
of liquidity against interest earned on cash deposits.
The ﬁ nance lease asset (see note 23) is in respect of a camera purchased by the Group and leased to DMM over a three year period.
The Group’s primary cost risk is in respect of staff utilisation. This risk is managed by retaining a minimal core staff, essential for business 
support, development and delivering key skills to customers. The majority of deliverable service is provided by non-core staff (associates) 
where cost is only incurred when the associates are on task earning revenue for the Group.
The Group has a small number of ﬁ xed price contracts which are managed by speciﬁ cally tasked project management and reviewed 
on a monthly basis for ﬁ nancial performance and risk to recognised margin. The recognised margins are prudently traded taking account 
of risks and costs to completion.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁ nancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position 
of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.

against the Group and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
PROPOSED DIVIDEND
The proﬁ t after tax was £919,000 (2005: £1,104,000). The Directors recommend a ﬁ nal dividend of 0.4 pence per 10 pence ordinary share.
During the year a dividend of £158,833 was paid by SCS to its owners, A E S Carter, J W Lyde and J D Tydeman prior to the merger with 
Cohort plc (see note 23).

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) 11 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
INTRODUCTION
Cohort plc was listed on AIM on 8 March 2006. The Group is neither required to comply with the 2003 FRC Combined Code (the Code) 
nor issue a statement of compliance with it. Nevertheless, the Board fully supports the principles set out in the Code and is in the process 
of complying wherever possible, having regard to the size of the Company and the resources available to it. Details are provided below 
of how the Company applies the Code.
THE BOARD
The Board of Directors comprises three Executive Directors and two independent Non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman. 
The Chairman (N M Prest) has a consultancy agreement with the Company (see Remuneration Committee Report) to provide services, primarily 
in respect of strategic business development and acquisition activity. This agreement allows for a minimum of 20 days’ service in any one year.
The Board considers Sir Robert Walmsley to be the senior independent Director.
The Board generally meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors together 
with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility for formulating, reviewing 
and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established two committees: Audit and Remuneration, all having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors and is scheduled to meet twice a year . It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide 
formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the ﬁ nancial reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst 
maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditor of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement of the Code that at 
least one member has relevant ﬁ nancial experience, the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee. 
The independent auditor liaises with the Audit Committee regarding work to be undertaken and complies with the Ethical Standards for Auditors 
issued by the Auditing Practice Board. Each year, prior to commencing its audit work, the independent auditor conﬁ rms in writing the nature of 
its non-audit work on behalf of the Group and the safeguards in place to ensure its independence and objectivity.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors, and is scheduled to meet at least once a year. It is the Remuneration 
Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual Directors.
SHAREHOLDER RELATIONS
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and will use the Annual General Meeting to encourage 
communication with private shareholders. In addition, the Company intends to use the Annual Report and Accounts, interim statement and 
web site (www.cohortplc.com) to provide further information to shareholders.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on behalf of the 
Board, the Audit Committee will review the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the risks potentially 
affecting the Group and from discussions with the external auditors. 
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level of Director 
review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year, reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared against 
budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 12 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 13 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements on pages 14 to 28. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements. We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁ nancial statements. 
This other information comprises the Corporate Statement, Highlights, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Board of Directors, 
Corporate Governance Report, Remuneration Committee Report and the Notice of the Annual General Meeting. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the ﬁ nancial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion: 
•  the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the Group’s and parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2006 and of the Group’s proﬁ t for the year then ended and have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
For the year ended 30 April 2006 18 Cohort plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
ACCOUNTING PERIOD
The Company has drawn up its accounts for the period from incorporation on 23 January 2006 to 30 April 2006. The Group has adopted merger 
accounting and presents accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 with comparatives restated accordingly for the year ended 30 April 2005.
CONSOLIDATION
The Company has adopted merger accounting and presented Group results for the year ended 30 April 2006.
In preparing the Group accounts, the Group’s interest in joint ventures has been accounted for in accordance with the gross equity method 
and the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The comparative ﬁ gures for the Group are the audited accounts for Systems Consultants Services Limited (SCS, the 100% subsidiary of the Company) 
for the year ended 30 April 2005 as restated for changes in accounting methods in preparing Group accounts. The impact of this accounting 
change and the restatement which arises from the change is the recognition of the Group’s share of losses in joint ventures and is further 
explained in note 11.
The Company has not presented its own proﬁ t and loss account, as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful life of assets which are reviewed annually. The rate of depreciation 
for equipment, ﬁ xtures and ﬁ ttings is 25% per annum of cost on a straight line basis. For the property sold in the year, the depreciation rate was 
2% per annum of cost (excluding land) on a straight line basis.
FINANCE LEASE
The Group has a ﬁ nance lease asset receivable from its 25% joint venture undertaking, Digital Millennium Map LLP . In this instance, where the 
Group acts as a lessor and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the related assets are transferred to the lessee, the net present 
value of the future lease payments are recognised as a debtor and the interest value is recognised over the period which it is earned on an actuarial basis. 
OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the beneﬁ ts and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against 
proﬁ ts on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁ ts and its results as stated in the ﬁ nancial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based 
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS
Payments are made to the Company’s stakeholder pension scheme, a deﬁ ned contribution scheme. Amounts are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account 
as incurred.
TURNOVER
Turnover represents amounts receivable for the provision of services, excluding Value Added Tax. In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force 40 
(Revenue recognition and service contracts), the Group recognises contract revenue as the activity progresses to reﬂ ect the partial performance 
of contractual obligations.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Income and expenditure arising on ﬁ nancial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis and credited or charged to the proﬁ t and loss account 
in the ﬁ nancial period to which they relate.

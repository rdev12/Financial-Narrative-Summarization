The Group has made good progress on delivering 
its strategic objectives, with the successful integration 
of the Vado business acquired in March 2013 driving 
excellent revenue and profit growth.
Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am pleased to report that Norcros has 
made significant progress during the year to 
31 March 2014, recording a fifth consecutive 
year of revenue and underlying operating 
profit growth. Despite mixed market conditions 
in the UK and a challenging environment in 
South Africa, Group revenue from continuing 
operations grew by 9.2% and by 16.6% on a 
constant currency basis. Underlying operating 
profit from continuing operations was 
25.5% higher at £16.1m.
The Group has made good progress on 
delivering its strategic objectives, with the 
successful integration of the Vado business 
acquired in March 2013 driving excellent 
revenue and profit growth. Tight cost 
control and cash management across all 
our businesses improved underlying return 
on capital employed from continuing 
operations to 15.0% (2013: 12.6%), towards 
the top end of our strategic target. The 
disposal of Johnson Tiles Australia 
announced in March 2014 and completed 
on 30 May 2014 now allows management 
to fully focus on its target geographies of 
the UK, Africa and the Middle East. We will 
continue to seek out opportunities to 
expand the Group through a combination 
of organic growth initiatives and acquisition 
of businesses in our target geographies and 
product groups.
Strong conversion of operating profit to 
cash meant that net debt at the end of the 
year was lower at £26.9m (2013: £30.7m), 
representing leverage of just 1.2x EBITDA, 
leaving the Group well placed to execute 
its growth strategy. 
Further progress on the Group’s legacy 
issues has also been made in the year 
with the agreement to sub-let the vacant 
surplus leasehold property at Groundwell, 
Swindon, to Network Rail. It is, however, 
disappointing to report that the sale of part 
of our surplus freehold land at Tunstall to 
Morrisons has not proceeded as expected.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for the year of 0.34p (2013: 0.305p) per share. 
When added to the interim dividend of 0.17p 
(2013: 0.155p) per share which was paid on 
9 January 2014 this will make the total dividend 
for the year 0.51p (2013: 0.46p) per share, 
a 10.9% increase on the previous year.
Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary 
responsibilities is to ensure that the 
Group operates to the highest standards 
in all aspects of governance and risk 
management. Our aim within Norcros is 
to manage a growing business effectively, 
while ensuring that proper operating 
procedures and internal controls are

maintained at all times. Transparency 
is central to this objective and you will 
find more detail about our approach and 
progress over the last year in the Corporate 
Governance section. The Remuneration 
Committee Report is in accordance with the 
new reporting requirements of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies Regulations 
which came into force in October 2013.
Board changes
In September 2013, Vijay Aggarwal 
resigned from the Board. Mr Aggarwal 
had been a Non-executive Director of the 
Company since October 2009 and has 
represented Lifestyle Investments Pvt Ltd, 
which was also a significant shareholder 
in the Company until its complete exit 
in September 2013. 
People
The people who work for the Group are 
undoubtedly our key asset and I am certain 
that the existing opportunities for long-term 
growth will ensure that our employees find 
Norcros a place where they will continue to 
enjoy rewarding careers. On behalf of the 
Board I congratulate them all for delivering 
another year of progress.
Summary
Norcros has continued its strong growth 
momentum and has again delivered a 
robust financial performance in line with 
market expectations. The Group remains 
in a strong financial position.
I believe that the Group will continue to 
make progress towards its strategic targets 
of doubling revenue to £420m by 2018 
through both organic and acquisitive growth, 
and achieving an underlying return on capital 
employed between 12% and 15% across the 
cycle. Underpinned by our strong brands, 
leading market positions and continued 
self-help initiatives focused on market share 
gain and operating efficiencies, I look forward 
to the future with confidence.

Group Chief Executive’s statement
Overview
The Group results for the year and 
comparatives have been adjusted 
to reflect the re-classification of our 
Australian business as held for disposal 
at 31 March 2014.
Group revenue for the year increased by 
9.2% to £218.7m (2013: £200.4m) and by 
16.6% on a constant currency basis. On a 
like for like basis, excluding Vado (acquired 
in March 2013) and Nortec (disposed of in 
November 2012), revenue was 4.5% lower 
on a reported basis, but 1.9% higher on a 
constant currency basis.
UK market conditions during the year have 
been mixed, with the trade sector recovery 
driven by improving new house build and 
housing transactions. The retail sector 
remained weak for most of the year 
although there have been signs of 
improvement in the last quarter of our 
financial year. UK revenue for the year at 
£148.0m (2013: £122.8m) was 20.6% higher 
on a reported basis reflecting the Vado 
acquisition in March 2013. On a like for like 
basis excluding Vado, UK revenue was 3.2% 
lower than last year with good progress in 
Triton Showers and Norcros Adhesives 
offset by lower revenue at Johnson Tiles. 
In its first year under Norcros ownership, 
Vado has performed in line with our 
expectations and although the comparatives 
are not reported in our results, revenue for 
the full year was 16.5% ahead of last year. 
This strong performance, together with the 
successful integration of the business during 
the year, leaves Vado well positioned to make 
further progress.
Despite a challenging market environment, 
our South African business performed well 
with full year revenue growth of 9.1% on a 
constant currency basis and 11.8% on a like 
for like basis (excluding Nortec which was 
disposed of in November 2012). A 19.5% 
weaker Rand compared to last year resulted 
in full year reported Sterling revenue being 
8.8% lower than prior year at £70.7m 
(2013: £77.6m) and 6.6% lower on a like 
for like basis.
Group underlying operating profit at £16.1m 
(2013: £12.8m) was 25.5% higher than prior 
year, with operating margins also ahead at 
7.3% (2013: 6.4%). This was achieved despite 
the weaker South African Rand which 
impacted reported South African profits 
by £0.4m. 
Strong cash conversion in our businesses 
resulted in closing net debt lower at £26.9m 
(2013: £30.7m) and leaves the Group well 
positioned for future growth.
Strategy
As reported in March 2013, the Board has 
set itself three strategic targets. These are 
to double Group revenue to £420m by 2018, 
to maintain revenue derived outside of the 
UK at approximately 50% of Group revenue, 
and to sustain a pre-tax return on capital 
employed of 12% to 15% over the economic 
cycle. I’m pleased to say that good progress 
has been made on a number of fronts 
towards these targets.
The acquisition of Vado has helped drive 
revenue growth of 9.2% in the year and 
16.6% on a constant currency basis. Vado 
has been integrated quickly and seamlessly 
into the Norcros Group, and has been 
Summary
Vado acquisition performing 
in line with expectations 
and well positioned to 
make further progress
Continued improvement 
in South Africa
Strong cash conversion 
in our businesses leaves 
the Group well positioned 
for future growth
Australian business disposed 
of on 30 May 2014 for total 
consideration of £4.2m
With our strong brands, leading market positions and 
continued self-help initiatives focused on market share 
gain, the Board remains confident that the Group should 
continue to make progress for the year to 31 March 2015.

significantly earnings enhancing in its first 
year of ownership. Furthermore, exciting 
synergy benefits between Vado and the 
rest of the Group are being developed, 
including Vado’s first ever range of top 
end electric showers aimed at high 
street bathroom boutiques.
Towards the end of the financial year, 
the Group entered into a conditional 
agreement to dispose of 100% of the share 
capital of Norcros Industry (Pty) Ltd which 
owns the Group’s Australian tiles business, 
Johnson Tiles (Pty) Ltd (JTA) to Kim Hin 
Industries Berhad (KHIB), a company listed 
on the Malaysian Bursa. This transaction 
was completed on 30 May 2014 for total 
consideration of £4.2m. This sale represents 
an excellent outcome for our shareholders, 
and allows management to fully focus on 
its target geographies of the UK, Africa 
and the Middle East. 
Property
Progress on resolving legacy property 
issues has been mixed. 
Excellent progress has been made 
through the sub-let of the vacant and 
surplus property at Groundwell, Swindon, 
to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited for 
the period through to 31 December 2018. 
This sub-lease will reduce the Group’s 
net cash outflow on legacy leases by 
approximately £4.0m over the five year 
period starting from 1 April 2014. There is 
no exceptional income statement charge 
or credit as a result of this transaction.
Progress on the conditional sale of surplus 
land at Tunstall, Stoke on Trent, to a subsidiary 
of WM Morrison Supermarkets plc (Morrisons) 
has, however, been disappointing. Following 
a contractual dispute, this transaction has 
not progressed as planned, and the Board 
continues to seek compensation from 
Morrisons as well as to investigate 
alternative buyers for the site. 
Summary and outlook
UK construction activity and an improving 
housing market has driven trade sector 
recovery during the year but the UK retail 
sector, as expected, is taking longer to 
benefit, although there have been some 
encouraging signs more recently. Whilst 
the medium-term outlook in South Africa 
is positive, the weak Rand continues to have 
an adverse effect on Rand profit translation to 
Sterling. Nevertheless, with our strong brands, 
leading market positions and continued 
self-help initiatives focused on market share 
gain, the Board remains confident that the 
Group should continue to make progress 
for the year to 31 March 2015.

Business model p8
Principal risks and uncertainties p22
The Board believes the implementation of 
this strategy will enhance shareholder value.
Organic growth will continue to be driven 
by capitalising on our leading market 
positions in the UK and South Africa. Our 
strategic initiatives will ensure we maintain 
the provision of innovative new product 
programmes, excellent customer service 
and investment in our brand portfolio. We 
will also reinforce our “designed and built 
in Britain” credentials as well as capture the 
growth opportunities in South Africa and 
sub-Saharan Africa, where medium-term 
growth rates are likely to be higher than the 
more developed markets. We will continue 
to drive faster revenue growth in our existing 
export markets and develop new emerging 
export opportunities.
Acquisitions will be targeted at complementary 
market and industry segments exhibiting 
attractive returns on capital which are likely 
to be bathroom and kitchen products with 
exposure to commercial and specification 
segments. The acquisition of Vado in 2013 
represents a first step in this approach.

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Group accounts Parent Company accounts
Revenue increased in the year by 20.6% 
to £148.0m (2013: £122.8m) reflecting the 
Vado acquisition in March 2013. On a like 
for like basis excluding Vado, UK revenue was 
3.2% lower than last year with good progress 
in Triton Showers and Norcros Adhesives 
offset by lower revenue in Johnson Tiles. 
Underlying operating profit increased to 
£14.2m (2013: £11.9m) with margins broadly 
maintained at 9.6% (2013: 9.7%). This is a 
strong performance given the mixed market 
conditions which have prevailed and the 
retail destocking effects which impacted 
Johnson Tiles performance in the period.
Triton Showers
Triton, our UK domestic shower business, 
has maintained its market leading position 
despite a flat UK market and continued 
tough conditions in the Irish market, with 
revenue for the year 1.6% higher at £51.9m 
(2013: £51.1m).
In the UK, revenue for the year was 2.4% 
ahead of prior year and, excluding the 
effect of some low margin business exited 
last year, was 4.2% higher. Trade sector 
revenue was in line with last year and 
excluding the exit of marginal business last 
year was 4.4% higher. Revenue in the retail 
sector grew by 4.5% reflecting the success 
of Triton’s category management approach 
and promotional programmes. 
Export revenue, which represents 
approximately 13% of overall revenue, was 
3.4% lower compared to prior year. The 
primary export market for Triton is Ireland, 
and although revenue was lower than last 
year, this is a respectable performance 
given the Irish shower market is estimated 
to have halved since 2007.
Performance of the thermostatic electric 
products for the care market including the 
Safeguard and T150 range has been 
encouraging. This success should be further 
underpinned by the recently launched 
Safeguard+ range with the unique grab rail 
shower kit and remote on/off control. 
This new product range forms the central 
pillar of the newly launched “Inclusive 
Showering” product offering. This new 
range has been extremely well received 
across all of Triton’s trade customers. Its 
success reflects the investment and 
research with both industry respected 
occupational therapists and the Royal 
National Institute for the Blind to develop 
a product range suitable for people with 
additional needs, but at the same time 
acceptable to the whole market, hence 
the concept of “Inclusive Showering”.
The T80Z Fast Fit range, which focuses 
on the increased speed of fit for installers, 
continues to gain momentum and has 
grown substantially in both merchant 
and electrical wholesale segments. 
Margins and profits were higher than 
last year, reflecting input cost reductions 
combined with an improvement in revenue 
mix. The business continued to be strongly 
cash generative. 
Vado
Vado, which was acquired on 31 March 2013, 
is our leading manufacturer of taps, mixer 
showers, bathroom accessories and valves. 
Vado recorded revenue of £29.1m for the 
period, 16.5% higher than last year (although 
not under Norcros ownership last year and 
not included in our comparatives). 
UK revenue was 22.6% higher than the prior 
year with strong performances in both the 
retail and trade sectors. UK retail revenue 
was 19.7% higher, reflecting the success of 
the Vado Partnership Programme which 
was launched last year and stronger 
relationships with buying groups increasing 
brand penetration. UK trade revenue was 
26.1% higher benefitting from increased 
business from existing customers as well as 
new specification wins including St. George 
(part of Berkeley Group Holdings plc) 
and Redrow. 
Export revenue, which accounts for 
approximately 42% of overall revenue, was 
9.1% higher with encouraging growth both 
in the specification and retail sectors in the 
Middle East and Africa more than offsetting 
a large project in Hong Kong in the first half 
of last year that was not repeated this year.
Revenue and gross margins increased in the 
period with further revenue investment made 
in sales resource and marketing initiatives to 
support future growth. Underlying operating 
profit for the year was in line with expectations 
and higher than prior year.
In January 2014, Vado opened the 
Hydrologics Studio, its new customer 
training facility. This innovative facility 
is designed to increase customers’ 
understanding of the Vado business, 
its product range and the brand. Early 
customer reaction has been very positive. 
Investment in product development 
remains key to Vado’s strategy with 
two new tap ranges launched in 2013 
alongside an enhancement of their 
core shower offering, all of which 
has contributed to the strong growth 
momentum of the business. 
Integration of the Vado business into 
the Group was completed quickly and 
seamlessly following acquisition, and a 
number of exciting incremental revenue 
initiatives with other Group companies 
are progressing well.

Johnson Tiles
Johnson Tiles, the UK market leading 
ceramic tile manufacturer and a market 
leader in the supply of both own 
manufactured and imported tiles, saw 
revenue decrease by 8.4% to £61.7m 
(2013: £67.3m). 
In the UK revenue fell by 12.6% with 
a decline in the retail sector more than 
offsetting growth in the trade sector. UK 
retail revenue was 21.4% lower than last 
year reflecting tough comparatives with last 
year benefitting from the significant pipeline 
fill for the B&Q tile range review, together 
with weaker sales and destocking by a 
number of large retail customers in the year. 
UK trade revenue has continued to improve, 
particularly in the second half of the year, 
and was 3.4% ahead of last year. This reflected 
improved market conditions with increased 
activity from house builders and increased 
specification business following last year’s 
refurbishment of the Material Lab and the 
launch of the new, specification focused 
website in September 2013. Notable 
successes in the period include further 
specifications with Marks and Spencer, 
John Lewis, Premier Inn and Costa Coffee.
Export revenue, which represents 
approximately 13% of overall revenue, 
increased by 32.7%. This was driven by the 
successful introduction of a new large format 
ink jet range in the French retailer Leroy Merlin 
combined with a strong contract performance 
in the Middle East. These projects included 
the Supreme Court in Muscat Oman, Al Barsha 
Tower project in UAE, Saudi Embassy in Cairo 
and the Geant Hypermarket in UAE. 
Furthermore, a significant project at the 
flagship Waikiki Beach Hawaii Hilton Hotel 
was completed, where a 31 storey bespoke 
external mural panel was fixed. 
A major review and restructuring of the 
business was undertaken during the first 
quarter of the financial year following weak 
sales and destocking by a number of large 
retail customers. This resulted in a 
headcount reduction of 59 across all areas 
of the business and the closure of the USA 
warehouse operations. The majority of the 
restructuring redundancies were made by 
the end of the first half at a cost of £1.3m. 
Following a difficult first half which saw 
the business fall into a loss making position, 
financial performance in the second half 
substantially improved reflecting the benefits 
of the reduced cost base following the 
restructuring, coupled with growth in our 
trade and export business, resulting in an 
overall profit for the year, albeit lower 
than prior year. 
Norcros Adhesives
Norcros Adhesives, our manufacturer and 
supplier of tile and stone adhesives and 
ancillary products, continued its strong 
momentum and grew revenue by 21.1% 
in the year to £5.3m (2013: £4.4m). 
Growth in the year was driven by market 
share gain from significant new accounts 
in both the retail and distribution channels. 
We have secured a further three years of 
our exclusive specification with Barratt 
Homes and this will continue to drive 
take up in our distribution base.
Progress has been made in the year in the 
DIY multiples channel, a segment which 
had previously been difficult to penetrate. 
High quality products and our service 
proposition has proved successful in 
gaining our first listing, and our offering 
in this sector will further develop as range 
review opportunities become available 
in other retailers.
The launch of our new ready-mixed range 
in January 2014 has been successful 
with the new formulation receiving positive 
feedback from our fixer customers, driving 
greater levels of acceptance and penetration 
into this sector of the market. Our new 
wet-room backer board and adhesive system 
launched in April 2013 has capitalised on the 
growing popularity of this type of shower 
solution and our reputation as a “one-stop 
shop” for our customers.
As the business grows, it has been 
imperative that our manufacturing systems 
are robust to ensure that the quality and 
consistency of our products is maintained. 
To this end, ISO9001 accreditation was 
achieved in April 2014. 
Strong revenue growth and improved 
margins resulted in underlying operating 
profit higher than last year and at a record 
level for this business.
Business review continued
TAL recently developed a customised 
ultra-white mosaic adhesive to install 
colourful glass mosaic tiles at 300 on Kent, 
the new office building of the JD Group’s 
Financial Services business in Randburg.
The four storey building features a different 
colour scheme on each floor and this 
colour scheme is replicated in the 
bathrooms through the use of colourful 
floor-to-ceiling glass mosaics that are 
locally manufactured.
Glass products are very brittle and rigid 
and therefore require a flexible high-
strength adhesive system. “For this project 
a special ultra-white mosaic adhesive was 
developed to install the glass mosaics 
thereby ensuring that the aesthetics of the 
mosaics were highlighted,” says TAL’s 
technical representative, Schalk Pelzer. 
TAL Mosaicflex Ultra White is a rapid-
setting, flexible, high-strength and water 
resistant adhesive that allows the mosaic 
tiles’ bright colours to come to the fore.

Another strong year of growth in our South 
African business saw revenue 9.1% higher 
on a constant currency basis and 11.8% 
higher on a like for like constant currency 
basis (excluding Nortec which was disposed 
of in November 2012). The average exchange 
rate for Sterling to Rand for the year was 
19.5% weaker at ZAR15.97 (2013: ZAR13.37), 
resulting in full year reported revenue of 
£70.7m (2013: £77.6m), which was 8.8% 
lower than prior year and 6.6% lower on a 
like for like basis. Underlying operating profit 
for the year doubled to £1.9m (2013: £0.9m) 
despite a 19.5% weaker Rand adversely 
impacting Sterling reported profits by 
approximately £0.4m. 
Johnson Tiles South Africa
Johnson Tiles South Africa continued to 
make strong progress despite the impact 
of a much weaker local currency on energy 
and raw material costs. This was driven 
off the back of an excellent manufacturing 
performance. Independent sector revenues 
increased by 12.3% on a constant currency 
basis but, at £10.6m (2013: £11.3m), were 
6.5% lower on a reported basis. Further 
gains in the DIY sector have been achieved 
as we continue our successful strategy 
of importing ceramic tile products to 
complement our own manufactured 
product to create a “one-stop shop” for larger 
retailers, particularly Builders Warehouse. 
The focus of the last two years has been 
on operational improvements and it is 
therefore pleasing to report that the 
manufacturing plant is now operating 
extremely well and in line with our plans. 
The substantial progress in this area has 
been the key driver behind the significantly 
reduced loss in this year. The second phase 
of the profit improvement programme aims 
to improve margins via an improved 
product offer both in terms of design and 
format. This process commenced towards 
the end of the financial year with the 
successful installation of state-of-the-art ink 
jet printing equipment and the introduction 
of new larger format tiles which are due to 
be launched in Q2 of 2014/15.
The business is currently experiencing a 
legal strike by a number of employees at its 
manufacturing facility in Olifantsfontein. 
The strike involves members of NUM 
(The National Union of Mineworkers), who 
are currently the majority union in the plant 
and relates to a failure to agree a collective 
recognition agreement regarding employment 
terms. With the support of the minority union 
BCAWU, who have remained at work, we 
have managed to maintain production levels 
with minimal disruption to the business. 
Management remains confident that, in 
the absence of any escalation, they will 
be able to maintain budgeted production 
performance for as long as is necessary.
TAL Adhesives
TAL, our market leading adhesives business 
in South Africa, saw independent sector 
revenue grow 5.2% on a constant currency 
basis and an 11.8% decline on a Sterling 
reported basis to £17.1m (2013: £19.4m). 
On a like for like basis, excluding the 
Nortec business which was disposed 
of in November 2012, constant currency 
revenue growth was 16.7%. 
Improving markets and continued market 
share gain particularly in the DIY retail 
sector have helped drive South African 
revenue, whilst significant progress in sub 
Saharan Africa, particularly Zimbabwe and 
Namibia, saw export revenue grow 60.7% 
compared to the same period last year. 
Focus on product quality and technical 
support are fundamental to TAL’s success, 
and to reinforce this position, a £0.1m 
investment in a new laboratory at our main 
Olifantsfontein site was completed in the 
first half of the year, resulting in improved 
production control, product formulations 
and margins.
Underlying operating profits for the period 
improved compared to prior year and 
remain strong. 
Following the sale of the business and 
assets of TAL’s small but loss making Nortec 
business in November 2012, the premises at 
Spartan in which this business had been 
located and had been leased to the new 
owners for a short period were vacated. 
These premises were disposed of in the first 
half of the year, generating proceeds of 
£0.7m and a profit of £0.5m, which has 
been treated as an exceptional gain in the 
income statement. 
Tile Africa
Tile Africa, our leading retailer of wall and 
floor tiles, adhesive, showers, sanitaryware 
and bathroom fittings, saw revenue increase 
9.9% on a constant currency basis but 
reduce 8.2% on a Sterling reported basis to 
£43.0m (2013: £46.9m). 
Sales growth reflected a slower than 
anticipated Christmas period following 
shipping delays out of China of imported 
product required for our peak trading 
period. Notwithstanding this, Tile Africa 
delivered a strong underlying operating 
profit performance. 
The successful implementation of new 
inventory optimisation software is now 
delivering the expected benefits. Improved 
in-stock levels supported by increased 
investment in marketing have contributed 
to constant currency like for like store 
revenue growth of 13.6% in the year. 
Store relocations in Klerksdorp and 
Montana were completed in the year. 
Of our 29 owned stores, 23 have now 
been successfully upgraded, and our 
new store programme is progressing 
well, with new sites secured for 
Southgate and Vanderbijlpark.
Another strong year of growth in our South African 
business saw revenue 9.1% higher on a constant 
currency basis.

Summary
Group revenue increased by 9.2%

Group underlying operating profit 
of £16.1m was 25.5% ahead of 
the prior year

Net debt reduced to £26.9m 
from £30.7m
Revenue
Group revenue at £218.7m (2013: £200.4m) 
increased by 9.2% of which acquisitions and 
disposals accounted for 13.6%, with organic 
revenue growth of 1.9% and foreign exchange 
impacts accounting for a 6.3% decline.
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased by 
25.5% to £16.1m (2013: £12.8m). Our UK 
businesses delivered underlying operating 
profits of £14.2m against £11.9m, driven 
largely by the acquisition of Vado. Following 
last year’s return to profitability, our South 
African businesses generated an underlying 
operating profit of £1.9m (2013: £0.9m). On 
a constant currency basis the improvement 
in underlying operating profit in South 
African businesses was £1.4m. Group 
underlying operating profit margins 
improved to 7.3% (2013: 6.4%).
Non-underlying and exceptional 
operating items
Non-underlying costs totalling £1.8m 
(2013: £1.5m) were made up of £1.4m 
(2013: £1.5m) non-cash pension fund 
administration costs following the 
implementation of the revised IAS 19, 
‘Employee Benefits’, accounting standard 
and £0.4m (2013: £nil) arising from the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles 
relating to the Vado acquisition. 
Exceptional items of £1.5m (2013: £4.4m) 
predominantly related to costs associated 
with the restructuring exercise in our Johnson 
Tiles business undertaken in the first half of 
the year. A full analysis of both non-underlying 
and exceptional operating items can be found 
in note 5 to the financial statements.
Operating profit for the year after deducting 
non-underlying and exceptional operating 
costs was £12.8m (2013: £6.9m).

Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased to £7.0m 
(2013: £1.7m) although £4.6m of this increase 
related to the movement on fair value of 
foreign exchange contracts. Bank interest 
payable of £1.5m (2013: £1.3m) was slightly 
higher than the prior year and reflects the 
increase in average net debt following the 
acquisition of Vado.
Following the implementation of the revised 
accounting standard, IAS 19, ‘Employee 
Benefits’, the Group has recognised a £1.3m 
interest cost in respect of pension scheme 
liability (2013: £0.9m) which increased 
by £0.4m principally due to a higher 
opening liability.
Taxation
The tax credit for the year was £4.3m 
(2013: credit of £0.2m). Due to the continued 
strong performance of the Group, a further 
review of the position with regard to deferred 
tax assets was undertaken. As a result of this, 
the remaining unrecognised deferred tax 
assets in relation to both the UK and South 
African businesses of £4.4m have now been 
recognised in respect of tax losses and capital 
allowances, on the grounds that it is considered 
probable that the Group will benefit from 
these assets in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of these assets is likely to mean 
that future effective tax rates will increase 
to approximately 25% in the coming year. 
The standard rate of UK corporation tax 
from 1 April 2014 will reduce to 21%, with 
a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015, 
and the standard rate of tax in South Africa 
is 28% (2013: 28%). The Group’s effective tax 
rate is expected to be higher than the standard 
UK rate because of the geographic mix of 
profits and because certain expenses, such 
as amortisation, are generally not allowable 
for tax purposes.
(Loss)/profit from discontinued operations
On 25 March 2014, the Company entered into 
a conditional agreement to dispose of 100% 
of the issued share capital of Norcros Industry 
(Pty) Limited (NIPL), which owns its Australian 
tiles business, to Kim Hin Industries Berhad 
(KHIB). As KHIB is listed on the Malaysian 
Bursa, it required shareholder approval to 
allow the transaction to take place. This was 
duly received allowing the disposal to be 
completed on 30 May 2014, with total 
consideration of £4.2m being received.
A loss of £1.6m relating to this sale has been 
included in these accounts, which, together 
with the results of the year for NIPL of £0.2m, 
has been disclosed within (loss)/profit for 
the year from discontinued operations.
As NIPL represented a major line of business 
for the Group, it has been classified as 
held-for-sale in the consolidated balance sheet 
and its operations have been treated as 
discontinued with a single amount shown on 
the face of the consolidated income statement. 
Further details on discontinued operations are 
provided in note 29 to the financial statements.
Restatement of prior year results
As NIPL is no longer classed as a continuing 
operation the prior period has also been 
restated in accordance with the presentational 
requirements of IFRS 5. 
Furthermore, the introduction of a revised 
IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, accounting 
standard (see pension schemes below), also 
requires prior year results to be restated.
The table shown opposite demonstrates 
the impact of these restatements on the 
consolidated income statement.
Earnings per share
Underlying diluted earnings per share 
amounted to 2.8p (2013: 1.8p). Excluding 
the effect of deferred tax assets recognised 
in the year, underlying diluted earnings per 
share was 2.1p. Basic earnings per share 
was 1.5p (2013: 1.0p). 
Profit before tax
Underlying profit before tax was £14.6m (2013: £11.5m), reflecting the increased underlying 
operating profit noted above. Underlying profit before tax is reconciled as shown below:

Dividends
As previously announced it is the Board’s 
intention to continue a progressive yet prudent 
dividend policy subject to the Group’s 
earnings, cash flow and balance sheet 
position. As such the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 0.34p (2013: 0.305p) per 
share, which, if approved, together with the 
interim dividend of 0.17p (2013: 0.155p), makes 
a total dividend of 0.51p (2013: 0.46p) in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2014.
This final dividend, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be payable on 
30 July 2014 to shareholders on the register 
on 27 June 2014. The shares will be quoted 
ex-dividend on 25 June 2014.
Balance sheet
The Group’s balance sheet is summarised 
opposite.
Property, plant, equipment and investment 
properties fell by £7.6m, of which £3.8m 
was due to exchange rate movements. 
Additions in the year were £4.3m.
Deferred tax increased principally as a result 
of the full recognition of certain assets in 
the year, net of a reduction of £2.5m as 
a result of the decrease in the pension 
scheme liability.
Pension schemes
The Group contributed £2.1m (2013: £3.2m) 
into its UK defined benefit pension scheme 
during the year. This included deficit recovery 
contributions of £2.0m (2013: £2.0m) as part 
of the 2012 deficit recovery plan.
The gross defined benefit pension scheme 
valuation on the UK scheme showed a deficit 
of £21.8m compared to a deficit of £30.0m 
last year. The lower deficit reflects decreased 
liabilities due to a higher discount rate of 
4.30% (2013: 4.20%) and a higher than 
expected return on scheme assets.

Finance Director’s report continued
Pension schemes continued
During the year the Group implemented the 
revised IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, accounting 
standard and in line with the requirements, 
has restated comparative financial information 
accordingly. Whilst this had no impact on 
the value of the liability or net assets, the 
analysis of amounts charged to the income 
statement and other comprehensive income 
have changed. A summary of the impact 
is shown opposite.
Fund administration expenses of £1.4m 
(2013: £1.5m) which had previously been 
netted off actuarial gains are now included 
in the income statement. The method 
of calculating the interest cost has also 
changed leading to a finance cost of £1.3m 
(2013: £0.9m). Further details on the change 
in accounting policy are provided in note 1 
to the financial statements.
The Group’s contributions to its defined 
contribution pension schemes were £2.2m 
(2013: £1.2m) and have increased, as 
expected, due to the closure of the UK 
defined benefit scheme to future accrual.
Cash flow and net debt
Net debt decreased by £3.8m in the year to 
£26.9m (2013: £30.7m). A summary of the 
movement in net debt is shown opposite.
Underlying operating cash flow was £9.5m 
higher than in the previous year at £20.3m, 
as a result of higher operating profits and 
management of working capital. The Group’s 
working capital outflow was £2.6m (2013: 
£7.4m), principally reflecting investment in 
inventory at Vado and Tile Africa to support 
future growth.
Net cash generated from operating 
activities was £6.0m higher than in the 
previous year at £10.3m, largely due to 
improved underlying operating cash flow 
net of higher outflows in respect of 
exceptional items.

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Group accounts Parent Company accounts
Capital expenditure at £4.2m (2013: £6.7m) 
included a new tile press at Johnson Tiles UK, 
continued investment in tooling for new 
product in Triton Showers and a customer 
training facility at Vado. In South Africa, capital 
investment was in ink jet tile manufacturing 
equipment at Johnson Tiles South Africa 
together with store upgrades as part of the 
normal store improvement programme 
in Tile Africa.
Bank funding
The Group has a committed facility of £70m 
with a club of three banks, and headroom on 
facilities was £34.1m at 31 March 2014. This 
facility expires in October 2015 and is currently 
subject to a margin of 2% above LIBOR.
Foreign currency translation
Pre-tax profits from our overseas operations 
are translated at the average exchange rate 
for the year and balance sheets of these 
operations translated at the closing rate of 
exchange. The table opposite sets out the 
relevant exchange rates used.
The movement in average exchange 
rates compared to 2013 had the effect 
of reducing 2013 reported Group revenue 
and Group underlying operating profit by 
£12.8m and £0.4m respectively.
Key performance indicators
Management uses a full suite of measures 
to manage and monitor the performance of its 
individual businesses. The Board considers that 
its key performance indicators are the measures 
most relevant in monitoring its progress to 
creating shareholder value. The relevant statistics 
for 2014 and 2013 are shown opposite.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Norcros has a system of risk 
management which seeks to 
mitigate risks as far as possible.
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on the Group’s performance. 
The key risks to which the Group is exposed, together with 
the potential effects and mitigating actions taken pertaining 
to them, are noted on the next page.
_1_NXR_ar14_Front_[SM_MR].indd   22 24/06/2014   10:28:52   23 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Group accounts Parent Company accounts
Risk and description Potential effects Mitigating actions Change
Key commercial relationships 
Whilst the Group has a diverse range 
of customers there are nevertheless 
certain key customers who account 
for high levels of revenue. 
Many of the contractual arrangements 
with customers are short term in nature 
(as is common in our markets) and 
there exists some risk that the current 
performance of a business may not 
be maintained if such contracts were 
not renewed or extended, or were 
maintained at lower volumes due 
to a decline in economic activity.
The importance of relationships with key customers is 
recognised and managed by senior personnel within the 
Group who have direct and regular access to their 
counterparts at the highest levels of management.
Rebate schemes and incentive programmes help maintain 
these key relationships in a competitive market situation.
The Group stresses key selling points such as continuity of 
supply, financial strength of the Group and level of customer 
service to help maintain relationships. As well as an excellent 
product offering, the Group is also able to take care of 
customers’ sourcing, storage and logistics requirements.
The existence of a flexible cost base helps alleviate this 
potential risk in certain of the Group’s businesses.
None
Competition
The Group operates within a 
highly competitive environment 
in all its markets.
The Group accepts there is a risk to 
its results and financial condition 
caused by the actions of its 
competitors, including competitors’ 
marketing strategies and product 
development. 
To help identify such risks the competitive environment, 
specific marketplace and the actions of particular competitors 
are discussed at both Group and operating divisional board 
meetings. In addition each market is carefully monitored to 
identify any significant shift in policy by any competitor.
None
Reliance on 
production facilities
The Group has a small number 
of automated manufacturing 
facilities for the manufacture 
of tiles and adhesives. 
If any of these facilities (including 
technology used to operate them) 
were to fail, the effect on the Group 
could be significant. 
The Group has a well established ongoing preventative 
maintenance programme as well as a comprehensive “annual 
shutdown” programme throughout its manufacturing 
operations. 
Furthermore the Group has developed an experienced 
globally co-ordinated product sourcing function which could 
mitigate the risk of failure. 
Finished inventory holdings across the operations acts as a 
limited buffer in the event of operational failure. 
A business interruption insurance policy is maintained to 
mitigate losses caused by a serious event affecting 
manufacturing capability.
None
Staff retention and recruitment
The Group employs around 1,700 
people worldwide. 
The Group’s ability to grow and 
increase its market share depends 
significantly on its continuing ability 
to recruit and retain highly skilled 
employees in each area of its activities. 
Future growth plans may be restricted 
or delayed by difficulties experienced 
in recruiting and retaining 
appropriate staff.
Group policy is to remunerate its personnel in line with market 
rates and practice. In addition to competitive salaries there are 
annual bonus schemes, share options and other benefits offered.
Executives and key management are incentivised via an 
Approved Performance Share Plan (APSP) which was approved 
at the 2011 AGM. A second grant of options under the APSP 
took place in 2012 and a third in 2013. 
Succession planning is an agenda item at Group Board level.
The Group is able to offer employees appropriate training and 
opportunities for advancement and has a demonstrable track 
record of internal promotion.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Risk and description Potential effects Mitigating actions Change
Foreign currency exchange risk
A significant amount of the Group’s 
business is conducted in currencies 
other than Sterling (primarily South 
African Rand, US Dollar, Australian 
Dollar and Euro). Sterling has become 
stronger relative to the major 
currencies on the back of improved 
UK economic data.
The Group’s financial performance is 
subject to the effects of fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates.
The Group typically seeks to hedge its foreign exchange 
transactional flows for up to twelve months forward. 
The Group may, where it is considered appropriate, 
denominate some of its borrowings in other currencies to 
hedge translational profit and asset risk although this is not 
considered necessary at present given the level of earnings 
made by its overseas businesses at present compared to the 
Group as a whole.
None
Interest rate risk
The Group pays interest and other 
facility fees based on local base rates 
and LIBOR rates.
A significant increase in interest rates 
would affect the Group’s profitability 
and cash flow.
Given the current low interest rates negotiated as part of 
the refinancing of bank debts in 2011, it is not considered 
advantageous to enter into hedging arrangements for the time 
being. The Group’s interest rate risk is reviewed regularly by 
Executive Management and at least annually as part of the 
Group budget process. 
None
Pension scheme management
The UK companies in the Group 
participate in a defined benefit 
pension scheme. 
The Group’s financial results show 
an aggregate deficit in this scheme, 
as at 31 March 2014 of £21.8m 
(2013: £30.0m) assessed in 
accordance with IAS 19 (revised). 
There are various risks that could 
adversely affect the funding of the 
defined benefits under the scheme 
and consequently the Group’s 
funding obligations. 
The scheme was closed to new members and future accrual 
with effect from 1 April 2013 and replaced by an auto-enrolment 
compliant defined contribution scheme. Risks from rising costs 
of providing a final salary pension scheme have therefore been 
materially reduced.
Executive Management regularly monitors the funding position 
of the scheme and is represented on both the Trustee’s board 
and its investment sub-committee to monitor and assess 
investment performance and other risks to the Group.
The Group considers each actuarial valuation (annual IAS 19R 
valuation and each triennial valuation) to re-assess its position 
with regard to its pension commitments in conjunction with 
external actuarial advice.
Down
Energy price risk
Energy costs are a significant 
proportion of the Group’s 
manufacturing costs, especially in its 
tile manufacturing businesses.
Sustained increases in energy 
costs could significantly affect 
the Group’s profitability.
Prices are monitored on a regular basis and, where believed 
to be appropriate, a proportion of energy costs are hedged.
Energy costs tend to increase worldwide at similar rates; 
therefore competitors will generally face the same pressures 
of any sustained increase.
None
Additional capital requirements 
to fund ongoing operations
The Group must ensure it has 
adequate funding to meet capital 
demands within its current 
available facilities.
The Group’s current and forecast performance against its banking 
facilities in monitored regularly by the Executive Directors. This 
has historically shown there are ample facilities available to meet 
the current and future needs of the existing Group. 
The Group refinanced its facilities in 2011 and successfully 
increased the facility in 2013 by a further £19m on the same 
commercial terms to finance the acquisition of Vado. This facility 
remains in place until October 2015. 
None
Performance against 
banking covenants
The Group is subject to key banking 
covenants including interest cover 
and debt cover.
Failure to meet these covenants 
could result in the Group being in 
default of its banking facilities.
Performance against banking covenants is regularly and 
closely monitored and is a key element of the forecasting 
and budgeting process.
None

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Group accounts Parent Company accounts
Risk and description Potential effects Mitigating actions Change
Many of the products the Group 
sells are subject to changing 
consumer preferences 
The Group’s revenues and profits can 
be sensitive to these changing 
preferences. Failure to anticipate, 
identify or react swiftly to changes in 
consumer preferences could result in 
lower sales, higher mark-downs to 
reduce excess inventories and lower 
profits. Conversely, failure to anticipate 
increased consumer demand for its 
products may lead to inventory 
shortages, negatively impacting 
customer goodwill, brand image 
and profitability.
The Group invests significantly in sales and marketing 
including design, new product development and market 
research. All these are discussed at each operating divisional 
board meeting and are regular agenda items. Each divisional 
board has appropriate sales and marketing representation. This 
ensures the Group is aware of changes in the marketplace and 
can adapt resources accordingly.
None
South African operations 
Approximately one third of the Group’s 
activities are conducted in South Africa.
The Group may be exposed to risks 
outside of its control including political, 
social and economic instability, 
industrial action, unexpected 
changes in the regulatory 
environment, exposure to different 
legal standards or employment 
relations and potentially adverse tax 
consequences. 
In addition, the geographical spread 
of the Group’s operations means 
management co-ordination of effort 
and communications with employees 
are subject to certain challenges.
The Group Executives and Head Office finance staff are in 
regular contact with their South African counterparts via 
electronic communication. In addition Group Executives make 
regular visits to the Group’s SA operations and specific internal 
audit visits are made annually.
None
Management of property estate
The Group has several leasehold 
interests in properties which are 
no longer used by the Group.
In a number of cases the rent paid by 
the Group exceeds the rents received 
from sub-letting these properties.
The Groups maintains a leasehold provision specifically to 
cover these rental shortfalls. This was reviewed in 2013 and a 
further £3.0m provision was recognised.
The property portfolio is managed on a day to day basis by a 
property consultant who is engaged by the Group.
The Group seeks to enter long-term leases with tenants to give 
it as much security over future revenues as possible and 
minimise rent free periods and voids.
The lease for Drakes Way expires in 2014 and the Groundwell 
property has been sub-let until at least the end of 2018.
Down
Vado acquisition risk
The Group acquired Vado at the end 
of the last financial year.
Business performance may not reach 
expectations impacting Group 
profitability and cash flows. 
Key management have been incentivised to stay with the 
business. They participate with Executive Directors at monthly 
board meetings to monitor business performance.
The Vado Managing Director reports directly to the Group 
Chief Executive and there is regular dialogue between 
business management and Head Office finance staff.
The terms of purchase were such that a significant proportion 
of the consideration is deferred and contingent upon future 
business performance over the next three years.
The business has performed to expectations in its first year 
and has been successfully integrated into the Group.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability
The Board takes regular account of the significance of environmental, 
ethical and social factors affecting the Group and recognises that 
management of these matters is key to ensuring the long-term 
sustainability of its businesses.
The environment
The Board recognises the Group’s activities 
do have an impact on the environment. 
Norcros is committed to minimising this 
impact by continually improving its 
efficiency in terms of energy, water and 
material consumption. 
For example, Triton Showers has stringent 
targets to recycle, not just its products, but 
also all site waste. The target has been to 
get waste to landfill down to below 3 tonnes 
per annum from the height of 183 tonnes in 
2005. This target has now been met and is 
still dropping further. In addition, new 
product introduction is very much focused 
around more environmentally friendly 
products and ultimately with less energy 
and better utilisation of water. Triton has a 
number of “Eco” products included in their 
range and similarly the Vado business has 
recognised that saving water is increasingly 
becoming a focus for its customers and 
accordingly it has a range of products 
which specifically meet this objective. 
The Group aims to minimise its carbon 
footprint. Its greenhouse gas emissions are 
reported on in detail on page 52.
For further information on Norcros’ 
commitment to the environment and 
sustainability please visit the “Corporate 
Responsibility” section of www.norcros.com. 
Ethics
The Group aims to act with integrity towards 
all stakeholders in its businesses and respects 
the laws, regulations and customs in all the 
counties within which it operates. The Group 
makes every effort to ensure its employees 
are aware of, and comply with, the relevant 
business’ ethical code.
The Group has implemented an anti-bribery 
policy to comply with the Bribery Act 2010. 
Appropriate procedures are in place at 
each location to mitigate the risk of any 
employee committing an offence under 
this Act.
In order to ensure an open culture of legal 
and ethical compliance, all of the businesses 
in the Group have in place “whistleblowing” 
procedures, so that any concerns can 
be raised.
Social
Companies in the Group are encouraged 
to become involved in and support local 
initiatives where possible. 
An example of this commitment is in South 
Africa where Norcros SA supported a wide 
variety of charities, including disadvantaged 
schools, homes for the elderly and 
children’s homes as well as social 
organisations such as Round Table and 
medical research charities. Giving took the 
form of tiles and related goods as well as 
monetary donations. In addition to such 
donations from the company, staff were 
encouraged to give material items such as 
non-perishable food, blankets and clothing 
at various times and events during the year. 
In the UK, Vado is supporting local charity 
“Help The Child”, which aims to provide 
specialist equipment to improve the lives of 
local children with special needs and 
Johnson Tiles likewise raises money for 
charity through various events and supports 
a local special needs nursery and various 
local organisations.

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Group accounts Parent Company accounts
Employees
The necessity for, and importance of, 
good relations with all employees is well 
recognised and accepted throughout 
the Group. However, because the Group’s 
activities are organised on a de-centralised 
basis, with each operating business having 
autonomy over its operations, there is no 
uniform set of arrangements for employee 
involvement imposed throughout the 
Group. Nevertheless, all businesses in the 
Group are strongly encouraged to devise 
and adopt whatever means of employee 
consultation best suits their circumstances.
Norcros also recognises the need to 
train their staff in order to give them the 
necessary skills to perform their duties to 
the high standards required. The Group’s 
businesses invest in a range of development 
activities; for example Norcros South Africa 
is committed to invest at least 1% of its 
annual payroll in training and development 
initiatives, ranging from management 
development to adult literacy programmes. 
Training and development of employees is 
also high on the agenda at Triton Showers, 
every manager is given ongoing management 
training on key skills and Triton is also a 
strong supporter of vocational training.
In addition, Triton runs training programmes 
and local projects to help support our 
employees and their local communities. 
The Group is fully committed to keeping its 
employees informed about their work unit 
and the wider business.
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
towards disabled persons and therefore 
all applications from such persons are 
fully and fairly considered bearing in 
mind the respective aptitudes and abilities 
of the applicant. In the event of existing 
employees becoming disabled, every effort 
is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that appropriate 
training is arranged. It is the policy of the 
Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, 
as far as possible, be identical to that of an 
able-bodied person.
Gender of directors and employees
The number of people employed by the 
Group of each gender can be shown 
as follows:
Male Female Total
Company 
Directors 4 1 5
Other senior 
managers

36 9 45
Total 
employees 1,017 646 1,663
1  As defined by the Companies Act this category includes 
all employees responsible for planning, directing or 
controlling the activities of the Group, excluding 
Company Directors.
Our people are key to our success as a 
business and we value the individuality 
and diversity that each employee brings.
At senior leadership levels 20% of 
employees are female.
Prior to any senior appointment the 
Nominations Committee ensures the 
best person for the role is appointed 
and in doing so gives due consideration 
to gender and diversity.
Human rights
The Directors do not consider human 
rights to be a material risk for the Group, 
principally due to the existing regulatory 
frameworks in place in the UK and South 
Africa, being the primary geographical 
locations in which we operate.
Whilst the Group does not have any policies 
which specifically address human rights at the 
present time, our values focus on respect, 
integrity and fairness, and consequently we 
welcome the debate on the role of business 
in promoting human rights.

Corporate governance
The Board is committed to ensuring that 
high standards of corporate governance are 
maintained by Norcros plc and is accountable 
to the Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance. Its policy is to manage 
the affairs of the Company in accordance 
with the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code referred to in the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. For the year 
under review, the Company has complied 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued in 2012 (the “Code”) in all respects save 
for those mentioned within this statement. 
The following sections of this statement 
describe the Board’s approach to corporate 
governance and how the principles of the 
Code are applied.
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises a 
Non-executive Chairman, two Non-executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors, 
who are equally responsible for the 
proper stewardship and leadership of the 
Company. The Directors holding office at 
the date of this report and their biographical 
details are given on pages 28 and 29.
Taking into account the provisions 
of the Code, the Chairman and the two 
Non-executive Directors are considered 
by the Board to be independent of the 
Company’s Executive Management and free 
from any business or other relationship that 
could materially interfere with the exercise of 
their independent judgment. The terms and 
conditions of appointment of the Chairman 
and the Non-executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company. The letters of appointment set 
out the expected time commitment. Other 
significant commitments of the Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors are disclosed to the 
Board on a regular basis throughout the year.
The Board is satisfied that the Chairman’s other 
significant commitments do not prevent him 
from devoting sufficient time to the Company.
David McKeith is the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director. He is available to 
shareholders if they have reasons for 
concern for which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive or Group Finance Director have 
failed to resolve.
All Directors are supplied, in a timely manner, 
with all relevant documentation and financial 
information to assist them in the discharge 
of their duties by the making of well 
informed decisions that are in the best 
interests of the Company as a whole. The 
Board regularly reviews the management 
and financial performance of the Company, 
as well as long-term strategic planning and 
risk assessment. Regular reports are given 
to the Board on matters such as pensions, 
health and safety, and litigation.
Any concerns that a Director may have about 
how the Group is being run or about a course 
of action being proposed by the Board will, if 
they cannot be resolved once those concerns 
have been brought to the attention of the 
other Directors and the Chairman, be 
recorded in the Board minutes. In the event of 
the resignation of a Non-executive Director, 
that Director is encouraged to send a written 
statement setting out the reasons for the 
resignation to the Chairman who will then 
circulate it to the other members of the Board 
and the Company Secretary.
Chairman and Group Chief Executive
The positions of Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are held by separate individuals 
and the Board has clearly defined their 
responsibilities. The Chairman is primarily 
responsible for the effective working of the 
Board, ensuring that each Director, particularly 
the Non-executive Directors, is able to make 
an effective contribution. The Group Chief 
Executive has responsibility for running 
the Group’s businesses and for the 
implementation of the Board’s strategy, 
policies and decisions.
The Board is committed 
to ensuring high standards 
of corporate governance.

Board, Committee and Director evaluation
The performance of the Board is appraised 
by the Chairman. The Executive and 
Non-executive Directors are evaluated 
individually by the Chairman. The Board, 
led by the Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director, appraises the Chairman, and the 
Board evaluates the performance of its 
three Committees. Evaluation processes are 
conducted periodically and they are organised 
to fit in with Board priorities and succession 
planning activity. A formal evaluation took 
place in the year under review in accordance 
with the requirements of the Code. The 
Chairman is responsible for the review of each 
Director’s development and ongoing training 
requirements to ensure that the performance 
of each Director continues to be effective.
Advice for Directors
Procedures have been adopted for the 
Directors to obtain access through the 
Company Secretary to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
where that Director judges it necessary in 
order to discharge their responsibilities as a 
Director of the Company.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary who is 
responsible to the Board for ensuring that 
Board policies and procedures are complied 
with. Both the appointment and removal of 
the Company Secretary is a matter reserved 
for decision by the Board.
Board procedures
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision which 
it reviews periodically. This ensures the 
Board takes all major strategy, policy and 
investment decisions affecting the Company. 
In addition, it is responsible for business 
planning and risk management policies and 
the development of policies for areas such 
as safety, health and environmental policies, 
Directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration 
and ethical issues. The Board provides 
direction to the management of the 
Company, and it is ultimately accountable 
for the performance of the Group.
The Board operates in such a way as to 
ensure that all decisions are made by the 
most appropriate people in a timely manner 
that will not unnecessarily delay progress. 
The Board has formally delegated specific 
responsibilities to Board Committees, 
namely the Nominations Committee, Audit 
Committee and Remuneration Committee. 
The terms of reference of those Committees 
are published on the Company’s website 
at www.norcros.com. The report of the 
Nominations Committee is on page 36, the 
report of the Audit Committee is on page 33 
and the report of the Remuneration 
Committee is on page 37.
The Board will also appoint committees 
to approve specific processes as 
deemed necessary.
The Directors and management teams 
of each Group company are responsible 
for those business entities. They are tasked 
with the delivery of targets approved by the 
Board on budgets, strategy and policy.
Directors’ roles
The Executive Directors work solely for 
the Group and none has taken on any 
non-executive directorship. However, 
in appropriate circumstances, Executive 
Directors will be encouraged to take on 
one non-executive directorship in another 
non-competing company or organisation.
The terms and conditions of appointment 
of the Non-executive Directors are available 
upon written request from the Company. All the 
Non-executive Directors confirm that they 
have sufficient time to meet the requirements 
of their role. They also confirm to disclose to 
the Company their other commitments and to 
give an indication of the time involved in each 
such commitment. The annual evaluation 
process includes an assessment of whether the 
Non-executive Director is spending enough 
time to fulfil his duties. If a Non-executive 
Director is offered an appointment elsewhere, 
the Chairman is informed before any such 
offer is accepted and the Chairman will 
subsequently inform the Board.
The Board has suitable procedures in place for 
ensuring that its powers to authorise conflict 
situations are operated effectively. Such 
powers are operated in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association by means 
of each Director having a responsibility to 
notify the Board of any conflict situation 
and for the Board to deal with that situation 
as appropriate.
The Board ensures that all new Directors 
(including Non-executive Directors) will receive 
a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Company. As part of that induction 
procedure, the Chairman will offer to major 
shareholders the opportunity to meet a new 
Non-executive Director. The Chairman also 
periodically assesses the training and 
development needs of all Directors and 
ensures that any suitable training and updates 
are provided to Directors.
Retirement by rotation
Each of the Directors is subject to election 
by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment. Thereafter, 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, all of the Directors are subject 
to retirement by rotation such that one third 
of the Directors retire from the Board each 
year and each Director must seek re-election 
at intervals of no more than three years. 
However, the Board has decided that every 
Director should, where appropriate, offer 
themselves for re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting. Accordingly, each continuing 
Director will seek re-election at the next 
Annual General Meeting. Biographical details 
of all of the Directors are set out on pages 28 
and 29.
Financial reporting
When releasing the annual and interim 
financial statements the Directors aim to 
present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s results and 
prospects. The Directors have a collective 
responsibility for the preparation of the 
Annual Report and Accounts which is more 
fully explained in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 54.

Corporate governance continued
Relations with shareholders
The Company recognises the importance 
of maintaining good communications with 
shareholders. The Company takes a number 
of steps to ensure that the Board, and in 
particular, the Non-executive Directors, 
develops an understanding of the views 
of major shareholders about the Company. 
The Directors have regular meetings with 
the Company’s major shareholders and 
have regular feedback on the views of 
those shareholders through the Company’s 
brokers. Reports of these meetings, and 
any shareholder communications during 
the year, are given to the Board. In addition, 
the Company publishes any significant events 
affecting the Group and updates on current 
trading. The Chairman and the Non-executive 
Directors are also offered the opportunity to 
attend meetings with major shareholders and 
the Non-executive Directors, and in particular 
the Senior Independent Director, would attend 
such meetings if requested to do so by any 
major shareholder.
The Board regularly receives copies of 
analysts’ and brokers’ briefings.
The Annual and Interim Reports, together 
with all announcements issued to the 
London Stock Exchange, are published on 
the Company’s website at www.norcros.com.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
is sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. It is the Company’s 
practice to propose separate resolutions on 
each substantially separate issue.
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms 
should provide shareholders with the option 
to direct their proxy to vote either for or 
against the resolution or to withhold their 
vote. The Company ensures that all valid proxy 
appointments received for general meetings 
are properly recorded and counted. For each 
resolution the Company ensures that the 
following information is given at the meeting 
and made available as soon as reasonably 
practicable on a website which is maintained 
by or on behalf of the Company:
 — the date of the meeting;
 — the text of the resolution;
 — the number of votes validly cast;
 — the proportion of the Company’s issued 
share capital represented by those votes;
 — the number of votes cast in favour 
of the resolution; 
 — the number of votes against the 
resolution; and
 — the number of shares in respect 
of which the vote was withheld.
The Chairman seeks to arrange for the 
Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees (or deputies if 
any of them are unavoidably absent) to be 
available at the Annual General Meeting to 
answer those questions relating to the work 
of these Committees.
Accountability and audit 
The respective responsibilities of the Directors 
and auditor in connection with the financial 
statements are explained in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 54 and 
the auditor’s report on pages 55 to 57. The 
Directors ensure the independence of the 
auditor by requesting annual confirmation of 
independence which includes the disclosure 
of all non-audit fees.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness (covering all material 
controls including financial, operational, 
risk management and compliance). This is 
undertaken via an annual programme to 
review the internal control environment at 
each business unit. Each review is carried out 
by senior finance staff independent of that 
business unit. The results of these reviews are 
communicated to the Audit Committee.
The Board has identified and evaluated 
what it considers to be the significant risks 
faced by the Group and has also assessed 
the adequacy of the actions taken to manage 
these risks. This has been disclosed on 
pages 22 to 25.
The Group’s insurance continues to be 
managed and co-ordinated centrally with 
the assistance of insurance brokers. This 
gives the Group full visibility of both claims 
history and the insurance industry’s 
perception of the Group’s overall risk via 
the respective insurance premiums. The 
Company examines the size and trend of 
these premiums and the extent to which it 
can mitigate the risk and reduce the overall 
risk burden in the business by considering 
the appropriate level of insurance 
deductible and the potential benefit of 
self-insurance in some areas.
Operational structure, review 
and compliance
In addition to the Group Finance Director, 
the Group has Senior Financial Managers at 
its Head Office. The Board has considered 
whether the Company should have an 
internal audit department and has deemed 
that given both its risk management and 
internal control programme noted 
previously, together with the size and 
complexity of the Group, it is not necessary 
to employ such a department at the present 
time. The Board will, however, continue to 
keep this matter under review.
The key elements of the controls framework 
within which the Group operates are:
 — an organisational structure with clearly 
defined lines of responsibility, delegation 
of authority and reporting requirements;
 — an embedded culture of openness of 
communication between operational 
management and the Company’s 
Executive Management on matters 
relating to risk and control;
 — defined expenditure authorisation levels; and 
 — a comprehensive system of financial 
reporting. An annual budget for each 
business unit is prepared in detail and 
approved by the Group Executive 
Management. The Board approves the 
overall Group’s budget and plans. Monthly 
actual results are reported against budget 
and the prior year and the forecast for 
the year is revised where necessary. Any 
significant changes and adverse variances 
are questioned by the Board and remedial 
action is taken where appropriate. There 
is weekly cash and treasury reporting to 
the Group Finance Director and periodic 
reporting to the Board on the Group’s tax 
and treasury position.
The system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failing to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The control framework as outlined above 
gives reasonable assurance that the structure 
of controls in operation is appropriate to the 
Group’s situation and that risk is kept to 
acceptable levels throughout the Group.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group and that this has been in place for the 
period under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Takeover directive
Share capital structures are included in the 
Directors’ Report on page 53.
Going concern
The Directors consider, after making 
appropriate enquiries at the time of 
approving the financial statements, that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and 
accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis in the preparation 
of the financial statements.

Audit Committee report
Members
The Committee consists of all the 
Non-executive Directors including the 
Chairman. Biographies of the members 
of the Committee appear on page 28 and 29.
David McKeith, who is considered to have 
recent and relevant financial experience, was 
appointed as Chairman of the Committee 
when he took office on 24 July 2013, 
following the retirement of John Brown 
on the same date.
The Board is satisfied that the Committee 
has the appropriate level of expertise to fulfil 
its Terms of Reference. 
Responsibilities
The Committee is a sub-committee of the 
Board whose main responsibilities include:
 — reviewing the Company’s Annual and 
Interim Reports and other results 
announcements, including considering 
and challenging significant financial 
reporting issues and judgments;
 — monitoring the Company’s risk 
management and internal control 
procedures; and
 — overseeing the appointment and work 
of the external auditor.
The Committee also advises the Board 
on whether it considers the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s strategy, business 
model and performance.
Terms of Reference
The Committee’s Terms of Reference, which 
are in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, were reviewed and 
updated on 10 December 2013. A copy can 
be obtained from the Company’s website, 
www.norcros.com.
Meetings of the Committee
The Committee met formally three times 
during the year ended 31 March 2014. 
The Group Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Company Secretary and Group 
Financial Controller also attended each 
of these meetings together with the 
engagement partner and other members of 
the audit team from the external auditor. 
The Committee may invite other individuals 
either from within the Company or external 
technical advisers to attend meetings to 
provide information or advice as it sees fit.
At each meeting the Committee receives 
regular papers on incidences of fraud and 
whistleblowing and reviews any financial 
communications issued to the market.
Significant financial reporting matters 
in the 2014 Annual Report
The key area of judgment considered by the 
Committee in connection with the 2014 
Annual Report and Accounts was the 
valuation of the Group’s UK defined benefit 
pension scheme. In order to value the 
liability, management had engaged an 
independent firm of qualified actuaries. The 
Committee reviewed the outputs from this 
work and benchmarked the assumptions, 
particularly the net discount rate, with those 
applied by other companies with the same 
year end. The Committee concurred with 
the assumptions put forward by 
management to value the liability.
Role of the Audit Committee
The main responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee are:
 — reviewing the Company’s 
financial reporting;
 — monitoring the Company’s risk 
management and internal control 
procedures; and
 — overseeing the appointment and 
work of the external auditor.

a focus on controls concerning accounts 
payable, expenses and capital expenditure.
External auditor
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for making recommendations to the Board 
on the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditor. The 
Committee keeps under review the scope 
and results of the audit and its effectiveness, 
as well as the independence and objectivity 
of the auditor.
The external auditor, 
Pricewaterhousecoopers LLP, was 
re-appointed in November 2011 following 
a competitive tender process. The 
Committee has committed to conducting 
a tender process for the role of external 
auditor at least every ten years.
The Committee is aware of the need 
to safeguard the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and the issue is discussed 
by the Committee and periodically with 
the audit engagement partner from 
Pricewaterhousecoopers LLP. As required 
by Auditing Practices Board requirements, 
external auditor independence is maintained 
by the rotation of the engagement partner 
every five years. The current engagement 
partner, Mr. M. Heath, has been in place for 
three years. In addition to this, new policies 
on the award of non-audit work to the 
external auditor and the employment 
of ex-employees of the external auditor 
have been put in place.
The external audit starts with the design 
of a work plan that tackles the key risks 
of the audit which were determined at the 
November 2013 meeting of the Committee. 
At each meeting the Committee had the 
opportunity to discuss matters with the 
external auditor without management 
being present. The Chairman of the 
Committee also has regular discussions 
with the external audit partner outside 
the formal Committee process.
For the year ended 31 March 2014, 
the Committee was satisfied with 
the independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the relationship 
with Pricewaterhousecoopers LLP as 
external auditor. In the light of this the 
Committee has recommended to the 
Board that Pricewaterhousecoopers LLP 
be re-appointed for the forthcoming year 
and a resolution proposing this will be 
put to the 2014 Annual General Meeting.

Significant financial reporting matters 
in the 2014 Annual Report continued
Other areas of judgment considered by 
the Committee in connection with the 2014 
Annual Report and Accounts were as follows:
 — Valuation of acquired intangibles. As part 
of its consideration of Vado acquisition 
accounting, the Committee reviewed 
management’s assessment of Vado’s 
intangible assets. Due to the technical 
complexity of this area, the Committee 
attended a training session which was 
provided by the external auditor to assist 
it with its review. The Committee agreed 
with management’s recommendation to 
recognise an intangible asset in respect of 
the Vado trade name, together with the 
valuation of that asset at £5.4m and its 
useful life of 15 years.
 — Potential impairment of Johnson Tiles 
South Africa tangible fixed assets. The 
Committee reviewed management’s paper 
which considered whether a trigger for an 
impairment review was in evidence. Having 
reflected on the paper and consulted with 
the external auditor, the Committee was 
satisfied that no impairment trigger was 
present and consequently an impairment 
review was not required.
 — Recoverability of assets held in respect 
of the surplus Tunstall properties. 
Management had engaged an external 
surveyor to value the surplus Tunstall 
properties and based on this assessment 
determined that no impairment was 
required at this time. The Committee 
considered this report and agreed with 
management.
 — Deferred taxation. The Committee reviewed 
a paper from management proposing full 
recognition of the Company’s deferred tax 
assets in respect of capital allowances and 
trading losses. The Committee challenged 
the assumptions concerning the time period 
over which the assets would be utilised and, 
being satisfied with the responses, agreed 
with management’s recommendation to 
move to a full recognition basis.
 — Classification of assets held-for-sale. 
Given the disposal of the Company’s 
Australian tiles business which completed on 
30 May 2014, the Committee considered 
whether this business segment should be 
presented as discontinued in the Company’s 
Annual Report. After consulting with the 
external auditor, the Committee agreed 
with management that the Australian tiles 
business should be shown as held-for-sale at 
the balance sheet date and that comparative 
financial information, where required, should 
be restated to reflect this classification.
Internal controls and internal audit
The Committee undertakes a review, 
at least annually, of the effectiveness of 
the Company’s system of internal controls 
and the Board will take into account the 
Committee’s report, conclusions and 
recommendations in this regard.
The significant risks facing the Company, 
together with the actions taken to mitigate 
them, are highlighted on pages 22 to 25 of 
the Strategic Report. Lower-level risks are 
discussed at monthly divisional management 
meetings and highlighted to the Board 
as appropriate.
The Company operates a robust 
monthly financial reporting and forecasting 
process and an annual budgeting cycle. This 
incorporates several levels of management 
review to provide assurance that the data is 
reconciled to the underlying records, and 
each month’s performance and the annual 
budget is ultimately approved by the Board.
Transaction-level financial reporting 
risks are identified and managed by each 
business within the Group completing an 
annual self-assessment questionnaire, the 
responses to which are considered during 
the internal controls reviews. To bolster this, 
a new management representation process 
was put in place during the year requiring 
each division to confirm that all known 
material facts have been appropriately 
communicated to the Executive Directors.
Although there is no dedicated Group-wide 
internal audit resource, internal control 
work is performed by members of the 
Group Finance function who are appropriately 
qualified to undertake this type of work. 
Additionally, due to the particular risks 
faced by the Group’s retail and satellite 
manufacturing operations in South Africa, 
the Group employs a dedicated internal 
auditor focused on those risks. The work 
undertaken principally involves performing 
a cycle of Tile Africa store audits to ensure 
standard operating procedures are being 
followed and conducting internal controls 
reviews of other satellite facilities in southern 
Africa operated by the Group.
At its meeting in March the Committee 
considered whether there was a need 
to have a dedicated Group-wide internal 
audit function and concluded that due to 
the size and nature of the Company there 
is no requirement at the present time. 
The strategy for reviewing internal controls 
is discussed with the external auditor and 
agreed with the Committee. Findings from 
the internal control reviews together with 
any recommendations from the external 
auditor are considered by the Committee 
with improvements and weaknesses 
highlighted being followed up as

Nominations Committee report
The Committee evaluates the balance 
of skills, knowledge, diversity and 
experience of the Board.
The Nominations Committee and the Board 
seek to maintain an appropriate balance 
between the Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. The Nominations Committee is 
chaired by the Chairman and consists of all 
the Non-executive Directors. The Chairman 
will not chair the Committee when it deals 
with the appointment of a successor to 
the Chairmanship.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee 
are available for inspection upon written 
request to the Company and on its website 
at www.norcros.com.
The Nominations Committee evaluates 
the balance of skills, knowledge, diversity 
and experience of the Board. In light of 
this evaluation and, if deemed necessary, it 
determines the scope of the role of a new 
Director, the skills and time commitment 
required and makes recommendations to 
the Board about filling Board vacancies 
and appointing additional Directors. The 
Committee utilises external search and 
selection consultants as appropriate. The 
search for Board candidates will continue to 
be conducted and appointments made on 
the basis of merit and the most appropriate 
experience against objective criteria in the 
best interests of shareholders. In selecting 
candidates due regard will be given to the 
balance of the Board, and to the benefits of 
different backgrounds and experience, and 
to diversity on the Board including gender.
If a new Director is selected, the 
Nominations Committee will use the 
appropriate selection process. In the 
case of the appointment of David McKeith 
during the year under review, he was 
selected as a Non-executive Director 
from a number of candidates.

The Committee is focused on ensuring the Group’s 
remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ 
interests while also enabling us to attract, retain and 
motivate our executive leadership.
Year in review
As highlighted by the Board Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive in their annual 
reviews on pages 2 to 5, Norcros continues 
to perform strongly. Particular highlights 
include:
 — revenue growth of 9.2% (16.6% on 
constant currency basis) to £218.7m;
 — underlying operating profit up 25.5% 
to £16.1m;
 — strong performance of the Vado business 
in its first year of Norcros ownership 
(revenue up 16.5%);
 — continued progress with the South African 
business (like for like constant currency 
revenue up 11.8%);
 — disposal of the Australian business in line 
with Group strategy; and
 — continued progress on legacy pension 
and property issues.
This strong in-year performance delivered 
underlying operating profit in excess of 
the on-target performance level set by 
the Committee at the start of the year for 
the annual bonus, which resulted in annual 
bonuses of 54% of base salary being paid 
to Executive Directors for the year to 
31 March 2014. This will be delivered half in 
cash and half in the form of nil-cost options 
under the 2011 Deferred Bonus Plan.
The Group has also exceeded its targets 
for aggregate underlying earnings per share 
(EPS) over the period from 1 April 2011 to 
31 March 2014. As a result, 100% of the 
APSP awards granted in 2011 will vest on 
31 August 2014. The Committee considers 
this outcome to appropriately reflect the 
Group’s very strong performance over 
the period.
Remuneration Committee annual statement
Annual statement
Dear shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year to 31 March 2014. 
In line with the new reporting regulations, this report is split into 
three parts: 
 — this Annual Statement;
 — a Policy Report, which presents the Group’s forward-looking 
Directors’ remuneration policy; and
 — an Annual Report on Remuneration, which details how 
our remuneration policy was implemented during the year 
to 31 March 2014 and how we intend to apply the policy 
in the year to 31 March 2015.
The Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 
2014 AGM, while the Annual Report on Remuneration is subject 
to an advisory vote. The Remuneration Committee hopes you 
find the new layout to be clear and transparent and that we can 
count on your support at the AGM. 
The Committee’s overall approach to executive remuneration 
remains unchanged. We are focused on ensuring the Group’s 
remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ 
interests while also enabling us to attract, retain and motivate 
our executive leadership. We do this with a simple remuneration 
structure comprising base salary and benefits, an annual bonus 
and a single long-term incentive. Targets for these two incentive 
plans are set at challenging levels and provide a clear link 
between pay and our strategic objectives.
Ahead of the detail in the balance of this Report, I would like to 
outline key highlights of the Committee’s activities in respect of 
the year to 31 March 2014 and in setting our remuneration policy 
going forward.

Executive Director remuneration review
Since July 2010 when the current Group 
Chief Executive was appointed, Norcros has 
made substantial progress on several fronts, 
all of which have contributed to the Group’s 
market capitalisation increasing from c. £45m 
to c. £120m over the period. Key 
achievements include:
 — five consecutive years of revenue growth 
(£161.7m in 2010; £218.7m in 2014) 
and underlying operating profit growth 
(£7.8m in 2010; £16.1m in 2014) from 
continuing operations;
 — return to the dividend list in November 2010 
and progressive policy maintained since;
 — full review of Group strategy with 
establishment of clear strategic goals;
 — acquisition of Vado, which is already 
proving to be significantly earnings 
enhancing;
 — return to profitability of South African 
operations and UK Tiles business;
 — substantial progress in resolving surplus 
legacy leasehold properties generating 
annual cash savings of £4.1m;
 — closure to future accrual of final salary 
scheme and progress in reducing pension 
liabilities and limiting risk/volatility; and
 — broadening of the shareholder base 
across blue-chip and long-only funds 
through the placing of the Lifestyle 
29.9% stake.
These and other actions have contributed 
to the substantial growth in the Group’s 
market value and the significant TSR 
outperformance of the FTSE All-Share 
Construction & Materials Index over 
the last five years (see page 48). 
Recognising this, the Committee recently 
undertook a review of Executive Director 
remuneration. This concluded that our 
Executive Director base pay levels were 
very materially below market rates for 
comparable roles at FTSE-listed companies 
of similar sector and size (by market cap 
and revenue), whereas levels of pension 
and car allowance were above market 
norms. The Committee therefore consulted 
shareholders on the following changes to 
Executive Director remuneration to apply 
with effect from 1 April 2014:
 — rebalance fixed pay by:
  a)  increasing base salaries 
to market median; and
  b)  decreasing employer pension 
contributions and car allowances to 
bring them in line with market norms;
 — introduce a post-vesting holding period 
on future APSP awards;
 — introduce Executive shareholding 
requirement of 100% of salary; and
 — accrue dividends over the vesting period 
on deferred bonus and APSP awards 
(subject to shareholder approval of a 
change to the APSP and DBP Plan Rules 
by separate resolutions at the AGM).
The significant majority of shareholders 
consulted were supportive of these 
changes, and so we have included them 
in the Remuneration Policy set out on 
pages 39 to 43 of this Report for shareholder 
approval. The Committee believes these 
changes will help more closely align Executive 
pay with shareholders’ best interests by 
shifting the balance of the package from 
fixed to variable pay and extending the 
time horizons for Norcros incentives.
In addition, the Board Chairman’s fee was 
also reviewed for the first time since 2007. 
Following a similar approach to the Executive 
Director remuneration review, market rates 
for comparable roles were considered. It 
was concluded that the Board Chairman’s 
fees were significantly below market and 
so the Committee (excluding the Board 
Chairman) recommended increasing 
the fee to £95,000. 
The Committee believes that these 
decisions will ensure the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy being put to a 
binding vote at the 2014 AGM will, with 
best intentions, remain fit for purpose 
over its three-year life.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support.

Remuneration disclosure
This Directors’ Remuneration Report 
has been prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The 
Report meets the requirements of the 
UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules 
and the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules. In this Report we describe how 
the principles of good governance 
relating to Directors’ remuneration, as 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), are applied in practice. 
The Remuneration Committee 
confirms that throughout the financial 
year the Group has complied with 
these governance rules and best 
practice provisions.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors and will be subject to a 
binding vote at the 2014 AGM. The Committee intends that the policy will come into effect on 23 July 2014, immediately after the 2014 AGM.
Executive Director remuneration policy table
This Policy has been designed to support the principal objective of enabling the Group to attract, motivate and retain the people it needs 
to maximise the value of the business. 
Component and objective Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
To enable the Group to attract, 
motivate and retain the people 
it needs to maximise the value 
of the business
Generally reviewed each year, with 
increases effective 1 April with 
reference to salary levels at other 
FTSE companies of broadly similar 
size or sector to Norcros.
The Committee also considers the 
salary increases applying across the 
rest of the UK business when 
determining increases for Executive 
Directors.
Base salary increases are applied 
in line with the outcome of the 
annual review.
Salaries in respect of the year under 
review (and for the following year) are 
disclosed in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Salary increases for Executive Directors 
will normally not exceed those of the 
wider workforce over the period this 
policy will apply. Where increases 
are awarded in excess of the wider 
employee population, for example 
if there is a material change in the 
responsibility, size or complexity of 
the role, the Committee will provide 
the rationale in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
n/a
Pension
To provide a level of retirement 
benefit that is competitive in 
the relevant market 
Executive Directors receive pension 
contributions (either as a direct 
payment or a cash allowance).
Base salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable.
Maximum of 15% of base salary. n/a
Benefits
Provision of benefits in line 
with the market
Executive Directors are provided with 
a company car (or a cash allowance 
in lieu thereof) and medical insurance. 
Other benefits may be introduced 
from time to time to ensure the 
benefits package is appropriately 
competitive and reflects the needs 
and circumstances of the Group 
and individual Executive Director.
Benefits may vary by role, and the 
level is determined each year to be 
appropriate for the role and 
circumstances of each individual 
Executive Director.
It is not anticipated that the current 
cost of benefits (as set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration) 
would increase materially over the 
period for which this policy will apply.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to approve a higher cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. relocation expenses 
or an expatriation allowance on 
recruitment, etc.) or in circumstances 
where factors outside the Company’s 
control have changed materially (e.g. 
market increases in insurance costs).
n/a
Annual bonus and 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
To focus Executive Directors on 
achieving demanding annual targets 
relating to Group performance and 
encourage retention
Performance targets are set at the 
start of the year and aligned with 
the annual budget agreed by the 
Board. At the end of the year, the 
Committee determines the extent 
to which these targets have 
been achieved. 
50% of the total bonus payment is 
paid in cash, and 50% is converted 
into nil-cost options over Norcros 
shares under the 2011 Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP). These options are 
exercisable after three years, subject 
to continued employment and malus 
(in whole or in part) during the deferral 
period in the event of a material 
mis-statement in accounting 
records or gross misconduct.
A payment equivalent to the dividends 
that would have accrued on deferred 
bonus awards that vest will be made 
to participants on vesting.
Maximum opportunity:
100% of base salary
Target opportunity:
50% of base salary
For threshold performance, the 
bonus payout is 25% of maximum.
The bonus will be based primarily 
on the achievement of financial 
performance targets and may, from 
time to time as considered appropriate 
by the Committee, include non-financial 
performance measures (the weighting 
of which, if any, will be capped at 
20% of the total opportunity).
The primary measure is Group 
underlying operating profit, although 
the Committee may, in its discretion 
and from time to time, supplement 
operating profit with additional 
financial measures that reflect the 
strategic priorities for Norcros for 
the financial year. 
The Committee has discretion to 
adjust the formulaic bonus outcomes 
(including down to zero) within the 
limits of the scheme to ensure 
alignment of pay with performance.
Further details including targets 
attached to the bonus for the year 
under review are given on page 45 of 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Component and objective Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Approved Performance 
Share Plan (APSP)
To incentivise Executive Directors 
to deliver long-term performance 
by aligning their performance 
with shareholders’ interests
APSP awards comprise annual 
conditional awards of nil-cost 
options following the announcement 
of the Group’s final results.
Awards normally vest after three 
years, subject to the achievement 
of a performance condition and 
continued employment with the 
Group until the vesting date.
To the extent an award vests, 
Executive Directors will be required 
to hold net vested shares for an 
additional holding period of one 
year (for 2014 APSP awards) 
and two years for future awards. 
A payment equivalent to the 
dividends that would have accrued 
on APSP awards that vest will be 
made to participants on vesting.
APSP awards are also subject 
to malus over the vesting period 
and clawback over the holding 
period (in both cases in whole or 
in part) in the event of a material 
mis-statement in accounting 
records or gross misconduct.
Maximum opportunity:
100% of base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such 
as to facilitate the recruitment of an 
external hire, the Committee may, 
in its absolute discretion, exceed this 
maximum annual opportunity, up to 
150% of salary.
Threshold performance results 
in 25% vesting.
Details of actual APSP awards in 
respect of each year will be disclosed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Vesting of APSP awards is dependent 
upon the Group’s earnings per 
share (EPS) performance over 
a three-year period.
At the start of each cycle, the 
Committee will determine the 
targets that will apply to an award.
If the performance targets are not 
met at end of the performance 
period, awards will lapse.
The Committee has discretion to 
adjust the formulaic APSP outcomes 
within the limits of the scheme if 
certain relevant events take place 
(e.g. a capital restructuring, a material 
acquisition/divestment etc.) with 
any such adjustment to result in the 
revised targets being no more or 
less challenging to achieve. 
The Committee will consult major 
shareholders on changes to the APSP, 
although retains discretion to make 
non-significant changes to the 
performance measure without 
reverting to a full shareholder vote.
Further details, including the targets 
attached to the APSP in respect of 
each year, are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
SAYE
To encourage the ownership 
of Norcros plc shares
An HMRC approved scheme where 
employees (including Executive 
Directors) may save up to the 
individual monthly limit set by 
HMRC from time to time over three 
years. Options granted at a discount 
of up to 20%.
Savings capped at the individual 
monthly limit set by HMRC 
from time to time.

Shareholding requirements
To align Executive Director and 
shareholder interests and reinforce 
long-term decision-making
Executive Directors are required 
to retain at least 50% of any DBP 
or APSP awards that vest (net of tax) 
until they have built up a personal 
holding of Norcros plc shares worth 
100% of salary.
Only shares that are held beneficially 
count in the assessment of whether 
an Executive Director has met the 
required ownership level.

Notes to the policy table
Payments from previous awards
The Group will honour any commitment 
entered into, and Executive Directors will be 
eligible to receive payment from any award 
made, prior to the approval and implementation 
of the remuneration policy detailed in this 
report, i.e. before 23 July 2014. Details of 
these awards are, and will be, disclosed in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection 
and approach to target setting
The use of Group underlying operating 
profit in the annual bonus directly reinforces 
our medium-term growth-oriented strategy 
(see page 7 of the Annual Report for further 
details). For the APSP, the Committee 
considers that EPS is a transparent, 
objective and effective measure of 
performance which is in the long-term 
interests of all of our shareholders.
Targets applying to the bonus and APSP are 
reviewed annually, based on a number of 
internal and external reference points. Bonus 
targets are aligned with the annual budget 
agreed by the Board. Annual bonus targets are 
considered to be commercially sensitive but 
will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration. APSP targets 
reflect industry context, expectations of what 
will constitute appropriately challenging 
performance levels, and factors specific to the 
Group. The Committee will determine the 
APSP targets at the time awards are made and 
these targets (along with other relevant details 
of the grant) will be disclosed in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Differences from remuneration policy 
for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees 
is based on broadly consistent principles 
as described above. Annual salary reviews 
across the Group take into account Group 
performance, local pay and market conditions, 
and salary levels for similar roles in 
comparable companies.
Executives and senior managers are eligible 
to participate in annual bonus schemes. 
Opportunities and performance measures vary 
by organisational level, geographical region 
and an individual’s role. Other members of 
the Group senior leadership team participate 
in the APSP on similar terms as the Executive 
Directors, although award sizes may vary by 
organisational level. All UK employees are 
eligible to participate in the Group’s SAYE 
scheme on identical terms.

deferred into the DBP and APSP awards do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant. This illustration is intended to 
illustrate the relationship between executive pay and performance. The values of the DBP and APSP assume no increase in the underlying 
value of the shares, and actual pay delivered will further be influenced by changes in factors such as the Group’s share price and the 
value of dividends paid.
Valuation assumptions
The “Minimum” scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration), being the only elements of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration package not linked to performance.
The “On-target” scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target bonus payout (50% of salary) and APSP threshold vesting 
at 25% of the maximum award level.
The “Maximum” scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout under all incentives (100% of salary under each of the annual bonus 
and APSP).
Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration
External appointment
In cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Group, the Remuneration Committee may make use 
of all existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Policy
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills 
of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of the incumbent in the role.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make phased increases over 
a period of three years, subject to the individual’s development and performance in the role.
Benefits As set out in the Policy table, benefits may include (but are not limited to) the provision of a company car or car 
allowance, medical insurance, and any necessary expatriation allowances or expenses relating to an executive’s 
relocation.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an equivalent 
cash supplement, or a combination of both. The maximum employer contribution will be 15% of salary on the same 
terms as other Executive Directors.
SAYE New appointees will be eligible to participate on identical terms to all other employees.
Annual bonus The bonus structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees. The maximum opportunity will 
be 100% of salary, pro-rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed. Performance 
measures may include strategic and operational objectives tailored to the individual in the financial year of joining.
50% of any bonus earned will be deferred into the DBP on the same terms as other Executive Directors.
APSP New appointees will be granted annual awards under the APSP on the same terms as other Executive Directors, 
as described in the policy table.
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and level for the appointee, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration 
all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of our shareholders. It is not the intention of the Committee that a cash 
payment such as a ‘golden hello’ would be offered. However, the Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ 
incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, over and above the approach and award limits outlined in the table above. 
Any such award will be made under existing incentive structures, where appropriate, and will be subject to the normal performance conditions of 
those incentives. The Committee may also consider it appropriate to make “buy out” awards under a different structure, using the relevant Listing 
Rule, where necessary to replicate the structure of forfeited awards. Any “buy out” award (however this is delivered) would have a fair value no 
higher than that of the awards forfeited, taking into account relevant factors including performance conditions, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. Details of any such award will be disclosed in the first Annual Report on 
Remuneration following its grant.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report continued
Approach to Executive Director 
recruitment remuneration continued
Internal promotion to the Board
In cases of appointing a new Executive 
Director by way of internal promotion, the 
policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees detailed above. Where an individual 
has contractual commitments made prior 
to their promotion to the Board, and it is 
agreed that a commitment is to continue, 
the Group will continue to honour these 
arrangements even if there are instances 
where they would not otherwise be consistent 
with the prevailing Executive Director 
remuneration policy at the time of promotion.
Service contracts and policy for payment 
for loss of office
Executive Directors have signed rolling 
contracts, terminable on 12 months’ notice 
by either the Group or the Director. The 
Group entered into a contract with Nick 
Kelsall on 1 April 2011, and with Martin 
Payne on 18 March 2011. Copies of these 
contracts are available to view at the 
Group’s registered office.
The Committee’s policy for Directors’ 
termination payments is to provide only 
what would normally be due to Directors 
had they remained in employment in 
respect of the relevant notice period, and 
not to go beyond their normal contractual 
entitlements. Any incentive arrangements 
will be dealt with subject to the relevant 
rules, with any discretion exercised by the 
Committee on a case by case basis taking 
into account the circumstances of the 
termination. Termination payments will also 
take into account any statutory entitlement 
at the appropriate level, to be considered 
by the Committee on the same basis. 
The Committee will monitor and where 
appropriate enforce the Directors’ duty to 
mitigate loss. When the Committee believes 
that it is essential to protect the Group’s 
interests, additional arrangements may be 
entered into (for example post-termination 
protections above and beyond those in the 
contract of employment) on appropriate terms. 
Under the current service contract for 
each of Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne, the 
Company has the discretion to terminate 
the employment lawfully without any notice 
by paying to the Director a sum equal to, but 
no more than, the salary and other contractual 
benefits of the Director. The payment 
would be in respect of that part of the 
period of notice which the Director has not 
worked, less any appropriate tax and other 
statutory deductions. The Director would be 
entitled to any holiday pay which may 
otherwise have accrued in what would have 
been the notice period. The Company may 
pay any sums due under these pay in lieu of 
notice provisions as one lump sum or in 
instalments of what would have been the 
notice period. If the Company elects to pay 
in instalments, the Director is under an 
express contractual duty to mitigate his losses 
and to disclose any third-party income he has 
received or is due to receive. The Company 
reserves the right to reduce the amount of 
the instalments by the amount of such income. 
The Committee would expect to include 
similar pay in lieu of notice provisions in any 
future executive director’s service contract. 
These pay in lieu of notice provisions can also 
be activated by the Director if they exercise 
their contractual right to terminate their 
employment upon a change of control of the 
Company or a transfer of their employment 
to an acquirer of the Company’s business. 
The Committee would not envisage 
including a similar right to terminate in any 
future executive director’s service contract.
Also under their service contracts, if the 
Director’s employment is terminated for 
whatever reason, he agrees that he is not 
entitled to any damages or compensation 
to recompense him for the loss or diminution 
in value of any actual or prospective rights, 
benefits or expectations under or in relation 
to the APSP, DBP, SAYE plan or the annual 
discretionary bonus scheme. This is without 
prejudice to any of the rights, benefits 
or entitlements which may have accrued 
to the Director under such arrangements 
at the termination of employment. 
The table below summarises how awards 
under the annual bonus, DBP and APSP are 
typically treated in specific circumstances, 
with the final treatment remaining subject 
to the Committee’s discretion:

External appointments 
Executive Directors are permitted to take 
up non-executive positions on the boards 
of other companies, subject to the prior 
approval of the Board. The Executive 
Director may retain any fees payable in 
relation to such appointment. Details of 
external appointments and the associated 
fees received are included in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The Group seeks to promote and maintain 
good relations with employees and (where 
relevant) their representative bodies as part 
of its broader employee engagement strategy. 
The Committee is mindful of salary increases 
applying across the rest of the business in 
relevant markets when considering salaries 
for Executive Directors, but does not currently 
consult with employees specifically on 
executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder 
views received during the year and at the 
Annual General Meeting each year, as well 
as guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more broadly, in shaping remuneration 
policy. The vast majority of shareholders 
continue to express support of remuneration 
arrangements at Norcros. The Committee 
keeps the remuneration policy under regular 
review, to ensure it continues to reinforce 
the Group’s long-term strategy, and aligns 
Executive Directors with shareholders’ 
interests. We will consult shareholders 
before making any significant changes 
to our remuneration policy.
It is the policy of the Board of Directors that Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s bonus, long-term 
incentive or pension schemes. Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-executive Directors are set out in the table below:
Component and objective Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Fees
To attract and retain Non-executive 
Directors of the highest calibre with 
broad commercial experience 
relevant to the Group
The fee paid to the Chairman is determined by 
the Committee excluding the Chairman. The 
fees paid to the other Non-executive Directors 
are determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors.
Fee levels are reviewed periodically, with any 
adjustments effective 1 April. Fees are reviewed by 
taking into account external advice on best practice 
and fee levels at other FTSE companies of broadly 
similar size and sector to Norcros. Time 
commitment and responsibility are also taken 
into account when reviewing fees.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Chairman 
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Aggregate fees are limited to 
£350,000 p.a. by the Group’s 
Articles of Association.
Fee increases will be applied 
taking into account the outcome 
of the review.
The fees paid to Non-executive 
Directors in respect of the year 
under review (and for the following 
year) are disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.

Approach to Non-executive Director recruitment remuneration
In recruiting a new Non-executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will use the policy as set out in the table above. A base fee 
in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for serving as a Director of the Board, with additional fees payable for acting 
as Chairman of the Audit or Remuneration Committees.
Non-executive Director remuneration policy
Non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) have letters of 
appointment which specify an initial term of at least three years, 
although these contracts may be terminated at one month’s notice 
by either the Company or Director. In line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code guidelines, all Directors are subject to re-election 
annually at the AGM.
Details of terms and notice periods for Non-executive Directors are 
summarised below:
Non-executive Director Date of appointment Notice period
Martin Towers 28 July 2011 1 month
Jo Hallas 27 September 2012 1 month

in the year to 31 March 2014. We are pleased 
to report this review concluded that the 
Committee has operated effectively.
In addition, the Group Chief Executive and 
the Group Finance Director were invited to 
attend Committee meetings to advise on 
specific questions raised by the Committee 
and on matters relating to the performance 
and remuneration of senior managers, other 
than in relation to their own remuneration. 
The Group Counsel and Company Secretary 
acts as Secretary to the Committee. No 
individual was present while decisions were 
made regarding their own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the 
year. Attendance by individual members 
at meetings is detailed on page 31.

Annual bonus in respect of performance in the year to 31 March 2014
The 2014 annual bonus plan was based 100% on Group underlying operating profit performance for the year to 31 March 2014. Based 
on the Company’s performance in 2014, against targets set at the start of the year for each performance measure, the Committee 
has decided to make an annual bonus award of 54% of base salary to each of the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. 
Further details, including the profit targets set and actual performance, are provided below:

Threshold 14.9 25 
Note that the profit target and outturn in the above table includes the Group’s Australian business, which was disposed of after the year end. 
50% of the annual bonus award of 54% of base salary for each Executive Director, i.e. 27% of salary, will be deferred into shares under the 
DBP. This DBP award will vest on the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.

The grant of options under the DBP in respect of the year to 31 March 2014 has not yet been made. As a result of this, the precise 
number of options to be granted in respect of the year to 31 March 2014 cannot yet be calculated, though the proposed monetary value 
of the bonus earned is known. Accordingly, Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne will receive a number of nil cost options calculated by dividing 
the proposed value of £74,114 and £51,309 respectively by the share price at the date of grant.

2011 APSP awards vesting
In September 2011, APSP awards of 2,122,449 and 1,469,388 shares were granted to Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne, respectively. Vesting 
of these awards was based on Norcros’ aggregate underlying EPS over the three financial years to 31 March 2014. Based on performance over 
this period, the Committee determined that 100% of this award will vest on 31 August 2014, being the end of the three-year vesting 
period. Performance targets, and actual performance against these, are summarised in the table below:

Total pension entitlements (audited information)
As part of their remuneration arrangements Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne are entitled to receive pension contributions from the Company. 
Under these arrangements, they can elect for those contributions to be paid in the form of taxable pension allowance, or direct payments 
into a personal pension plan or the Group’s UK defined contribution scheme. For the year under review, if a payment is made in the form 
of taxable pension allowance, the amount payable is reduced to allow for employment taxes so that the total cost to the Company is the 
same as it would have been if the contribution had been made directly into a pension plan. This reduction ceased to apply from 1 April 2014.
During the year Nick Kelsall elected to take taxable pension allowance of £72,363 (2013: £70,255) with no amounts paid directly into a 
pension scheme (2013: £nil paid into a pensions scheme). Martin Payne elected to take taxable pension allowance of £41,748 (2013: £13,510) 
with £nil paid into a personal pension plan (2013: £30,750). In line with the Regulations, the single figure table reflects the total of these 
amounts, as well as the capitalised increase in accrued pension (net of inflation) under the UK defined benefit scheme, of which neither 
Nick Kelsall nor Martin Payne are active members. Martin Payne’s entitlement relates to his former employment at H&R Johnson Tiles 
Limited between 1993 and 2001. Details of Executive Directors’ retirement benefits under the Group’s UK defined benefit scheme and 
taxable pension allowances are summarised in the following table.

1.  Martin Towers was appointed Chairman on 1 November 2012, prior to which he was a Non-executive Director. His 2013 fee reflects his appointment to the position of Chairman 
part-way through the year.
2. Jo Hallas joined the Board on 27 September 2012. Her 2013 fee reflects her appointment part-way through the year.
3. David McKeith joined the Board on 24 July 2013. His 2014 fee reflects the part-year served.
4.  John Brown retired as a Non-executive Director at the Annual General Meeting on 24 July 2013 and Vijay Aggarwal resigned as a Non-executive Director on 20 September 2013. 
No compensation was paid to either Non-executive Director on their stepping down from the Board.
Payments to past Directors (audited information)
During the year under review, no payments were made to past Directors.
Exit payments made in the year (audited information)
No exit payments to Directors were made during the year under review.
External appointments in the year
No external appointments were held by the Executive Directors during the year.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in the CEO’s salary, benefits (excluding pension) and annual bonus between the 2013 
and 2014 financial years compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for all staff employed 
in continuing operations. The comparison uses a per capita figure and accordingly this reflects an average across the Group’s businesses. 
No account is therefore taken of the impact of a substantially weaker South African Rand and operational factors such as new joiners 
and leavers and the mix of employees.

Implementation of Executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2015
As detailed in the Annual Statement, Executive Directors’ total remuneration was reviewed in early 2014 by considering structure and 
levels against a comparator group comprising UK based FTSE SmallCap companies of comparable market capitalisation and revenues, 
and FTSE companies operating in similar sectors to Norcros. A key finding from this review was that base salaries were significantly below 
market median, whereas pension contributions and car allowances were significantly above. The Company consulted with shareholders 
on proposed changes, and there was support for the rebalancing of fixed remuneration from 1 April 2014 as described below:
Nick Kelsall Martin Payne
1 April 2013 1 April 2014 Percentage change 1 April 2013 1 April 2014 Percentage change

Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed taking into account individual performance and competitive practice for similar roles in the Company’s 
remuneration peer group. The review conducted in early 2014 identified that the current Executive Directors’ base salaries were 
significantly below market norms, and therefore the Committee approved base salary increases from £275,000 to £335,000 for 
Nick Kelsall and from £190,000 to £225,000 for Martin Payne with effect from 1 April 2014.
Pension
Executive Directors’ pension contributions were reduced to 15% of salary (from 30% of salary for Nick Kelsall and 25% of salary for Martin 
Payne) with effect from 1 April 2014. Contributions will be made either directly into a pension or as a cash allowance, at the choice of 
each Executive Director. 
Car allowance
The annual car allowance was reduced from £29,000 to £15,000 for Nick Kelsall and from £20,000 to £12,000 for Martin Payne with 
effect from 1 April 2014.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors will remain unchanged for the 2015 financial year with a maximum bonus entitlement 
of 100% of salary. The bonus outcome for Executive Directors will continue to be based entirely on Group underlying operating profit. Of any 
bonus earned 50% will be deferred into nil cost options for a further three years under the Deferred Bonus Plan. Annual bonus targets are 
considered to be commercially sensitive but will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
APSP
The structure of APSP awards to be made in the 2015 financial year will be unchanged from 2014 except that, to the extent an award 
vests, vested shares will be subject to a further one year holding period. Awards with face values of 100% of salary will be granted to 
Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne, with vesting subject to the achievement of three year aggregate underling EPS targets. The Committee 
will determine these targets at the time awards are made and these targets (along with other relevant details of this grant) will be 
disclosed in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
SAYE
Executive Directors will be able to participate in any SAYE contract offered to all employees, on identical terms.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2015
In early 2014, the Committee reviewed the Board Chairman’s fee, which has been unchanged at £80,000 p.a. since Norcros re-listed in 2007. 
This review identified that the Board Chairman’s fee was significantly below market median, and the Committee concluded that an increase to 
£95,000 p.a. was appropriate. The Board Chairman and the Executive Directors reviewed Non-executive Director fees at the same time, and 
concluded that the current levels remained appropriate. For the 2015 financial year, Non-executive Director fees will be as follows:
Fee at Fee from Percentage
Executive Director 1 April 2013 1 April 2014 increase
Board Chairman £80,000 £95,000 18.8%
Non-executive Director £35,000 £35,000 —

Shareholder dilution
The Group’s share incentive plans operate in line with the ABI principles, which require that commitments under all share schemes 
satisfied by newly issued shares must not exceed 10% of the issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period, of which up to 5% may be 
used to satisfy options under executive share schemes. The Group’s position against the dilution limits at 31 March 2014 was 5.5% for the 
all share schemes limit and 3.9% for executive schemes.

Directors’ report
The Directors present their Annual 
Report and the audited consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2014.
Principal activities 
The Company acts as a holding company 
for the Norcros Group. The Company’s 
registered number is 3691883 and the 
Company is registered and domiciled 
in England.
The Group’s principal activities are the 
development, manufacture and marketing 
of home consumer products in the UK and 
South Africa. 
Results and dividends
The information that fulfils the requirements 
of the Business Review, which is incorporated 
in the Directors’ Report by reference, including 
the review of the Group’s business and future 
prospects, is included in the Chairman’s 
Statement, Group Chief Executive’s Review 
and the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 27. 
Key performance indicators are shown 
on page 21.
The Directors recommend a final dividend 
for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 0.340p 
(2013: 0.305p). This follows the decision to 
pay an interim dividend earlier in the year 
of 0.170p (2013: 0.155p).
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
and indemnities
The Company purchases liability insurance 
cover for Directors and officers of the 
Company which gives appropriate cover for 
any legal action brought against them. The 
Company also provides an indemnity for its 
Directors (to the extent permitted by the law) 
in respect of liabilities which could occur as a 
result of their office. This indemnity does not 
provide cover should a Director be proven 
to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Purchase of own shares
In 2007 the Company formed the Norcros 
Employee Benefit Trust (the “Trust”). The 
purpose of the Trust is to meet part of the 
Company’s liabilities under the Company’s 
share schemes. The Trust purchased no 
ordinary shares during the year (2013: nil). 
At the Company’s 2013 Annual General 
Meeting, the shareholders authorised the 
Company to make market purchases of up 
to 58,348,858 ordinary shares. At the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders will be asked to renew the 
authority to purchase its own shares for 
another year. Details are contained in the 
Notice of Meeting.
Employees
The necessity for, and importance of, good 
relations with all employees is well 
recognised and accepted throughout the 
Group. However, because the Group’s 
activities are organised on a de-centralised 
basis, with each operating business having 
autonomy over its operations, there is no 
uniform set of arrangements for employee 
involvement imposed throughout the 
Group. Nevertheless, all Group companies 
are strongly encouraged to devise and 
adopt whatever means of employee 
consultation best suit their circumstances.
The Group is fully committed to keeping its 
employees informed about their work unit 
and the wider business.
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
towards disabled persons and therefore 
all applications from such persons are fully 
and fairly considered bearing in mind the 
respective aptitudes and abilities of the 
applicant. In the event of existing employees 
becoming disabled, every effort is made to 
ensure that their employment with the Group 
continues and that appropriate training is 
arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the 
training, career development and promotion 
of disabled persons should, as far as possible, 
be identical to that of an able-bodied person.

The Board presents this report in order to meet the Company’s obligation under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013 to disclose the Group’s worldwide emissions of the six Kyoto gases attributable to human activity measured 
in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. As stated in the Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 26 and 27, the Company is committed

own use. This is the first year for which reporting is required. These sources use the same reporting boundary as for our consolidated 
financial statements. We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated statement.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), data gathered to fulfil our requirements 
under the CRC Energy Efficiency scheme, and emission factors from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2014. Where no more suitable data sources are available, we have used, where practicable, estimates based on the appropriate 
information that is available to the Group.

Research and development
The Group’s expenditure on research and 
development is disclosed in note 3 to the

the development of new products.
Corporate governance
Details of the Group’s corporate 
governance are contained on pages 30 
to 32. This Corporate Governance Report 
forms part of the Directors’ Report and is 
incorporated into it by cross reference.
Financial risk management 
The Group’s operations expose it to a 
variety of financial risks that include the 
effect of changes in interest rate risk, credit 
risk, liquidity risk, exchange rate risk and 
energy price risk. The Group actively seeks 
to limit the adverse effects of these risks on 
the financial performance of the Group.
Interest rate risk
The Group has the ability to secure a 
substantial proportion of its bank loans at 
fixed rates via interest rate swaps. However, 
due to the current low level of debt and 
historically low UK LIBOR rates, the Group 
has decided not to take out any such 
swaps at the present time. This position 
is regularly reassessed.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash 
equivalents, derivative financial instruments 
and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures to 
customers. The Group maintains a credit 
insurance policy for all its operations which 
covers a substantial portion of the Group’s 
trade debtors. For banks and financial 
institutions only independently rated parties 
with a strong rating are accepted.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s banking facilities are designed 
to ensure there are sufficient funds available 
for the current operations and the Group’s 
further development plans.
Exchange rate risk
Through its centralised treasury function 
the Group seeks to hedge its UK-based 
transactional foreign exchange risk on a 
rolling annual basis through the use of 
forward exchange contracts and similar 
hedging instruments. The Group’s principal 
UK-based foreign currency exposures are 
largely hedged until at least March 2015 
based on current forecasts. In the overseas 
businesses the policy is to hedge the local 
transactional risk to the extent this is 
permitted and not cost prohibitive.
The Group has certain investments in 
foreign operations whose net assets are 
exposed to foreign currency translational 
risk. The Group seeks to mitigate this 
exposure through borrowings denominated 
in the relevant foreign currencies to the 
extent that this is considered to be 
commercially beneficial.
Energy price risk
The Group seeks to secure a proportion of 
its key energy requirements using forward 
purchase contracts where it is believed to 
be necessary. 
Takeover Directive
The Company has only one class of shares, 
being ordinary shares, which have equal 
voting rights. The holdings of individual 
Directors are disclosed on page 50.
There are no significant agreements 
to which the Company is a party which 
take effect, alter or terminate in the event 
of a change of control of the Company, 
except for the banking facilities dated 
22 September 2011 (as amended on 
28 March 2013) in respect of the 
£70.0m term facilities which contain 
mandatory prepayment provisions on 
a change of control.
There are no provisions within Directors’ 
employment contracts which allow for 
specific termination payments upon a 
change of control.
Statement of disclosure of information 
to auditor
In the case of each of the persons who are 
Directors, the following applies:
(a)   so far as the Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
(b)  they have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information.
Independent auditor
A resolution to re-appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditor 
to the Company will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the 
Company will take place at 11.00am 
on 23 July 2014 at De Vere Mottram Hall 
Hotel, Wilmslow Road, Mottram St Andrew, 
Cheshire SK10 4QT. The Notice convening 
that meeting, together with the resolutions 
to be proposed, appears on pages 98 to 104 
of this document. The Directors recommend 
that all shareholders vote in favour of all of the 
resolutions to be proposed, as the Directors 
intend to do so in respect of their own shares, 
and consider that they are in the best interests 
of the Company and the shareholders as 
a whole.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
In respect of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the 
Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 — make judgments and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 — state whether IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements respectively; and
 — prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in Directors’ Report 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 — the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
 — the Business Review includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion  
In our opinion the Group financial 
statements, defined below:
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of 
the Group’s profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
 — have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of 
what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are 
prepared by Norcros plc, comprise:
 — the consolidated balance sheet as at 
31 March 2014;
 — the consolidated income statement 
and statement of comprehensive income 
for the year then ended;
 — the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity and statement of cash flows 
for the year then ended; and
 — the notes to the Group financial 
statements, which include a summary 
of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation comprises 
applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union.
Certain disclosures required by the financial 
reporting framework have been presented 
elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts 
(the “Annual Report”), rather than in the notes 
to the financial statements. These are cross-
referenced from the financial statements and 
are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements 
involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
 — whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
 — the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
 — the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited Group financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. 
These helped us to determine the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, 
we determined materiality for the Group 
financial statements as a whole to be 
£730,000. This represents 5% of underlying 
profit before taxation, which we believe 
to be the most appropriate measure of 
Group performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them misstatements 
identified during our audit above £25,000 
as well as misstatements below that amount 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group operates across 11 divisions 
within three main geographical areas: the 
UK, South Africa and the Rest of the World. 
The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of these divisions, comprising 
the Group’s operating businesses and 
centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the 
Group audit, we determined the type of 
work that needed to be performed at the 
divisions by us, as the group engagement 
team, or component auditors, from other 
PwC network firms, operating under our 
instruction. Where the work was performed 
by component auditors, we determined the 
level of involvement we needed to have in 
the audit work at those divisions to be able 
to conclude whether sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis 
for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
We performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of the 4 UK trading 
and the 4 South African trading divisions since, 
together, these comprise in excess of 95% 
of both Group revenue and underlying profit 
before tax. In addition, we also performed 
specified procedures over property, plant and 
equipment, inventories, cash and accounts 
payable in respect of the Australian division 
included within assets / liabilities held-for-sale at 
the year-end, and further specified procedures 
in relation to the investment property and 
provisions within the Group’s property division. 
This, together with additional procedures 
performed at the Group level, including the 
audit of the consolidation and procedures 
over the head office division, gave us the 
evidence we needed for our opinion on 
the Group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. We 
primarily focused our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined 
information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we 
considered necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtained audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be 
those that required particular focus in the 
current year. This is not a complete list of 
all risks or areas of focus identified by our 
audit. We discussed these areas of focus 
with the Audit Committee. Their report on 
those matters that they considered to be 
significant issues in relation to the financial 
statements is set out on pages 33 to 35.

To the members of Norcros plc
Independent auditor’s report continued
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of defined benefit pension 
scheme liabilities
We focused on this area because of the magnitude of the 
pension scheme and the judgements inherent in the actuarial 
assumptions involved in the valuation of the liability within the 
deficit, in particular the discount rates, inflation and mortality 
rates.
Changes to the assumptions used can have a material effect 
on the liability valuation, and therefore on the results and 
financial position of the Group.
 
We evaluated the assumptions and valuation methodologies 
applied in the actuarial valuation, including considering 
whether they had been applied consistently. 
We challenged the assumptions used, comparing them 
to benchmark ranges, taking into account the specific 
characteristics of the Group’s pension scheme. 
Fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel to 
achieve the forecasted results. 
We focused on the risk that revenue may have been recognised for 
transactions that had not occurred, and on the risk of inaccurate 
recognition of rebates granted to customers which are deducted 
from invoiced revenue.
Our testing of revenue transactions, to assess whether a sale 
had occurred, focused on obtaining evidence about whether 
cash had been received to support a sale having occurred. 
Where revenue was recorded through manual journal entries we 
checked whether the entry corresponded to a sales transaction 
that had occurred in the financial year and obtained evidence 
to explain the need for a manual entry and to test the value 
of the adjustment. We also performed data analysis to identify 
revenue transactions that did not directly result in a cash receipt, 
primarily related to rebates, and obtained audit evidence 
confirming the accuracy of their recognition.
Risk of management override  
of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, 
including the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate 
actions, and interviewed senior management. 
We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements 
relevant to the financial statements for evidence of bias by the 
directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due 
to fraud. 
We also tested manual journal entries, to determine the rationale for, 
and obtain evidence over, manual adjustments, and reconciliations 
over key account balances such as cash, accounts receivable, 
accounts payable and inventory.

Report on the Group financial statements

Going Concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review the directors’ statement, set out 
on page 32, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed 
our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, 
the directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial 
statements using the going concern basis 
of accounting. The going concern basis 
presumes that the Group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that 
the directors intend it to do so, for at least 
one year from the date the financial 
statements were signed. As part of our audit 
we have concluded that the directors’ use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, these statements 
are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 — the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the Group 
financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial 
statements; and
 — the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement set out on 
pages 30 to 32 in the Annual Report 
with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share 
capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations 
received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We 
have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law have not 
been made. We have no exceptions to 
report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion a 
corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the Parent Company. We 
have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Parent 
Company’s compliance with nine provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’). We have nothing to report 
having performed our review.
On page 54 of the Annual Report, as 
required by the Code Provision C.1.1, the 
directors state that they consider the Annual 
Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it provides the 
information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. On page 33, as required 
by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee 
has set out the significant issues that it 
considered in relation to the financial 
statements, and how they were addressed. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — the statement given by the directors 
is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
 — the section of the Annual Report 
describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by 
us to the Audit Committee
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited Group financial 
statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 — is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those 
of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 54, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has 
been prepared for and only for the Parent 
Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.

1. Group accounting policies
General information
Norcros plc (the “Company”), which is the ultimate Parent Company of the Norcros Group, is incorporated in England as a public company 
limited by shares. The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange market of listed securities. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group were approved by the Board on 19 June 2014.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments 
which are stated at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the 
European Union issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), with the interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are effective as of the Balance Sheet date and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are detailed in the risk 
management section. Although these estimates are based on management‘s best knowledge of amounts, events or actions, actual results may 
differ from expectations.
Going concern
At the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and consequently consider that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of preparation.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to the information presented, unless otherwise stated.
IAS 19R, ‘Employee benefits’, has been adopted with effect from 1 April 2013. The change in the accounting standard has been applied 
retrospectively, meaning that comparative amounts have been restated. Under IAS 19R, the separate calculations of an interest cost on the 
defined benefit obligation and a return on plan assets have been replaced by a single net interest charge calculated by applying the discount 
rate to the net defined benefit liability. Additionally, certain costs of administering pension schemes which were previously deducted from 
the return on plan assets have been reclassified such that they are now presented within operating expenses in the income statement. 
As explained in note 29, certain operations have been classified as discontinued during the year and consequently the comparative financial 
information has been restated where appropriate to meet the presentational requirements of IFRS 5, ‘Non-current assets held-for-sale and 
discontinued operations’, to take account of this change.
The impact of the restatement on comparative periods has been reflected in a table in note 23.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2014
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 April 2013.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, amendments and interpretations now applicable. Other than IAS 19R, none of these 
standards and interpretations has had any material effect on the Group’s results or net assets.
Applicable for

Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out as follows. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated historical financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Norcros plc and entities controlled by Norcros plc 
(its subsidiaries) made up to the reporting date each year. Control is achieved where Norcros plc has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date 
of acquisition or the up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring them into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency 
in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the Income 
Statement in the period of acquisition. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Critical estimates
The Group’s accounting policies have been set by management and approved by the Audit Committee. The application of these accounting 
policies to specific scenarios requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future. These are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Under IFRS, estimates or judgments are considered critical where they involve a significant risk or cause a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities from period to period. This may be because the estimate or judgment involves matters which are highly 
uncertain, or because different estimation methods or assumptions could reasonably have been used.

1. Group accounting policies continued
Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Critical estimates continued
Critical judgments have been made in the following areas:
 — estimated impairment of goodwill, long-life assets and property, plant and equipment – the Group tests goodwill for impairment annually 
and other fixed assets should indicators of potential impairment arise, in accordance with its accounting policy. The recoverable amounts 
of cash-generating units (CGUs) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates, 
both in arriving at the expected future cash flows and the application of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value 
of these flows. These calculations have been carried out using the assumptions in note 11;
 — retirement benefit obligations – the present value of pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an 
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net expense for pensions principally include 
the discount rate and rate of inflation. Any changes in these assumptions can impact the carrying amount of retirement benefit 
obligations (see note 23); 
 — property provisions – where a property leased by the Group is vacated, but an ongoing lease commitment remains, provision is made 
for the onerous element of the lease. Key assumptions are the extent to which properties are let and rentals are achieved. Any changes 
in these assumptions can affect the quantum of the provisions; 
 — deferred tax – deferred tax assets are recognised on losses and capital allowances carried forward only to the extent that it is probable they will 
be available for use against future profits and that there will be sufficient future taxable profit available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. In arriving at a judgment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets, management considers the regulations applicable 
to taxation and whether there are likely to be sufficient future taxable profits. Future taxable profits may be higher or lower than estimates 
made when determining whether it is appropriate to record a tax asset and the amount to be recorded. Furthermore changes to the legislative 
framework or application of tax law may result in a management reassessment of the level of recognition of deferred tax assets. In line 
with this policy the Group recognised additional deferred tax assets during the year as described in note 21; and
 — valuation of acquired intangible assets – intangible assets can only be recognised as part of a business combination where the intangible 
asset is separable from goodwill, can be reliably measured and is expected to generate future economic benefits. Judgment is required 
to assess whether these criteria are met and also to subsequently determine the appropriate assumptions which are used to place a 
value on the intangible asset. Had different assumptions been applied the valuation of acquired intangible assets could have differed from 
the amount ultimately recognised.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services provided alongside the supply of goods 
in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities and is shown net of value added and other sales-based taxes, customer volume rebates, 
discounts and promotional support.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer, which is usually on despatch 
or upon sale to a customer in the case of the Group’s retail operations.
Revenue received in respect of extended warranties is recognised over the period of the warranty.
Segmental reporting
The Group operates in two main geographical areas: the UK and South Africa. All inter-segment transactions are made on an arm’s length basis. 
The chief operating decision maker (being the Board) assesses performance and allocates resources based on geography as each segment has 
similar economic characteristics, complementary products, distribution channels and regulatory environments.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indicator of impairment. Goodwill 
is carried at cost less amortisation charged prior to the Group’s transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004 less accumulated impairment losses. 
Any impairment is recognised in the period in which it is identified. 
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible fixed assets comprise the Vado trade name recognised as a separately identifiable asset on acquisition and are valued at cost 
less accumulated amortisation. The estimated useful life of the asset is 15 years, with amortisation being charged on a straight-line basis.

1. Group accounting policies continued
Impairment of long-life assets
Property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated as either the higher of the asset’s net selling price or value in use; the resultant impairment (the amount by which 
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount) is recognised as a charge in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of assets and their 
eventual disposal proceeds. In order to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows the Group uses an appropriate discount 
rate adjusted for any associated risk. Estimated future cash flows used in the impairment calculation represent management’s best view 
of likely future market conditions and current decisions on the use of each asset or asset group.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and rebates) and 
any directly attributable costs. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment 
in value. Impairment charges are recognised in the income statement when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than the estimated 
recoverable amount, calculated with reference to future discounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate when considered 
as part of an income-generating unit. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is provided on a straight line basis to write down 
assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition by the Group. 
The estimated useful lives of Group assets are as follows:
Buildings 25–50 years
Plant and equipment 3–15 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Investment property
Investment property comprises mainly land and relates to property which is either sub-let to a third party or is not being utilised in the 
Group’s core operations. Investment property is held at cost less depreciation on buildings (land is not depreciated). Investment property 
is depreciated over 50 years.
Assets held-for-sale
Assets and disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to dispose of.
Assets and disposal groups are only classified as held-for-sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction as opposed 
to continuing use, and only when such a sale transaction is deemed highly probable. Such a sale transaction should be expected to 
complete within one year and accordingly assets and disposal groups held-for-sale are included within current assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, with the associated liabilities included within current liabilities.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, and, where applicable, labour 
and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions are made for slow-moving 
and obsolete items.
Taxation
Current tax, which comprises UK and overseas corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
Balance Sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits and is accounted for using the Balance Sheet 
liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised and 
is charged in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, when the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Operating leases
Annual rentals are charged/credited directly to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Provisions
Warranty provisions – provision is made for the estimated liability on products under warranty. Liability is recognised upon the sale 
of a product and is estimated using historical data.
Restructuring provisions – provision is made for costs of restructuring activities to carried out by the Group when the Group is 
demonstrably committed to incurring the cost in a future period and the cost can be reliably measured.
Property provisions – where the Group has vacated a property but is committed to a leasing arrangement, an onerous lease provision 
is recorded. This is calculated as the cost that management expects to incur over the period of the lease, which is net of any expected 
future sub-lease income.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount to be spent and discounted where material.

Employee benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans 
and post-employment medical plans.
(a) Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating 
to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one 
or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated every three 
years by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, and is subject to interim reviews in intervening years. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to 
the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise, net of the related deferred tax.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are 
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash 
refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(b) Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional 
on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these 
benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage 
voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits 
falling due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
(d) Profit sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are one-off expenses or income arising from transactions or events which occur outside the course of the Group’s 
normal operations. They include profits and losses on disposal of non-current assets outside the normal course of business, restructuring 
costs, acquisition fees and large or significant one-off items.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are expenses or income arising from transactions or events which, whilst not exceptional in nature, do not relate 
to the Group’s normal operations. They include non-cash amortisation charges relating to intangible assets and non-cash pension 
administration costs which have arisen as a result of the implementation of IAS 19R.
Financial assets and liabilities
Borrowings – the Group measures all borrowings initially at fair value. This is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received. T ransaction 
costs (any such costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation 
of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the Income Statement over the duration of the borrowing.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.
Treasury derivatives – where deemed necessary, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations is managed through the use of forward exchange contracts and cross 
currency swaps.

1. Group accounting policies continued
Financial assets and liabilities continued
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognised immediately within finance cost/income 
in the Income Statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents – cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Cash and 
cash equivalents are offset against overdrafts and borrowings when there is a legally enforceable right to do so.
T rade receivables – trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently reviewed for impairment. A provision for impairment 
of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of receivables. Evidence including significant financial difficulties of a debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or 
financial re-organisation and default or delinquency in payment are considered indicators that the trade receivables are impaired. The amount of 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised in the 
income statement within administration costs. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade 
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against administration costs in the Income Statement.
Trade payables – trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date. 
The Group determines the fair value of its remaining financial instruments through the use of estimated discounted cash flows. 
The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is calculated as the net present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their 
short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows 
at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is charged against profits for the year in which it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised once the technical 
feasibility of a project has been established and a business plan, which demonstrates how the project will generate future economic benefits, 
has been approved.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders, or when paid if earlier.
Foreign currency transactions
Functional currency
Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency that best reflects the economic 
substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to that entity (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the parent entity.
Transactions and balances
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than functional currency are translated at rates applicable at the year end and 
trading results of overseas subsidiaries at average rates for the year. Exchange gains and losses of a trading nature are dealt with in arriving 
at operating profit. 
Translation of overseas net assets
Exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of overseas net assets and results are taken directly to reserves.
Share capital
Issued share capital is recorded in the Balance Sheet at nominal value with any premium at that date of issue being credited to the share 
premium account.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

Key management is defined as the Directors and Officers of Norcros plc, together with the Managing Directors of the Group’s significant 
divisions. Due to the acquisition of Vado on 31 March 2013, the definition of key management has broadened in 2014 to include the 
managing director of that business.
5. Non-underlying and exceptional operating items
The Directors believe that underlying profit before taxation and underlying earnings provide shareholders with additional useful information 
on the underlying performance of the Group. In order to arrive at underlying profit before taxation and underlying earnings, certain items 
including non-underlying and exceptional operating items have been excluded.

1 During the year the Group disposed of a surplus property in South Africa, generating a profit of £0.5m.
2  In accordance with IFRS 3R, a significant proportion of deferred consideration payable to the former shareholders of Vado is required to be treated as remuneration, and, accordingly, 
is expensed to the income statement as incurred.
3 Legal costs related to the ongoing dispute over the disposal of the surplus land at the Highgate site in Tunstall, UK.
4  Restructuring costs related to redundancies, asset write-downs and consultancy costs following the implementation of a programme of restructuring initiatives throughout the Group’s 
business units. In 2013 this included a loss of £0.3m on the sale of the small non-core South African Nortec adhesives business.
5 The provision to cover the Group’s onerous property leases was increased by £3.0m in 2013 following a reappraisal of the future cash flows arising from these leases.
6 The fees arose as a result of the Group’s acquisition of Vado in 2013.

9. Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year, excluding those held in the Norcros Employee Benefit Trust.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary 
shares. At 31 March 2014 the potential dilutive ordinary shares amounted to 24,374,489 (2013: 8,895,196) as calculated in accordance 
with IAS 33.
The calculation of EPS is based on the following profits and numbers of shares:

Details of the terms of the APSP and SAYE scheme are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The 22,574 shares exercised in 
respect of the SAYE 4 scheme were issued from the holding of the Norcros Employee Benefit Trust. The 1,216,313 shares exercised in 
respect of the SAYE 3 scheme were fulfilled by the issue of new shares (see note 24).
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is 
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. A charge of £0.9m was 
recognised in respect of share options in the period (2013: £0.7m). The Group uses a Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the annual 
charge for its share-based payments. The assumptions used in this model for each share-based payment are as follows:

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by a value-in-use calculation. These calculations use cash flow projections derived from 
data and metrics used on an ongoing basis, with the key assumptions being those regarding discount rates, growth rates, future gross 
margin improvements and cash flows. 
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are:
 — Cash flows before income taxes are based on approved budgets and detailed forecasts for the first five years. For periods after the first 
five years a long-term growth rate of 3% is used to derive a terminal value.
 — Pre-tax discount rates of 9.0% (2013: 9.0%) in the UK and 11.05% (2013: 11.05%) in South Africa based upon the risk free rate for 
Government bonds adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities and investing in the Group’s specific 
sectors and regions.
The following sensitivity analysis has been performed:
 — increase each CGU discount rate by 1%; and
 — reduce future growth rates by 30%.
In each of these scenarios the estimated recoverable value comfortably exceeds the carrying value for the CGU and accordingly no impairment 
was identified.
Having assessed the future anticipated cash flows, management believes that any reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would 
not result in an impairment of goodwill.

of the opinion that the fair value of the investment properties is not significantly different from their carrying value. Rental income receivable 
in the year was £0.5m (2013: £0.5m). During the year an investment property began to be used by one of the Group’s divisions and accordingly 
has been transferred to property, plant and equipment.

The carrying value of the Group’s net debt is denominated in the following currencies:
2014 2013
£m £m
Sterling 35.3 33.8

20. Financial instruments
During the year the Group held financial instruments for two purposes:
 — financial instruments relating to the operations, financing and risks of the Group’s operations; and
 — financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Group’s bank debt.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash, trade receivables and payables and forward exchange contracts. Based on 
the hierarchy defined in IFRS 7, the Group’s financial instruments are classified as level 2 instruments. Consequently, fair value measurements 
are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit and loss

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 March 2014 were €13.2m and US$53.1m 
(2013: €7.1m and US$45.6m).
The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next 15 months. 
Gains and losses recognised on forward exchange contracts to date have been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Sensitivity analysis
IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Group’s profit and loss and equity of reasonably possible 
fluctuations in market rates. To demonstrate these, hypothetical variations of 1% increase or decrease in market interest rates and 5% 
strengthening or weakening in major currencies have been chosen.
(A) 1% increase or decrease on market interest rates for most of the coming year
As the Group has net debt of £27.4m (excluding amortised finance costs) the effect of a 1% change in market interest rates would 
be a change in the net finance costs of approximately £0.3m per annum.
(B) 5% strengthening or weakening in major currencies
A number of the Group’s assets are held overseas and as such variations in foreign currencies will affect the carrying value of these assets. 
A 5% strengthening of Sterling across all currencies would lead to a £2.0m devaluation in net assets. Likewise a 5% weakening in Sterling 
would lead to a £2.3m increase in net assets.
The Group’s profits and losses are exposed to both translational and transactional risk of fluctuations in foreign currency risk. The Group 
seeks to hedge the majority of its transactional risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. After taking these hedges into account the 
effect of a 5% strengthening in both Sterling and South African Rand against all other currencies would be an increase in profits of £0.4m. 
Likewise a 5% weakening in both these currencies would lead to a £0.4m reduction in profits.

Year ended 31 March 2014
21. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
In the year ended 31 March 2013 the Company recognised certain deferred tax assets, principally in relation to its South African businesses, 
which had not previously been recorded in view of the uncertainty of their recovery. During the year ended 31 March 2014, due to the continued 
strong performance of the Company, a further review of the position with regard to deferred tax assets was undertaken. As a result of this, 
further deferred tax assets totalling £4.4m in relation to both the UK and South African businesses have been recognised in full, chiefly in 
respect of tax losses and capital allowances, on the grounds that it is considered probable that the Company will benefit from these assets.
The main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. A further announcement was made in the 
2013 Annual Budget Statement that the rate would reduce to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This 
rate reduction was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and the deferred tax asset at 31 March 2014 has been re-measured accordingly.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method. The movement on the deferred tax account 
is as shown below:
2014 2013
£m £m
Deferred tax asset at the beginning of the year 8.7 6.4

Tax losses 12.4 16.1
Other timing differences (0.3) —
Deferred tax asset relating to pension deficit 4.4 6.9

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £7.9m of tax losses as the Company does not believe that utilisation of these losses 
is probable.

22. Provisions continued
The warranty provision has been recognised for expected claims on products which remain under warranty. It is expected that this 
expenditure will be incurred within five years of the Balance Sheet date.
The restructuring provision has been recognised for expected liabilities arising from re-organisations and company disposals. This is 
expected to be utilised within twelve months of the Balance Sheet date.
The UK property provision has been recognised for expected liabilities arising from lease shortfalls on surplus Group properties and so 
future expenditure is expected to be spread over several years.
23. Retirement benefit obligations
(a) Pension costs
Norcros Security Plan
The Norcros Security Plan (“the Plan”), the principal UK pension scheme of Norcros plc subsidiaries, is funded by a separate trust fund which 
operates under UK trust law and is a separate legal entity from the Company. The Plan is governed by a Trustee board which is required 
by law to act in the best interests of the Plan members and is responsible for setting policies together with the Company. The Plan exposes 
the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, market (investment) risk and currency risk.
It is predominantly a defined benefit scheme, with a modest element of defined contribution benefits. Norcros plc itself has no employees 
and so has no liabilities in respect of these pension schemes. The scheme closed to new members and future accrual with effect from 
1 April 2013, though active members retain a salary link. As a result of the closure a new defined contribution pension scheme has been 
implemented to replace the Plan from the same date. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years and can be attributed to the scheme members 
as follows:
2014
Employee members 10%
Deferred members 29%
Pensioner members 61%
Total 100%
The Plan assets do not include any investments in the Company or any property or other assets utilised by the Company.
The Plan is funded by the Company with funding based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions 
may differ from the assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of 
Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustee and the Company. Employer deficit recovery contributions in the year 
to 31 March 2015 are expected to be £2.1m.
South Africa defined benefit schemes
The Group previously operated two separate defined benefit schemes for the benefit of the Group’s South African employees. These were 
the TAL Pension Fund and the Johnson Tiles Pension Fund. Both schemes were closed during the financial year ended 31 March 2008 and 
replaced by defined contribution schemes.
Defined contribution pension schemes
Contributions made to these schemes amounted to £2.2m (2013: £1.2m), which includes £0.3m for the provision of life insurance cover.
(b) IAS 19R, ‘Employee benefits’
Norcros Security Plan
The valuation used for IAS 19R disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2012 and updated by KPMG, 
a firm of qualified actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19R in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2014. 
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 March 2014.

South Africa defined benefit schemes
The actuarial valuations of the Group’s South African defined benefit pension schemes, carried out in March 2005, have been updated 
by Alexander Forbes Financial Services to take account of the requirements of IAS 19R. The schemes were closed during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2008 and replaced with defined contribution schemes. Following the agreement of the allocation of surplus assets, the 
surplus was partially recovered in the year ended 31 March 2012 with the remaining £0.1m surplus recovered in the current year.
(i) The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities of the Norcros Security Plan under IAS 19R are:
2014 2013
Projected Projected
unit unit
Discount rate 4.30% 4.20%
Inflation rate (RPI) 3.20% 3.20%
Inflation rate (CPI) 2.20% 2.20%
Increase to deferred benefits during deferment (non-GMP liabilities) 3.05% 3.05%
Increases to pensions in payment (other than pre-1988 GMP liabilities) 3.05% 3.05%
Salary increases 3.45% 3.45%
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are that 
a member who retires in 2014 at age 65 will on average live for a further 21.3 years (2013: 21.3 years) after retirement if they are male and 
23.6 years (2013: 23.7 years) if they are female. Members are assumed to take a 25% (2013: 25%) cash commutation sum on retirement.

(viii) Sensitivities
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Plan’s liabilities are as follows:
Impact on scheme deficit 
2014 2013
Assumption £m £m
Discount rate – 0.1% decrease 5.2 6.1
Inflation – 0.1% increase 3.4 4.6
Increase in life expectancy by one year 11.6 11.6
The above sensitivities are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year. Whilst the analysis does not take account 
of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the scheme, it does provide an approximation as to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.
No changes have been made to the method and assumptions used in this analysis from those used in the previous year.
(c) Impact of the restatement of comparatives following the implementation of IAS 19R and for discontinued operations
As explained in note 1, comparative financial information has been restated following the retrospective implementation of IAS 19R and the 
classification of the Australian tiles business as a discontinued operations (see note 29). The impact on the results of continuing operations 
from the previous year is shown below:

capital excluding any shares issued as part of a capital raising. One of the warrant holders exercised their warrant instrument in full during 
the year and acquired 3,180,594 shares at the exercise price of 8.97p per share.
Taking into account the capital raising in 2009 the remaining warrants now represent 3,174,569 ordinary shares (0.54% of the issued 
ordinary share capital) at 31 March 2014. The warrants are exercisable at 8.97p per share at any time up to July 2017.

28. Business combinations
On 31 March 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Eurobath International Limited, known principally under 
its trading name Vado, a leading manufacturer and global distributor of bathroom controls including taps, mixer showers, bathroom 
accessories and valves. Full details of the acquisition are provided on the Group’s website (www.norcros.com) and on page 64 of 
the Group’s 2013 Annual Report.
In accordance with the sale and purchase agreement, an exercise to review the completion balance sheet at the date of acquisition 
was undertaken. This resulted in an adjustment to the cash consideration paid for Vado which was refunded to the Group, and accordingly 
the consideration paid for Vado was revised as follows:

Cash 11.0 (0.1) 10.9

11.4 (0.1) 11.3
The return of £0.1m has been disclosed in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement within investing activities. There have been no changes 
to the estimate of contingent consideration payable in the year.
Due to the fact that the acquisition took place on the last day of the accounting period ended 31 March 2013, it was not possible for the 
Group to finalise the fair value of Vado’s assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the amounts stated in the 2013 Annual Report were provisional 
and principally reflected the reported balances of Vado, as adjusted where possible to comply with the accounting policies of the Group.
The Group has now reviewed the identifiable net assets of Vado and has identified the following measurement period adjustments:

The principal adjustments that have been made in the measurement period are to recognise an intangible asset of £5.4m in respect of the 
trade name and additional derivative financial instruments of £0.7m. Deferred tax at the prevailing rate of 23% as of the date of acquisition 
has been applied resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of £1.4m. Due to the complexity of the nature of these assets, it was 
not possible to reliably measure their value in the time available before publishing the 2013 Annual Report, and for this reason they have 
been recognised subsequent to the period of acquisition.

29. Discontinued operations and assets held-for-sale
On 25 March 2014, the Company entered into a conditional agreement to dispose of 100% of the issued share capital of Norcros Industry (Pty) 
Limited (NIPL), which owns its Australian tiles business, to Kim Hin Industries Berhad (KHIB). As KHIB is listed on the Malaysian Bursa, it required 
shareholder approval to allow the transaction to take place, and this was duly received allowing the disposal to be completed on 30 May 2014. 
Due to the fact that irrevocable undertakings supporting the transaction had been obtained from KHIB’s largest shareholder (representing 
approximately 61% of KHIB’s issued share capital), it was determined that the sale was highly probable at 31 March 2014 and accordingly 
NIPL has been classified as held-for-sale in the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with IFRS 5, an impairment loss of £1.5m 
to remeasure the carrying value of the assets to fair value less costs to sell has been recognised following the reclassification of the net 
assets of NIPL as held-for-sale. Including an estimated tax charge arising from the transaction of £0.1m, a total loss on disposal of £1.6m 
is anticipated. An analysis of the assets held-for-sale and liabilities associated with assets held-for-sale is given in the table below.

discontinued with a single amount shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement. As NIPL is no longer classed as a continuing 
operation the prior year has also been restated to conform to this style of presentation. The table below provides further detail of the

Purchases of goods:

Goods are purchased from related parties on normal commercial terms and conditions.
Prism Cement Limited was classed as a related party due to the fact that one of its directors, Vijay Aggarwal, was also a Director of the 
Company, and one of its subsidiaries, Lifestyle Investments PVT Limited, owned 29.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as of 1 April 
2013. On 11 April 2013, Lifestyle Investments PVT Limited sold 27,000,000 ordinary shares to reduce its holding in the Company to 24.97%, 
and on 18 September 2013, sold the remainder of its holding in the Company and consequently ceased to be a related party from that date. 
Additionally, Mr Aggarwal ceased to be a Director of the Company from 20 September 2013.
Prior to this, dividends of £0.4m (2012: £0.5m) were paid to Lifestyle Investments PVT Limited.

31. Contingent liabilities
The Company’s material UK subsidiaries have entered into a guarantee and debenture which effectively means that all of their assets, 
property or otherwise, and undertakings are charged in favour of the security agent acting on behalf of the lending banks to the Company. 
32. Principal subsidiaries 
The principal Group subsidiaries are disclosed below. Transactions between subsidiaries and between the Parent Company and its subsidiaries 
are eliminated on consolidation.
UK
 — Norcros Group (Holdings) Limited
Overseas
 — Norcros SA (Pty) Limited* trading as Johnson Tiles (Pty) Limited, TAL and TAF (incorporated in South Africa)
* The Group interest is owned by Group companies other than Norcros plc.
Notes
Unless otherwise stated, all companies are 100% owned and all UK companies are incorporated and operate in Great Britain and are registered 
in England. Overseas companies operate in the countries in which they are incorporated.
Only those subsidiary undertakings whose results principally affect the financial statements of the Group are included above.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 410 (2) of the Companies Act 2006 by providing information only 
in relation to subsidiary undertakings whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affected the financial 
statements. A full list of subsidiaries is included on the Company’s annual return.
_0_NXR_ar14_Back_[SM_MR].indd   37 24/06/2014   10:27:57 92  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Our opinion
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2014;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by Norcros plc, comprise:
 — the Parent Company Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2014; and
 — the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect 
of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and accounts (the 
“Annual Report”), rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 — the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
 — is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 54, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Norcros plc for the year ended 31 March 2014.

1. Statement of accounting policies
Norcros plc prepares its financial statements on the going concern basis under the historical cost basis of accounting with the exception 
of share-based payments which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and in accordance with both applicable accounting standards 
in the UK and the Companies Act 2006. A summary of the more important accounting polices which have been applied consistently 
is set out below. 
Accounting reference date
The Company’s year end is stated as 31 March. 
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. The Directors believe the carrying value of investments 
is supported by their underlying assets. Dividends received from investments are included within turnover and recognised on receipt of 
the dividend.
Foreign currency transactions
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates applicable at the year end. Exchange 
gains and losses are dealt with in arriving at the operating profit.
Taxation
Deferred taxation has been recognised as a liability or asset if transactions have occurred at the Balance Sheet date that give rise to 
an obligation to pay more taxation in the future or a right to pay less taxation in the future. An asset is recognised only when the transfer 
of economic benefits is more likely than not to occur. 
Profit and loss account
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented as permitted by Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Cash flow statement
As the Group prepares consolidated financial statements, the Company is exempt from publishing a Cash Flow Statement under 
FRS 1 (revised 1996).
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or when paid if earlier.
Financial assets and liabilities
Borrowings – the Company measures all borrowings initially at fair value. This is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received. 
Transaction costs (any such costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in 
the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the Profit and Loss Account over the duration of 
the borrowing.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Related parties
Related party disclosures are made in the Group accounts under note 30.
In accordance with FRS 8, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
2. Other information
Other than the Directors, who receive no emoluments from the Parent Company, the Company has no employees. Details of the Directors’ 
emoluments can be found in note 4 of the Group accounts.
Auditor’s remuneration of £3,000 (2013: £3,000) is borne by the Company’s subsidiary, without recharge.

capital excluding any shares issued as part of a capital raising. One of the warrant holders exercised their warrant instrument in full during 
the year and acquired 3,180,594 shares at the exercise price of 8.97p per share.
Taking into account the capital raising in 2010 the remaining warrants now represent 3,174,569 ordinary shares (0.54% of the issued ordinary 
share capital) at 31 March 2014. The warrants are exercisable at 8.97p per share at any time up to July 2017.

is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 23 July 2014. These financial statements do not reflect this final dividend.
11. Contingent liabilities
The Company has entered into a guarantee and debenture which effectively means that all of its assets, property or otherwise, 
and undertakings are charged in favour of the security agent acting on behalf of the lending banks to the Company.
12. Financial risk management objectives and policies
A description of the Group’s financial risk management policies are provided in the Directors’ Report on page 53. These objectives 
and policies also apply to the Company.

Notice of Annual General Meeting continued 
Notes
1.  A member who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint another person, or two or more persons in respect 
of different shares held by him, as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend and to speak and vote at the meeting.
2.  The right of a member of the Company to vote at the meeting will be determined by reference to the register of members. A member 
must be registered on that register as the holder of ordinary shares of 1p each (“ordinary shares”) by 6.00 pm on 21 July 2014 in order 
to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting as a member in respect of those shares. 
3.  A member wishing to attend and vote at the meeting in person should arrive prior to the time fixed for its commencement. A member 
that is a corporation can only attend and vote at the meeting in person through one or more representatives appointed in accordance 
with Section 323 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended. Any such representative should bring to the meeting written evidence of 
his appointment, such as a certified copy of a board resolution of, or a letter from, the corporation concerned confirming the appointment. 
Any member wishing to vote at the meeting without attending in person or (in the case of a corporation) through its duly appointed 
representative must appoint a proxy to do so. Forms for the appointment of a proxy that can be used for this purpose have been provided 
to members with this Notice of Annual General Meeting. To be valid, a proxy appointment form must be completed in accordance 
with the instructions that accompany it and then be delivered (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is 
signed, or a certified copy of such item) to Capita Asset Services, PXS at The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4ZF 
so as to be received by 11.00 am on 21 July 2014. Alternatively, a member may appoint a proxy online by following the instructions for 
the electronic appointment of a proxy at www.capitashareportal.com. If you have not previously registered to use this facility you will 
require your investor code which can be located on the enclosed proxy form. In order to be a valid proxy appointment, the member’s 
electronic message confirming the details of the appointment completed in accordance with those instructions must be transmitted 
so as to be received by the same time. Members who hold their shares in uncertificated form may also use the CREST voting service 
to appoint a proxy electronically, as explained below. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member from attending and voting 
in person at the meeting should he so wish.
4.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is currently nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information rights under 
Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, (a “nominated person”) may have a right under an agreement between him and 
that member to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If a nominated person has no such right 
or does not wish to exercise it, he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member concerned as to the 
exercise of voting rights. The statement in note 1 above of the rights of a member in relation to the appointment of proxies does not 
apply to a nominated person. Such rights can only be exercised by the member concerned. 
5.  Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll, rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting 
as members’ votes are counted according to the number of ordinary shares held. As soon as practicable following the meeting, the 
results of the voting at the meeting and the numbers of proxy votes cast for and against, together with the number of votes actively 
withheld in respect of, each of the resolutions will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and will also placed on the 
Company’s website: www.norcros.com. 
6.  As at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document), (i) the Company’s issued share capital 
consisted of 587,885,491 ordinary shares carrying one vote each and (ii) the total voting rights in the Company were 587,885,491. 
7.  Each member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting which, 
in accordance with Section 319A of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, and subject to some exceptions, the Company must 
cause to be answered. Information relating to the meeting which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006, as amended, 
to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at www.norcros.com. A member may not use any electronic 
address provided by the Company in this document or with any proxy appointment form or in any website for communicating 
with the Company for any purpose in relation to the meeting other than as expressly stated in it.
8.  It is possible that, pursuant to members’ requests made in accordance with Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, the 
Company will be required to publish on a website a statement in accordance with Section 528 of that Act setting out any matter that 
the members concerned propose to raise at the meeting relating to the audit of the Company’s latest audited accounts. The Company 
cannot require the members concerned to pay its expenses in complying with those sections. The Company must forward any such 
statement to its auditor by the time it makes the statement available on the website. The business that may be dealt with at the 
meeting includes any such statement.

Notes continued
9.  CREST members who wish to appoint one or more proxies through the CREST system may do so by using the procedures described 
in the CREST voting service section of the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed one or more voting service providers, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or a proxy instruction made 
using the CREST voting service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST proxy appointment instruction”) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with the specifications of CREST’s operator, Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (“Euroclear”) and must contain 
all the relevant information required by the CREST manual. To be valid, the message (regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment 
of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must be transmitted so as to be received 
by Capita Asset Services (ID RA10), as the Company’s “issuer’s agent”, by 11.00 am on 21 July 2014. After this time, any change of 
instruction to a proxy appointed through the CREST system should be communicated to the appointee through other means. The time 
of the message’s receipt will be taken to be when (as determined by the timestamp applied by the CREST Applications Host) Capita 
Asset Services is first able to retrieve it by enquiry through the CREST system in the prescribed manner. Euroclear does not make 
available special procedures in the CREST system for transmitting any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations 
apply in relation to the input of CREST proxy appointment instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or a CREST sponsored member or has appointed any voting service provider(s), 
to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as is necessary to ensure that a message 
is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting service provider(s) should take into account the provisions of the CREST manual concerning timings as well as its section 
on “Practical limitations of the system”. In certain circumstances, the Company may, in accordance with the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 or the CREST manual, treat a CREST proxy appointment instruction as invalid. 
10.  The Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication which it sends 
but does not accept responsibility for any loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachment sent by the 
Company. The Company recommends that members subject all emails and attachments to virus checking procedures prior to opening 
or use. Any electronic communication received by the Company or Capita Asset Services (including the lodgement of an electronic 
proxy form) which is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
11.  Copies of Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment will be available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours each business day and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes 
prior to and during the meeting.
12.  The rules of the Norcros plc 2011 Deferred Bonus Plan and the rules of the Norcros plc 2011 Performance Share Plan will be available 
for inspection during normal business hours on Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays) at our registered office and at the offices 
of Addleshaw Goddard LLP, Milton Gate, 60 Chiswell Street, London EC1Y 4AG from the date of this document until the close of the Annual 
General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes before and during the Annual General Meeting.
13.  Information regarding this meeting, including information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, is available at 
www.norcros.com.

Explanatory notes
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will take place at 11.00 am on 23 July 2014 at De Vere Mottram Hall, Wilmslow Road, 
Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire SK10 4QT. The Notice convening that meeting, together with the resolutions to be proposed, appears on pages 
98 to 101 of this document. The Directors recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of all of the resolutions to be proposed, as the Directors 
intend to do so in respect of their own shares, and consider that they are in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole.
Explanatory notes in relation to the resolutions appear below:
Resolution 1
Report and accounts
For each financial year, the Directors are required to present the audited accounts, the auditor’s report and the Directors’ Report 
to shareholders at a general meeting.
Resolution 2
Approval of the Remuneration Report
The Company is required by law to seek the approval of shareholders of its annual report on remuneration policy and practice. 
This does not affect the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration and the result of this resolution is advisory only.
The Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2014 is set out in full on pages 37 to 50 of this document. Any shareholder who 
would like a copy of the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 can obtain one by contacting our registrar on 0871 664 0300. Alternatively, 
the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 can be viewed on our website at www.norcros.com.
Included in the text of the Remuneration Report is the directors’ remuneration policy statement. Please note that there is a specific 
resolution concerning this (see Resolution 3).
Your Directors are satisfied that the Company’s policy and practice in relation to Directors’ remuneration are reasonable and that they 
deserve shareholder support.
Resolution 3
Approval of the Directors’ remuneration policy statement
For the first time this year, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company proposes an ordinary resolution to approve the 
Directors’ remuneration policy statement contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The policy statement is set out on pages 39 to 43 
of the Annual Report. The vote on this resolution is binding and, if passed, will mean that the Directors can only make remuneration payments 
in accordance with the approved policy. The Company is required to ensure that a vote on its remuneration policy takes place annually unless 
the approved policy remains unchanged, in which case the Company will propose a similar resolution at least every three years.
Resolution 4
Dividend
The payment of the final dividend requires the approval of shareholders in general meeting. If the meeting approves resolution 4, the final 
dividend of 0.34 pence per ordinary share will be paid on 30 July 2014 to ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members on 
27 June 2014 in respect of each ordinary share. 
Resolution 5
Re-election of Jo Hallas
It is proposed that Jo Hallas be re-elected as a Director.
Brief biographical details of Jo can be found on page 28. The Chairman confirms that, following performance evaluation, 
Jo’s performance continues to be effective, she demonstrates commitment to the role and she possesses the necessary experience 
and knowledge. The Board therefore unanimously recommends that Jo be re-elected as a Director. 
Resolution 6
Re-election of Martin Towers
It is proposed that Martin Towers be re-elected as a Director.
Brief biographical details of Martin can be found on page 28. The Board confirms that, following performance evaluation, 
Martin’s performance continues to be effective, he demonstrates commitment to the role and he possesses the necessary experience 
and knowledge. The Board unanimously recommends that Martin be re-elected as a Director. 
Resolution 7
Re-election of David McKeith
It is proposed that David McKeith be re-elected as a Director.
Brief biographical details of David can be found on page 29. The Chairman confirms that, following performance evaluation, 
David’s performance continues to be effective, he demonstrates commitment to the role and he possesses the necessary experience 
and knowledge. The Board unanimously recommends that David be re-elected as a Director.

Resolution 8
Re-election of Nick Kelsall
It is proposed that Nick Kelsall be re-elected as a Director.
Brief biographical details of Nick can be found on page 29. The Chairman confirms that, following performance evaluation, 
Nick’s performance continues to be effective, he demonstrates commitment to the role and he possesses the necessary experience 
and knowledge. The Board unanimously recommends that Nick be re-elected as a Director. 
Resolution 9
Re-election of Martin Payne
It is proposed that Martin Payne be re-elected as a Director.
Brief biographical details of Martin can be found on page 29. The Chairman confirms that, following performance evaluation, 
Martin’s performance continues to be effective, he demonstrates commitment to the role and he possesses the necessary experience 
and knowledge. The Board unanimously recommends that Martin be re-elected as a Director. 
Resolution 10
Re-appointment of auditor
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting before which accounts are laid, to hold office until the end of the next 
such meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has indicated that it is willing to continue as the Company’s auditor for another year. You are therefore 
asked to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Directors recommend the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Resolution 11
Remuneration of auditor
The resolution follows best practice in giving authority to the Directors to determine the remuneration of the Company’s auditor.
Resolution 12
Amendment to the rules of the Norcros plc 2011 Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
The Company’s Remuneration Report outlines the proposed changes to Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2014. As part of these 
changes the Committee proposes to make the following change to the rules of the DBP.
Currently the rules of the DBP do not allow for options granted under the DBP to be made with an entitlement to dividend equivalents. 
It is proposed that the rules of the DBP be amended so that in future options granted under the plan will be made on the basis that, on the 
exercise of an option, a participant shall receive an amount in cash and/or shares equivalent to the value of the dividends that would have 
been paid on the shares between the date of grant of the option and the date of vesting.
The Remuneration Committee has consulted with its principal shareholders in relation to the proposed amendment and received general support.
Resolution 13
Amendment to the rules of the Norcros plc 2011 Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The proposed change to the rules of the PSP is exactly the same as for the DBP outlined above.
Again, the Remuneration Committee has consulted with its principal shareholders in relation to the proposed amendment and received 
general support.
Resolution 14
Power to allot shares
Most listed companies renew their directors’ authority to issue shares at each Annual General Meeting. Such an authority was granted at last 
year’s Annual General Meeting and is due to expire on 24 January 2015 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
of the Company. In accordance with best practice, this resolution seeks to renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares.
Resolution 14, if passed, will renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum aggregate nominal 
value of £3,919,237 (representing 391,923,700 ordinary shares). This represents the Association of British Insurers’ (ABI) guideline limit of 
approximately two thirds of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of this document). Of this amount, ordinary shares to an aggregate nominal value of £1,959,618 (representing 195,961,800 
ordinary shares which is approximately one third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 16 June 2014 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this document)), can only be allotted pursuant to a rights issue. 
As at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), the Company did not hold any shares 
in the Company in treasury. The renewed authority will remain in force until 18 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, 
at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2015.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority. The purpose of giving the Directors this authority is to maintain the 
Company’s flexibility to take advantage of any appropriate opportunities that may arise.

Explanatory notes continued
Resolution 15
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
The Directors are currently authorised, subject to certain limitations, to issue securities of the Company for cash without first offering 
them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. That authority will expire on 24 January 2015 or, if earlier, 
at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company and, in accordance with best practice, this resolution (which 
will be proposed as a special resolution) seeks to renew the Directors’ authority to disapply pre-emption rights. 
Other than in connection with a rights or other similar issue or where, for example, difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas 
shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements, the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal 
value of £293,943, which represents 29,394,300 ordinary shares and is approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital as at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document)). The renewed authority will remain 
in force until 18 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2015. 
In accordance with the Statement of Principles on disapplying pre-emption rights issued by the Pre-Emption Group (which is supported 
by the ABI, the National Association of Pension Funds Limited and the Investment Managers Association), the Board confirms its intention 
that no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital will be issued for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three year period.
Resolution 16
Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, is a resolution which the Company proposes to seek on an annual basis, 
in line with other listed companies in the UK, to give the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted 
by the Companies Act 2006. The authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to an aggregate maximum of 58,788,549 
ordinary shares which have an aggregate nominal value of £587,885 (representing approximately 10% of the aggregate nominal value 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this 
document)) and sets minimum and maximum prices. The renewed authority will remain in force until 18 months after the passing of 
this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2015.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares, but will keep the matter 
under review, taking into account other investment opportunities. The authority will be exercised only if the Directors believe that to do 
so would result in an increase in earnings per share and would promote the success of the Company and be in the best interests of its 
shareholders generally. To the extent that any shares so purchased are held in treasury (see below), earnings per share will be enhanced 
until such time, if any, as such shares are resold or transferred out of treasury.
Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. If any shares are 
purchased, they will be either cancelled or held in treasury. Any such decision will be made by the Directors at the time of purchase on 
the basis of the shareholders’ best interests. Shares held in treasury can be cancelled, sold for cash or, in appropriate circumstances, used 
to meet obligations under employee share schemes. Any shares held in treasury would not be eligible to vote nor would any dividend be 
paid on any such shares. If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are not held by the Company as treasury shares, 
then such shares would be immediately cancelled, in which event the number of ordinary shares in issue would be reduced.
The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice. Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares gives the 
Company the ability to re-issue them quickly and cost effectively and provides the Company with additional flexibility in the management 
of its capital base. 
As at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), there were warrants and options over 
31,160,091 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 5.30% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options and warrants would 
represent approximately 5.89% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at 16 June 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this document), the Company did not hold any shares in treasury.
Resolution 17
Notice of general meeting
This special resolution is required in order to preserve the ability of the Company to convene general meetings (other than Annual General 
Meetings) of the Company on not less than 14 clear days’ notice, rather than on not less than the 21 days’ notice that would otherwise 
be required. In order to preserve this ability, the Company’s shareholders must have approved the calling of such meetings on not less than 
14 clear days’ notice. Resolution 17 seeks such approval. 
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for general meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the 
business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of the shareholders as a whole.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be 
proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic proxy submission under the Companies (Shareholders’ 
Rights) Regulations 2009 before it can call a general meeting on such notice.

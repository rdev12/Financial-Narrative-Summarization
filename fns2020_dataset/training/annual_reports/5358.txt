CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The economic downturn that the world experienced in 2009 has severely 
tested the resilience and ﬁ nancial strength of most companies and 
businesses around the globe.  I am therefore happy to report that,  despite 
the resultant downturn in results that we have experienced in 2009,  our 
businesses have nevertheless each reported a positive operating result for 
the year,  before exceptional items,  and the Group’s balance sheet remains 
robust,  with the year end net debt to EBITDA ratio at a level of 1.8 times.  
This was achieved through the inherent quality of our main businesses,  
each of which maintained its market leading position in its sector,  and 
by management taking immediate action on costs in the early part of the 
year to mitigate the effects of the sharp downturn.  In addition,  while the 
severity of the downturn caused management to put greater focus on 
some shorter term issues during the year,  such as current costs and cash 
ﬂ ow,  we were nevertheless still able to take some strategic actions that 
will help us achieve our longer term goals.  Specialty Products completed 
an acquisition,  in December 2009,  of a US based business called Fancor.  
Although modest in size,  this acquisition increases our presence and 
product offering in the faster growing personal care market.  In Chromium,  
we took the decision to close our UK facility which will improve earnings 
stability and therefore the quality of the business going forward.

Results
Operating proﬁ t for the year,  before exceptional items,  
was £23.4 million compared to £52.0 million in the 
previous year.  Earnings per share on the same basis was 
2.8 pence compared to 9.1 pence in 2008.  Revenue in 
2009 was £363.7 million which,  on a constant currency 
basis and after adjusting for 2008 acquisitions,  is 
28 per cent lower than the previous year,  mainly due to 
the effects of the economic downturn which were more 
prominent in the ﬁ rst half of the year as a result of severe 
customer destocking.  Consequently,  sales volumes in 
the second half of the year were 27 per cent higher than 
in the ﬁ rst half and operating proﬁ t,  before exceptional 
items,  in the second half was £17.8 million compared to 
£5.6 million in the ﬁ rst half.  
The Group recorded a number of exceptional items in 
the year,  including the closure of the UK Chromium plant 
and some one-time hedging costs,  all of which were 
announced at the time of the Group’s 2009 interim results 
statement.  In the second half of the year we received 
notiﬁ cation of ﬁ nes from the EU Commission relating 
to their investigation into heat stabilisers and,  while we 
are appealing this decision in the strongest terms,  we 
have taken the prudent approach of providing for the full 
potential cost of the ﬁ nes.  An exceptional pension credit 
has also been recorded in respect of adjustments to past 
service credits relating to bridging pension offsets.  The 
total of all exceptional items recorded in 2009 is therefore 
£49.5 million (2008:  £20.5 million).  After taking account 
of these items the Group recorded a loss of 8.3 pence per 
share compared to a proﬁ t of 4.5 pence in 2008.
EU Commission ﬁ nes
As announced in November 2009 the Group received 
a communication from the EU Commission regarding 
the imposition of ﬁ nes on Elementis and others.  The 
communication stated that the Commission was 
imposing a ﬁ ne of Euro 14.3 million on Elementis and a 
further ﬁ ne of Euro 18.3 million jointly and severally on 
Elementis,  Akcros Chemicals Ltd and companies owned 
by Akzo Nobel.  The Euro 14.3 million ﬁ ne was paid in 
February 2010 and the Company’s share of the latter ﬁ ne 
has yet to be determined.  The Company has ﬁ led with the 
General Court of the EU an action to annul the decision 
of the Commission to impose the ﬁ nes and will continue 
to vigorously assert its position that the Commission is 
precluded from imposing any ﬁ ne on Elementis or its 
afﬁ liates.  Elementis’  policy is to conduct its business in 
full compliance with all applicable competition laws.  
Dividend
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 1.4 pence 
per share,  taking the total return to shareholders for the 
year to 2.9 pence,  the same amount as last year.  The Board 
concluded that maintaining the dividend was appropriate 
in spite of the downturn as it remains conﬁ dent in the 
Group’s strategy and expects to make progress as the 
economy recovers.  Subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting,  the dividend will be paid on 28 May 
2010 to shareholders on the register on 30 April 2010.  
The Board intends to continue to review the dividend 
policy as earnings performance and debt levels permit.
Future reporting
The Board has decided to present the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
statements in US dollars under IFRS with effect from 
the beginning of 2010.  The majority of the Group’s 
sales and earnings originate in US dollars or US dollar 
linked currencies and the change will more closely align 
external reporting with the proﬁ le of the Group,  as well 
as with current internal management reporting.  In the 
future,  dividends will be determined in US dollars and 
paid in sterling at the closing exchange rate on the date 
the dividend is announced.  More information will be 
provided to shareholders,  including restated 2009 ﬁ gures 
in US dollars,  in a press release at the time of the next 
Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2010.  The ﬁ rst set of 
Group ﬁ nancial statements to be presented in US dollars 
will be the interim results statement for 2010.
Health,  safety and environment 
I am happy to report that our activities in this important 
area of our business have continued to be of a high 
standard during 2009 with no signiﬁ cant incidents 
reported by any of our businesses.
People
In a difﬁ cult year of trading,  such as we have experienced 
in 2009,  the pressures and responsibilities on our people 
are greatly increased,  and it is through their efforts 
that the Group has ended 2009 in a position to be able 
to beneﬁ t from the eventual economic recovery.  On 
behalf of the Board I would like to thank them for their 
tremendous contributions.
Outlook
As we begin 2010,  trading has started on a more positive 
note and it appears that our customers are restocking,  
which is having a positive impact on our sales volumes.  
Our businesses have been strengthened by the 
strategic actions taken in 2009 and the Group remains 
well ﬁ nanced,  therefore we expect to make progress 
going forward.  However,  we will remain cautious until 
underlying demand patterns become clearer and signs 
of a sustained global recovery become more evident.

Chairman
23 February 2010 04 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
Elementis utilises scientiﬁ c innovation and manufacturing technology to 
deliver products that enhance the performance and value of our customers’  
products.  The Specialty Products business provides rheology additives 
that enhance the ﬂ ow characteristics of our customers’  products in markets 
such as paints and coatings,  cosmetics,  and oil and gas exploration.  The 
Surfactants business provides chemicals that enhance the performance 
of our customers’  products in markets such as household cleaners,  paper 
goods and oilﬁ eld chemicals.  The Chromium business provides chemicals 
to our customers that make their products more durable in applications 
such as aerospace alloys,  timber treatment and leather production. 
The strategy of the Group is to leverage our competitive advantage,  deliver 
technological innovation and cultivate our global presence in order to 
proﬁ tably grow the Specialty Products business,  utilising cash ﬂ ow from 
the Chromium and Surfactants businesses.
STATEMENT OF GROUP STRATEGY
We will do this by:
1.  Preferentially growing the Specialty Products 
business through a mixture of organic growth 
from new products,  markets,  applications or 
geographies,  and selective acquisitions in rheology 
or complementary additives,  with the aim of growing 
revenue and market share whilst maintaining margins.
2.  Consistently delivering a relatively stable and 
sustainable level of earnings from the Chromium 
business by serving higher margin markets and 
customers,  optimising operational performance 
from the business’ s  more ﬂ exible and lower cost 
manufacturing footprint,  and improving margins 
through maintaining pricing discipline,  managing 
energy and raw material costs and creating more 
efﬁ cient supply chains.  
3.  Steadily upgrading the product portfolio in 
Surfactants by focussing on higher margin 
applications,  while at the same time maintaining 
cost discipline.
4.  Continually improving the quality of the Group’ s 
balance sheet by generating strong free cash ﬂ ow 
and reducing the proportion of non-business items 
such as legacy pension funds and provisions.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S OVERVIEW

Group Chief 
Executive
£5.6m
Fancor acquisition
£16.0m
Annualised cost 
savings
Dear Shareholders,
2009 witnessed the most challenging macro economic 
conditions experienced in decades,  testing both the 
strength of our business model and the ability of our 
leadership to take fast,  decisive actions.  We succeeded 
in addressing the impact of unprecedented erosion 
in global demand across our markets by swiftly 
implementing a global cost reduction programme,  while 
maintaining superior customer service and continuing 
our investment in innovative technology.  In addition,  
we have been able to maintain our market share in each 
business segment,  whilst maintaining contribution 
margins.  Disciplined leadership at the business unit level 
resulted in all three Elementis businesses contributing to 
positive operating cash ﬂ ow for the year and a stable year 
on year debt position. 
Whilst the weak global trading environment disrupted the 
positive momentum created by four consecutive years 
of double digit EPS* improvement,  our business teams 
stayed focussed throughout the year.  That focus was on 
the successful execution of our long term strategy and 
a resolute commitment that Elementis enters 2010 in a 
stronger competitive position.
2009 Highlights:
All of our efforts resulted in a solid performance relative 
to the industry and the economic environment:
•
  Annualised costs reduced by £16 million,  of which
£10 million is expected to be sustained as customer 
demand recovers.
•
  Specialty Products maintained its contribution margin.
•
  Chromium ceased production at its UK facility in 
July,  successfully transitioning customers and 
releasing £7 million of cash ﬂ ow from the liquidation 
of working capital at the site. 
•
  Surfactants continued to improve the quality of 
its product portfolio.
•
  Deuchem was successfully integrated and began 
contributing impressively to our performance in 
Asia Paciﬁ c.
•
  Acquisition of Fancor in December 2009 strengthens 
our proﬁ table personal care business.
•
  Maintained an excellent health and safety record.
•
  Net debt remains essentially unchanged despite 
unprecedented decline in volumes and exceptional 
cash costs of £14.7 million.
Looking ahead we will continue to pursue proﬁ table 
growth in specialty markets and applications.  Specialty 
Products’  technical expertise,  product leadership,  
customer understanding and balanced geographical 
footprint provide a competitive advantage that enhances 
a strong platform for growth.  We will direct our energy 
and resources to geographies,  market segments and 
technologies that have the potential to generate material 
growth during what we anticipate will be a period of 
modest progress in global GDP trends.  While innovation 
and new product development remain the cornerstone 
of our organic growth strategy,  we will continue to seek 
prudent investments that leverage Specialty Products’  
quality core competencies and further strengthen its 
market position. 
The closure of the Chromium UK manufacturing facility 
addressed a fundamental long term strategic issue.  
Idling the high cost facility,  that had manufactured a 
non-differentiated product line,  has positioned the 
business to deliver stable earnings and cash ﬂ ow by 
providing high quality products from low cost,  ﬂ exible 
manufacturing facilities to a diverse global customer base.
While market sentiment is generally turning more 
positive as we begin 2010,  we continue to plan prudently 
and to leverage the operational efﬁ ciencies achieved 
in 2009.  The progress we made towards achieving our 
goals has been realised thanks to the hard work and 
initiative of the global Elementis team.  Their engagement 
and commitment is remarkable and truly appreciated.  
Based on the fundamental strength of our businesses,  
strong market position versus our peers,  a more robust 
Chromium business structure and the growth potential 
of Specialty Products,  I am quite positive about the future 
and conﬁ dent in our ability to make progress in the 
medium term.  I would like to thank our shareholders and 
customers for their continued conﬁ dence and support.

Specialty Products’ 
2009 operating proﬁ t*
Elementis Specialty Products is a leading manufacturer 
of rheology control additives that are used to enhance 
the performance of our customers’  products.  Best in 
class technical support and customer service are critical 
core competencies of the business and provide the 
platform to deliver added value in the coatings,  oilﬁ eld 
exploration,  construction and personal care markets.  The 
strategy of the business is to grow in rheology products 
and complementary additives through new product 
innovation,  expansion into new geographies and bolt 
on acquisitions.  In 2008 the business made an important 
step forward in this strategy by acquiring the Deuchem 
additives and Yuhong organoclay businesses in Taiwan 
and China.  Deuchem is a leading supplier of additives 
and resins to the coatings and related industries and the 
acquisition signiﬁ cantly expanded Elementis’  presence 
in Asia Paciﬁ c,  and provided a platform for the Specialty 
Products business to accelerate growth in the region.  In 
December 2009,  the business also acquired substantially 
all of the assets of  The Fanning Corporation and Fancor 
Ltd (“Fancor”) for £5.6 million.  Fancor is one of the largest 
North American suppliers of lanolin and lanolin derivatives,  
with sales of £7.9 million in 2009,  and is a global leader in 
eco-friendly Meadowfoam and Abyssinian oil derivatives.  
The addition of the Fancor products will allow Elementis 
Specialty Products to bring an expanded product portfolio 
of specialty additives to the global personal care market 
and creates an exciting opportunity to work more closely 
with existing customers in the personal care,  hair-care,  
skin-care,  colour-cosmetics and antiperspirant markets. 
Sales in 2009 were £194.6 million compared to 
£181.5 million in the previous year.  The acquisition of 
Deuchem in July 2008 contributed £23.4 million to year 
on year sales,  as no Deuchem sales were recorded by 
the Group in the ﬁ rst half of 2008.  Adjusting for this and 
the effects of currency movements,  sales were lower 
by approximately 22 per cent compared to 2008.  The 
main driver of the reduction was the severe economic 
downturn that occurred towards the end of 2008 that led 
to signiﬁ cant customer destocking and resulted in sales 
volumes (excluding Deuchem) in the ﬁ rst half of 2009 
being almost 30 per cent lower than the previous year.  
However,  the second half of the year saw demand levels 
improving as the effects of destocking subsided and some

Areas of focus

  Excellent customer service and understanding
•
  Technical expertise and support,  and product 
innovation
•
  Operational excellence to maintain margins and 
improve procurement and supply chain efﬁ ciencies
Elementis Specialty Products 
modest restocking by customers was evident towards the 
end of the year.  As a result,  sales volumes in the second half 
of the year were approximately 16 per cent better than the 
ﬁ rst half.  Half year coatings sales to Asia Paciﬁ c showed the 
largest improvement with sales volumes up by over 20 per 
cent,  driven by a strong performance by Deuchem plus the 
impact of the economic stimulus package introduced by 
the Chinese government in the early part of the year.
Operating proﬁ t in 2009 was £18.4 million compared to 
£29.1 million in the previous year.  The result was lower 
primarily as a result of the lower sales volumes,  but the 
impact was reduced by management actions taken in the 
early part of the year to reduce costs,  as well as there being 
a full year of results from Deuchem in the year as opposed 
to only six months in 2008.  Currency movements also had a 
positive impact of approximately £3.1 million.  Contribution 
margins were relatively stable,  which was a constant theme 
throughout the year,  and there was little volatility in raw 
material costs as the business is not a signiﬁ cant purchaser 
of the more commoditised products. 
Elementis Surfactants is a specialty surfactant manufacturer 
offering innovative products to markets such as oilﬁ eld 
chemicals,  pulp and paper and household products.  Its 
strategy is to focus on higher margin markets such as 
agrochemicals,  feed,  plastic and resins and limit activity in 
high volume commodity applications.  At the same time 
the business seeks to continually reduce operating costs 
by more efﬁ cient utilisation of its manufacturing facility 
in the Netherlands,  which it shares with the Specialty 
Products business.  
Surfactant sales in 2009 were £49.2 million compared to 
£51.1 million in 2008,  a fall of four per cent,  or 14 per cent 
on a constant currency basis.  Lower sales volumes brought 
about by the economic downturn were again the main 
cause of the decline,  but the scale of the reduction was less 
severe than for other Group businesses because a greater 
proportion of Surfactants’  sales go to more defensive 
market sectors that were less affected by the economic 
downturn,  such as household consumables.
Business strategy
To focus on higher margin markets such as 
agrochemicals,  feed,  plastic and resins to balance 
the base-load activity in high volume commodity 
applications.

Chromium’s 2009 
operating proﬁ t*
Operating proﬁ t for the year was £0.1 million compared 
to £0.5 million in 2008.  The business was able to sustain 
its operating result in spite of the drop in sales volumes 
due to the ongoing management process of moving the 
business to more sustainable,  higher margin products. 
Elementis Chromium is one of the world’s largest suppliers 
of chrome chemicals,  which are used in a variety of end 
markets including metal alloys,  pigments,  metal ﬁ nishing,  
leather tanning and foundry applications.  The business 
operates within the Group from a separate legal entity 
structure and has no interactions with other Group 
businesses other than at the administrative level.  Its 
strategy is to provide high quality products to its customers 
utilising low cost,  sustainable manufacturing facilities to 
produce mostly higher margin products such as chromic 
acid and chromic oxide.  Global supply/demand balances 
are a signiﬁ cant driver of margins in the chromium 
chemicals market and Elementis Chromium seeks to 
produce stable earnings by serving higher value markets 
and by utilising its ﬂ exible manufacturing base 
to adjust to changes in demand.  In 2009 the business 
decided to close its UK facility in Eaglescliffe,  which 
produced less differentiated products than its US facilities,  
was more exposed to Chinese competition and whose 
proﬁ tability had relied heavily on supplying intermediate 
products to the US business.  Closure of the facility is 
therefore very much in line with the business strategy 
and concentrates the global production capability of the 
business in the US where the business has a more ﬂ exible 
manufacturing platform and a more value added product 
offering to its customers.  As a result of the closure the 
business recorded an exceptional charge in the year of 
£28.7 million (2008:  £20.5 million).
Sales in 2009 were £119.9 million compared to 
£168.6 million in the previous year which,  on a constant 
currency basis,  represents a fall of 42 per cent.  The decline 
was almost entirely due to a drop in sales volumes as the 
economic decline and customer destocking severely 
impacted demand,  particularly in the ﬁ rst part of 2009.  
Volumes improved in the second half of the year as the 
effects of destocking subsided and consequently sales 
volumes in the second half were approximately 50 per cent 
higher than in the ﬁ rst half,  although still 26 per cent lower 
than for the same period last year.  For the year as a whole,  
sales of chromic acid fared relatively better due to steady 
demand for utility poles in the US,  while sales of all products 
into Europe declined more than other regions due to 
the closure of the Eaglescliffe facility,  which temporarily 
reduced product availability to the European market.  
Nevertheless,  in conjunction with the closure programme,  
the business was able to meet market demand for the 
majority of the year and thereby help to provide a smooth 
customer transition.
Operating proﬁ t for the year,  before exceptional items,  
was £10.5 million compared to £27.7 million in the previous 
year with the decline in sales volumes being the main 
driver of the reduction.  Average raw material costs were 
somewhat higher than in the previous year,  mainly due to 
the utilisation of chrome ore stocks that were purchased 
in the second half of 2008,  but this was partly offset by 
lower energy costs due to the decline in the price of fuel 
oil and natural gas since the previous year.  Fixed costs in 
the ongoing US business were also lower as a result of 
management actions to reduce costs taken in the early part 
of the year,  in response to the economic downturn,  and 
currency movements contributed positively approximately 
£2.6 million to the result.  Finally,  the business also beneﬁ ted 
in 2009 from a one-time gain from the sale of the ﬁ nal 
products produced at the Eaglescliffe facility during the 
closure process.  The level of ﬁ xed costs required to support 
a plant during a shutdown process is naturally lower than 
for ongoing operations and so products produced during 
that short period of time were more proﬁ table than normal.  
In line with previous guidance,  the impact of this in 2009 
was to increase operating proﬁ t on a one-time basis by 
approximately £2.5 million.
Business strategy
To produce stable earnings by serving higher value 
markets,  providing high quality,  higher margin 
products,  such as chromic acid and chromic oxide, to 
its customers;  and utilising its ﬂ exible manufacturing 
base to adjust to changes in demand.

FINANCE REPORT
Group revenue was £363.7 million in 2009 compared to £400.5 million in 
the previous year which,  after adjusting for 2008 acquisitions,  represents 
a year on year decline of 28 per cent on a constant currency basis.  The 
sharp global economic downturn that occurred towards the end of 2008,  
particularly affecting the ﬁ rst half of 2009 when customer destocking was 
prominent,  was the main cause of this decline and impacted all three of 
the Group’s businesses,  albeit by differing amounts.  From a geographical 
viewpoint,  Group sales to Asia Paciﬁ c performed better than other 
regions of the world on a year on year basis.  In particular,  annualised sales 
volumes into the region by Specialty Products were at a similar level to the 
previous year in spite of the general downturn.  This encouraging result 
was supported by the Group’s acquisition of Deuchem in 2008,  which has 
a strong position in the Chinese coatings market,  and therefore gave the 
business greater leverage to the faster growing Chinese market.

Company overview Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Business review
Group operating proﬁ t,  before exceptional items,  was 
£23.4 million compared to £52.0 million in the previous 
year and lower sales volumes were the main cause of the 
decline.  The Group result beneﬁ ted from management 
actions taken at the start of the year to reduce ﬁ xed costs 
in response to the sharp downturn in demand.  These 
actions were estimated to reduce annualised costs by 
£16 million,  of which approximately £10 million were 
considered to be of a permanent nature.  Based on the 
fact that most of these actions were implemented during 
the second quarter of 2009,  there remains approximately 
£3 million of the savings that will beneﬁ t 2010.  The result 
was also positively inﬂ uenced by currency movements,  
in particular from the strengthening of the US dollar and 
euro against sterling,  which improved operating proﬁ t 
by approximately £1.8 million.  The Group continued 
to hedge its currency exposures during 2009 by selling 
currencies forward and,  excluding amounts treated as 
exceptional items,  this also had a positive year on year 
impact on operating proﬁ t in the year of £2.4 million.  In 
addition,  as a result of the hedging programme,  currency 
gains of approximately £6 million have been effectively 
deferred into 2010 at current exchange rates.
Diluted earnings per share,  before exceptional items,  was 
2.8 pence compared to 9.1 pence in the previous year,  
primarily due to the changes in operating proﬁ t noted 
above.  Reported earnings per share,  after taking account 
of exceptional items noted below,  was a loss of 8.3 pence 
(2008:  gain of 4.5 pence) and the operating result on 
the same basis was a loss of £26.1 million (2008:  proﬁ t of 
£31.5 million).
Central costs
Central costs are costs that are not identiﬁ able as 
expenses of a particular business,  and are comprised 
of expenditures of the Board of directors and the 
corporate ofﬁ ce.
Exceptional items
Total exceptional costs of £49.5 million consist of 
£28.7 million charged to the Chromium business and 
£20.8 million charged to central costs.
Chromium
Following a strategic review at the beginning of the 
year,  the Eaglescliffe chromium plant in the UK was 
closed with production ceasing in July 2009 and an 
exceptional charge of £28.7 million recorded in the 
period.  Included within the charge is £16.3 million 
related to the anticipated site remediation costs,  being 
the current estimate calculated in conjunction with 
external consultants on the basis of an ongoing full site 
survey.  The bulk of these costs will be incurred over the 
next two years.  Employee costs of £6.0 million relate 
to severance payments and employee operating costs 
associated with the shutdown of the plant.  Exceptional 
hedging costs of £4.5 million relate to the cost of reversing 
forward exchange contracts that were taken out in 2008 
in anticipation of foreign currency cash ﬂ ows arising 
from sales made from Eaglescliffe in the second half of 
2009.  A £1.9 million charge has been incurred in respect 
of adjustments to the net realisable value of engineering 
stores and other site assets. 
Central costs
The Group hedges its currency exposure in any year by 
entering into forward contracts during the second half of 
the previous year for up to 50 per cent of the estimated 
exposure.  The signiﬁ cant downturn in sales volumes that 
took place towards the end of 2008 caused the Group to 
have more forward contracts than underlying exposure 
during the ﬁ rst half of the year.  The cost of cancelling 
these excess contracts was £4.7 million and has been 
recorded in central costs as an exceptional item. 
Following an investigation by the EU Commission into 
heat stabilisers,  the Company was notiﬁ ed of a ﬁ ne of 
Euro 14.3 million on Elementis and a further ﬁ ne of 
Euro 18.3 million served jointly and severally on Elementis,  
Akcros Chemicals Ltd and other companies owned by 
Akzo Nobel.  Elementis no longer manufactures such 
products and has not done so since 1998,  when the 
Company disposed of its 50 per cent joint venture 
interest in Akcros Chemicals to Akzo Nobel,  the other 
50 per cent joint venture owner.  The Company is 
appealing the decision of the Commission to impose 
the ﬁ nes.  An exceptional charge of £21.6 million has 
been recorded consisting of the full value of the 
Euro 14.3 million ﬁ ne and 50 per cent of the Euro 
18.3 million joint ﬁ ne along with legal costs incurred to 
date in defending the Company’s position.  The Euro 
14.3 million ﬁ ne was paid on 19 February 2010.
In 2009 a one-time gain of £5.5 million was recorded 
in respect of past service credits relating to bridging 
pensions between retirement and the state pension age.

1  EBITDA – earnings before interest,  tax,  exceptional items,  
depreciation and amortisation
The Group’s net debt increased by only £2.1 million 
in 2009 to £66.0 million,  despite EBITDA falling from 
£64.4 million in 2008 to £36.6 million in 2009 as a result 
of the economic downturn.  This was achieved through 
sensible reductions in capital spending during the 
downturn,  and by the businesses adjusting their working 
capital levels in line with the lower demand patterns.  
Changes in working capital generated a positive cash ﬂ ow 
of £5.2 million in the year,  which included £7.0 million 
from the liquidation of working capital at Chromium’s 
UK site as part of the closure programme.  In the ﬁ rst half 
of the year changes in working capital generated a cash 
outﬂ ow of £17.7 million,  due to the timing of chrome 
ore purchases and a build up of inventory at Chromium’s 
UK plant as part of the closure programme.  But this was 
successfully reversed in the second half of the year. 
Inventory days at the end of 2009 were 85 (2008:  91) 
reﬂ ecting a planned reduction in chrome ore stocks 
during the year and business initiatives to reduce inventory 
levels generally.  Debtor days were 50 at the end of the 
year (2008:  48) with the small increase being driven mainly 
by changes in sales mix.  Creditor days returned to more 
normal levels (51 in 2009 compared to 78 in 2008) having 
increased at the end of 2008 due to a strategic increase in 
chrome ore purchases towards the end of 2008 and the 
timing of some large payments close to the end of the 
year.  Spending on exceptional items was £14.7 million in 
the year,  consisting of £7.6 million on one-time hedging

Net interest increased by £1.6 million in 2009 to

£1.4 million to £1.2 million due to lower global interest 
rates and an interest refund relating to a tax repayment.  
There was net ﬁ nance cost of £3.9 million associated 
with pension schemes (2008:  £0.1 million) with the 
increase driven mainly by a reduction in pension scheme 
assets during 2008.  Discount on provisions relates to 
environmental provisions which are evaluated on a 
discounted basis.  The discount amount was adjusted to 
zero in 2009 as part of a provision rebalancing exercise.

In 2009 there was a tax charge of £5.8 million 
(2008:  £8.2 million),  representing an effective pre-
exceptional tax rate of 32.8 per cent (2008: 16.9 per cent).  
The increased tax rate reﬂ ects both the greater proportion 
of Group proﬁ t being earned in higher tax paying 
jurisdictions following the Deuchem acquisition in 
2008 and the reduced availability of tax credits in the 
US to offset deferred tax. 
Earnings per share
Note 9 sets out a number of calculations of earnings per 
share.  To better understand the underlying performance 
of the Group,  earnings per share reported under IFRS 
is adjusted for items classiﬁ ed as exceptional.  Diluted 
earnings per share,  before exceptional items,  decreased 
to 2.8 pence (2008:  9.1 pence).
Diluted earnings per share including exceptional items 
(referred to as  “reported earnings per share”  in other 
parts of this report) was a loss of 8.3 pence (2008:  proﬁ t of 
4.5 pence).  Exceptional items in 2009 reduced reported 
earnings per share by 11.1 pence (2008:  4.6 pence).

costs announced previously and £7.1 million relating 
to the Chromium plant closure.  In 2010 it is anticipated 
that a further £10.4 million will be spent on this 
programme.  Spending on acquisitions in 2009 of 
£5.6 million relates to the acquisition of Fancor and 
currency movements in the year reduced net debt by 
£11.6 million.  The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at the end 
of 2009 was 1.8 (2008:  1.0) and increased primarily 
because of the lower operating proﬁ t.

against sterling,  accounting for £25.1 million of the 
decline (2008:  £65.8 million increase). Other signiﬁ cant  
factors that impacted the net assets of the Group were the 
increase in provisions,  relating to the Eaglescliffe closure 
and the EU commission ﬁ nes,  and the increase in the

Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when 
the Group has a present obligation as a result of past 
events which is expected to result in an outﬂ ow of 
economic beneﬁ ts in order to settle the obligation.  
At the end of 2009 the Group held provisions of 
£56.4 million (2008:  £21.8 million).
The Group had a provision for environmental costs of 
£17.4 million at 31 December 2009 (2008:  £20.0 million) 
of which £7.2 million relates to ongoing businesses 
(2008:  £8.3 million) and the remainder to sites no 
longer controlled by the Group.  These balances have 
been derived using the estimates provided by external 
consultants during 2008 which have been adjusted for 
actual costs incurred in 2009,  with the same consultants 
reviewing the potential development of liabilities with 
management during 2009.  Following the closure of the 
Eaglescliffe facility,  a separate provision was created for 
anticipated site remediation costs and employee costs.  
£16.6 million of the provision remained at the year end 
and it is anticipated that £10.4 million will be spent in 
2010.  Also included within provisons at the year end is 
£20.8 million relating to the EU Commission ﬁ nes.

 (69.4) (49.3)
The Group operates several pension plans in different 
countries and a retirement medical scheme in the US.  
The largest of these is the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension 
scheme (“UK scheme”) which had a deﬁ cit under IAS 19 
of £43.1 million at the end of 2009,  an increase of £30.4 million 
over the previous year.  Gross liabilities under the scheme 
increased by £67.7 million during the year ,  principally due 
to a decrease in corporate bond yields and an increase in 
market inﬂ ation expectations.  The scheme assets also 
increased in the year to £386.4 million (2008: £349.1 million),  
partially offsetting the increase in liabilities.  The increase was 
mainly driven by a positive investment return of 16 per cent 
(2008:  negative four per cent),  as markets recovered from the 
sharp downturn experienced towards the end of 2008.  T otal 
contributions made to the scheme in the year ,  including 
deﬁ cit payments and service costs,  were £7.7 million 
(2008:  £7.7 million).   Discussions with the UK trustees are 
ongoing regarding the triennial valuation and funding plan,  
based on a valuation date of 30 September 2008.  Financial 
markets were extremely volatile around that time which 
made it a particularly difﬁ cult period to carry out a valuation.  
It is likely that the triennial valuation will arrive at a deﬁ cit value 
of £100-125 million,  which is higher than the deﬁ cit shown in 
the Group accounts on an IAS 19 basis at the end of 2008.  
There were two main reasons for this difference.  The triennial 
funding valuation uses a discount rate based on a prudent 
estimate of the expected return on the scheme’ s assets,  
whereas IAS 19 uses a discount rate based on high quality 
corporate bond yields.  In previous years the discount rates 
under these two approaches have been broadly similar ,  but 
during 2008 changes in corporate bond yields increased the 
gap between the two rates,  which has placed a relatively 
lower assessed value on the scheme’ s liabilities under IAS 19.  
Also,  in the months leading up to the triennial valuation date 
of 30 September 2008,  the ﬁ nancial market expectation for 
future price inﬂ ation was higher than it was towards the end 
of the 2008,  further reducing the IAS 19 valuation relative to 
the triennial valuation.
The previous triennial valuation was carried out as of 
30 September 2005,  at which time the Company and 
trustees agreed upon a deﬁ cit value of £49.5 million and 
the Company agreed to make deﬁ cit contributions of 
£6.2 million per annum until September 2015. Based on 
the latest triennial valuation,  the Company has indicated 
to the trustees that it is willing to increase the deﬁ cit 
contribution to £8.0 million from 2010 until such time as 
the deﬁ cit is eliminated.

Key performance 
indicators
The Group’s key performance indicators are a standard 
set of measures against which each business reports on a 
monthly basis.  Incentive plans include targets against the 
annual operating plan for operating proﬁ t and average 
trade working capital to sales ratio. 
1.  Operating proﬁ t/operating margin
Operating proﬁ t is the proﬁ t derived from the normal 
operations of the business.  Operating margin is the 
ratio of operating proﬁ t or loss,  before exceptional 
items,  to sales.  The Group achieved an operating proﬁ t,  
before exceptional items,  of £23.4 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2009 (2008:  £52.0 million).  The 
Group’s operating margin was 6.4 per cent compared to 
13.0 per cent in 2008.
2.  Trade working capital to sales ratio
The trade working capital to sales ratio is deﬁ ned as 
trade working capital divided by sales,  expressed as a 
percentage.  Trade working capital comprises inventories,  
trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.  
It speciﬁ cally excludes prepayments,  capital or interest 
related receivables or payables,  working capital related to 
acquisitions made in the year,  changes due to currency 
movements and items classiﬁ ed as other receivables 
and other payables.  The Group’s trade working capital 
to sales ratio at 31 December 2009 was 27.7 per cent 
(2008:  19.6 per cent). 
3.  Return on operating capital employed
The return on operating capital employed is deﬁ ned as 
operating proﬁ t before exceptional items divided by 
operating capital employed,  expressed as a percentage.  
Operating capital employed comprises ﬁ xed assets 
(excluding goodwill),  working capital and operating 
provisions.  Operating provisions include self insurance 
and environmental provisions but exclude restructuring 
provisions and retirement beneﬁ t obligations.  The Group’s 
return on operating capital employed was 13.0 per cent 
for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008:  31.9 per cent).
4.  Lost time accidents
A lost time accident (“LTA”) is any work related injury or 
illness sustained by an employee or directly employed 
contractor whilst working at the Group’s premises that 
results in greater than three days lost,  excluding the day 
of accident.  There were two LTAs in 2009 (2008:  three). 
5.  Contribution margin
Contribution,  which is deﬁ ned as sales less all variable 
costs,  divided by sales and expressed as a percentage 
is the deﬁ nition of contribution margin.  The Group’s 
contribution margin in 2009 was 31.6 per cent 
(2008:  33.7 per cent). 
6.  Operating cash ﬂ ow
The operating cash ﬂ ow is deﬁ ned as the net cash ﬂ ow 
from operating activities less net capital expenditure but 
excluding income taxes paid or received,  interest paid 
or received,  pension contributions net of current service 
cost and exceptional items.  In 2009 the operating cash 
ﬂ ow was £32.0 million (2008:  £49.2 million).

As mentioned under  “Exceptional items”  the Group 
recorded a one-time gain of £5.5 million in 2009 relating 
to pensions bridging between retirement and state 
pension age.
The US pension plan is smaller than the UK scheme,  
with assets of $74.5 million (2008:  $64.8 million).  The 
deﬁ cit in the plan decreased by $10.2 million,  largely 
due to a 28 per cent gain on the assets in the year 
(2008:  32 per cent loss) as equity markets in the US 
recovered from the 2008 downturn.  This gain is greater 
than for the UK scheme because the US plan has a larger 
percentage of its assets in equities.  Plan liabilities were 
similar to the previous year because assumptions for 
US inﬂ ation,  corporate bond yields and mortality rates 
remained unchanged.
The other schemes are smaller than the UK and US pension 
plans and showed only modest changes in deﬁ cit values.  Annual report and accounts 2009 Elementis plc   13

Principal risks and 
uncertainties
Risk management framework and review
The Board is ultimately responsible for the management 
of risk in the Group.  With guidance from management 
and advisers,  where appropriate,  it sets the tone for 
the Group’s policies on risk,  appetite for risk and levels 
of risk tolerance and speciﬁ cally approves:  the Group’s 
insurance programme and risk management policies 
and plans;  signiﬁ cant insurance and/or legal claims 
and/or settlements;  major acquisitions,  disposals and 
capital expenditures;  and the Group’s Annual Operating 
and Three Year Plans.  The day to day management 
of risk is delegated to the executive directors and the 
management team,  who have speciﬁ c responsibility for 
ensuring compliance with and implementing policies 
at corporate,  divisional and business unit level.  The 
Board retains an oversight role and has a schedule of 
matters speciﬁ cally reserved to it for decision,  with 
strict delegation of authority limits that have been 
communicated throughout the businesses and are 
well understood by the management team and 
business leaders.
During 2009,  the Chief Executive,  Finance Director and 
the rest of the senior management team (comprising 
the business managing directors and other functional 
heads) met formally 11 times to review business strategy 
and performance,  including matters concerning risk 
management,  where appropriate.  Management reports 
key risk management activities to the Board at least four 
times a year,  with further reports on an ad hoc basis as 
appropriate.  The ﬁ rst report was in June to present the 
Group’s insurance renewal proposals and highlight any 
signiﬁ cant change in insurance underwriters’  perception 
of the organisation from a risk transference standpoint.  
The second brieﬁ ng in October involved presentations 
from the businesses on health,  safety,  environmental 
and legal risks.  In December,  a summary of the Group’s 
risk management processes,  including a summary of 
the key risks identiﬁ ed by management during its formal 
annual review of risk and risk management activities,  was 
presented to the Board for approval.  At the December 
Board review,  business and corporate risk maps prepared 
by management were discussed and approved.  These 
risk maps summarise key risks from a list of risks identiﬁ ed 
by the businesses and are categorised and ranked 
according to severity and likelihood,  along with actions 
recommended or implemented to reduce or eliminate 
the risk.  The Board then reviewed and approved the 
disclosures on principal risks and uncertainties and the 
description of risk management activities in each Annual 
Report,  as well as the statement on internal control,  at its 
meeting in February. 
At its other meetings during 2009,  the Board discussed 
other risks related to the triennial valuation of the UK 
pension fund,  the economic downturn and the Group’s 
borrowing facility and associated covenants.  In addition 
to the presentation of legal risks at its meeting in October,  
the Board receives legal reports at its February and July 
meetings,  as part of the general review and approval of 
the respective preliminary results announcement and 
Annual Report and the interim management report and 
half year results.  The Board is kept appropriately advised 
throughout the year of any material legal issues or 
developments that may arise. 
Another important part of the Board’s approach to risk 
management concerns the Company’s system of internal 
control and the processes that have been put in place 
to manage the associated ﬁ nancial,  operational and 
compliance risks and keep them under review.  A key 
aspect of the internal control framework is the internal 
audit service and the role of the Audit Committee.  The 
report of the Audit Committee,  including a description of 
its role,  and the statement on internal control are set out 
in the Corporate governance report on pages 27 and 28. 
The Group carried out a benchmarking exercise of its risk 
management processes last year,  comparing its processes 
and standards with the UK Risk Management Standard 
(“Standard”),  issued by the Association of Insurance and 
Risk Managers and the Institute of Risk Management.  
One or two areas of improvement were identiﬁ ed,  which 
have since been addressed,  but otherwise the Group 
is considered to have met most of the requirements 
of the Standard which are that the Group is aware of 
the need for sound risk management procedures and 
demonstrates strong risk awareness and a culture built 
around mitigation wherever possible.  In 2009 the Group 
continued to invest time and resource across a range 
of risk management strategies.  These included actions 
to reduce the severity and likelihood of some risks,  and 
working closely with the Group’s insurance broker and 
major insurer to transfer other risks.  However,  despite best 
efforts,  it is recognised that there remains the possibility 
that an identiﬁ ed risk may turn into a reality,  or that a 
previously unidentiﬁ ed risk manifests itself,  causing loss 
to the Company.  Elementis has an established Business 
Continuity Plan (“BCP”) to help ensure that the business 
can continue to operate in the event of a major incident 
or crisis.  The BCP is embedded throughout the 
organisation and is periodically tested,  audited and 
subject to continual improvement.
Commercial risk
The main risk and uncertainty currently facing the 
Group’s businesses is the extent to which the economy 
can recover from the recent economic recession and 
the threat of a double-dip recession in 2010.  However,  
the actions taken by management in 2009 have lowered 
the business’s cost base,  thereby making it more resilient 
against the effects of a further deterioration in economic 
conditions.  The geographical spread of customers 
and the breadth of product applications help to reduce 
the Group’s exposure to local economic downturns.  
The closure of the UK chromium facility in 2009 has 
reduced the exposure of the Chromium business to 
economic downturn as the remaining US business’s 
manufacturing base is better able to maintain margins 
because of its more ﬂ exible production facilities and 
more differentiated products.  14 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009

Principal risks and uncertainties
continued
Regulatory risk 
Regulations such as REACh (the EU’s regulations 
concerning the Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorisation 
and Restriction of Chemicals) could affect sales of some 
chemicals.  The Group mitigates this risk by ensuring that 
all of its products are fully compliant with the REACh 
regulations.  There is also a risk that new regulations 
could restrict the Group’s sales of some of its products 
or cause customers to look for alternative products.  
The Group mitigates this risk by continually seeking to 
diversify its product range and to develop products that 
meet or anticipate its customers’  needs,  including any 
regulatory concerns.
Raw materials and energy risks
A signiﬁ cant part of the Specialty Products business 
depends on hectorite clay from the Group’s own open 
pit mine in California.  While this provides a secure source 
of clay,  there remains a risk from the exposure to ﬂ ash 
ﬂ ooding and earthquake,  which are known to have 
occurred in the past in that region and so may recur in 
the future.  Sufﬁ cient inventory of mined clay is held at the 
surface level to minimise the impact and disruption that 
such an event might cause.
The Chromium business is particularly sensitive to energy 
pricing.  Climate change regulations designed to reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels as well as global 
supply/demand trends for energy could make energy 
more expensive in the future.  To mitigate this,  the Group 
works continually on improving energy efﬁ ciency and to 
secure stable energy supplies through hedging contracts 
and by investing in a capability to use multiple sources 
of fuel.
IT risk
The Group is highly dependent on IT systems for 
managing its businesses.  There is the ever present 
threat of a security breach and disruption to voice and 
data infrastructure,  which is a risk common to many 
organisations.  The Group has an ongoing review 
programme in place to ensure that systems are updated 
and maintained adequately and in a timely manner.  
Overall Elementis is conﬁ dent that it has a high level of 
resilience in its IT systems and infrastructure,  and that 
IT management has adopted good industry practices 
for protecting against malicious attacks and operational 
downtime from other non-malicious problems including 
ﬁ re,  natural perils and staff unavailability. 
Legal,  governance,  compliance and insurance risk
Other risks faced by the Company include governance 
and compliance risk.  Lack of Board oversight and 
processes or ineffective management teams can lead 
to signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial loss or loss of strategic direction.  
These risks are mitigated by regular Board meetings with 
a comprehensive agenda,  regular evaluations of Board 
and management team members and regular Board 
reviews of strategy,  business plans and compliance 
programmes.  Like many companies,  the Company’s 
UK pension fund has seen the size of its deﬁ cit increase 
over the past few years,  largely as a result of changes in 
assumptions that are used in the valuation of pension 
liabilities,  such as the rate of mortality,  as well as 
depressed equity prices and bond yields.  Changes to 
these assumptions or to pensions legislation could have 
a material impact on the size of the pension fund deﬁ cit 
and the Company’s ongoing funding liability.
Breach of anti-trust,  HSE or other laws or regulations 
from historical or ongoing operations can lead to a major 
ﬁ nancial loss,  public censure or both,  thereby damaging 
the creditworthiness and or reputation of the Company;  
either of which can damage the Company’s long and 
short term market value.  These risks are mitigated by 
our risk management programmes,  including:  web-
based compliance training for employees;  regular HSE 
compliance audits,  supported by external advisers and 
the internal audit service;  and insurance.  
In terms of the key legal risks,  there is a risk of material toxic 
tort,  environmental and other claims from historical and 
ongoing operations.  Some of these risks,  in the case of 
previously owned operations,  may be mitigated or reduced 
as a result of continuing warranties or indemnity provisions 
negotiated when such operations were disposed of.  
Despite having insurance in place there is always the 
possibility of an under-insured or uninsured claim and,  in 
the extreme,  an insured limit might be exceeded.  However,  
Elementis has a robust programme in place to actively 
manage and defend against legal action or claims relating 
to its operations,  products and manufacturing facilities.  
The programme is led by the Group General Counsel,  who 
is supported by an in-house team and professional advisers.  
Litigation reports are reviewed regularly by the Board. 
In connection with the EU investigation into competition 
issues relating to heat stabilisers,  the outcome of that 
investigation and the Company’s response to it is 
described in the Chairman’s statement. 
Treasury policies and objectives
Treasury activities are governed by policies and 
procedures approved and monitored by the Board.  
The Group operates a central treasury function which 
manages and monitors external and internal funding 
requirements and the following treasury risks:
•
 Credit risk,
•
 Liquidity risk,
•
 Market risk.
These risks and the Group’s policies to manage them are 
set out in Note 22 to the Financial Statements.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Elementis joined the 
FTSE4Good Index in 
September 2009
Business conduct and ethics
The Board has adopted and disseminated throughout 
the Group an Elementis Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics (the “Code”) and an Anti-corruption Policy (the 
“Anti-corruption Policy”).  The aim is to help employees 
understand the Group’s standards of ethical business 
practices and to stimulate awareness of ethical and legal 
issues that may be encountered in carrying out their 
responsibilities.  In addition,  Group businesses are 
expected to require independent contractors,  consultants,  
agents and sales representatives who represent the 
Group to agree to the same high standards as the 
Group’s employees while working on Group business. 
The Code requires all employees to comply with 
applicable laws,  governmental rules and regulations,  
including making full,  accurate and timely disclosures in 
the periodic reports required to be ﬁ led by the Group with 
regulators and in other public communications made by 
the Group.  The Anti-corruption Policy prohibits the giving 
of anything of value to any person in government or state-
owned companies,  a political party or persons holding 
public ofﬁ ce,  including candidates,  or performing public 
duties in order to obtain or retain business or secure an 
improper advantage with respect to any aspect of the 
Group’s business. 
Employees are required to adhere strictly to the Code and 
to report any violations of the Code or the Anti-corruption 
Policy promptly to a responsible supervisor,  the Group 
General Counsel or other appropriate internal authority.  
In order to help employees comply with the Code and 
Anti-corruption Policy,  clear guidance is given on matters 
such as competition law,  bribery,  political donations,  
the giving and receiving of gifts,  conﬂ icts of interests 
and Group whistleblowing procedures.  In addition,  the 
Code is supported by a non-retaliation policy to protect 
employees who communicate bona ﬁ de concerns 
relating to lawful or ethical business conduct,  and audit 
or accounting procedures or other related matters.
As well as policies and guidance,  the Group recognises 
the importance of providing training.  Web-based,  
modular training courses,  designed in conjunction with the 
Integrity Interactive Corporation,  are offered to employees 
across the Group.  Some of these courses are mandatory 
for all employees,  such as training on the Code,  and others 
are only mandatory depending on the job role or position.  
These courses include topics such as Mutual respect in 
the workplace,  Human rights,  Environmental stewardship,  
Anti-trust,  Privacy and data protection and Financial 
integrity.  On-site training,  for example on health and safety,  
is also provided.  
The Group General Counsel is responsible for ensuring 
adherence to the Code,  Anti-corruption Policy and all 
matters related to business conduct and ethics,  and 
legal and regulatory compliance.
HSE leadership
The Group Chief Executive takes leadership of HSE matters 
at Board level with direct lines of reporting from the 
operational facilities.  This includes formal monthly 
reports on HSE performance and rapid notiﬁ cation 
of HSE incidents wherever they may occur throughout 
the world.  A manufacturing council,  comprising senior 
manufacturing and HSE managers,  reviews performance 
monthly,  sets standards and initiates improvements.
Elementis places great emphasis on protecting people and the 
environment from harm.  The Board considers that compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations,  and the effective management of health,  
safety and environmental (“HSE”) issues,  are critical to the long term 
success of the Group.  In addition to legal and regulatory compliance,  and 
a moral duty to maintain high standards in HSE and ethical performance,  
attention to these aspects of our business,  including stewardship of 
our products through their life-cycle,  also makes good business sense 
to minimise the costs associated with poor performance and the risk of 
damage to reputation and brand.  It is the policy of Elementis to promote 
honest,  ethical and lawful conduct by all employees,  ofﬁ cers and directors 
of the Group in all aspects of the business. 16 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
The chart below illustrates our performance over the last 
ﬁ ve years.  This clearly demonstrates that the Elementis 
culture has the right discipline and focus on safety as we 
continue to work towards an injury free workplace.
Using the UK Health & Safety Executive’s deﬁ nition of 
LTAs (greater than three days lost,  not including day of 
incident),  two of the recordable incidents were classed as 
LTAs in 2009 (2008:  three
2
),  giving a rate of 0.08 LTAs per 
100,000 hours worked (2008:  0.12).
We have contractors working at our sites and place great 
emphasis on their safety.  Through effective control of 
contractors,  ensuring they comply with Elementis safe 
systems of work and their own efforts,  performance 
is comparable to that for Elementis employees.  The 
contractor recordable incident rate in 2009 was 0.63 per 
200,000 hours worked (2008:  1.01).
Safety goal
Our goal remains zero recordable incidents,  with 
continual improvement in the health and safety of our 
employees leading to year on year improvement in 
safety performance.  
Commitment to the environment
As stated in our HSE policy we are committed 
to minimising the impact of our facilities on the 
environment.  We believe that we have achieved a 
high level of environmental performance,  with a 
corresponding low level of environmental incidents. 
As well as complying with environmental regulatory 
reporting requirements,  Elementis records and 
categorises incidents into tiers based on the severity 
of the incident on the environment or actions taken by 
regulatory authorities.  Tier 3 incidents are those that have 
an impact on the environment and require reporting to 
an external authority,  who are likely to take action.  Tier 
2 incidents have a minor impact and require notiﬁ cation 
but are likely to result in minimal or no action by the 
authorities.  Tier 1 incidents require no external reporting 
and are recorded internally and investigated so that 
continual improvements can be made to reduce the 
likelihood of future Tier 2 and Tier 3 incidents.

Elementis policy on HSE
Elementis conducts business globally with the highest 
concern for the health and safety of our employees,  
contractors,  customers,  neighbours and the general 
public and for the environment in which we operate.
Elementis seeks to identify and eliminate occupational 
health hazards,  is committed to providing a safe 
workplace for all employees and strives for zero 
injuries as part of our continual improvement process.
Elementis operates facilities to minimise impact on the 
environment.  We view compliance with all applicable 
legal requirements and other codes of practice as our 
minimum standard.  Our sustainable development 
strategy requires that we work proactively to reduce 
emissions,  minimise waste from our processes,  conserve 
valuable natural resources and ensure responsible 
product stewardship up and down the supply chain.
Elementis recognises the importance of communication 
with all interested parties and is committed to open 
dialogue with our neighbours,  contractors,  customers 
and the general public about our operations.
The Board and senior management of Elementis are 
committed to this policy and continually monitor 
performance to ensure its implementation.
Working towards an injury free work environment
Our principal measure of performance is recordable 
incidents
1
.  Recordable incidents are work related injuries 
and illnesses that require medical treatment beyond ﬁ rst 
aid.  An important sub-set of recordable injuries is lost time 
accidents (“LTAs”),  which generally reﬂ ect on the severity 
of such injuries and illnesses.  Given the low frequency of 
LTAs we use recordable incidents as our standard measure.
In 2009,  as a result of effective design of working practices,  
good leadership from management and safe behaviours,  
we were able to limit recordable incidents to just nine 
globally.  Of these one was in the UK,  four were in the US,  
two were in the Netherlands and two were in China.  While 
all recordable injuries are regrettable,  it is encouraging to 
note that the level of severity was at the low end of the 
spectrum,  with no injuries with longer term effects on the 
employees involved. 
The recordable incident rate for 2009 was 0.69 per 
200,000 hours worked (2008: 0.73).  Given the low number 
of incidents,  the slight improvement in rate,  while 
welcome,  shows consistency rather than statistical 
signiﬁ cance.  Based on American Chemistry Council 
statistics,  our recordable incident rate continues to rank 
amongst companies that are generally viewed as “best 
in industry” .

Lost time accident rate 
per 100,00 hours
In 2009 Elementis had excellent success in preventing 
environmental incidents:  there were no Tier 2 or Tier 3 
incidents (2008:  zero Tier 2,  one Tier 3).  As noted above 
we do not report Tier 1 incidents externally as these are 
treated as operational learning opportunities rather than 
non-compliances.
Environmental performance
Emissions to air,  discharges to water and waste disposal 
are regulated by external authorities and controlled 
carefully within Elementis.  The table below shows our 
performance in this area as well as our water and energy 
usage over the past three years. 
It should be noted that the data presented in the table 
below is,  in part,  a function of production output.  In 
2009 the closure of the Eaglescliffe facility,  in addition 
to generally reduced production levels elsewhere in 
the Group,  had a major one-time impact on emissions,  
waste,  and water and energy consumption.  The columns 
showing per tonne of production are affected by changes 
in the product mix and plant efﬁ ciencies.  In 2009 there 
were signiﬁ cant changes in these variables due to the 
closure of Eaglescliffe and temporary plant shutdowns in 
response to the economic downturn.  Furthermore,  as is 
standard practice in the chemical industry,  some emission 
values may be calculated from energy use or based on 
samples rather than continuous monitoring.  However,  
environmental emissions,  discharges and solid waste data 
are subject to periodic internal audits to ensure accuracy 
and consistency of reporting. 
 
Emissions to air
Elementis is aware of the global need to reduce 
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions,  such as carbon 
dioxide (“CO
2
”),  because of its link to global warming,  
and is committed to reducing,  wherever it can,  its 
emissions of GHGs.  The Group complies with relevant 
national CO
2
 reduction schemes and is preparing for new 
schemes,  such as the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
cap and trade scheme in the UK,  and the Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction Rule,  which will apply to some of our facilities 
in the US.  The closure of the chromium chemicals site at 
Eaglescliffe,  UK,  will reduce signiﬁ cantly the Group’s CO
2
 
emissions going forward. 
The Group’s operations also result in some emissions of 
the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen,  which can cause acid 
rain.  Volatile organic compounds,  where emitted,  can 
damage soil and ground water or combine with nitrogen 
oxide to cause smog.  However,  all these emissions are 
controlled to comply with regulatory permits and,  as the 
volumes are not considered to be signiﬁ cant,  they are not 
reported here. 
Discharges to water
Maintaining the water quality of the areas in which we 
operate is a regulatory issue and vital to protect the 
ecosystems and communities in which we operate.  The 
Group’s production activity generates process efﬂ uent 
with low concentrations of organic material that is 
discharged to water.  This is measured as chemical and 
biological oxygen demand.  These are regulated by 
external authorities and managed carefully by Elementis.  
However,  the volumes of these discharges are not 
considered to be signiﬁ cant and are not reported here. 
In 2009,  the plant in Charleston,  West Virginia,  completed 
major capital improvements to the wastewater treatment 
plant,  allowing the process efﬂ uent to discontinue ﬂ ow to 
the Charleston publicly owned treatment works (“POTW”) 
and be discharged directly to the Kanawha River.  This 
work was completed as part of a consent order with 
the City of Charleston to resolve treatment issues that 
the POTW had experienced with its treatment plant (as 
reported last year).
Any emissions to air or discharges to water above 
regulatory permitted levels will continue to be reported 
each year under environmental incidents. 
Water consumption
With the exception of the Hectorite mine in California,  
the Company does not operate in areas of extreme water 
shortage.  Nevertheless,  water is a valuable resource and 
the Company recognises the global need to conserve 
water.  Water consumption is minimised where possible 
by treatment and recycling.

continued
Energy consumption
Conserving energy is important for sustainable 
development.  The use of fossil fuels in energy production 
results in GHGs,  which may contribute to global warming.  
There is also the added incentive that energy is an 
expensive resource and its efﬁ cient use has a signiﬁ cant 
effect on the cost of production.  As the Group uses a 
range of fuel sources purchased conventionally in a 
variety of units,  we report usage in gigajoules (“GJ”) to 
provide consistent energy units.  Energy consumption 
in the Chromium business reduced by 40 per cent 
compared to 2008,  partly due to the closure during the 
year of the Eaglescliffe plant in the UK and partly due to 
reduced working in the US in response to the economic 
downturn.  In the Specialty Products and Surfactants 
businesses,  energy consumption reduced by 30 per cent,  
partly due to temporary site closures in periods of low 
demand.  The production of chromium chemicals 
accounts for just over 70 per cent of the energy 
consumption in the Group (2008:  just under 80 per cent).  
This ﬁ gure is expected to reduce further as a result of 
the closure of the Eaglescliffe facility.
Solid waste
The Company is committed to minimising the quantity 
of all types of waste.  The quantity of hazardous waste 
resulting from operations in Elementis has reduced 
signiﬁ cantly over the last decade.  The increase in 2009 
is due to some speciﬁ c site remediation projects:  the 
dismantling of a rotary hearth at the Corpus Christi facility 
and removal of contaminated soil at the Charleston 
facility that occurred under a previous owner of the site.  
The low level that remains from Elementis operations 
is highly controlled and subject to licensed disposal.  
Non-hazardous waste is minimised and recycled as far 
as possible.  Non-hazardous waste is predominantly the 
inert residue from the chromate kiln operations,  which is 
deposited in our own licensed landﬁ ll sites adjacent to the 
manufacturing facilities.  Alternative or recycled uses have 
been explored but to date there is no technically viable 
commercial alternative to landﬁ ll.  However,  the cessation 
of chromate kiln operations at the Eaglescliffe facility will 
reduce signiﬁ cantly the volume of non-hazardous waste 
going to landﬁ ll.
The Group encourages the re-using,  reduction and 
recycling of general ofﬁ ce waste and recycling schemes 
are in place at various ofﬁ ce locations.  The amounts of 
general ofﬁ ce waste is not reported separately from 
non-hazardous waste as the volumes are not considered 
to be signiﬁ cant.
Environmental target
Our target is to comply with all environmental regulations 
and permits,  with zero environmental incidents classed 
as Elementis Tiers 2 and 3.  Beyond that we will strive for 
continual improvement in standards to reduce our impact 
on the environment.
HSE hazards and risks
Elementis is committed to identifying hazards and 
reducing risk to people and the environment. 
New equipment and plant modiﬁ cations are subject 
to HSE review including,  where appropriate,  hazard 
and operability studies.  A formal modiﬁ cation control 
system is employed to ensure that changes to plant 
and equipment are approved with due consideration of 
risk as well as ﬁ nancial cost.  To provide assurance that 
equipment is installed and maintained in a safe condition,  
process safety auditing has been added to the corporate 
HSE audit programme. 
The Group has a set of policies to cover life critical 
activities such as working at heights and in conﬁ ned 
spaces.  Many sites are certiﬁ ed to external standards such 
as ISO 14001,  OHSAS 18001 and OSHA VPP .  Maintenance 
is conducted under permits to work,  which require risk 
assessments that are either documented or based on the 
knowledge and experience of the operations supervisor.
A well established,  mandatory incident reporting system 
records HSE incidents (including near misses) worldwide 
throughout Elementis.  A structured investigation process 
is then adopted to establish root causes and implement 
effective corrective actions.  Learning from these incidents 
is then shared across the Group through conference calls 
and safety alert bulletins.  The aim is to help prevent similar 
incidents occurring elsewhere and,  in the case of repeat 
occurrences,  to identify trends for further action. 
Major hazards and risks (including those from natural 
perils) are identiﬁ ed and included in the section on 
Principal risks and uncertainties.
Continual improvement in HSE 
Each site has an annual plan including HSE objectives 
that is intended to have a positive impact on safety.  
These plans are drawn up in conjunction with the 
manufacturing council who then monitors performance 
and provides guidance to achieve the desired results. 
Social responsibility
The Group Chief Executive has Board level responsibility 
for social and community matters,  although day to day 
responsibility is delegated to the business managing 
directors. 
Elementis recognises the international standards for 
human rights and strives to ensure equality of opportunity 
and fair rewards for expertise and knowledge at all its 
locations globally.  Details of our employment policies 
and information about employee communication 
are summarised in the Directors’  report on page 22.  
The Company also recognises that its employees and 
contractors,  customers and suppliers (where relevant),  
have a right to expect the Group to respect their wider 
fundamental human rights and is supportive of this view.  
The Group’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets 
standards and provides guidance to ensure that,  wherever 
relevant or practicable,  consideration is taken in business 
decisions of the wider fundamental human rights of all 
employees,  contractors,  customers and suppliers.   Annual report and accounts 2009 Elementis plc   19

The Company undertakes regular customer satisfaction 
surveys and also has a customer service policy with key 
account management operated to ensure that the views 
of our customers can be taken on board with regard to 
HSE matters.  The Group is open to collaborating with 
customers to develop new products and is currently 
undertaking collaborative research to develop “greener” 
alternatives for use in the products we manufacture.  
This kind of research is still at a very early stage but it 
demonstrates our commitment to reduce the impact of 
our operations on the environment. 
Our global procurement team is primarily responsible 
for engaging with and encouraging suppliers to 
promote social responsibility within their supply 
chains.  A groupwide employee training programme 
is in place which includes courses on Mutual Respect,  
Environmental Awareness in Manufacturing and 
Environmental Stewardship. 
Elementis also takes care to ensure that its activities do not 
cause long term damage to the biodiversity in the areas 
where it has operations.  In this regard,  the Group has 
policies and systems in place to ensure full compliance 
with environmental requirements.
In September 2009 Elementis was recognised as having 
met the corporate responsibility criteria for inclusion 
in the FTSE4Good index – a leading global responsible 
investment index. 
Product stewardship
Elementis recognises its responsibility to ensure that its 
products are safe for intended use,  transport and the 
environment throughout the product life cycle.  Safe use 
is guided by long experience of many of our products 
in conjunction with third party studies and regulatory 
requirements.  Information is provided via technical 
bulletins,  safety data sheets and labelling – supported 
by discussion with our customers and suppliers,  and 
participation in studies by industry associations. 
We continuously adopt a consistent and coordinated 
approach to regulatory matters concerning our products 
at global,  national and regional levels which complement 
industry voluntary efforts.  Where new regulations are 
required,  we believe they should be based on established 
scientiﬁ c risk assessment and risk management 
principles.  They should be predictable,  ﬂ exible and 
capable of responsibly addressing society’s economic,  
environmental and safety requirements.
The Group is fully engaged in the new European 
REACh programme with more than 700 substances 
pre-registered to cover products manufactured in 
Europe,  imported products and required raw materials.  
To support our global customers and markets,  we 
implemented a structure to enable us to provide “Only 
Representative” services under REACh to cover imports 
into Europe by Group entities and key customers,  and 
we created a framework to cover “re-imports” into Europe.  
The Product Stewardship team is involved in many 
consortia coordinating the REACh registration of our most 
important product categories.  We will continue providing 
active support to consortia and organisations such as 
CEFIC (European Chemical Industry Council) and SIEF 
(Substance Information Exchange Forum) as appropriate.  
Elementis expects to meet all its REACh registration 
requirements by the deadline set for the current phase in 
REACh,  which is November 2010.
In addition to complying with the REACh regulatory 
requirements for its products,  Elementis is implementing 
new systems,  assessments and documents to comply 
with the United Nations Globally Harmonised System 
(“UN GHS”) for classiﬁ cation and labelling rules in many 
countries around the world.  Speciﬁ cally in the European 
Union,  Elementis is putting in place the structure and IT 
tools to accommodate compliance with the European 
Regulation on the Classiﬁ cation,  Labelling and Packaging 
of Substances and Mixtures (CLP Regulation),  which is 
the EU implementation of the UN GHS criteria required by 
December 2010.
Community involvement
Elementis works with local communities to provide 
information on its activities and be a responsible 
neighbour.  The Company provides focussed support for 
children and disadvantaged groups,  and encourages 
employees to be active in their communities through 
volunteer work or fundraising. 
Including donations made in the UK,  which are disclosed 
on page 24,  the Group made charitable donations worth 
more than £23,693 in 2009 (2008:  £15,400) to 35 (2008:  
34) different organisations supporting various causes in 
and around the locality of our ofﬁ ces and plants in the US 
and UK.  Organisations and groups supported last year 
include local youth and sports clubs,  schools,  arts groups,  
hospice and other welfare related groups,  and medical 
research and health related charities.  In addition to the 
above amount,  our business donated a further £9,752 to 
charities in Taiwan including to the Red Cross relief effort 
for victims of the Typhoon Morakot ﬂ oods. 
The Company also operated a payroll giving programme 
in the UK and,  for over ten years,  the Eaglescliffe operations 
in Stockton-on-Tees have leased at peppercorn rent 
116 acres of land to a local ecology and conservation study 
group which is used by schools to conduct environmental 
studies and as a calming,  learning environment for children 
with emotional and behavioural difﬁ culties.  Some of our 
employees act voluntarily as ofﬁ cers of the group.  The 
conservation group has in recent years set up partnerships 
with two local schools who use the site as Forest School 
classrooms where children can learn about ecology and the 
natural environment.  20 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009

Employment policies
The Group Chief Executive is the Board member responsible for 
employee matters and he is assisted by a Vice President of Global 
Human Resources.  The Group employs HR specialists throughout its 
worldwide locations to advise on all HR matters including training 
and development,  and various HR performance indicators are 
maintained in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of 
employment policies.
Elementis values the diverse backgrounds of all its people and 
works to create an open atmosphere of trust,  honesty and respect.  
Harassment or discrimination of any kind - including that involving 
race,  colour,  religion,  gender,  age,  national origin,  citizenship,  
mental or physical disabilities,  sexual orientation,  veteran status, or 
any other similarly protected status – is unacceptable.  This principle 
applies to all aspects of employment,  including recruitment,  hiring,  
placement,  transfer,  promotion,  layoff,  recall,  termination and other 
terms and conditions of employment.  The Group is committed 
to providing equal employment opportunities for all Elementis 
people and all applicants for employment,  based on individual 
qualiﬁ cations and without regard to the factors mentioned above.  
It is Group policy to comply with all applicable laws governing 
employment practices and not to discriminate on the basis of 
any unlawful criteria,  and its practices include the prohibition 
on the use of child or forced labour.  Employment policies are 
fair and equitable and consistent with the skills and abilities of 
the employee and the needs of the business.  Elementis respects 
the rights of its employees to join a trade union or participate in 
collective bargaining arrangements and,  out of its global workforce,  
approximately one third of all employees are represented by a trade 
union or collective agreements. 
In terms of how our employment policies are applied to employees 
who have or acquire a disability,  the Group’s policy is,  wherever 
practicable,  to provide continuing employment under normal 
terms and conditions and to provide training,  career development 
and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate. 
The Board expects the Group to conduct its operations based on 
sound ethical practices which are open and free from discrimination 
and harassment.  Further information about the Group’s policy 
on business conduct and ethics is set out in the Corporate social 
responsibility report. 
Employee communications and involvement
It is Group policy to communicate with all employees on major 
matters to encourage them to take a wider interest in the 
affairs of their employing company and the Group and to make 
them aware of the ﬁ nancial and economic factors affecting the 
Company’s performance.  This is done in a variety of ways including 
informal consultations,  bulletins and brieﬁ ng sessions.  There are 
well established procedures,  including regular meetings with 
recognised unions,  to ensure that the views of employees are taken 
into account in making decisions likely to affect their interests.  
Managers throughout the Group have a responsibility to keep 
their staff informed of developments and matters of interest.  The 
Company operates savings-related share option schemes allowing 
UK and US employees an opportunity to become shareholders,  
details of which are set out in Note 25 to the Financial Statements 
on pages 74 and 75.
Report and ﬁ nancial statements
The directors submit their report and the audited ﬁ nancial

Principal activities,  business review and future development

that might affect,  the development,  performance and position of 
the Group.  A review of the Group’s risk management framework as 
well as principal risks and uncertainties is set out on pages 13 and 14,

Statements on pages 61 to 68.  The Corporate social responsibility 
report on pages 15 to 19 summarises the Group’s policy on business 
conduct and ethics,  and sets out its approach to health and safety,  
the environment,  social responsibility and community matters.
The Group undertakes,  on a continuing basis,  research and 
development activities for new products and to improve 
existing products.

Corporate governance
Signiﬁ cant agreements – change of control
Other than as set out in this paragraph,  there are no signiﬁ cant 
agreements to which the Company is a party which take effect,  alter 
or terminate in the event of change of control of the Company.  The 
Company is a guarantor under the Group’s £150 million revolving 
credit facility which runs until July 2011.  Under the terms of that 
facility,  in the event of a change of control,  any lender among the 
facility syndicate,  of which there are eight with commitments 
ranging from £10 million to £27 million,  may withdraw from the 
facility and that lender’s participation in any loans drawn down are 
required to be repaid. 
Under David Dutro’s service contract with the Company,  
compensation is payable to him equivalent to one year’s basic salary 
if he terminates his contract upon a change of control provided 
that the Company has not ﬁ rst obtained a written agreement to 
be bound by his service contract from any successor in a change 
of control.  There is no speciﬁ c change of control provision in Brian 
Taylorson’s service contract with the Company but the provisions 
on early termination set out on pages 30 and 31 of the Directors’  
remuneration report apply and compensation equivalent to one 
year’s basic salary and beneﬁ ts would be payable if less than 12 
months’  notice of termination by the Company is given. 
The rules of the Company’s various share incentive schemes set 
out the consequences of a change of control of the Company on 
the rights of the participants under those schemes.  Under the rules 
of the respective schemes,  participants will generally be able to 
exercise their options on a change of control,  provided that the 
relevant performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed and,  where 
relevant,  options are not exchanged for new options granted by an 
acquiring company. 
Signiﬁ cant relationships
The Group has in place a number of supply contracts for key raw 
materials that are essential to the business.  In Specialty Products,  
supply contracts are for clays,  quaternary amines and other 
chemical intermediates.  The suppliers of these contracts are 
important and,  although we have sought to develop a strategic 
long term relationship with them,  we have taken steps to maintain a 
sufﬁ ciently broad base of suppliers to mitigate any supply chain risks.  
Specialty Products also owns and operates a hectorite clay mine in 
California which reduces our reliance on third party suppliers for raw 
materials.  The Surfactants business sources a number of products 
from a reasonably wide base of third party suppliers for use in the 
manufacturing of its products.  These include supplies for ethylene 
oxide,  propylene oxide,  nonylphenol ethoxylate and fatty alcohols.  
The Chromium division’s key raw materials are chrome ore,  soda ash 
and sulphuric acid.  Chrome ore is sourced from a number of South 
African mining companies,  while soda ash is sourced from suppliers 
in the UK and US.  Sulphuric acid is sourced from suppliers in the US.  
The business is continually looking for new sources of supplies to 
broaden its base of suppliers.  All businesses purchase energy in the 
form of natural gas,  fuel oil or electricity.  It is the Group’s practice 
to enter into agreements with suppliers to lock in the price of at 
least 50 per cent of its energy costs for each year.  Information about 
individual suppliers is not disclosed as the Board considers that 
disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the Group. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities,  together with the factors likely to 
affect its future performance and development are set out in the 
Business review on pages 4 to 19.  The ﬁ nancial position of the 
Group and description of the principal risks and uncertainties are 
set out above in the Finance report on pages 13 and 14.  Note 22 
details the Group’s exposure to credit,  liquidity and market risk and 
its mechanisms for dealing with these risks.
The Group’s primary source of funding is a syndicated £150 million 
revolving credit facility which is not due for renewal before July 2011,  
although the intention is to renew the facility during 2010.  At the 
year end,  the Group’s net debt was £66.0 million.  Compliance with 
covenants is reported half yearly to the syndicate of banks and 
involves tests for net debt:  EBITDA ratio,  interest cover and net 
worth.  No breaches in covenants were reported during the year.  
Additionally,  the Group uses various short and medium term 
forecasts to monitor anticipated future compliance and has 
modiﬁ ed the modelling to include worst case scenario planning 
in order to stress test the assumptions and identify the headroom 
on the covenant tests. 
After evaluating the covenant compliance modelling and the 
ongoing trading of the businesses,  the directors are satisﬁ ed that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
to operate for the foreseeable future as going concerns.  For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these ﬁ nancial statements. 
Share capital
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares,  as set out 
in Note 7 to the Financial Statements of the Company on page 82.  
All of the Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and 
rank equally in all respects.  The rights attached to them,  in addition 
to those conferred on their holders by law,  are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (“the Articles”).  Other than those 
speciﬁ c provisions set out in the articles,  there are no restrictions 
on the transfer of ordinary shares or on the exercise of voting rights 
attached to them.  From time to time the Elementis Employee 
Share Ownership Trust (“Trust”) holds shares in the Company for the 
purposes of various share incentive plans and the rights attaching 
to them are exercised by independent trustees,  who may take into 
account any recommendation by the Company.  As at 31 December 
2009 the Trust held 4,741,243 ordinary shares of ﬁ ve pence each in 
the Company.  A dividend waiver is in place in respect of all shares 
held by the Trust. 
Directors,  Articles and purchase of shares
Rules about the appointment and replacement of directors are set 
out in the Articles.  Changes to the Articles must be approved by 
shareholders passing a special resolution.  The directors’  powers are 
conferred on them by UK legislation and by the Articles.  The Board 
has the power conferred on it by shareholders to purchase its own 
shares and is seeking renewal of that power at the forthcoming 
AGM within the limits set out in the Notice of Meeting. 24 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
DIRECTORS’  REPORT
continued
As its businesses are reasonably diverse in terms of the customers 
and sectors they serve,  the Group is not dependent on any particular 
customer and therefore no further information is given.  The Group 
supplies some of its products through approved distributors,  who 
are able to provide or access technical support services,  and has 
a joint venture in China at an organoclay plant and,  whilst these 
relationships are an important part of our business,  the Board does 
not consider any individual relationship to be essential to the Group.  
The Group values all of its employees and,  although some perform 
roles that are more important to the business than others,  the Board 
does not consider that the Group’s success is materially dependent 
on any single individual.  Additionally,  the Board has reviewed its 
management succession plans and is satisﬁ ed that the Company’s 
incentive arrangements are appropriate to attract,  retain and motivate 
key people within the organisation.
Substantial shareholders

Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company 
will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 22 April 2010.
Each director in ofﬁ ce at the date of this Directors’  report conﬁ rms 
that (a) so far as he is aware,  there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditors are unaware and (b) he has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Political and charitable donations 
During the year the Group donated £7,200 for charitable purposes 
in the UK (2008:  £2,240).  The Company made no political donations 
during the year (2008:  £nil).
Policy on payment of suppliers
The Company’ s and the Group’ s policies concerning the payment to 
suppliers is to agree terms of payment at the start of business with each 
supplier and to adhere to these,  subject to satisfactory performance 
by the suppliers.  The Company and the Group do not follow any code 
or statement on payment practice.  Trade creditors for the Group at 
31 December 2009 represented 51 days (2008:  78 days) of annual 
purchases,  adjusted for currency and acquisitions and disposals.  
The Company has no trade creditors.
Directors’  and ofﬁ cers’  liability insurance
The Company maintains liability insurance for the directors and 
ofﬁ cers of the Company and its subsidiaries and,  towards the end 
of 2008,  granted indemnities in favour of the directors against 
any liability or loss that may arise out of or in connection with the 
execution of their powers,  duties and responsibilities as directors of 
the Company,  or of any subsidiary,  to the extent permitted under the 
Companies Act 2006.  Copies of these indemnities,  which continue 
to remain in place,  are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁ ce during normal business hours and will be available 
for inspection at the AGM.
Directors’  conﬂ ict of interest
During the year the conﬂ ict authorisation that was put in place 
in October 2008 for Brian Taylorson was reviewed and renewed 
by the Board to enable him to continue to act as a Trustee of the 
Group’s UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme (“UK pension scheme”),  
notwithstanding that this role could give rise to a situation in which 
there is a conﬂ ict of interest.  The Board considers that it is appropriate 
for the Trustees of the UK pension scheme to beneﬁ t from the 
ﬁ nancial expertise of the Finance Director and that his contribution

supporting the UK pension scheme.  The Board’s conﬂ ict authorisation 
is subject to annual review and,  under the terms of the conﬂ ict 
resolution,  reciprocal provisions have been put in place with a view 
to safeguarding information that is conﬁ dential to the Group as well 
as to the Trustees.  Were a conﬂ ict of interest to arise,  Brian Taylorson is

DIRECTORS’  RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year.  Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁ nancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
proﬁ t or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements,  the directors are required to:
•
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•
  for the Group ﬁ nancial statements,  state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
•
  for the parent company ﬁ nancial statements,  state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,  subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements;  and
•
  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁ nancial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006.  They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations,  the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’  Report,  Directors’  Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that 
law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company’s 
website.  Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The directors,  all of whom are shown on page 20,  conﬁ rm that to the 
best of their knowledge:
•
  the ﬁ nancial statements,  prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards,  give a true and fair view 
of the assets,  liabilities,  ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;  and 
•
  the Directors’  report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole,  
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
The Directors’ responsibility statement has been approved by the 
Board and signed on its behalf by:

Finance Director
23 February 2010 26 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
Last year,  owing to the economic downturn and the freeze on 
non-essential expenditures,  the Board cancelled its overseas Board 
meeting which instead was held in London.  The Board is planning 
to resume holding one of its meetings at an overseas location in 
2010,  which will involve touring local manufacturing facilities,  as it 
considers that non-executive directors beneﬁ t from interacting with 
operational management and gaining a broader understanding of the 
risks and opportunities faced by the businesses,  which,  in addition to 
operational,  commercial and regulatory risks,  include environmental,  
social and governance risks. 
Board performance evaluation
The Board is supportive of the principles and provisions of the 
Combined Code on Board performance evaluation and towards the 
end of last year carried out an evaluation of its performance,  including 
that of its committees and individual directors,  using comprehensive 
assessment questionnaires that were designed internally.  The results 
of the questionnaires were reviewed by the Board,  which believes 
that the performance of each director continues to be effective and 
demonstrates commitment to the role.  The evaluation did not raise 
any particular issue as a matter of concern to the directors,  but a 
number of actions were taken following the review.  These included 
formalising succession plans at business unit level,  maintaining 
a register of training undertaken by non-executive directors and 
changes to the way investor and research information is disseminated 
to the Board. 
The evaluation focussed on the following areas:
•
  Number,  length,  format and conduct of meetings (including 
quality of discussion).
•
  Quality,  conciseness,  relevance and structure of Board papers 
(including accuracy of minutes).
•
  Access to and support from the Chairman and the Secretary.
•
  Skills and experience of,  and training provision to,  all directors.
•
  Board interaction and information ﬂ ows with senior management 
and shareholders.
•
  Strategy and strategic priorities,  succession planning,  governance 
and Board accountability and audit,  and internal control and 
risk management.
•
  Delegation of responsibilities to management and committees.
•
  Monitoring management performance against strategic priorities.
•
  Consideration of employees,  environment,  community,  business 
relationships and reputation.
•
  Leadership of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
•
  Contribution of individual directors.
•
  Performance of committees and the Secretary.
During the year the Senior Independent Director chaired a meeting 
of the directors to review the performance of the Chairman without 
him being present,  and it was concluded that the Chairman was very 
effective in his role.
Corporate governance statement
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance. 
The Company has throughout the year ended 31 December 2009 
applied fully all the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code 
of Corporate Governance (June 2008) as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (the “Combined Code”).
The Board
Composition
The Board currently consists of a non-executive Chairman,  Group 
Chief Executive,  Finance Director and four non-executive directors.  
The directors and biographical information about them are shown 
on pages 20 and 21.  The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are separate and clearly deﬁ ned.  Non-executive directors 
are appointed for an initial term of three years,  and all directors 
are required under the articles to retire and offer themselves for 
re-election at least every three years.
The directors consider that the structure and composition of the Board 
is appropriate to take the Company through to the next stage of its 
development and there are no further plans for the time being to 
increase the number of directors on the Board. 
Board independence
The Board considers all the non-executive directors to be independent 
in character and judgement.  The Board is satisﬁ ed that each director 
exercises independent judgement and believes no individual or group 
dominates decision making.  
Board operation
The Board operates within a framework of controls used to minimise 
risks and has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved to 
it for decision.  These include strategic and annual operating plans,  
the approval of ﬁ nancial statements,  acquisitions and disposals,  risk 
management and compliance programmes including insurance 
arrangements,  major non-recurring projects and major capital 
expenditures.  The Board regularly reviews management performance 
and sets values and standards to ensure that its obligations to 
shareholders and others are understood and met.  It also delegates 
speciﬁ c responsibilities with written terms of reference to the Board 
Committees detailed later in this report.
Information of an appropriate quality is issued in a timely manner 
to assist the Board in performing its duties.  New directors receive 
appropriate induction tailored to their needs.  This includes visits to 
manufacturing facilities and meetings with senior management to 
assist them in building an understanding of how the Group operates 
and the issues that it faces.  New directors are advised of their legal and 
other duties and other obligations as directors of a listed company.  All 
members of the Board have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice,  as 
appropriate,  at the expense of the Company. 
Traditionally,  at least one meeting of the Board each year is held at 
one of the Group’s overseas locations and directors are encouraged 
to undertake such activities and training as is appropriate,  or may be 
required or desirable,  in order to carry out their duties.  The average 
number of days’  training undertaken by non-executive directors in 
2009 was 1.7 and the range of topics covered included accounting,  
pensions,  remuneration,  investor relations and risk management.

Audit Committee
The chairman and members of the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) 
during 2009 and their attendance records are shown in the table above. 
The Committee has two members with “recent and relevant ﬁ nancial 
experience” as recommended by the Combined Code.  Chris Girling is a 
chartered accountant and was until April 2007 group ﬁ nance director 
of Carillion plc which is a FTSE 250 listed company.  Ian Brindle’s 
experience is based on his career with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(“PwC”) and his previous roles at the Accounting Standards Board and 
the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
A description of the remit and work of the Audit Committee
The Committee has delegated authority from the Board for:
•
  monitoring the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements and 
associated press announcements,  and reviewing signiﬁ cant 
accounting policies,  judgements and estimates contained within 
them;
•
  reviewing the effectiveness of internal control and risk 
management systems,  including control over ﬁ nancial reporting;  
•
  reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function,  
including the risk management programme;  
•
  reviewing the Group’s policies and practices concerning business 
conduct,  ethics and integrity and on whistleblowing;  and 
•
  overseeing all aspects of the relationship with the external 
auditors,  including their appointment,  the audit process,  the 
supply of non-audit services and monitoring their effectiveness 
and independence. 
Communication with shareholders
The Board has developed a comprehensive programme to ensure that 
effective communication with shareholders,  analysts and the ﬁ nancial 
press is maintained throughout the year.  Through the annual and 
interim reports,  results and other announcements,  as well as through 
presentations to institutional shareholders and the dissemination 
of information via the Group’s website at www.elementis.com,  the 
Board seeks to present the Company’s strategy and performance in an 
objective and balanced manner.
Shareholders attending the AGM are invited to ask questions during 
the meeting and also to meet the directors after the formal business 
of the meeting has concluded.  The chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees are also available to answer questions from 
any shareholder at the meeting.  Full details of proxy votes cast on each 
resolution are made available to shareholders at the meeting and are 
made available on the Company’s website after the meeting.
The Board receives regular reports from management on meetings 
held with shareholders and analysts,  feedback from investors on both 
corporate and management’s performance from results roadshows 
and copies of research notes published by analysts.  The Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director are also available for contact by 
shareholders at any time. 
Towards the end of last year,  the Chairman and the chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee attended meetings with eleven of the 
Company’s major shareholders to consult them over proposals on 
executive remuneration (see Remuneration report),  as well as to 
discuss other relevant matters,  such as governance and strategy.
Share capital
The information on the structure of the Company’s share capital,  
including any rights or restrictions of shares,  required to be made 
in this Corporate governance report under the Financial Services 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules can be found in the 
Directors’ report under the heading “Share capital” .
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit,  Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees,  all with deﬁ ned terms of reference,  modelled closely 
on those set out in the Combined Code,  which are available from the 
Company Secretary or can be found on the Company’s website at

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
continued
Following the receipt of the EU Commission’s Statement of Objections 
relating to its investigation into heat stabilisers in March 2009,  the 
Committee carried out a review of the Group’s policies and practices 
on complying with competition laws and is satisﬁ ed that the Group 
conducts its businesses in full compliance with all applicable 
competition laws. In addition,  refresher training programmes on 
competition law awareness and compliance were implemented at 
all business unit levels across the Group.  
Nomination Committee
The chairman and members of the Nomination Committee (the 
“Committee”) and their attendance records are shown on page 27.  
The Committee is responsible for:
•
  reviewing the size and composition of the Board,  together with 
the skills,  knowledge and experience of its members and making 
recommendations for change as necessary;
 
•
  carrying out an annual performance evaluation of the Board,  
its committees and members;  and
•
  succession planning for the Board and leadership team.
The Committee met twice last year to review the results of the Board 
performance evaluation (“BPE”) exercise and consider succession 
planning matters.  Both of these meetings were attended by both 
executive directors for part of the meeting,  allowing the non-
executive directors to meet without the executives present,  in 
compliance with the Combined Code.  There were no issues of 
signiﬁ cant concern raised in the BPE exercise,  and a description of 
the areas evaluated and further commentary can be found on page 
26.  There are no current plans to make any changes to the Board’s 
composition. 
During the year,  the Committee recommended to the Board the 
re-appointment of Robert Beeston as Chairman of the Board and 
Company,  to hold ofﬁ ce until September 2012 when it will be 
reviewed again. 
Remuneration Committee
Details about the Remuneration Committee are set out in the 
Directors’  remuneration report on page 30.
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of 
this system,  which includes ﬁ nancial,  operational and compliance risks 
and controls.  Such a system can only be designed to manage,  rather 
than eliminate,  the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can therefore only provide reasonable,  and not absolute,  assurance 
against material mis-statement or loss.
The Board is of the view that an ongoing process for identifying,  
evaluating and managing signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group 
was in place throughout the ﬁ nancial year under review and up 
to the date that this Annual Report was approved.  This process is 
regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s “Turnbull” and “Smith” guidance,  as amended,  
on internal control. 
The Audit Committee met four times during 2009.  Findings and 
recommendations at each of its meetings are given to the Board.  
The Committee met to review the annual and interim reports and 
ﬁ nancial statements and also to receive half yearly reports from 
the internal audit providers,  PwC,  as well as representations from 
management.  During the year it reviewed the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit activities through meetings and interviews 
with management and key ﬁ nance staff,  approved the scope of work 
of and fees for both internal and external auditors,  and concluded 
that,  owing to the complexity and international nature of the 
Group’s businesses,  the internal audit function was best served by 
continuing to be outsourced to PwC,  given their global expertise and 
resources.  The Committee also reviewed the Group’s risk management 
programme as part of the full Board’s review of risk management at 
meetings held in October and December. 
The Committee keeps under review the objectivity and independence 
of the external auditors (“KPMG”) and the nature and extent of 
non-audit services they provide.  The Company’s policy is that any 
appointment of the external auditors to undertake non-audit work is 
subject to the approval of the Audit Committee unless it falls below a 
threshold,  in which case the Finance Director has delegated authority 
from the Committee to approve such appointments.  The threshold 
is that any individual non-audit engagement fee is no greater than 15 
per cent of the annual Group audit fee and the total cost of non-audit 
engagements in the same ﬁ nancial year does not exceed 50 per cent 
of the annual Group audit fee. 
The external auditors were appointed during the year to undertake 
tax work on behalf of the Group,  which included work on transfer 
pricing,  US debt structure,  tax compliance and planning,  the latter 
in connection with the closure of the UK chromium plant.  It was 
concluded that their knowledge of the Group’s business processes 
and controls made them best placed to undertake this work cost-
effectively on the Group’s behalf.  The Committee considers that,  
notwithstanding these non-audit services they provided during the 
year,  the external auditors’  objectivity was not impaired.  In coming 
to its decision to recommend the re-appointment of the external 
auditors,  the Committee considered and discussed many factors 
including the following:  KPMG’s independence and quality control 
procedures;  the risk of KPMG withdrawing from the audit market;  
KPMG’s policy on rotating its audit partners (the senior audit partners 
in the UK and US were rotated in 2009);  and the extent of non-audit 
services provided by KPMG. 
The Committee reviewed its policy on whistleblowing during the 
year as well as reports on its operation.  In addition to having internal 
procedures for reporting any suspected cases of wrongdoing,  the 
Group has appointed an independent third party through whom 
issues may be raised and toll-free “Alert Line” numbers are provided 
in all the jurisdictions where it operates.  Management reports all 
incidents that have been raised to the Audit Committee together 
with the outcome of the investigation and steps taken to ensure 
lessons are learned to prevent their recurrence.  Treasury and 
banking policies were also reviewed and updated during the year.  Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information

The key features of the Group’s internal control system are:
Control environment
A key factor in the Group’s approach to internal control is the 
recognition of the need for risk awareness and the ownership of 
risk management by executives at all levels. 
 
The Group has policies and procedures that set out the 
responsibilities of divisional management,  including authority 
levels,  reporting disciplines and responsibility for risk management 
and internal control.  Certain activities,  including treasury,  taxation,  
insurance,  pension and legal matters are controlled centrally with 
reports reviewed by the Board as appropriate.  Site level policies and 
procedures are set by divisional management as appropriate to 
the needs of each business unit.  
Risk identiﬁ cation and review
Key identiﬁ ed risks,  both ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial,  are reviewed by 
the Board as well as by divisional management on an ongoing basis,  
which is supported by the work of the Audit Committee and the 
internal audit function,  which is provided by PwC.  A formal annual 
review of risks and controls is carried out by both the management 
team and the Board,  and includes presentations from senior managers. 
The management team,  which comprises the executive directors,  
divisional managing directors and functional business leaders,  
meets on a regular basis to review each division’s and the Group’s 
performance,  strategy and risk management.  Their work is supported 
by a central risk management unit whose terms of reference include 
supporting corporate governance requirements,  recommending 
business risk strategy and developing policies and procedures for risk 
management and internal controls.  PwC’s work covers the monitoring 
of the effectiveness of internal controls and the design of processes to 
test the effectiveness of controls. 
At operating level,  all divisions are required to have processes to 
identify risks and,  so far as possible,  take action to reduce those risks.  
In addition annual compliance statements on internal control are 
certiﬁ ed by each operating division.
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive groupwide system of ﬁ nancial reporting.  
Figures reported include proﬁ t,  cash ﬂ ows,  capital expenditure,  
balance sheet and relevant performance indicators.  Each operating 
division prepares an annual and a three year operating plan which is 
approved by the Board.  Thereafter a formal re-forecasting exercise is 
undertaken three times a year.  Actual monthly results are monitored 
against budget,  forecasts and the previous year’s results.  Any 
signiﬁ cant variances are investigated and acted upon as appropriate. 30 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
The Committee does not include targets for corporate performance 
on environmental,  social and corporate governance issues when 
considering the remuneration of executive directors.  The safety and 
environmental performance of Group businesses is accorded high 
importance and the Committee considers that management should 
aspire to achieving high standards in both safety and environmental 
performance without the need for incentives.  Corporate governance 
standards are set by the Board as a whole. 
Salaries,  fees and beneﬁ ts
Salaries for executive directors are determined by the Committee 
and are reviewed annually by it,  taking into account the following 
factors which conform to the ABI’s latest guidelines on executive 
remuneration (“Guidelines”):  individual performance over the previous 
12 months;  the responsibilities and challenges of the role and the 
complexities of the business;  external benchmark salary data (which is 
used to provide a point of reference only);  and pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group.  The basic salaries of the executive 
directors were frozen at their 2008 levels in 2009 and increased by 
three per cent from 1 January 2010. 
Beneﬁ ts relate to the provision of a car,  life assurance and medical 
cover.  Additionally,  as is standard in the US,  David Dutro receives 
beneﬁ ts covering dental costs,  accidental death and disablement,  and 
long term disability.  Information about pension beneﬁ ts and share 
incentive schemes is provided further below.
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and 
the executive directors,  having regard to fees paid to non-executive 
directors in other UK quoted companies,  the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role.  The level of fees has not been increased 
since 2005 and will be reviewed again at the end of this year,  with 
any changes becoming effective from 2011.  Thereafter,  fees will be 
reviewed every three years.  The Chairman’s fee was also reviewed 
during the year and it was maintained at its 2006 level.  No share 
options are held by non-executive directors and individuals cannot 
vote on their own remuneration. 
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that salaried executive directors should 
have service contracts with the Company that contain a termination 
notice period not exceeding 12 months,  as is the case with the service 
agreements of David Dutro and Brian Taylorson.
Termination payments in relation to departing executive directors 
are not agreed in advance and are determined in accordance with 
the directors’  contractual rights.  It is the Committee’s policy to ensure 
that a director’s duty to mitigate his loss is taken into account in the 
calculation of any termination payments.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is chaired by Kevin 
Matthews.  The Committee determines the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the executive directors,  and recommends and monitors 
the structure and level of remuneration for senior executives.
The Committee met seven times last year and its members and 
their attendance records are shown on page 27.  Members of 
the Committee have no personal ﬁ nancial interest other than 
as shareholders in the matters to be decided and no day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the business of the Group.
Advisers to the Committee
The Vice President of Global Human Resources is the internal adviser 
to the Committee and provides information and advice to facilitate 
discussion and decision making on remuneration matters.  He also 
provides the Company and its subsidiaries with services which 
include the setting of employment policies,  recruitment of senior 
managers and overall responsibility for all major issues involving 
human resources.
The Committee’s external advisers are Hewitt New Bridge Street 
(“HNBS”) who were appointed after a tender in 2008.  HNBS provided 
guidance to the Committee in its review of the short and long term 
incentive plans,  particularly in relation to current market trends in 
structure and performance metrics.  However,  the changes outlined 
later in this report are being made by the Committee after due 
consideration of all relevant factors including:  the advice of HNBS;  
the Group’s strategy to grow the business and create sustainable 
shareholder value;  risk management policy and processes;  the Group’s 
historical ﬁ nancial performance;  and the guidelines on executive 
remuneration issued by investors and investor bodies,  such as the 
Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) and the National Association of 
Pension Funds (“NAPF”).  Accordingly,  the Committee is satisﬁ ed that 
there is no over-reliance on HNBS,  who have no connection with the 
Company other than as remuneration advisers.
Annual General Meeting
A resolution to approve this report will be tabled at the AGM and the 
chairman of the Committee will be available to answer questions from 
shareholders on the decisions of the Committee. 
Remuneration policy and practice
The policy of the Committee is to set remuneration at a level which 
is competitive with that of comparable businesses,  enabling the 
Company to attract and retain people with relevant ability,  experience 
and skills.  To ensure that executive directors align their interests 
with those of shareholders,  a substantial proportion of the overall 
remuneration package is linked to corporate performance through 
participation in short term and long term incentive schemes.  Details 
of how these schemes were operated during 2009 and how they will 
operate in 2010 are described later in this report.

2009 Annual Bonus Scheme
As described in last year’s Remuneration report,  the 2009 Annual 
Bonus Scheme for David Dutro and Brian Taylorson was modiﬁ ed 
from the scheme that had been operated since 2006.  The maximum 
amount of bonus in 2009 was reduced to 150 per cent of basic salary 
and EPS conditions were set at threshold,  target and upper levels,  with 
straight line accrual in between these points.  At the threshold level,  a 
bonus equivalent to 0 per cent of basic salary could be earned,  rising 
to 100 per cent of salary for achieving target performance and 150 per 
cent for achieving the upper target.  The EPS conditions at threshold,  
target and upper level were 6.6p,  8.2p and 9.0p respectively.  These 
targets were set in January 2009 before the full extent of the economic 
downturn and its impact on trading were known.  The Committee 
decided not to modify these targets even when the severity of the 
recession became apparent and,  as a consequence,  the executive 
directors and business managing directors will receive no bonus for 
2009.  Were bonus payments to be payable,  two thirds would have 
been paid in cash and one third in the form of deferred shares,  vesting 
after two years. 
After the end of the ﬁ nancial year,  a discretionary one-off special 
bonus payment of £33,000 was made to the two business managing 
directors for achieving separate performance objectives related to 
the Chromium UK closure programme,  the successful integration of 
the Deuchem acquisition and for achieving certain business working 
capital targets.  Notwithstanding the difﬁ cult year the businesses 
experienced in 2009,  there were exceptional circumstances 
which justiﬁ ed these special payments.  In Chromium,  the closure 
programme was managed successfully and to tight time-scales 
and cost budgets,  involving the smooth transitioning of customers,  
carrying-out various environmental studies and managing the 
liquidation of working capital at the site.  In Specialty Products,  the 
integration process was a great success and involved reorganising 
the Asia Paciﬁ c management team,  integrating the sales,  commercial,  
ﬁ nance,  and procurement and supply chain teams,  as well as the 
R&D and IT functions,  and introducing a common ﬁ nancial reporting 
platform.  The economic downturn in the ﬁ rst half of 2009 made this 
process all the more challenging,  but the integration programme was 
executed effectively and enabled the Asia Paciﬁ c business to perform 
strongly in 2009.  Both programmes made a signiﬁ cant contribution to 
the strategic direction of the Group.
The total amount that would be payable to David Dutro for early 
termination by the Company of his service agreement is between 
50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate of (i) his basic annual 
salary and (ii) any bonus which he may be eligible to receive. 
The total amount that would be payable to Brian Taylorson for early 
termination by the Company of his service agreement is between 
50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate of (i) his basic annual 
salary,  (ii) the sums that would have become payable to him or on his 
behalf,  had 12 months’  notice of termination been given,  by way of 
pension accruals and any pension cash salary supplement,  (iii) the 
cost of providing private medical insurance for him,  his spouse and 
children aged under 21 for the 12 months following termination,  and 
(iv) his monthly car allowance for a 12 month period.
The non-executive directors during the year held letters of 
appointment with the Company as follows:

Each letter provides that the director’s appointment can be 
terminated by the Company on six months’  notice on any grounds 
without claim for compensation.  Copies of all letters of appointment 
of non-executive directors,  as well as the executive directors’  service 
contracts,  are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
ofﬁ ce during normal business hours and will be available for 
inspection at the AGM.
 
Short term incentive arrangements
2008 Annual Bonus Scheme
For completeness and in keeping with the ABI’s Guidelines,  the 
following earnings per share (“EPS”) targets for 2008 are disclosed 
retrospectively:  7.2p (threshold),  7.8p (target) and 8.3p (upper).  At 
threshold,  target and upper level,  the percentage of base salary that 
was payable,  in the case of the executive directors,  in bonus payments 
was 7.5 per cent,  70 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.  In addition,  
an over-performance bonus was deﬁ ned such that with every 0.1p of 
EPS above 8.3p and capped at 9.0p,  certain participants were entitled 
to a share of an over-performance bonus pool.  The Company’s EPS 
(before exceptional items,  which is the deﬁ nition used) in 2008 was 
9.1p and,  under the over-performance component,  the executive 
directors and business managing directors all had an equal share in 
the bonus pool,  equivalent to £140,000 each.  32 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
DIRECTORS’  REMUNERATION REPORT
continued
The bonus scheme for the other senior executives,  such as the 
business managing directors,  follows a similar design and structure,  
except that the performance metrics are based on divisional 
performance where appropriate.  The maximum bonus opportunity 
for the business managing directors is also restricted to 100 per 
cent of their base salaries.  All bonuses,  as in previous years,  are not 
pensionable.
Long term incentive arrangements
1998 Executive Share Option Schemes
The 1998 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option 
Schemes (the “1998 Schemes”) are discretionary option schemes 
under which senior management below Board level were granted 
options to purchase shares in the Company.  The price at which 
options may be exercised is the average market price over the ﬁ ve 
working days preceding the grant and there is no discount.  Options 
are capable of exercise after three years and within ten years of the 
date of grant;  those granted since 1995 are subject to earnings per 
share performance targets.  The 1998 Schemes have now expired 
and no further options will be granted.  However,  subject to the rules 
of the 1998 Schemes,  certain awards continue to remain exercisable.
2003 Executive Share Option Schemes
The 2003 Approved and Unapproved Schemes (the  “2003 Schemes”) 
replaced the 1998 Schemes.  The key features of the 2003 Schemes are 
as follows:
 
•
  Options are granted with an exercise price per share based on the 
Company’s mid-market closing share price on the dealing day 
preceding the date of grant;
 
•
  The value of options valued at the date of grant will not normally 
exceed 1.5 times basic salary in any ﬁ nancial year;  and
 
•
  Performance conditions attached to the exercise of options 
granted between 2003 and 2007 to executive directors and other 
senior managers were based partly on the Company’s EPS growth 
relative to inﬂ ation and partly on the Company’s total shareholder 
return (“TSR”) relative to an index of comparator companies;  the 
performance conditions attached to the options granted to 
executives in 2008 were based on EPS targets only and in 2009 on 
TSR only,  relative to the comparator companies listed on page 33.
2010 Annual Bonus Scheme
Following a review of short and long term incentive schemes,  in 
which major shareholders representing over 50 per cent of the 
Company’s issued capital were consulted,  the Committee has made 
some structural changes to the Annual Bonus Scheme for 2010.  The 
maximum bonus opportunity has been reduced to 100 per cent of 
base salary,  all of which would be paid in cash.  The additional 50 per 
cent in the 2009 bonus scheme that would have been paid out in the 
form of deferred shares is to be replaced by a grant of options,  under 
the long term incentive plan,  subject to performance conditions.  
These are discussed later in the report.  The Committee considers 
that transferring part of the bonus opportunity into the long term 
incentive programme obviates the need to introduce bonus deferral 
or claw-back mechanisms advocated by investor bodies,  such as the 
ABI and NAPF . 
The performance conditions attaching to the 2010 Annual Bonus 
Scheme are split 50:50 between EPS and the average trade working 
capital to sales ratio expressed as a percentage for the Group (“AWC”).  
Both EPS and AWC conditions have been selected because they 
are considered to be the most appropriate measures of the Group’s 
strategic and ﬁ nancial performance,  and these have been set at 
threshold,  target and upper level.  Under each component of EPS and 
AWC the following percentages of basic salary can be earned in bonus 
payments,  with straight line accrual in between the points,  0 per 
cent at threshold,  25 per cent at target and 50 per cent at upper level.  
To achieve the maximum of 100 per cent of base pay,  EPS and AWC 
performance would both have to be at the upper level. 
The Committee considers that the target range set for the EPS 
performance condition is commercially sensitive and therefore this 
is not disclosed in this report,  although the Committee undertakes 
to disclose this target range in next year’s Remuneration report.  The 
Committee can report that the EPS target range,  which is more 
than a 50 per cent increase on the 2009 result,  is considered to be 
sufﬁ ciently challenging and was arrived at having taken the following 
factors into consideration:  analysts’  consensus forecast for 2010;  the 
Group’s annualised EPS growth rate between 2005 and 2008;  and the 
likelihood that trading volumes are anticipated to recover as global 
economic conditions improve.  In addition,  the Committee has agreed 
that the EPS target range will be adjusted for any corporate action or 
transaction,  if appropriate. 
The AWC target range is also considered to be commercially 
sensitive because it could prejudice negotiations with suppliers 
and customers.  The Committee considers that the range set is 
appropriately challenging,  having taken into account the Group’s 
historical performance in this area,  and gives management an 
additional incentive to focus on operating cash ﬂ ow and working 
capital,  as the business emerges from the economic downturn.  
The 2010 AWC target range (and the 2009 AWC target comparative) 
will be published in next year’s Remuneration report. Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Minor amendments to the 2003 Schemes are being made this year to 
take into account of recent age discrimination legislation and update 
references for the Companies Act 2006.  However,  as these are not 
considered to fall under the category of changes that would require 
prior shareholder approval,  no resolution to approve these is being 
proposed at the AGM.
2008 Long Term Incentive Plan (“2008 L TIP”)
The 2008 LTIP was adopted by shareholders at the 2008 AGM and the 
following awards were made in that year:  David Dutro 25 per cent of 
the LTIP pool,  Brian Taylorson 20 per cent of LTIP pool,  Greg McClatchy,  
Managing Director of Specialty Products and Surfactants,  20 per cent 
and Eric Haaijer,  then Managing Director of Chromium,  12 per cent,  
leaving 23 per cent of the LTIP pool unawarded.  The value of the 2008 
LTIP pool (in £’millions) is calculated by taking 2.15 per cent of the 
increase in the value of the Company (measured by share price growth 
over the three year performance period plus all dividends paid or 
declared during that period) less 9.3 per cent per annum (representing 
the cost of equity which is the minimum growth threshold).  The 
2008 LTIP awards are in the form of nil cost options over shares in the 
Company equal to the value of each participant’s share of the LTIP 
pool.  These awards were granted on 28 April 2008 when the market 
value of a share was 66.5 pence.  The awards vest after three years from 
the date of grant and are subject to the cost of equity performance 
condition described above.  Eric Haaijer’s award lapsed when he left 
the Group in March 2009.
The Committee decided that no change would be made to the 
terms and conditions relating to the LTIP awards made in 2008 and,  
accordingly,  the performance condition will be tested in April 2011 
and,  if it is not met,  the awards will lapse.
The comparator companies for the purposes of grants made between 
2003 to 2007 and in 2009 were as follows:
FTSE All Share Chemicals Croda International Plc
 Porvair plc
 Yule Catto & Co plc
FTSE Eurotop 300 Chemicals Akzo Nobel NV

Switzerland:  Specialty Chemicals Lonza Group AG
S&P 400 Specialty Chemicals Ferro Corp
 HB Fuller Co

France:  Chemicals Rhodia SA
The following targets applied to options granted to executive directors 
and other senior managers prior to 2008:
Proportion of option   Performance criteria
grant as a percentage   to be met for options
of base salary EPS/TSR split to be exercisable
0% to 70% 50% EPS – Annual average
  EPS growth of 4% + RPI

70.1% to 150% 50% EPS – Annual average 
  EPS growth of 
  between 4.1% + RPI 
  and 10% + RPI (straight line
  vesting in between)
 50% TSR – Median to upper quartile
   (straight line vesting 
  in between)
The EPS performance condition and TSR condition apply separately 
to options granted under the 2003 Schemes.  Options granted since 
2006 are not permitted any re-test and lapse immediately if the 
performance conditions attaching are not satisﬁ ed. 
The Company’s policy on granting options is that no individual has 
an absolute right of participation and that all grants are made at 
the discretion of the Committee under delegated authority from 
the Board.  Participants are nominated by business and functional 
heads and recommended to the Committee for approval by the 
Chief Executive.  The level of grants are relative to the base salary 
of the participants,  set at 20 per cent,  35 per cent and 60 per cent,  
commensurate with seniority in terms of managerial grade and the 
individual’s ability to inﬂ uence corporate performance.  Three senior 
executives received grants in 2009 at the level of 60 per cent of their 
base salary.  Some 48 employees throughout the Group received 
a grant of options in 2009 (2008:  43).  This number excludes both 
executive directors and one business managing director.  
In 2008 the executive directors and two business managing directors 
received awards under the 2008 LTIP instead of executive options.  
None of these individuals received any LTIP awards or grants of 
executive options in 2009.  However,  during the early part of 2009 the 
managing director of Chromium was replaced by Dennis Valentino 
who was granted options under the 2003 Schemes over 100,000 
shares at the time he took up his role. 34 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
DIRECTORS’  REMUNERATION REPORT
continued
All nil cost options to be granted under the amended LTIP in 2010 
will be subject to a 50:50 EPS and TSR performance condition.  The 
EPS condition will be based on the Group’s Three Year Plan targets at 
threshold,  plan and upper level,  with 0 per cent vesting at threshold,  
100 per cent at the upper level and straight line vesting in between.  
Due to commercial sensitivity,  these targets are not disclosed but the 
Committee considers that they are appropriately challenging,  having 
also taken into consideration in determining these targets those 
factors listed in the description of how the EPS targets in the Annual 
Bonus Scheme were set. 
The TSR condition will be measured against the FTSE All Share Index 
(excluding investment trusts) as it was considered that this broad 
equity index,  which is more transparent and less exposed to cyclical 
returns,  would provide a better measure of relative performance 
than the comparator group used in the past.  Using this index should 
ensure greater alignment with shareholders who,  when investing,  
generally make decisions to invest in the Company by reference to the 
broader UK listed market,  rather than to a speciﬁ c list of international 
chemical companies.  In addition,  TSR is a metric that broadly reﬂ ects 
a company’s relative price earnings ratio,  which in turn reﬂ ects the 
premium or risk that an investor perceives attaching to the shares 
held,  and so is a performance metric that takes risk into account.  
The Committee considers that the TSR condition will encourage 
management to focus on a broad range of factors that inﬂ uence 
shareholder value. 
In terms of the vesting scale,  at median performance against the FTSE 
All Share Index 3.85 per cent of that part of a grant which is subject 
to the TSR condition would vest,  with 100 per cent vesting for upper 
quartile performance (straight line in between).  The Committee 
considers that this vesting scale provides management with an 
appropriate incentive to out-perform the FTSE All Share Index. 
It is the Committee’s intention that,  subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM,  nil cost options would be granted under the amended 
LTIP rules each year on a materially similar basis to that proposed for 
2010.  The four senior executives who will participate in the amended 
LTIP will not also participate in any other discretionary share option 
programme.
The costs of operating all of the Company’s share incentive schemes 
and the total number of options outstanding as at the year end are 
disclosed in Notes 25 to the Financial Statements on pages 74 and 
75.  Grants to be made under the amended LTIP rules will not take the 
total number of share options outstanding over the ABI’s Guidelines 
on anti-dilution limits in respect of the allotment of shares for 
discretionary and all employee share schemes.
2010 Long Term Incentive Plan (“2010 L TIP”)
As mentioned earlier,  the Committee carried out an extensive review 
of the Group’s incentive schemes during the year which involved 
consulting with the Company’s major shareholders.  The outcome 
of that process is that the Committee is proposing changes to the 
manner in which the LTIP is operated,  together with a number of 
consequential changes to the LTIP rules adopted in 2008.  Details 
of the key operational changes being proposed are set out below.  
In addition,  a summary of the principal features of the rules of the 
LTIP as proposed to be amended is set out in the Notice of Meeting 
accompanying this Annual Report.  If the proposed changes are 
approved by shareholders,  it is intended that awards be granted 
in 2010 to the Chief Executive,  Finance Director and both business 
managing directors.  Copies of the rules of the LTIP as proposed to be 
amended are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
ofﬁ ce during normal business hours and will be available for 
inspection at the AGM.
The proposal is that the grant of nil cost options to each of these four 
individuals would comprise two parts.  The ﬁ rst part is based on a 
number of options equal in value to one times base salary (using the 
mid-market closing price on the dealing day immediately preceding 
the date of grant) and the second part is a further grant of options 
equal in value to a maximum of 50 per cent of the Chief Executive’s 
base salary as at the date of grant.  Under this formula,  the maximum 
number of options that can be granted to any single individual would 
be restricted to a value equivalent to 100 per cent of the individual’s 
annual base salary plus 50 per cent of the Chief Executive’s annual base 
salary at the date of grant.  Shareholders are asked to approve these 
2010 LTIP proposals by approving and adopting the amended LTIP 
rules at the AGM.
The second component of the above grant of LTIP options has been 
designed to replicate and replace the over-performance bonus pool 
in the old annual bonus scheme,  which took the bonus opportunity 
to more than 100 per cent of base salary.  The Committee considers 
that,  as the executive directors and two business managing directors 
had an equal share of the over-performance bonus pool under the old 
annual bonus schemes (which,  at the maximum level,  was equivalent 
to about 50 per cent of the Chief Executive’s base salary),  setting the 
second part of the LTIP grant at this level,  rather than relative to each 
individual’s base salary,  would achieve the twin objectives of ensuring 
that the interests of the four individuals concerned are closely aligned 
and that the Committee’s policy of having a signiﬁ cant proportion of 
total remuneration linked to performance is maintained.  Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
 Annual report and accounts 2009 Elementis plc   35
The Committee considers that,  based on the relative size of the 
Group’s UK and US workforce (under 100 in the UK versus over 
700 in the US),  restricting the monthly savings of US employees 
to an amount equivalent to the UK permitted amount is no longer 
appropriate,  particularly since US tax law allows the Group’s US 
employees to save towards options having a maximum value of 
$25,000 in any 12 month period across all US tax qualifying option 
schemes.  The Committee considers that this increase in the savings 
limit is not excessive given that the US Scheme is operative for a ten 
year period.  Additionally,  the Company will continue to follow and 
adhere to ABI Guidelines on anti-dilution limits on all employee and 
discretionary share schemes by managing its options programmes in 
conjunction with its Employee Share Ownership Trust,  which holds 
some 4.7 million shares in trust at present. 
The Notice of Meeting accompanying this annual report sets out the 
details of changes being proposed.  Copies of the rules of the 2008 US 
Scheme annotated to show the proposed changes are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce during normal business 
hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Total shareholder return performance
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total shareholder return 
for the ﬁ ve years ending 31 December 2009,  relative to the FTSE All 
Share Index.
This graph looks at the value,  to the end of 2009,  of £100 invested in 
Elementis on 31 December 2004 compared with that of £100 invested 
in the FTSE All Share Index.
The Company is a member of the FTSE All Share Index and accordingly 
this is considered to be the most appropriate broad equity market 
index for the purpose of measuring the Company’s relative 
performance.
Share ownership guidelines
Shareholding guidelines introduced previously required executive 
directors to build up a stake in the Company over a period of time 
that is equal in value to one times their basic annual salaries.  Brian 
Taylorson,  who has been Finance Director since 2002,  is considered to 
have met this requirement.  David Dutro,  who was appointed to the 
Board as Group Chief Executive in January 2007,  is also expected to 
build up a shareholding equal to his annual basic salary.  The 2008 LTIP 
award contained a requirement that a proportion of the awards which 
vest must be retained as shares by the executive directors in order 
to build up the required shareholding under the Share ownership 
guidelines. 
Savings-Related Share Option Schemes
Under the 2008 UK savings-related share option scheme (“UK SAYE 
Scheme”),  all eligible UK employees,  including executive directors,  can 
enter into savings contracts with a bank or building society for a period 
of three or ﬁ ve years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts 
to acquire shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.  
The option price at which options may be exercised is the average 
market price over the ﬁ ve working days preceding the invitation date 
discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent. 
Options granted to executive directors under the UK SAYE Scheme 
are not subject to performance conditions,  as it is a HM Revenue & 
Customs’  approved all-employee scheme,  which does not allow for 
the imposition of performance conditions on the exercise of options.  
A similar scheme was also adopted in 2008 for the beneﬁ t of US based 
employees,  including executive directors,  and the savings period is 
typically 24 months,  with an option price discounted by a maximum 
of 15 per cent (“US Scheme”).
The 2008 UK SAYE and US Schemes replaced previous schemes,  which 
have expired,  that contained substantially the same provisions as the 
current schemes.  However,  subject to the rules of the now expired 
schemes,  certain awards continue to remain exercisable.
A number of changes are being proposed at the AGM to the 2008 
US Scheme,  principally to increase the amount that individual 
participants may save each year from $500 per month to $2,000 
per month and to double the total number of shares that may be 
allocated to options under the US Scheme.  These changes are 
considered necessary in order for the Company to be able to provide 
a competitive share incentive programme to its US based employees.  
The changes being proposed are standard features of a typical US 
savings-based share option plan.  The US Scheme was adopted in 2008 
by the Board under the authority granted to it by a resolution passed 
by shareholders at the 2008 AGM and is modelled closely on the UK 
SAYE Scheme.

3  David Dutro as Group Chief Executive received a salary of $650,000 per annum (2008:  $650,000 per annum).  His emoluments exclude salary 
supplements paid as compensation for the closing to future accruals of the US deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme – see below.  His basic salary in 2010 
was increased by three per cent. 
4  Emoluments for Brian Taylorson also exclude salary supplements paid as compensation for the limitation of pension rights to the former 
HM Revenue & Customs’  earnings cap.  These are shown in the Directors’  retirement beneﬁ ts table below.  His basic salary in 2010 was also 
increased by three per cent.

the year.
Retirement beneﬁ ts
David Dutro,  as a US salaried executive director,  participated in the Elementis Career Reward Retirement Plan (“ECRRP”) for US employees until 
the plan was closed to future accruals in May 2006.  The ECRRP is a cash balance retirement plan,  which falls under the category of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension plans in the US.  As the plan is closed to future accruals,  participants’  account balances are no longer credited with contributions,  
however,  interest is credited each year at the US Treasury 30 year bond rate.  David Dutro’s accrued beneﬁ ts under this plan are shown in the table 
below.  The normal pensionable retirement age for David Dutro under the ECRRP is 65.
The ECRRP was replaced by a US 401(k) Plan,  which is similar to a money purchase scheme,  and a Non-Qualiﬁ ed Deferred Compensation Plan.  
Employer contributions in respect of David Dutro under these plans in 2009 were £49,316 (2008:  £35,070) in total.  The amount paid can vary 
from year to year as it is based on matching employee contributions up to about six per cent of their total remuneration each year.
Brian Taylorson,  as a UK salaried executive director,  participates in the Company’s HM Revenue & Customs’  approved funded occupational 
pension scheme,  and he is subject to the former HM Revenue & Customs’  earnings cap on the amount of salary which may be treated as 
pensionable. 
The main beneﬁ ts under this scheme to him as a UK salaried executive director,  who contributes a percentage of his salary to the scheme each 
year,  are:
•
 an accrual rate of 1/30th for each year of pensionable service;
•
 life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary;  and
•
 pensions to spouse and dependent children payable on death.
The normal pensionable retirement age for Brian Taylorson is 60. Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Transfer values for David Dutro and Brian Taylorson in the table below have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009
(b)  Pension and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts (Note 24) In 
respect of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes,  the Group’s net 
obligation in respect of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans is calculated 
by estimating the amount of future beneﬁ t that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods;  
that beneﬁ t is discounted to determine its present value,  and the 
fair value of any plan assets is deducted.  The liability discount rate 
is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that 
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s 
obligations.  Pension and post-retirement liabilities are calculated 
by qualiﬁ ed actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
The expected increase in the present value of scheme liabilities 
and the long term expected return on assets,  based on the fair 
value of the scheme assets at the start of the period,  are included 
in the income statement under ﬁ nance income.  Any difference 
between the expected return on assets and that achieved is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income together 
with the difference from experience or assumption changes.  The 
Group recognises all such actuarial gains and losses in the period 
in which they occur through the statement of comprehensive 
income.  The Group also operates a small number of deﬁ ned 
contribution schemes and the contributions payable during the 
year are recognised as incurred.  Due to the size of the pension 
scheme assets and liabilities,  relatively small changes in the 
assumptions can have a signiﬁ cant impact on the expense 
recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability 
recorded in the balance sheet.
(c) Intangible assets (Note 10)
  (i) Goodwill All business combinations since the transition to IFRS 
on 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase 
method.  In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred 
since the transition date,  goodwill represents the difference 
between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of 
net identiﬁ able assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.  
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date,  goodwill is included 
on the basis of its deemed cost,  which represents the amount 
recorded under previous GAAP .  Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and tested annually for impairment.  Changes to 
the assumptions used in impairment testing could have a material 
impact on the ﬁ nancial position of the Group and of the result for 
the year.
  (ii) Research and development Expenditure on research is 
recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.  
Expenditure on development where research ﬁ ndings are applied 
to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes is capitalised if the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group 
has sufﬁ cient resources to complete development.  Expenditure 
capitalised is stated as the cost of materials,  direct labour and 
an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated 
amortisation.  Other development expenditure is recognised in 
the income statement as an expense as incurred.  
1 Accounting policies
Elementis plc is a company incorporated in the UK.  The Group ﬁ nancial 
statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRS”).  The Company has elected to 
prepare its parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
UK GAAP .  These are presented on pages 79 to 82.
Basis of preparation The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
using the going concern basis and further details on this are set out in 
the Directors’  report on page 23.  The ﬁ nancial statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments and ﬁ nancial instruments held for trading or available 
for sale are stated at their fair value.  Non-current assets held for sale 
are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell.  The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements requires the application 
of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities,  revenues and costs and related disclosures at the 
balance sheet date.  The accounting policies set out below have been 
consistently applied across Group companies to all periods presented 
in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Critical accounting policies Critical accounting policies are those 
that require signiﬁ cant judgements or estimates and potentially 
result in materially different results under different assumptions or 
conditions.  When preparing consolidated ﬁ nancial statements under 
IFRS management must make assumptions and estimates about 
the future which have an impact on the assets,  liabilities,  income 
and expenditure at the balance sheet date.  These assumptions 
and estimates are based upon factors such as historical experience,  
industry knowledge and the use of external advisers,  and are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis.  The Group’s critical accounting policies,  and 
information on the key areas where critical judgements are used,  are 
described in the paragraphs below.  The development of the estimates 
and disclosures related to each of these matters have been discussed 
by the Audit Committee.
(a)  Provisions (Note 16) A provision is recognised in the balance 
sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event,  and it is probable that 
an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the 
obligation.  If the effect is material,  provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that 
reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and,  where appropriate,  the risks speciﬁ c to the liability.  
  A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has 
approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan,  and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced 
publicly.  In accordance with the Group’s environmental 
policy and applicable legal requirements,  a provision for site 
restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised when 
the land is contaminated.  Provisions for environmental issues 
are judgemental by their nature and more difﬁ cult to estimate 
when they relate to sites no longer directly controlled by the 
Group.  Elementis has taken a consistent approach to estimating 
environmental provisions. Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
 Annual report and accounts 2009 Elementis plc   45
(e)   Exceptional items (Note 5) The Group presents certain 
items separately as “exceptional” .  These are items which in 
management’s judgement,  need to be disclosed by virtue of 
their size and incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper 
understanding of the ﬁ nancial information.  The determination of 
which items are separately disclosed as exceptional items requires 
a signiﬁ cant degree of judgement.
 (f)  Income tax (Note 17) Income tax on the proﬁ t or loss for the year 
comprises current and deferred tax.  Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised directly in equity,  in which case it is recognised 
in equity.  Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year,  using tax rates enacted or substantially 
enacted at the balance sheet date,  and any adjustment to tax 
payable in respect of previous years.  Deferred tax is provided on 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes.  The following temporary differences 
are not provided for:  the initial recognition of goodwill;  the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting 
nor taxable proﬁ t other than in a business combination;  and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.  The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities,  using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the 
balance sheet date.  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax beneﬁ t will be realised.
  The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates.  This requires an estimation of 
current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary 
differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting 
and tax treatments.  The Group operates in a number of countries 
in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.  
As a consequence the Group is subject to tax audits,  which by 
their nature are often complex and can require several years to 
conclude.  Management’s judgement is required to determine 
the total provision for income tax.  Amounts are accrued based 
on management’s interpretation of country speciﬁ c tax law and 
likelihood of settlement.  However, the actual tax liabilities could 
differ from the position and in such events an adjustment would 
be required in the subsequent period which could have a material 
impact.  Tax beneﬁ ts are not recognised unless it is probable that 
the tax positions are sustainable.  Once considered to be probable,  
management reviews each material tax beneﬁ t to assess whether 
a provision should be taken against full recognition of the beneﬁ t 
on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation.  This 
evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast 
of future taxable income.
  (iii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at 
cost or when arising in a business combination,  estimated fair 
value,  less accumulated amortisation.
  (iv) Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets unless such lives are indeﬁ nite.  On this basis 
there is no amortisation of intangible assets relating to brand.  
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance 
sheet date.  Other intangible assets are amortised from the date 
they are available for use.  The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 Patents and trademarks 10 – 20 years
 Other intangible assets  1 – 5 years
(d)   Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments (Note 22) The Group uses 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.  The Group does not hold or 
issue derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for trading purposes.  
However,  derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
accounted for as trading instruments.  Due to the requirement to 
measure the effectiveness of hedging instruments,  changes in 
market conditions can result in the recognition of unrealised gains 
or losses on hedging instruments in the income statement.
  Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recognised initially at 
fair value.  The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.  However,  
where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting,  recognition of 
any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being 
hedged.  The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their 
quoted market price at the balance sheet date,  being the present 
value of the quoted forward price.  
   Cash ﬂ o w hedges Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is 
designated as a hedge of the variability in cash ﬂ ows of a recognised 
asset or liability,  or a highly probable forecast transaction,  the 
effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative ﬁ nancial 
instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.  Any 
ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.  
   F air v alue hedges Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is 
designated as a hedge of the variability in a fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability or an unrecognised ﬁ rm commitment,  all changes 
in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in 
the income statement.  The carrying value of the hedged item is 
adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk 
being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised 
cost) and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised 
immediately in the income statement (even if those gains would 
normally be recognised directly in reserves). 46 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income 
and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,  are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.  Unrealised gains 
arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.  
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains,  
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
 Associa t e s Associates are those entities in which the Group has 
signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence,  but not control over the ﬁ nancial and operating 
policies.  The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the Group’s 
share of the post-acquisition total recognised gains and losses and 
the net assets of associates on an equity accounted basis.  Where the 
Group’s share of losses exceeds its investment in an associate,  the 
Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred 
a legal or constructive obligation.  
Foreign currency 
(a)  Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies 
are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at 
the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.  Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(b)  Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and 
liabilities of foreign operations,  including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on consolidation,  are translated at exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date.  The revenues and expenses 
of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of 
exchange ruling for the relevant period.  Exchange differences 
arising since 1 January 2004 on translation are taken to the 
translation reserve.  They are recognised in the income statement 
upon disposal of the foreign operation.  The Group hedges a 
portion of the translation exposure of its overseas net assets 
through US dollar and Euro borrowings.  From 1 January 2005,  the 
Group has elected to apply net investment hedge accounting 
for these transactions where possible.  Where hedging is applied,  
the effective portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to 
hedge a net investment is recognised in equity.  Any ineffective 
portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement.  
1 Accounting policies (continued)
(g)  Property,  plant and equipment (Note 11) Items of property,  
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.  Freehold land is not 
depreciated.  Leasehold property is depreciated over the period 
of the lease.  Freehold buildings,  plant and machinery,  vehicles,  
ﬁ xtures,  ﬁ ttings and equipment are depreciated over their 
estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.  Depreciation 
methods,  useful lives and residual values are assessed at the 
reporting date.  No depreciation is charged on assets under 
construction until the asset is brought into use.  
 Estimates of useful lives of these assets are:
 Buildings 10 – 50 years
 Plant and machinery 2 – 20 years
 Vehicles 2 – 10 years
 Fixtures,  ﬁ ttings and equipment 3 – 20 years
  The cost of replacing part of an item of property,  plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it 
is probable that the future economic beneﬁ ts embodied within 
it will ﬂ ow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.  
The costs of the day to day servicing of property,  plant and 
equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
  Management regularly considers whether there are any 
indications of impairment to carrying values of property,  plant 
and equipment.  Impairment reviews are based on risk adjusted 
discounted cash ﬂ ow projections.  Signiﬁ cant judgement is 
applied to the assumptions underlying these projections which 
include estimated discount rates,  growth rates,  future selling 
prices and direct costs.  Changes to these assumptions could have 
a material impact on the ﬁ nancial position of the Group and of the 
result for the year.
 Basis of consolidation The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include 
the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the 
period.  A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.  
Control exists when the Company has the power,  directly or indirectly,  
to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity to obtain 
beneﬁ ts from its activities.  The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during a period are included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1,  the Company has 
not restated business combinations that took place prior to the date 
of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004.  As a consequence the Scheme 
of Arrangement entered into in 1998 whereby the Company acquired 
Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override 
to account for the transaction as a merger has not been restated 
under IFRS.

Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of 
ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from 
equity.  When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased,  the 
amount of the consideration paid,  including directly attributable 
costs,  is recognised as a deduction from equity.  Repurchased shares 
are classiﬁ ed as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from 
total equity.  
Impairment The carrying amount of non-current assets other than 
deferred tax is compared to the asset’s recoverable amount at each 
balance sheet date where there is an indication of impairment.  For 
goodwill,  assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful life and intangible assets 
that are not yet available for use,  the recoverable amount is estimated 
at each balance sheet date.  An impairment loss is recognised 
whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount.  Impairment losses are recognised in 
the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are 
allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of 
the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.  A cash generating unit 
is the smallest identiﬁ able group of assets that generates cash inﬂ ows 
that are largely independent of the cash inﬂ ows from other assets or 
groups of assets.  
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use.  In assessing value in use,  the estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset.  For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent cash inﬂ ows,  the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs.
Revenue Revenue is based on the fair value of consideration received 
from the sale of goods.  It excludes sales between Group undertakings,  
VAT and similar sales based taxes.  Revenue from the sale of goods is 
recognised in the income statement when the signiﬁ cant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.  
Finance income and ﬁ nance costs Finance income comprises 
interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of 
ﬁ nancial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.  Interest 
income is recognised as it accrues,  using the effective interest method.  
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings,  unwinding of 
the discount on provisions,  dividends on preference shares classiﬁ ed 
as liabilities,  foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value 
of ﬁ nancial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.  All 
borrowing costs are recognised the income statement using the 
effective interest method.
Leased assets Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as 
ﬁ nance leases.  An asset held under a ﬁ nance lease is recorded in 
the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of its estimated 
useful life and the lease term.  Future instalments net of ﬁ nance 
charges are included within borrowings.  Minimum lease payments 
are apportioned between the ﬁ nance charge,  which is allocated 
to each period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining liability and charged to the income statement and 
reduction of the outstanding liability.  Rental costs arising from 
operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the period 
of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.  Net realisable value is the estimated selling price,  
less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.  Cost,  which 
is based on a weighted average,  includes expenditure incurred in 
acquiring stock and bringing it to its existing location and condition.  
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress,  
cost includes an appropriate share of overheads attributable to 
manufacture,  based on normal operating capacity.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are 
stated at their nominal amount which is the original invoiced amount 
less provision made for bad and doubtful receivables.  Estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of receivables and 
historical experience.  Individual trade receivables are written off when 
management deem them no longer to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less.  Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
statement of cash ﬂ ows.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal 
to the fair value at inception),  and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  Any difference 
between the proceeds,  net of transaction costs and the settlement 
or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the terms of the 
borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing borrowings 
and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost. 48 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009
continued
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted New standards,  
amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective 
for the year ended 31 December 2009,  and have not been applied in 
preparing these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements,  but that become 
mandatory for the Group’s 2010 ﬁ nancial statements are as follows:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised 2008)
The revised standard amends the deﬁ nition of a business,  the method 
by which an acquisition is accounted for and the recognition of 
deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
(amended 2008)
This sets out changes to the accounting for non-controlling 
(minority) interests.
Amendments to IAS 39 – Eligible Hedged Items
This clariﬁ es how the principles that determine whether a hedged 
 risk or portion of cashﬂ ows is eligible for designation should be 
applied in particular circumstances.
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
This interpretation provides guidance in respect of distributions of 
non-cash assets to owners acting in their capacity as owners.
Amendments to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations.
 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
Amendments to IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
 Amendments to IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives.
 Amendments to IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a 
Foreign Operation.
The Group has not yet determined the potential impact of these 
interpretations on the 2010 ﬁ nancial statements.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share 
options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the options.  The fair value of the options 
granted is measured using a binomial model,  taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  The 
amount recognised as an employee expense is adjusted to reﬂ ect the 
actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is 
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Own shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) 
Transactions of the Group sponsored ESOT are included in the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.  In particular,  the trust’s purchases 
of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
Investments Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated 
at amortised cost.
Government grants Grants against capital expenditure from 
government and other bodies are shown separately in the balance 
sheet.  Such grants are released to the proﬁ t and loss account over the 
same period for which the relevant assets are depreciated.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current 
asset (a disposal group),  is classiﬁ ed as held for sale if its carrying 
amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through 
continuing use,  it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable 
within one year.  On initial classiﬁ cation as held for sale,  non-current 
assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments 
taken to proﬁ t or loss.  The same applies to gains and losses on 
subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations,  or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale,  
that has been disposed of,  has been abandoned or that meets the 
criteria to be classiﬁ ed as held for sale.
Termination beneﬁ ts Termination beneﬁ ts are recognised as an 
expense when the Group is demonstrably committed,  without 
realistic possibility of withdrawal,  to a formal detailed plan to 
terminate employment before the normal retirement date.  
Termination beneﬁ ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised if 
the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy,  
it is probable that the offer will be accepted,  and the number of 
acceptances can be estimated reliably. Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information

2 Operating segments
The Group has determined its operating segments on the basis of those used for management,  internal reporting purposes and the allocation 
of strategic resources.  The three reportable segments,  Specialty Products,  Surfactants and Chromium each have distinct product groupings and, 
with the exception of Surfactants which shares a common management structure and Specialty Products,  separate management structures.  
There is no material inter-segmental trading.  Segment results,  assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment and those 
that may be reasonably allocated from corporate activities.  Presentation of the segmental results is on a basis consistent with those used for 
reporting Group results.  Principal activities of the reportable segments are as follows:
Specialty Products – production of rheological additives,  compounded products and colourants.
Surfactants – production of surface active ingredients.
Chromium – production of chromium chemicals.
Unallocated items and those relating to corporate functions such as tax and treasury are presented in the tables below as Central costs.

The Group has continued its separate presentation of certain items as exceptional.  These are items which,  in management’s judgement,  need to 
be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the ﬁ nancial information.  
Following an investigation by the EU Commission into heat stabilisers,  the Company was notiﬁ ed of a ﬁ ne of Euro 14.3 million on Elementis and 
a further ﬁ ne of Euro 18.3 million served jointly and severally on Elementis,  Akcros Chemicals Ltd and other companies owned by Akzo Nobel.  
Elementis no longer manufactures such products and has not done so since 1998,  when the Company disposed of its 50 per cent joint venture 
interest in Akcros Chemicals to Akzo Nobel,  the other 50 per cent joint venture owner.  An exceptional charge of £21.6 million has been recorded 
consisting of the full value of the Euro 14.3 million ﬁ ne and 50 per cent of the Euro 18.3 million joint ﬁ ne along with legal costs incurred to date in 
defending the Company’s position.
Chromium
Following a strategic review at the beginning of the year,  the Eaglescliffe chromium plant in the UK was closed with production ceasing in 
July 2009 and an exceptional charge of £28.7 million recorded in the period.  In 2008 an impairment of £20.5 million had been recorded following 
a re-assessment of the value in use of property,  plant and equipment within the business.  Included within the 2009 charge is £16.3 million 
related to the anticipated site remediation costs,  being the current estimate calculated in conjunction with external consultants on the basis of 
an ongoing full site survey.  The bulk of these costs will be incurred over the next two years.  Employee costs of £6.0 million relate to severance 
payments and employee operating costs associated with the shutdown of the plant.  Exceptional hedging costs of £4.5 million relate to the 
cost of reversing forward exchange contracts that were taken out in 2008 in anticipation of foreign currency cash ﬂ ows arising from sales made 
from Eaglescliffe in the second half of 2009.  A £1.9 million charge has been incurred in respect of adjustments in the net realisable value of 
engineering stores and other site assets.   52 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
5 Exceptional items (continued)
Central costs
The Group hedges its currency exposure in any year by entering into forward contracts during the second half of the previous year for up to 
50 per cent of the estimated exposure.  The signiﬁ cant downturn in sales volumes that took place towards the end of 2008 caused the Group 
to have more forward contracts than underlying exposure during the ﬁ rst half of the year.  The cost of cancelling these excess contracts was 
£4.7 million and has been recorded in central costs as an exceptional item.  
In 2009 a one-time gain of £5.5 million was recorded in respect of past service credits relating to bridging pensions between retirement and the 
state pension age.

The tax charge on proﬁ t before exceptional items represents an effective tax rate on proﬁ t before exceptional items for the year ended 
31 December 2009 of 32.8 per cent (2008:  16.9 per cent).  The rate is higher than the standard UK corporation tax due to proﬁ tability in 
jurisdictions where the standard rate is higher than the UK rate and where additional taxes on undistributed proﬁ ts are levied.  As a Group 
involved in overseas operations,  the amount of proﬁ tability in each jurisdiction,  transfer pricing legislation and local tax rate changes,  will 
affect future tax charges.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting proﬁ t as follows:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated,  at acquisition,  to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to beneﬁ t from 
that business combination.  The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products (£193.0 million) and Elementis Surfactants 
(£2.3 million).
The Group tests annually for impairment,  or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  The recoverable amounts 
of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.  The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the 
discount rates,  growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.  Management estimates discount rates 
using pre-tax rates that reﬂ ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the CGUs.  The discount rate used 
in 2009 was 10.3 per cent (2008:  9.2 per cent).  The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.  Changes in selling prices and direct costs 
are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ﬂ ow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and 
extrapolates cash ﬂ ows for the following 17 years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5 per cent.  The rate does not exceed the average long 
term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Other intangible assets comprise mainly the of value ascribed to the brand and customer lists acquired as part of the Deuchem acquisition.  
The customer list is being amortised over a useful economic life of ten years.

Environmental provisions relate to manufacturing and distribution sites including certain sites no longer owned by the Group.  These provisions 
have been derived using a discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology and reﬂ ect the extent to which it is probable that expenditure will be incurred 
over the next 20 years.  
Included within the closing balance relating to the Chromium UK closure,  is £14.3 million of anticipated environmental costs.  These have been 
excluded from the environmental provision category in order to facilitate understanding of the overall cost of the Chromium UK closure.
Self insurance provisions at 31 December 2009 represent the aggregate of outstanding claims plus a projection for losses that may not yet have 
been reported.  The self insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within ﬁ ve years.

At 31 December 2009 the full amount of ACT previously written-off,  available for offset against future UK proﬁ ts,  was £26.5 million (2008:  £25.8 million).  
Additional tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised were £65.3 million (2008:  £47.1 million).  
Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable proﬁ ts from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.  Where this is not the case,  deferred tax assets have not been recognised.  
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas‘ subsidiaries.  As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group,  no tax 
is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.  There are no signiﬁ cant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in 
subsidiaries and associates.

22  Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of ﬁ nancial instruments:
�
 credit risk,
�
 liquidity risk,
�
 market risk.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.  The Group’s 
risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group,  to set appropriate risk limits and controls,  and to 
monitor risks and adherence to limits.  Risk management policies and systems are reviewed reguarly to reﬂ ect changes in market conditions and 
the Group’s activities.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and 
reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.  The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in 
its oversight role by Internal Audit.  Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures,  the 
results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,  
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.  The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base,  including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate,  has less of an inﬂ uence on credit risk.  
No single customer accounts for a signiﬁ cant proportion of the Group’s revenue and geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 
offered.  The Group’s review includes external ratings,  where available,  and in some cases bank references.  Purchase limits are established for 
each customer,  which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.  Customers that fail to meet the 
Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.  
The main components of this allowance are a speciﬁ c loss component that relates to individually signiﬁ cant exposures,  and a collective loss 
component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identiﬁ ed.  The collective loss 
allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating of at least 
A1 from Standard & Poor’s and A from Moody’s.  Given these high credit ratings,  management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet 
its obligations. 62 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009

22  Financial risk management (continued)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due.  The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure,  as far as possible,  that it will always have sufﬁ cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due,  under both normal and stressed 
conditions,  without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.  The Group’s funding policy is to have committed 
borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.  At the year end the 
Group had £79.0 million (2008:  £70.4 million) of undrawn committed facilities,  which expire after more than one year but within 2 years.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices,  such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates,  will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of ﬁ nancial instruments.  The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within 
acceptable parameters,  whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business,  and also incurs ﬁ nancial liabilities,  in order to manage market risks.  All such 
transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales,  purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective 
functional currencies of Group entities,  primarily the Euro and the US Dollar.  The Group hedges approximately 50 per cent of current and forecast 
trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a non-sterling currency.  The Group’s hedging policy will be re-assessed when it adopts the 
US Dollar as its reporting currency in 2010.  The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk,  most with a maturity of less 
than one year from the reporting date.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash ﬂ ows generated by the underlying operations of the Group,  primarily 
US Dollar.  This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.  In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies,  the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot 
rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.  The Group’s investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US Dollar denominated 
drawdowns under the syndicated facility,  which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of subsidiary’s net assets.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to borrow at both ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest proﬁ le.  
The policy does not require that a speciﬁ c proportion of the Group’s borrowings are at ﬁ xed rates of interest.
Other market price risk 
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations.  Management 
monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.  The primary goal of the Group’s 
investment strategy is to maximise investment returns in order to meet partially the Group’s unfunded beneﬁ t obligations;  management is 
assisted by external advisers in this regard.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sale requirements;  such contracts are 
not settled net. Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information
 Annual report and accounts 2009 Elementis plc   63
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor,  creditor and market conﬁ dence and to sustain future 
development of the business.  The Board of directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders,  as well as the return on capital,  
which the Group deﬁ nes as total shareholders’  equity,  excluding minority interests,  and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Group’s savings related share option schemes.  At present,  
employees hold 0.3 per cent of ordinary shares,  or 3.1 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.  
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages 
and security afforded by a sound capital position.  The Group’s target is to achieve a return on shareholders’  equity of between 10 and 15 per cent;  
in 2009 the return was negative 14.0 per cent (2008:  11.2 per cent).  In comparison the weighted average interest expense on interest-bearing 
borrowings (excluding liabilities with imputed interest) was 2.0 per cent (2008:  3.5 per cent).

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reﬂ ects the signiﬁ cance of the inputs used in making the 
measurements:
Level 1:  Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2:  Valuation techniques based on observable inputs,  either directly or indirectly.
Level 3:  Valuation techniques using signiﬁ cant unobservable inputs.
The following summarises the signiﬁ cant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of ﬁ nancial instruments reﬂ ected in the 
table above.
Derivatives (level 1)
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price,  if available.  If a listed market price is not available,  then fair 
value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of 
the contract using a risk-free interest (based on government bonds).
Non-derivatives ﬁ nancial liabilities (level 2)
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ﬂ ows,  discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
reporting date. 68 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009
22  Financial risk management (continued)
Trade and other receivables (level 3)
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ﬂ ows,  discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash ﬂ ows,  where applicable,  are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus 
an adequate constant credit spread,  and were as follows:
        2009 2008
        per cent per cent
Derivatives        4.1 3.7

        2009 2008
        £million £million
Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year    2.4 2.1
At the balance sheet date,  the Group had outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases,  which fall due as follows:
        2009 2008
        £million £million
Within one year        0.4 0.6
In the second to ﬁ fth years inclusive       4.1 3.5
After ﬁ ve years        1.6 0.3
        6.1 4.4
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties,  plant and machinery.  Leases have varying terms 
and renewal rights.
24  Retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement beneﬁ t plans providing retirement beneﬁ ts for the majority of 
employees and executive directors.  The main schemes in the UK,  US and the Netherlands are of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t type,  the beneﬁ t being 
based on number of years of service and either the employee’s ﬁ nal remuneration or the employee’s average remuneration during a period of 
years before retirement.  The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the 
Group balance sheet.  In addition the Group operates an unfunded post-retirement medical beneﬁ t (“PRMB”) scheme in the US.  The entitlement 
to these beneﬁ ts is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2005 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2009 for the US and Netherlands 
schemes.  The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2009 for inclusion within this Annual Report.  The assumed life 
expectancies on retirement are:

The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 6.25 per cent (2008:  6.25 per cent) per annum and a health care cost trend of 
10.0 per cent (2008:  10.0 per cent) and 11.0 per cent (2008:  11.0 per cent) per annum for claims pre age 65 and post age 65 respectively reducing 
to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2017 (2008:  4.5 per cent).  Actuarial valuations of retirement beneﬁ t plans in other jurisdictions have not been 
updated for IAS19 purposes because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.

25  Share based payments
The Company has several share option schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
The 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which senior management below Board level are granted options 
to purchase shares in the Company.  The option price is the average market price over the ﬁ ve working days preceding the grant and there is no 
discount.  Options are capable of exercise after three years and within ten years of the date of the grant;  those granted since 1995 are subject to 
earnings per share performance targets.  Although this 1998 scheme only expired in 2008,  it was replaced by the 2003 scheme that year and no 
options have been granted under the 1998 scheme since 2002.  However,  a small number of options remain outstanding under the 1998 scheme.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which executive directors and senior managers below Board level are 
granted options to purchase shares in the Company.  The option price is the market price of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding 
the day on which the option is granted with no discount applied.  Options are capable of exercise after three years,  subject to earnings per share 
and total shareholder return performance targets being met,  and within ten years of the date of the grant.
The 1998 and 2008 UK Savings-Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which UK employees can enter into savings contracts with a 
building society or a bank for a period of three or ﬁ ve years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company 
on the exercise of their options.  The option price is the average market price over the ﬁ ve working days preceding the invitation date discounted 
by a maximum of 20 per cent.  The 1998 scheme expired in 2008,  although options are still outstanding under that scheme,  and was replaced by 
the 2008 scheme.
The 2000 and 2008 US Savings-Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which US employees can enter into savings contracts with 
a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their 
options.  The option price is the market price on the date of the grant,  discounted by 15 per cent.  The 2000 scheme expired in 2008,  although 
options are still outstanding under that scheme,  and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model.  The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations 
are as follows:  
        2009 2008
Fair value per option (pence)        10.5 23.9
Expected volatility (per cent)        49.0 35.0
Risk free rate (per cent)        1.8 4.5
Expected dividend yield (per cent)        5.0 3.6
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous ﬁ ve years.  The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted,  based on management’s best estimate,  for the effects of non-transferability,  exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.  The Group recognised total expenses of £0.6 million (2008:  £0.8 million) related to equity-settled share based 
payment transactions during the year including the LTIP award in 2008.
The table overleaf shows all outstanding options granted under the executive and savings related share option schemes.
The Company made a one-off grant of awards in 2008 under the long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) in 2008 and awards were made to four senior 
executives.  Details of these awards are set out on page 33 of the Directors’  remuneration report.  The LTIP awards were valued using the binomial 
method and an IFRS 2 expense of £0.3 million (2008:  £0.3 million) was recognised. Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information

30  Acquisitions
On 24 December 2009 the Group acquired substantially all of the trading assets of the Fanning Corporation and Fancor Ltd for a cash consideration 
of £5.6 million.  Fancor is one of the largest North American suppliers of lanolin and lanolin derivatives and will expand the Group’s presence in the 
personal care market.
Because of the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end,  a detailed fair value exercise has yet to be performed.  Using book values at the 
acquisition date the acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:
         Book value 
         at acquisition
         £million
Inventory         1.2
Trade receivables         0.9
Trade payables         (1.4)
         0.7
Goodwill         4.9
Consideration paid,  satisﬁ ed in cash        5.6
A purchase price allocation and fair value exercise will be performed in 2010 in order to identify the fair values of assets acquired to the Group,  
including potentially intangible assets relating,  for example,  to brand.  In the meantime,  the difference between consideration paid and net 
value acquired has been allocated to goodwill.
The estimated contribution of Fancor to the results of the Group,  had the acquisition been made on 1 January 2009,  is as follows:
         2009
         £million
Revenue         7.9
Operating proﬁ t         1.4
On 1 July 2008 the Group acquired all the shares of Deuchem Co.,  Ltd,  a Taiwan based company,  for a cash consideration of £38.5 million.  
Deuchem is a leading supplier of additives and resins to the coating and related industries,  with manufacturing and technical facilities in 
Taiwan and China.
On 8 July 2008 the Group set up a new business with Anji County Yu Hong Clay Chemicals Co.,  Ltd for the production of organoclays in China.  
The Group holds 80 per cent of the shares in the entity,  which is treated as a subsidiary.  Cash consideration paid was £2.6 million.

30  Acquisitions (continued)
The consideration for the acquisitions,  which included professional fees and incidental expenses of £1.1 million,  was allocated against identiﬁ ed 
net assets with the remaining balance recorded as goodwill.  The goodwill recognised on acquisition reﬂ ects both the capabilities of the 
acquired entities’  personnel and the synergistic opportunities going forward,  neither of which can be allocated to an identiﬁ able intangible 
asset.  Following a review in 2009 of the provisional fair value adjustments made in 2008,  a fair value adjustment of £0.4 million was made in 
respect of obsolete stock which has resulted in an increase in goodwill of £0.4 million.
Acquisitions made during 2008 contributed £20.2 million to the Group’s revenue,  £0.5 million to the operating proﬁ t before intangible 
amortisation and £0.1 million to the operating proﬁ t after amortisation.
The estimated contribution of Deuchem to the results of the Group,  had the acquisition been made on 1st January 2008,  and assuming that the 
fair value adjustments that arose on acquisition would have been the same at the earlier date,  are as follows:
         2008
         £million
Revenue         45.4
Operating proﬁ t before intangible amortisation        (0.2)
Operating proﬁ t after intangible amortisation        (0.9)
31  Contingent liabilities
As is the case with other chemical companies,  the Group regularly receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters.  
A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,  and it is probable 
that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation.  Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and 
that the probability of a material outﬂ ow is remote,  the Group would not disclose a contingent liability.  No contingent liability is considered 
to be reportable as at 31 December 2009.  While the risk of any individual claim faced by the Group leading to a material outﬂ ow is considered 
remote,  a ﬁ nding of liability in one proceeding may lead to additional litigation risks,  at which time a provision may be recognised or a 
contingent liability disclosed.  Company overview Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information

Share based payments
The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised 
as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value 
is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.  
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial 
model,  taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options were granted.  The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reﬂ ect the actual number of share options that vest except 
where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold 
for vesting.  
 
Classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of FRS 25,  ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the 
Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the 
following two conditions:
a)   they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to 
deliver cash or other ﬁ nancial assets or to exchange ﬁ nancial 
assets or ﬁ nancial liabilities with another party under conditions 
that are potentially unfavourable to the Company;  and
b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s 
own equity instruments,  it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own 
equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a ﬁ xed amount of cash or other ﬁ nancial 
assets for a ﬁ xed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that the deﬁ nition is not met,  the proceeds of issue are 
classiﬁ ed as a ﬁ nancial liability.  Where the instrument so classiﬁ ed 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares,  the amounts 
presented in these ﬁ nancial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with ﬁ nancial liabilities are dealt with 
as part of interest payable and similar charges.  Finance payments 
associated with ﬁ nancial instruments that are classiﬁ ed as part 
of shareholders’  funds,  are dealt with as appropriations in the 
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’  funds.
1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
ﬁ nancial statements,  except as noted below.
Basis of preparation
The Company’s ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the 
historical cost accounting rules.  Under section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its 
proﬁ t and loss account.  As the Company’s voting rights are controlled 
within the Group headed by Elementis plc,  the Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not 
disclosed transactions or balances with wholly owned entities which 
form part of the Group.  
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the 
contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the proﬁ t 
and loss account.
Investments 
Investments in Group undertakings are included in the balance sheet 
at cost or,  if lower,  directors’  valuation.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’  funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised 
as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.  
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the 
notes to the ﬁ nancial statements.  
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts
The Company participates in the Elementis Group deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension scheme.  The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Company.  The Company is unable to identify its share of 
the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and 
reasonable basis and as required by FRS 17,  it has treated the scheme 
as if it were a deﬁ ned contribution scheme.  As a result,  the amount 
charged to the proﬁ t and loss account represents the contributions 
payable for the year.
Taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting,  in respect of all 
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date,  except as otherwise required by FRS 19.  Advance 
corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation 
tax is carried forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable 
within debtors as appropriate.
2 Proﬁ t for the ﬁ nancial year attributable to shareholders
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006,  the 
Company has not presented its own proﬁ t and loss account.  A loss of 
£0.6 million (2008:  £3.0 million) is dealt with in the ﬁ nancial statements 
of the Company.

6 Retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The Company is a member of a multi-employer pension scheme providing beneﬁ ts based on ﬁ nal pensionable pay.  Because the Company is 
unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis,  as permitted by FRS 17 “Retirement beneﬁ ts” ,  
the scheme has been accounted for as if the scheme was a deﬁ ned contribution scheme.  The net deﬁ cit in the scheme at 31 December 2009 
was £43.1 million (2008:  £12.7 million).
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 September 2005 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 December 2009 by a qualiﬁ ed 
actuary.  The contribution for the year was £0.1 million (2008:  £0.1 million).
Details of a guarantee given by the Company in respect of current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension 
scheme are set out in Note 10 in the Company’s ﬁ nancial statements. 82 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2009

issue.  The Board has no current plans to issue more redeemable B shares and information for the calculation of capital gains tax can be found on

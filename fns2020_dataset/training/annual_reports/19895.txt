*Approximately half of the beds are let to key workers in London 2003 was a year of substantial
progress in building our platform,
such that we are now
approaching an appropriate level
of scale to enable us to focus
greater attention on increasing
returns, reducing costs and
improving quality standards, 
in products and services.
By September 2004, we will be
serving the accommodation
needs of over 26,000 students in
28 cities, an increase of over 75%
since January 2003. T aking into
account our investments over this
period, we consider that the
business is, as planned, now
reaching a scale commensurate
with its infrastructure. As a result
the Board now intends to move
the emphasis of its strategy away
from the debt funded annual roll
out of a targeted number of beds
to focus on optimising the value
of UNITE's unique portfolio. 
This will be done through
maximising the rental potential of
our properties; through focusing
future developments on those
cities where we consider the
opportunities within a balanced
portfolio to be most attractive;
and through seeking funding
opportunities other than
straightforward debt ﬁnance, for
example through selective asset
disposals and joint ventures. In
line with our market opportunity
our annual roll out programme will
still be signiﬁcant; in addition to
the 5,104 bed spaces to be
delivered in 2004, we anticipate a
similar number being delivered in
2005. We believe that this
strategy will provide the most
attractive returns to shareholders
over time.
An important objective in 2003
was to put in place the ﬁnal
elements of funding for our
development programme, without
further recourse to equity markets.
I am pleased to report that this
was achieved. With the recent
establishment of a new £100
million warehouse facility in
addition to our existing borrowing,
UNITE is now fully funded to build
out and reﬁnance its development
commitments. In light of this
increase in bank facilities and the
lower capital requirements of our
revised strategy, the Board does
not consider it necessary to
undertake a major capital
recycling transaction at this time.
We remain committed to the
undertaking made at the time of
the last equity fund raising in 2002
not to raise further equity to
ﬁnance expansion.
With our large and increasing
customer base, UNITE's mission
has evolved to becoming the ﬁrst
choice in the student
accommodation market. T o that
end, we have set out three
imperatives on which to be
judged, namely to provide:
■ our customers with great value
and service;
■ our people with challenging,
meaningful and rewarding
careers; and
■ our shareholders with
continually improving 
ﬁnancial returns.
A clear strategy to maximise
the value of our portfoilio

Financial Results
Against the background of stable
growth, I am pleased to report an
encouraging improvement in our
ﬁnancial performance over the year.
Net asset value increased by 5.6%
to 302 pence per share (2002: 286
pence), with uplifts from our
development activity contributing
£32.3 million (29.8 pence per
share). Our completed portfolio is
now worth £788.3 million, with a
further £160.5 million in the course 
of development.
Built out, the portfolio will be worth
approximately £1.3 billion. From a
valuation perspective, the initial
yield applied to our completed
portfolio has increased to an
average of 6.61%, up from 6.20%
a year ago, and is now higher than
the reference Investment Property
Databank initial yield for the entire
property sector of 6.55% at 
31 December 2003.
Losses in 2003 (before goodwill
amortisation) fell sharply to £5.2
million from £20.2 million in 2002,
representing a loss per share of
4.8 pence (2002: 23.6 pence).
Importantly, the proﬁt generated
by our portfolio, after servicing
interest, increased by 255% to
£3.9 million, driven largely by an
increase in both rents and margin.
Rental income increased strongly
by 48% to £48.1 million (2002:
£32.4 million) with like for like
revenues up 7.6%, and the
portfolio operating margin
increased to 60.5% (2002: 58.8%)
with related overheads static at
£6.1 million. Occupancy across
the portfolio at the year end 
was 96%.
New borrowing associated with
portfolio growth contributed to the
increase in net interest costs to
£25.2 million (2002: £17.6 million).
Pre-contract costs fell to 
£3.7 million (2002: £6.2 million)
following a scaling back of
development resource in October
2002. Finally, goodwill of 
£5.6 million has been amortised
through the proﬁt and loss
account (2002: £5.5 million); 
the remaining goodwill relating to
development proﬁts will be
amortised in 2004.
Dividend
In line with our stated policy, the
Board is pleased to recommend a
ﬁnal dividend of 1.67 pence per
share, making a total dividend of
2.5 pence per share for the year
(2002: 2.5 pence). The dividend
will be paid on 14 May 2004 to
shareholders on the register on 
16 April 2004.
Business Performance
The UNITE team delivered 6,437
new beds across 17 properties
and in 13 cities in the autumn of
2003, increasing the number of
operating beds to 21,215 in 28 Chairman’s statement   07
cities. The 2003 property openings
proved to be the greatest
challenge yet faced by the
business, which few similar
organisations could have
contemplated. There were lessons
to be learnt from this signiﬁcant
programme of openings, which
are being incorporated into our
processes for 2004 and beyond.
As an increasing proportion of our
portfolio is now direct let, we have
been strengthening our sales
team to market our
accommodation much earlier in
the year. We have also been
investing in the continuous
improvement of our systems for
handling larger volumes, as well
as in strengthening our ﬁeld based
teams to undertake more work in-
house; the aim is to achieve
consistent improvements in
services and costs. The
Accommodation Services Division
is already delivering improvements
in margin upon which we will
continue to build.
As the market leader, we focus
particular attention on
understanding our customers.
Following recent research, 
a number of initiatives are 
being taken to improve 
services and facilities within 
our accommodation.
Like all companies in our sector,
build cost inﬂation is an important
issue, which we have clear plans
to address. As we have a
reasonably standard range of
products, compared with much of
the industry, we are better placed
than many to address these
issues. We have continued
successfully to develop
partnerships with construction
contractors, consultants and other
providers, with the aim of
addressing cost, quality and
speed of delivery, largely through
better on and off site processes
and reduced material costs. 
Our manufacturing facility is
already demonstrating material
cost savings, and produced 1,500
units during the year, with weekly
production rates increasing from
ﬁve modules in January to 50
modules by the year end. 
As production volumes increase
we expect to beneﬁt from greater
build cost savings, both at the
factory and on site.
The Board and People
The Board made a number of
important appointments during the
year. Mark Allan, who has been
with the Company for over four
years, was promoted to
Group Finance Director when
Simon Bernstein stepped down.
We are grateful to Simon for his
energetic and diligent input at an
important stage in UNITE's history.
Andrew Lee, our Human
Resources Director since 2001,
also joined the Board, conﬁrming
the importance we attach to the
development of our people in what
is an increasingly customer
orientated business.
After the year end, Stuart Beevor, a
member of the Board and Group
Fund Management Director of
Grosvenor Group Limited, joined
the Board as a Non-Executive
Director, bringing a breadth of
knowledge of the property
industry. Stuart takes the place of
Baroness Usha Prashar, who
retired after the completion of her
three-year term of appointment.
We thank Usha for her wise
counsel and sense of balance in
encouraging the Company to
pursue clear commercial and
public service objectives.
With UNITE's increasing scale, a
greater level of accountability and
appropriate resource was
successfully transferred to our
operating divisions, namely
Development, Manufacturing and
Accommodation Services. At this
point we would like to recognise
all our people. There is signiﬁcant
energy for personal development,
delivery for our customers and
teamwork and we warmly
appreciate the dedication 
and commitment of everyone 
in the business.
Prospects
During 2003, signiﬁcant progress
was made in establishing a
platform of sufﬁcient scale to
enable us to be fully cost and
service competitive in our target
markets. Our portfolio is beginning
to see the beneﬁts of scale and
operating proﬁts are improving as
a result.
Looking forward, the Group will be
moving away from a purely debt-
funded capital expenditure
programme and is beginning to
explore other effective sources of
capital. Our investment decisions
will be driven by the creation of
shareholder value for the long
term and, with a strengthened
team and stable ﬁnancing base,
we have every conﬁdence of
achieving our objectives and
moving into proﬁt. We entered 2003 with a clear
objective to deliver scale in our
portfolio. With 6,437 new beds
we achieved that target,
delivering more new student
beds than all other specialist
providers combined. This has
delivered a genuine platform of
scale upon which we will
continue to build. We will no
longer set speciﬁc bed number
targets, but we will concentrate
upon the quality of the products
and services which our
customers demand.
The market in which we operate
has been in sharp focus
throughout the year. On the
demand side, acceptances for
university and college places
were up by 1.7% on average for
2003/04, with overseas student
numbers increasing by 30%.
Over the past ﬁve years,
compound growth has been over
5%, although a number of
universities have performed
appreciably better than this
average – for example, the city of
Leeds has seen growth exeeding
20% in its student population
over the same period. Data such
as that is key to the formulation
of our investment policy.
In terms of accommodation
supply, competition for
appropriate development sites
within our chosen markets
remains intense, whilst build cost
increases continue to outpace
inﬂation. We have continued to
concentrate on implementing
measures to combat these
changes, to ensure we secure
the right sites, at the right time,
for the right price.

Portfolio performance
This year, the Accommodation
Services team handled our largest
number of new property openings
to date. 6,437 new beds across
17 properties in 13 cities were
opened in the Autumn of 2003
with the division now managing
21,215 beds across 28 cities
nationwide. Opening 44% more
rooms than in 2002 with broadly
the same infrastructure has
placed demands on all parts of
the Division. Our teams have
demonstrated excellent teamwork
and dedication in meeting such a
demanding target and I thank
everyone involved for their
commitment to the growth of
our business.
The key deliverable for the
Division was to focus on returns,
substantially increasing portfolio
proﬁt. At £3.9 million for the year,
against £1.1 million in 2002, this
was emphatically achieved.
Rental income increased strongly
by 48% to £48.1 million (2002:
£32.4m) and overheads were
held at £6.1million.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review   09 Rental growth was again strong.
Average increases for the same
room on the same tenancy terms
was 3.7% across the estate
although, by improving asset
utilisation over the summer
months, like for like revenues
were, in fact, 7.6% higher
than those for 2002.
An important advancement
during 2003 has been the
increased number of longer, 50+
week tenancies across our direct
let estate. This maximises asset
utilisation and offers students a
year-round option (particularly
meeting demand from overseas
and post graduate students).
16% of our portfolio was let on
these longer tenancies in 2003.
Customer Service
Our approach is directed ﬁrst and
foremost by our customers and
we are committed to improving
our customer service and care.
Market research has always
played a vital role for UNITE and
this year we will continue to use
the invaluable research from the
UNITE Student Living Report,
conducted by MORI. Combined
with this, we have a regular
customer research programme
which is helping us to better
understand the broader student
market and identify continuous
improvement opportunities, which
reﬂect customer demand 
and aspiration.
Broadband is one such
opportunity. During 2003, we
undertook a full review of our
communications package for
customers. As a result, we intend
to introduce a comprehensive
new broadband package, which
will be announced later in 2004.
We will also be launching more
frequent payment options to help
our customers spread the cost of
accommodation according to
their needs. Likewise we have set
up new processes, to make sure
that our customers receive
returned deposits more promptly. 
With an increased percentage of
our portfolio comprising direct let
properties, we are adding to our
sales team, who begin marketing

Leisure room, Buchanan View, Glasgow our accommodation and services
from January each year. In this
way we aim to facilitate customer
choice for earlier room
reservations. Recommendation is
also a powerful marketing tool
and results from our independent
research suggest that some 80%
of our customers said that they
would recommend UNITE. We
intend to make the most of this
during 2004 by incentivising
recommendations which translate
into bookings. 
Managing the growth of the
business on our existing
operating platform is testimony to
the careful planning which has
taken place during the past few
years. However, in recognising
that Accommodation Services
has a much larger footprint, the
ﬁnal part of the divisional
reorganisation has been the
appointment of a senior team of
Operations Directors. These
internal promotions are evidence
of our commitment to improving
our service to customers and
university partners by ensuring a
senior dedicated resource to lead
the training and development
required in the ﬁeld. In managing
over 21,000 rooms during 2003
we have also expanded our call
centre and improved training to
handle ﬂuctuations in demand.
The team handles some 200,000
calls per year. This investment in
the continuous improvement of
our systems will remain a theme
for 2004.
Working towards our objective of
improved customer service, we
have strengthened our area
management team and increased
in house maintenance resources.
This will allow us to provide a
more responsive service; and
realise further economies of scale
and greater shareholder returns.
Growing our portfolio
In Autumn 2003, UNITE
completed 6,437 new beds in 13
cities, ﬁve of which were new
markets where UNITE opened
accommodation for the very ﬁrst
time. In 2004, UNITE will
commission some 5,000 new
beds, all of which are located
within UNITE’s existing markets.
By the end of 2004, there will be
11 cities in which we operate over
1,000 beds. T ogether, those cities
will account for 70% of the total
completed portfolio – a clear
demonstration of the scale we are
beginning to build.
Even in our largest markets we
have not yet reached market
saturation point, leaving
considerable scope for future
growth. More importantly there
are a number of established
university cities, with large student
populations, where we do not yet
have scale of 1,000 plus beds.
Hence there are many
opportunities for future investment.
The unprecedented scale of our
2003 deliveries resulted in
considerable pressures, delaying
the opening of some beds,
particularly in Liverpool. The costs
associated with resolving these
issues have been charged to the
proﬁt and loss account and action
plans have been developed to
help minimise the risk of a
recurrence in the future.
According to UNITE’s business
cycle, the ﬁnal quarter of 2003 and
the ﬁrst two quarters of 2004
represent the principal acquisition
phase for projects to be opened in
2005. Although the supply of
appropriate development
opportunities remains competitive,
we are targeting those towns and
cities where we consider the
Group can take advantage of the
market opportunity.

Production Output
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
We are helped in this endeavour
by our increasing expertise in
planning and design and, in that
respect, the team has accrued
signiﬁcant experience with the
planning authorities in our core
towns and cities. In 2003 we
achieved 17 planning consents.
With our roll-out programme in
place, we will procure some £165
million worth of construction
services in 2004. In working to
mitigate build cost inﬂation, it is
important to facilitate close, non
adversarial business
relationships with our contractors
and consultants. In Scotland, our
partnership with Carillion was
particularly beneﬁcial, enabling
the timely completion of a
signiﬁcant scheme delayed by
the receivership of the initial non-
partner contractor.
On an organisational level, the
planned strengthening of our
regional project management
and ﬁnance resources, has been
completed. UNITE’s team of
project managers, who oversee
the construction projects from
start to ﬁnish, have been
integrated more closely with our
modular construction operation
to further improve lead-times and
communication, continually
driving down build costs and
enhancing product quality.
Modular Construction 
Our investment in modular
construction is playing an
important role in our campaign to
counter build cost inﬂation,
improve completion schedules
and control quality. The division
has achieved important
milestones in its ﬁrst full year of
operation, having established an
advanced manufacturing facility,
which aims to radically change
the approach to off-site
manufacturing within the UK.
Production at the facility began in
January 2003, steadily increasing
its productivity to over 50 fully
ﬁtted bedroom units per week. A
total of 1,500 units were produced
by the end of the year.
The ﬁrst building using this
advanced modular technology,
St Martins House, Leicester, was
opened in September 2003.
The 2004 pipeline features the
utilisation of modular
construction within schemes
located in Liverpool, Birmingham,
Bath and Plymouth.
Responding to the environment
of build cost inﬂation, our key
priorities for the manufacturing
and project management teams
are to increase production in line
with internal targets, and further
improve our supply chain
process. In so doing, we will
seek to improve relationships
and communications with
contractors to ultimately deliver
reductions in build time and cost
combined with improving quality.

2004 will mark another year of
sustained growth, achieving
genuine scale in many of our core
markets. In many ways we have
now ‘grown’ into the business
infrastructure we have put into
place during the last two years
and the focus of our activities
going forward must now shift.
2004 will see us focus on
maximising the return from our
existing portfolio, as well as
ensuring that the schemes in
which we invest are well located
and will add shareholder value for
the long term.
Evolution of our ﬁnance strategy
is another key step in the
progress of the business. We
intend not only to borrow against
strong existing investments to
fund further growth, but also to
have a range of ﬁnancing
solutions available which offer a
greater degree of ﬂexibility and
do not hinder the ﬁnancial
performance of existing assets.
2004 is already proving to be an
exciting year, building on the
themes of stability and growth.
Our mission is to enhance our
position as the ﬁrst choice provider
of student accommodation
through a total commitment to our
customers and our people, which
together will deliver greater
shareholder returns.

Our people
Personal development is
encouraged through extensive
training and development
activities. During 2003 that
included the development of ﬁrst
line and senior management
leadership programmes with year
long interventions. Core
management competencies have
been developed to ensure that the
senior management team has the
skills to select, develop, recognise

The correlation between

increasing shareholder returns.
As at 31 December 2003 the
Group had 643 employees across
its three Divisions and central
support teams. The proportion of
employees with over one year’s
service has increased by 7% to
58% during 2003. 
UNITE also conducted its third
annual employee opinion survey. 
The results maintained an overall
employee satisfaction score of
60% and we have developed a
further detailed programme of
actions to improve these results as
part of our focus on customers,
people and shareholders.
The priorities for 2004 will be
focused on supporting the
continuous development and
succession of the senior teams
and creating the environment to
breed sucess. We will continue
our Group-wide evolution towards
becoming a truly customer
focused organisation, aligning
processes, systems and
behaviours to deliver our strategic
objectives and improve
shareholder returns.
UNITE is committed to providing
equal opportunities to all
employees regardless of age,
gender, race, religion, ethnic
origin, sexual orientation or
disability. We also make our
social, environmental and ethical
responsibilities clear. Business
risks in these areas have been
evaluated as follows:

UNITE fully recognises the
importance of health and safety
and risk management in all 
its operations. 
UNITE strives to:
■ Ensure timely and effective
communications on matters
necessary to ensure the
health and safety of 
its employees.
■ Exceed minimum legislative 
requirements.
■ Provide adequate training to 
maintain the competencies
of employees.
■ Provide adequate resources 
to ensure a robust safety 
management system.
■ Work with partners,
contractors and service
providers to ensure 
health and safety is
appropriately managed.
■ Proactively manage 
signiﬁcant ﬁre risks.
In 2002 an independent audit
was undertaken to examine
compliance issues and to identify
areas in which Group’s health
and safety and risk management
procedures could improve. As a
result of that audit, the following
initiatives were implemented:
■ The Development Division
included consideration of
health and safety issues as
part of its evaluation of 
potential acquisitions.
■ The Accommodation Services
Division introduced
campaigns to reduce
unintended ﬁre alarm
activations and educate 
our customers.
■ The Manufacturing Division
appointed a full time Health
and Safety Ofﬁcer.
A further audit was
commissioned in 2003, the
results of which indicate a
signiﬁcant improvement, and are
testimony to UNITE’s
commitment to continual
improvement. Nevertheless,
UNITE is not complacent and
continues to look for ways to
build upon its success.

UNITE’s life as a quoted
company during which its
signiﬁcant development
programme was ﬁnanced without
recourse to the equity markets.
With ﬁnancial results unaffected
by share issuance, net asset
value per share rose by 5.6% to
302 pence (2002: 286 pence) and
is now higher than at the time of
the Group’s last, dilutive, share
placing in August 2002. We
remain committed to funding our
continued expansion by means
other than share issues. 
Our investment portfolio
At 31 December 2003 our
completed portfolio comprised
21,215 beds across 85 properties
and was independently valued at
£788.3 million. Including
development properties when
built out, the portfolio will be worth
approximately £1.3 billion. The
table on page 18 sets out, for the
ﬁrst time, details of the Group’s
completed portfolio together with
those projects scheduled for
delivery in 2004; a total of 26,319
beds across 28 cities.
Encouragingly the defensive, non-
cyclical characteristics of the
student sector, and its unique
rental growth record are beginning
to achieve a higher proﬁle in the
Real Estate sector at large and
growing interest in the residential
sector is also adding to an
increasingly positive sentiment.
Nonetheless valuing a portfolio
such as ours remains challenging
– there is little, although increasing,
reference transactional evidence
and the operational and residential
aspects of the properties add
further complexity. 
With this in mind we appointed 
a new valuer in 2003, CBRE, 
to work in conjunction with our
existing valuers, King Sturge 
and this has provided important
reassurance on the appropriate
valuation methodology.
Valuation yields across our
portfolio moved out during 2003.

Group Finance
Director’s report
2003 saw an important period of growth and stability for
UNITE, following the changing environment of the
previous twelve months. Operating proﬁts from our
portfolio increased by 53% to £29.1 million and pre-tax
losses (before goodwill amortisation) fell sharply to £5.2
million (2002: £20.2 million). 
that range due to near-term
reversionary factors. The equated
yield proﬁle of the portfolio is even
stronger, ranging from 7.0% to
11.0% and averaging 9.2%.
Proﬁt and loss account
Portfolio proﬁt (operating proﬁts
from our portfolio less interest
expense) increased by 255% to
£3.9 million for the year (2002: £1.1
million). Rental income for 2003
was £48.1 million, an increase over
2002 (restated to include a full year
of the Peabody UNITE joint
venture) of 48%. This reﬂects the
signiﬁcant increase in the number
of operational beds in our portfolio
– 14,778 were operational for the
full year, with a further 6,437 beds
being opened for the 2003/04
academic year. Importantly, we
were able to contain the Group’s
portfolio-related overhead to 
£6.1 million, despite this signiﬁcant
increase in operations, and
consequently our portfolio
operating margin improved to
60.5% from 58.8% in 2002.
New borrowing associated with
portfolio growth and the entirely
debt-funded development
programme contributed to an
increase in the Group’s net
interest charge before
exceptionals to £25.2 million for
the year (2002: £17.6 million).

Group Finance Director’s report   17 ■ £1.2 million of unrecovered
overhead relating to our
manufacturing facility which
was expensed in the ﬁrst half
of the year, as disclosed in 
our interim statement. 
All manufacturing overhead 
in the second half of the 
year was fully recovered
against increasing 
production volumes.
■ Pre-contract development
costs fell sharply to £3.7
million from £6.2 million in the
previous year, reﬂecting the
full year impact of the scaling
back of these activities
effected in October 2002.
■ £5.4 million of goodwill has
been amortised in relation to
development proﬁts.
After taking the above items into
account the Group reported a
basic loss per share of 10.0
pence, representing a signiﬁcant
improvement from the 30.0 pence
loss reported for 2002.
Capital expenditure
and ﬁnancing
Capital expenditure for 2003
totalled £218 million (2002: £190
million) and, as anticipated, was
funded purely through new
development debt and increased
borrowings against our
completed portfolio.
Consequently, gearing increased
to 182% from 133% at 31
December 2002.
Whilst our April 2002 securitisation
has demonstrated the ability of
our assets to sustain high levels
of debt, ﬁnancing our equity
contribution to new developments
purely through increasing
borrowing against completed
assets is initially dilutive to
earnings. As the Group sees early
stage scale in its portfolio, we are
beginning to explore other
sources of development capital
which are not as earnings dilutive.
However, interest cover improved
– net interest was covered 1.2
times by net rental income (2002:
1.1 times) and 0.9 times after
deducting corporate and
pre-contract development costs
(2002: 0.5).

2004 Completed Portfolio Notwithstanding such initiatives,
the Group remains very active in
the debt markets. During 2003,
the Group successfully arranged
£336 million of new bank facilities,
introducing four new lenders and
taking its overall bank facilities to
£731 million. Whilst the maximum
available loan to value ratios
under these facilities was
maintained, 2003 was generally a
more difﬁcult year for real estate
borrowers and the average
margin for our facilities increased
by approximately 20 basis points
when compared to earlier
borrowing. Despite this our overall
cost of debt fell to 6.3% as the
Group ﬁxed into historically low
long term swap rates.
Following the arrangement of
these new facilities, the Group
had £380 million of undrawn bank
facilities available to it at the year-
end, of which £180 million was
available for investment
properties. This headroom is
sufﬁcient to fully reﬁnance those
projects scheduled for completion
in 2004 and, with its existing
development facilities in place,
the Group is fully funded to meet
its development commitments.
Group Finance Director’s report   19
With our 2004 debt funding
requirements now fully in place
our attention is turning towards
requirements for 2005 and
beyond. With the ﬁrst of our
warehouse facilities scheduled for
repayment in July 2005, and the
ongoing requirement to reﬁnance
assets as they complete in order
to free up borrowing capacity for
continued development, we are
now exploring reﬁnancing options
for a proportion of our assets in
order to release capacity in the
bank markets.
In the past this has been
achieved through the
securitisation of income
generating assets and the
issuance of long-dated ﬁxed rate
bonds. We now consider this to
be only one of a number of
available alternatives, including
selective asset disposals, sale
and leaseback transactions and
other types of debt instruments,
all of which offer potential
solutions for the Group.
Looking forward
From a ﬁnance perspective, 2004
promises to be a challenging
and rewarding year for the
Group. Our portfolio is beginning
to see the beneﬁts of scale and
operating proﬁts are improving
as a result. The Group will be
moving away from a purely debt-
funded capital expenditure
programme and is beginning to
explore other effective sources of
capital. This is undoubtedly
helped in part by greater investor
interest in our sector, perhaps
fuelled by the potential
introduction of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (REITs) and a
greater understanding of
residential assets.
2004 will also see the quoted
Real Estate sector come to terms
with the implications of the
recently published International
Accounting Standards. They
promise a signiﬁcant shift in
ﬁnancial reporting methodology
for the whole sector and we are
currently examining the likely
impact on UNITE.
Finally, with a portfolio valued at
£1.3 billion when built out, an
increased focus on yield
enhancement will be important.
We will be examining our portfolio
closely and ensuring that, both
through existing holdings and
new developments, our capital is
put to work where it can earn the
best returns and add the greatest
shareholder value.
Foundry Court, Preston UNITE has been credited with
creating an entirely new asset
class for rented accommodation
which has shown itself resilient to
economic conditions. Within this
broad market context, we can
look to positive prospects ahead.
The numbers up!
Government policy appears set to
continue to drive increases in
student numbers. Furthermore
there is also early evidence that a
new inﬂux of prospective students
has applied to UK universities
from the European countries
joining the EU on 1 May 2004.
The Higher Education Policy
Institute suggests, in its research
‘Supply and Demand to 2010,’
that there could be a demand for
up to 250,000 more higher
education places from school
leavers qualiﬁed with two A-levels
by the end of the decade. 
Of those, 150,000 will arise from
demographic growth and the
remainder as a result of increases
in participation. This analysis has
not been challenged and is widely
regarded as the deﬁnitive
projection to the end of 
the decade. 
Furthermore, the University and
Colleges Admissions Services
(UCAS) ﬁgures show that the
number of full-time students
accepted by UK universities and
colleges in Autumn 2003 was up
by 1.7% on the previous year. 
A total of 374,307 applicants 
were accepted onto full-time
undergraduate courses 
compared with 368,115 in 2002. 
Overseas student numbers are
also increasing – up by 30% in
2001/02. Indeed, as well as an

Unlocking the potential

Market insight
The sector in which we operate could not have been more prominent in
recent months with high-level debates concerning the Higher Education Bill
and announcements from the Chancellor on stamp duty and REIT’s. Also of
signiﬁcance to UNITE is the Housing Bill, which proposes licensing of Houses
in Multiple Occupation and the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill,
which aims to speed up planning and also puts more emphasis on the
community consultation process. 
applications, the number of non-
EU international students
entering higher education rose by
a record 23% last year with the
intake from China and India up
by 80%. 
Will increasing debt deter
prospective students? The Higher
Education Bill introduces top-up
fees but abolishes the current 
up-front fee paying from 2006
allowing some ﬁnancial pressure
to be deferred and providing
more maintenance support. The
UNITE Student Living Report
2004, undertaken by MORI,
shows that students seem to be
roughly divided into two camps
regarding their attitudes towards
debt. One group is seriously
worried about the debts they will
incur during their time at
university, while the other camp is
putting off thinking about their

be that their acceptance of a
wider debt-based culture has 
also made this group slightly 
less sensitive to the cost of 
their education.
A worthwhile investment 
Despite high levels of debt,
almost all students think of
university as a worthwhile
investment. According to the 2004
UNITE Student Living Report, nine
in ten agree that the money they
are spending on their education is
a good investment in their future.
To help pay their way, two in ﬁve
of students work part-time,
earning an average of £83 per
week for an average 14 hours
work. The majority of students
(85%) also receive ﬁnancial
support from their parents 
and families.
Market dynamics
Student rented accommodation
has proved resilient to the
prevailing economic conditions,
with rental values demonstrating
steady increases over the last 20
years. However, an entirely robust
assessment of the situation
cannot be made due to the
changes in the nature of this
accommodation during this time.
Other factors for consideration
include build cost inﬂation and the
competitive market for suitable,
well-located sites. Those factors
continue to provide a challenging
context and signiﬁcant barriers to
entry for the provision of
affordable accommodation.
Impact on Student
Accommodation
The university sector has severely
limited resources with which to fund
the construction of new
accommodation, especially bearing
in mind its need to carry out some
£700m remedial work. It is therefore
unlikely that this will be a signiﬁcant
source of new developments to
suppress rental growth.
Market insight   21
Snow Island, Huddersﬁeld
This leaves the private sector to
manage supply. It is estimated
that professional landlords in the
private sector are providing 75%
of proposed new projects. For
smaller investors, the Housing Bill,
if and when enacted, could
represent another barrier to entry.
The Bill is due for debate in the
current parliamentary session and
includes the proposal for the
licensing of the vast majority of
Houses in Multiple Occupation.
Already in existence in Scotland,
its introduction in England would
affect a great deal of student
accommodation, subjecting
landlords to potentially  higher
costs and tighter regulations.
Understanding our market in
detail is central to our ability to
sense and respond to changes
ahead of time. For example, it is
acknowledged that there is
evidence of a trend towards more
students living at home, rather
than going away to study. Yet on
the other hand, there is a
recognition by universities that
living away from home enhances
the student experience and
increases satisfaction with
university life. Students, too,
believe that moving away is an
integral aspect of university life,
although one that absorbs a
signiﬁcant proportion of a
student’s budget. According to
the 2004 UNITE Student Living
Report, students who live at home
are less happy than those who
live away from home, perhaps
missing out on some important
elements of student life. Six in ten
students believe that those living
at home do not gain the full
beneﬁt of being a student. 22   The Board of Directors

Substantial Interests in the Share
Capital of the Company
As at 23 February 2004 those
shareholders, other than
Directors, who had notiﬁed the
Company of a disclosable interest
amounting to 3% or more of the
ordinary share capital of the
Company were as follows:
Donations
The Group made no political
donations during the course of
the year but made charitable
donations amounting to £50,000
to Uniaid Foundation 
(2002: £50,000).
Policy and Practice on Payment
of Creditors
During the year the Company
maintained its policy of agreeing
and abiding by supplier payment
terms. The Group has not
followed any recognised code for
payment practice. As at 31
December 2003, the Group’s
trade creditors were equivalent to
30 days’ purchases (2002: 30
days). The Company does not
have any trade creditors 
(2002: nil).
Health and Safety
The Group’s policy is to provide
and maintain safe and healthy
working conditions, equipment
and systems of work for all its
employees and to provide such
information, training and
supervision as they need for this
purpose. Further details of the
Group’s Health & Safety
Management System are set out
on page 15.
Employment Policies
The Company encourages
employee involvement and
consultation and places
emphasis on keeping its
employees informed of the
Group’s activities and ﬁnancial
performance. The UNITE Group
plc Approved Company Share
Option Scheme, The UNITE
Group plc Unapproved Share
Option Scheme and The UNITE
Group plc Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme are intended to
help develop employees’ interest
in the Company’s performance.
The Company operates a non-
discriminatory employment
policy. Full and fair consideration
is given to applicants for
employment from the disabled
where they have the appropriate
skills and abilities and to the
continued employment of staff
who become disabled. The
Company encourages the
continuous development and
training of its employees and the
provision of equal opportunities
for the training and career
development of disabled
employees. Further details of the
Group’s personal development
programme for employees are
set out on page 14, in the
section ‘Our people’.
Environmental and
Ethical policies
The Group has always
recognised the importance of
protecting and enhancing the
environment in which it operates
and is fully committed to
implementing and monitoring
policies reﬂecting the statement
set out below.
Shareholder Percentage of
share capital
Schroder Investment 7.26%
Management Limited
Fidelity International 5.42%
Limited/FRM Corp Limited
Canada Life 3.02%
Marketing Group
Legal & General 3.01%
Investment
Management Limited
In all aspects of its business, the Group
considers the impact of its activities on the
environment. It is concerned for the
environmental well being of the communities in
which it invests and complies with all relevant
environmental legislation and regulations. It
strives to protect the health and safety of its
employees and promotes environmental
awareness amongst them, its customers,
contractors, tenants and suppliers. 26   Directors’ report
Mr N A Porter, Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer of the Group, has
responsibility for ensuring that the
policy described above is
observed. The Board, as a whole,
regularly reviews implementation
of such policy and considers any
amendments thought necessary
or desirable.
Initiatives implemented include
the introduction of waste re-
cycling schemes at the Group’s
ofﬁce locations and at its
accommodation blocks. In
addition, the increasing use by
the Group of modular
construction has resuled in a
signiﬁcant reduction in waste,
compared with traditional
construction methods. 
The basic tenet of the 
UNITE Code of Ethics
(the full text of which can be
found on the Company’s web-
site), is that the Group seeks at all
times to conduct its business in
accordance with, and to ensure
that each of its employees and
directors adheres to, the highest
standards of business and
personal ethics. Employees,
customers and contractors of the
Group are all made aware of the
provisions of this Code.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 384 of
the Companies Act 1985, a
resolution for the re-appointment
of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of
the Company is to be proposed
at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of
the Company will be held at The
Herbert Morrison Room, London
Marriott Hotel, County Hall,
Westminster Bridge Road,
London SE1 7PB at 9.30 a.m. on
6 May 2004. Formal notice of the
meeting is given on page 59.
In addition to the ordinary
business of the meeting, an
1 Observing all local environmental control policies and relevant 
environmental regulations.
2 Reviewing all proposed developments to assess the presence of 
any contamination and the means of remediation, if required.
3 Inspecting all land and buildings owned by the Group to 
ascertain whether environmental damage has occurred or is at 
risk of occurring.
4 Informing tenants of good energy management practices.
In building, design and construction the following
measures are applied:
1 Re-developing brown-ﬁeld sites where practicable.
2 Striving to eliminate the use of materials containing CFC and 
HCFC as alternatives become available.
3 Conserving energy through improved insulation and the use of 
energy efﬁcient heating and lighting systems.
4 Specifying, where practicable, that building materials and 
furnishings come from sustainable sources.
5 Applying effective waste management procedures to ensure 
that developments do not cause an increase in air, water or
ground pollution.
6 Enhancing landscaping and external aspects in harmony with 
existing surroundings.
7 Adopting best health and safety at work practices.
8 Limiting nuisance from noise, dust and hazards.
9 Endeavouring to limit waste generation, discharges and 
emissions and handling wastes in a responsible manner.
10 Adopting measures to protect workers, visitors and the public 
from exposure to unacceptable risks and hazards.
In its internal operations, the Company will:
1 Be responsive to public attitudes and concerns.
2 Ensure all building, maintenance and service operations are 
optimised to save energy, water and waste.
3 Return used materials for re-cycling.
4 Ensure that Company vehicles are maintained regularly to reduce
exhaust emissions and economise on fuel usage.
5 Maintain a safe and healthy working environment for the well 
being of employees.
The statement on the previous page forms the framework of the Group’s environmental policy. The policy is implemented through:
ordinary resolution will be
proposed to authorise the
Directors to allot up to £9,024,796
in nominal value of the authorised
but unissued share capital of the
Company (representing one third
of the issued share capital of the
Company as at 23 March 2004).
The Board has no current
intention of exercising that
authority. A special resolution will
also be proposed to dis-apply
statutory pre-emption rights in
respect of the allotment of shares
for cash in connection with any
rights issue or other issue by way
of rights and otherwise up to an
aggregate nominal amount of
£1,353,719 (representing ﬁve per
cent of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at 23 March
2004). Again the Board has no
current intention of exercising 
that authority.
By order of the Board
A D Reid
Secretary
23 March 2004 Corporate governance
for the year ended 31 December 2003
However, responsibility for day to
day operations is delegated to the
Group’s Operations Board, which
comprises the Executive Directors
from the full Board, together with
the heads of each of the Group’s
operating Divisions, namely
Development, Accommodation
Services and Manufacturing. 
Terms of reference have been set
by the Board for its various
committees and for the Chairman
and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.
The terms of reference for the
Chairman and the Chief Executive
are such as to clearly establish
the division of responsibility
between the two roles. In
addition, all Directors have
access to the advice and services
of the Company Secretary, whilst
procedures are in place allowing
for individual Directors to take
independent legal advice at the
Company’s expense. Directors
attend relevant training
programmes, as appropriate.
The current Board complement
consists of three Executive
Directors, namely a Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer (Mr N A Porter),
a Group Finance Director (Mr M C
Allan) and Human Resources
Director (Dr A Lee), as well as the
Chairman (Mr G K Maddrell) and
two Non-Executive Directors
(Messrs N P Hall and S R H
Beevor). Mr Beevor was
appointed as an additional Non-
Executive Director on 1 March
2004, on which date Baroness
Prashar stepped-down as a Non-
Executive Director following the
expiration of her three year term
of appointment.
During the course of the year the
Company complied (except as
speciﬁcally set out below) with
the principles of best practice set
out in the Combined Code
issued by the Hampel
Committee on Corporate
Governance in June 1998
(the “Combined Code”).
Following the publication by the
Financial Reporting Council in
July 2003 of its new Combined
Code on Corporate Governance
(the "New Combined Code"), the
Company reviewed its corporate
governance procedures and set
out below is a summary of those
procedures, as amended in light
of the requirements of the New
Combined Code. Such
procedures were adopted by the
Board in October 2003.
Board of Directors
The Company’s corporate
governance procedures provide
that the full Board of Directors
shall meet at least six times a
year. During 2003 there were
nine meetings of the full Board,
all of which were attended by
each of the Directors then
appointed, other than two
meetings, one of which Baroness
Prashar was unable to attend,
whilst Mr D F Naish was unable
to attend one meeting.
The Board receives regular
reports from each of the Group’s
operating Divisions, but itself
retains full and effective control
of the Group’s activities, with a
formal schedule of matters
speciﬁcally reserved for decision
by the full Board. In particular, the
full Board sets the strategic
objectives, business plan and
annual budgets for the Group,
with major investment decisions
also requiring Board approval.
As a smaller company (i.e. one
that is outside the FTSE 350), the
Company meets the requirement
of the New Combined Code that
it should have at least two Non-
Executive Directors. However, in
view of the size of the Board, no
Director has been designated as
senior independent Non-
Executive Director and in that
respect, the Company does not
comply with the Combined Code
or the New Combined Code.
Each of the existing Non-
Executive Directors is
independent of management
and free from any personal,
business or other relationships
with the Group, save for the
receipt of Directors’ fees and
interests in shares of the
Company. However, Mr D F
Naish (who until 25 March 2003
was a Non-Executive Director of
the Company), was, until 31
October 2002, a partner in The
David Naish Partnership, to
which the Company paid fees (in
relation to tax advisory services)
of £110,000 in the year to 
31 December 2003.
Each of the Executive Directors
has a written service contract,
whilst each of the Non-Executive
Directors has a formal letter of
engagement. Executive Directors
have rolling contracts of
employment with twelve months
notice periods, whilst Non-
Executive Directors are
appointed by the full Board for a
term not exceeding three years.
The letters of appointment
relating to the Non-Executive
Directors are available for
inspection at the Company’s
registered ofﬁce during normal
business hours and for 15
minutes prior to and during the
Annual General Meeting.
Corporate governance    27 The Board has appointed an
Audit Committee, a
Remuneration Committee and a
Nominations Committee. The
terms of reference for each such
committee are published on the
Company’s website and set out
below are summaries of the work
of those committees in
discharging their respective
responsibilities.
Audit Committee
During the year the Audit
Committee comprised 
Mr G K Maddrell, Baroness
Prashar, Mr D F Naish (until his
resignation from the Board on 
25 March 2003) and Mr N P Hall
(as from his appointment to 
the Board on 5 March 2003). 
Mr S R H Beevor was appointed
as a member of the Audit
Committee on 18 March 2004
following his appointment to the
Board on 1 March 2004 and the
resignation on that date of
Baroness Prashar. 
Mr Maddrell acted as Chairman
of the Audit Committee until 1
July 2003 when the chairmanship
of the Committee was assumed
by Mr N P Hall. Mr Hall has
extensive recent ﬁnancial
experience, being a Chartered
Accountant and, until February
2003, ﬁnance director of Arcadia
Group plc (formerly The Burton
Group plc).
During the year the Audit
Committee met on three
occasions, with each meeting
being attended by each of its
then members.
The Audit Committee meets with
the Group Finance Director and
with the external auditors and
reviews the annual accounts and
the preliminary and interim
ﬁnancial results announcements
prior to submission to the Board.
The Audit Committee also
reviews compliance with
accounting standards, the scope
and extent of the external audit
programme and the
appointment, independence and
remuneration of the auditors. The
chairman of the Audit Committee
reports to the Board on matters
discussed at meetings of the
Audit Committee. 
During the course of the year the
Audit Committee reviewed the
need for an internal audit
function within the Group. 
The conclusion of that review
was that, in view of the existing
controls in place, the
implementation of an
Accommodation Services self-
audit regime and the size of the
Group, a Group internal audit
function was not required.
However, the position is being
kept under review.
The Audit Committee has
established a formal policy with
regard to the Company’s
appointment of the external audit
ﬁrm for the supply of non-audit
services. In addition, the Audit
Committee reviews any potential
threat to the objectivity and
independence of the external
auditor, including, in particular,
those potential threats identiﬁed
by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and
Wales in its independence
guidelines. The Committee
determines and then reports to
the Board, whether or not it is
satisﬁed that the independence
of the external auditor is not
jeopardised, taking into account
the external auditor’s own
submissions to the Committee
and/or the Board. 
During the course of 2003 the
only non-audit services provided
to the Group by the external
audit ﬁrm were tax advisory.
Remuneration Committee
During the year the
Remuneration Committee
comprised Mr G K Maddrell (who
again acted as Chairman),
Baroness Prashar, Mr D F Naish
(until his resignation from the
Board on 25 March 2003) and 
Mr N P Hall (as from his
appointment to the Board on 
6 March 2003). Mr S R H Beevor
was appointed a member of the
Remuneration Committee on 
18 March 2004 following his
appointment to the Board on 
1 March 2004 and the
resignation on that date of
Baroness Prashar.
The Committee determines
remuneration policy and advises
the Board accordingly. In
particular, the Committee makes
recommendations regarding the
terms of employment of
executive directors and senior
managers, including terms of
remuneration, the award of share
options and other incentives. 
Mr N A Porter is invited to attend
meetings of the Remuneration
Committee but takes no part in
the discussions concerning his
own remuneration and does not
attend those parts of the
meetings of the Committee that
consider that issue. The
Directors’ Remuneration Report
is set out on pages 32 to 36. 
During the course of 2003 ﬁve
meetings of the Remuneration
Committee were held, all of
which were attended by each 
of the then current members of
the Committee.
28   Corporate governance Corporate governance    29
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is
chaired by Mr G K Maddrell.
However, the exact composition
of the committee is variable,
provided that each meeting has
a majority represented by
independent Non-Executive
Directors. During the course of
2003 six meetings of the
Nominations Committee were
held, each of which was
attended by Mr G K Maddrell,
Baroness Prashar and Mr N A
Porter. Mr D F Naish also
attended those meetings of the
Committee held prior to his
resignation, whilst Mr N P Hall
attended those meetings of the
Committee held subsequent to
his appointment to the Board. 
The Committee is responsible for
making recommendations to the
Board on any appointment or
re-appointment to the Board and
at senior executive level. It is also
responsible for ensuring that
plans are in place for an orderly
succession of appointments to
the Board and at senior
management level so as to
maintain an appropriate balance
of skills and experience within the
Company and on the Board. 
Following determination by the
Board that a new Non-Executive
Director should be appointed,
the Nominations Committee
draws-up a personal and
professional proﬁle of the ideal
candidate it would like to see
appointed in order that a
recruitment and selection
process can be undertaken.
The Committee then appoints an
independent search and
selection agency to approach
potential candidates who it
identiﬁes as meeting the
speciﬁcation supplied by the
Nominations Committee. Initial
interviews are conducted by the
search agency, which then
compiles a short list of
appropriate candidates to be
interviewed by the Nominations
Committee. A recommendation
of a proposed candidate is then
made following those second
round interviews. Following a
recommendation from the
Committee for the appointment
of a candidate to the Board, the
Chairman may be requested by
the Board to approach the
nominated candidate to agree
terms for the appointment
according to the criteria set out
in the Group’s remuneration
policies. The above procedure
was followed in the case of the
recent appointment to the Board
of Mr S R H Beevor.
Consideration of the appointment
of an internal candidate to the
position of Executive Director will
follow a request from the Chief
Executive to the Nominations
Committee that the appropriate
candidate be considered for
nomination. This will only follow a
record of successful
achievement in the candidate’s
current role and the gathering of
data from an independent
external assessment centre that
the candidate will have been
asked to attend. At that centre,
the proposed candidate is
assessed in the areas of
commercial and strategic ability,
leadership; technical ability;
ability to build peer relations; and
values and behaviours. The
results of those assessments are
compared against a global norm
group of highly performing
directors and senior managers.
After gathering the assessment
data the Nominations Committee
interviews the proposed
candidate, following which it may
recommend his or her
appointment to the Board. If the
Board accepts the
recommendation of the
Committee it will, through the
Chairman and Chief Executive,
invite the proposed candidate to
join the Board according to
terms and conditions of service
agreed by the Remuneration
Committee. That follows an
external benchmarking of
remuneration for the role. The
above procedures were followed
in the cases of the recent
appointments to the Board of Mr
M C Allan and Dr A Lee.
For the appointment of external
candidates to the role of
Executive Director, the process
outlined above in relation to Non-
Executive Directors is followed,
with the addition that such
external candidates are, as is the
case with internal candidates,
required to attend an external
assessment centre prior to ﬁnal
interviews by the Nominations
Committee.
Performance Evaluation
of Directors
The process for evaluating the
performance of the Executive
Directors ﬂows from the setting
of the overall business strategy
for the Group. Once agreed by
the Board, the Executive
Directors produce Divisional
strategies and milestone action
plans designed to deliver the
agreed overall strategy. Such
strategies and plans, which are
challenged and may be revised
prior to being ratiﬁed by the
Board, then form the basis of
personal objectives that are set
for each of the Executive
Directors. The personal
objectives of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are agreed between him
and the Chairman as part of the
annual Performance Development
Programme (“PDP”) cycle. The
other Executive Directors agree
their objectives with the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer, again as part of
the PDP process. Progress in
achieving objectives is monitored
at least monthly through one to
one meetings between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer and between the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer and the other
Executive Directors. Progress
reviews are also carried out at
Board level through the review of
key performance indicators. 
Formal performance
measurement is undertaken
through half-year PDP reviews of
progress made against
milestones, key performance
indicators and other personal
objectives. The annual PDP
review of performance takes
place shortly after the year-end.
That review considers
performance against objectives,
including key performance
indicators, and the Group’s
values and behaviours. The key
performance indicators, which
include ﬁnancial performance and
customer and employee
satisfaction also form the basis of
the bonus formulae as set out in
the Directors’ Remuneration
Report. 
In line with the New Combined
Code, the performance of the
Non-Executive Directors is to be
reviewed annually by the
Chairman, whilst the performance
of the Chairman is to be
considered annually by the Non-
Executive Directors (in the
absence of the Chairman) in both
cases taking account of the views
of the Executive Directors. The
ﬁrst such reviews will be
conducted in June 2004. The
Chairman and the Non-Executive
Directors (also on an annual
basis), meet to consider the
overall effectiveness of the Board
and its Committees. Those
meetings are then followed by full
Board review meetings, which are
attended by all members of the
Board. Such meetings have been
the normal practice of the Board
over recent years.
Internal Control
The Board has overall
responsibility for the Group’s
system of internal control.
However, such a system is
designed to achieve business
objectives and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material
misstatement. The provisions of
both the Combined Code and the
New Combined Code in respect
of internal controls require that
directors review all controls
including operational, compliance
and risk management, as well as
ﬁnancial control. Through reports
from the Group’s Operations
Board, the Board has reviewed
the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal controls for the
period covered by the annual
report and accounts. 
The Company has an established
framework of internal controls
which, amongst other things,
includes the following:
Financial Reporting
The Group has a comprehensive
budgeting system with an annual
business plan approved by the
Board. Operating results and
cash ﬂows are reported on
monthly and compared against
budget. Forecasts are reviewed
throughout the year and revised
as necessary. The Company
reports to shareholders on a half-
yearly basis.
Investment Appraisal
The Company has clearly deﬁned
guidelines for capital expenditure.
These include annual budgets,
detailed appraisal and review
procedures, levels of authority
and due diligence requirements
where investment or development
properties are being acquired.
Post-investment appraisals are
performed for major investments.
Business Risk Assessment
The Group has developed a
comprehensive risk management
system whereby strategic threats
to the business are identiﬁed and
the management and control of
those threats prioritised. As a
result of this system, the Board is
satisﬁed with the high level
controls in place, although all
areas of the business are kept
under review and new controls
introduced as appropriate.
30   Corporate governance Social Responsibility
Following the issue by the
Association of British Insurers in
October 2001 of its guidelines in
relation to socially responsible
investment, the Company
reviewed its policies in relation to
that issue and formalised its
procedures for considering the
signiﬁcance to the business of
the Company of social,
environmental and ethical (SEE)
matters. As a result, SEE matters
are now considered as part of
the Group’s existing risk
management system (referred to
above in relation to Business
Risk Assessment). The results of
the benchmarking reviews which
form part of that system (which
are carried out by the Group’s
Operations Board) are reported
to and considered by the full
Board on a six monthly basis.
Details of the SEE risks and
opportunities that are considered
most signiﬁcant to the Group are
set out on page 14. In light of the
above, the Board believes that it
has in place appropriate
procedures to identify and
assess the signiﬁcant risks to the
Company’s short and long-term
value arising from SEE matters,
as well as opportunities to
enhance value that may arise
from an appropriate response. In
that respect, the Board considers
that it receives adequate
information to make those
assessments and that the
Company has in place effective
measures for managing
signiﬁcant risks. 
Account is taken of SEE matters in
relation to the training of Directors.
Investor Relations
The Executive Directors have a
programme of meetings with
institutional shareholders and
analysts. Feedback from such
meetings regarding shareholder
opinion is provided to the Board
as a whole. In addition, Non-
Executive Directors are available
to meet with major shareholders if
requested. The Company’s
Annual General Meeting provides
an opportunity, which the Board
encourages, for private investors
to communicate with the
Company.
Going Concern
After making enquiries the
Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group and
the Company have adequate
resources to continue in
operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts.
Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities
Company law requires the
Directors to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each year which
give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company
and the Group and of the proﬁt or
loss for that period.
In preparing those ﬁnancial
statements the Directors are
required to:
1 select suitable accounting 
polices and then apply them 
consistently;
2 make judgements and 
estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
3 state whether applicable 
accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed
and explained in the ﬁnancial 
statements; and
4 prepare the ﬁnancial 
statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting

Corporate governance    31 The Regulations require the
auditors to report to the
Company’s members on the
“auditable part” of the Directors’
Remuneration Report and to state
whether, in their opinion, that part
of the Report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 (as
amended by the Regulations).
The Report has therefore been
divided into separate sections for
the unaudited and audited
information. Within the unaudited
section the Report deals with the
remuneration policy that is to be
followed in 2004; summarises the
results of remuneration surveys
that have been undertaken and
describes arrangements which
applied during 2003.
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Remuneration
Committee of the Board
consisted of the Chairman of the
Board (Mr G K Maddrell) and the
Non-Executive Directors of the
Company, namely Baroness
Prashar, Mr D F Naish (until his
resignation from the Board on 
25 March 2003) and Mr N P Hall
(as from his appointment to the
Board on 6 March 2003).
Subsequent to Baroness
Prashar’s resignation from the
Board and the Committee on 
1 March 2004, Mr S R H Beevor,
who was appointed an additional
Non-Executive Director of the
Company on 1 March 2004, was
appointed to the Remuneration
Committee in place of Baroness
Prashar on 18 March 2004. Mr N
A Porter is invited to attend
meetings of the Committee, which
is chaired by Mr Maddrell. 
The Committee is required
annually to consider and review
all aspects of the Executive
Directors’ employment,
performance and remuneration
and the Group’s policies on those
matters. Mr Porter takes no part in
the discussions concerning his
own remuneration, nor does he
attend those parts of the meetings
of the Committee which discuss
that issue. 
The Committee is able to obtain
independent professional advice
from remuneration and other
consultants in order to carry out its
duties. During the year such
advice was received from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
provided no other services to the
Group during the course of the
year. In addition, Dr A Lee, the
Group Human Resources Director
(who was appointed to the Board
on 17 November 2003) provided
advice and services to the
Committee during the course of
the year. The members of the
Committee attend the Company’s
Annual General Meeting and are
available to answer shareholders’
questions about the Directors’
remuneration.
Policy on Remuneration of
Executive Directors and Senior
Executives
The policy in respect of Directors’
remuneration for the following and
subsequent years is to ensure that
the remuneration packages it
offers are competitive and
designed to attract, retain and
motivate Executive Directors and
senior executives of an appropriate
calibre. Performance-related
reward policies are operated which
are designed to provide a
signiﬁcant element of “at risk” pay,
which is only available when good
results are achieved. During 2002
a review of executive remuneration
was undertaken on behalf of 
the Committee by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . 
32   Directors’ remuneration report
The Board reports to
shareholders on Directors’
remuneration as set out
below. In preparing this
Report the Remuneration
Committee of the Board (the
“Committee”) has complied
with the Directors’
Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the
“Regulations”) and relevant
requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Financial
Services Authority. The
Report also describes how
the Board has applied the
principles of good
governance in relation to
directors’ remuneration.
A resolution to approve the
Report will be proposed at
the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
Directors’ remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2003 Directors’ remuneration report   33
That review compared all elements
of remuneration against a group of
20 comparator companies, (mainly
in the property sector) having
regard, amongst other things, to
the size of the business and the
sectors within which the Company
operates. The results of that review
indicated that the base salaries of
the Executive Directors were lower
than the market median, whilst
total remunerations were above the
median but below the upper
quartile. In the light of those
ﬁndings, the Committee agreed
the principle that base salaries for
executives should be set broadly in
line with the median, but that
directors should have the
opportunity of achieving total
remuneration at the upper quartile
level when justiﬁed by strong
performance. Accordingly, since its
original report in 2002,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has
been commissioned to undertake
further tracker surveys to ensure
that the above referred to principle
is adhered to.
The main components of the
Directors’ remuneration 
packages are:
Basic Salary
The basic salary of each Director
has been ﬁxed taking into account
advice from independent sources
on the rates of salary for similar
roles in selected groups of
comparable companies and the
performance of the relevant
individual. As stated above, the
Company has agreed the
principle that base salaries should
be set broadly in line with the
market median.
Performance Related Bonus
The Group operates an annual
performance related bonus
scheme which is designed to
reward contributions and
encourage the achievement of
targeted levels of performance
over the short term. The maximum
potential bonus payment is, in the
case of each of the Executive
Directors, equivalent to 100 per
cent of his base salary. However,
achievement of any bonus
payment is subject to stretching
performance criteria, linked to both
the individual performance of the
Director and that of the Group. In
2003 individual performance
targets (which accounted for 60
per cent of a Director’s maximum
potential bonus payment) were set
following the Performance
Development Programme reviews
(“PDP’s”) that were carried out for
all employees (including the
Executive Directors) at the start of
the year. The remaining 40 per
cent of the maximum potential
bonus payment, which was
referable to the performance of the
Group, involved the Group
achieving targets in relation to
proﬁtability, increases in net asset
value, customer satisfaction and
employee satisfaction (the latter
two components both being
monitored by independent
organisations). In 2004 the
proportion of the individual and
Group elements of the maximum
bonus potential will change. The
individual performance element
will account for 40 per cent of the
maximum bonus potential and the
remaining 60 per cent will be
determined on the basis of Group
performance according to the
same elements in 2003. This
change in emphasis is designed
to promote an even stronger team
approach amongst the Executive
Directors and senior managers to
delivering the stretching
performance targets of the Group.
The performance related bonus is
not pensionable and Non-
Executive Directors do not
participate in the scheme.
For the year-ended 31 December
2003 Directors’ bonus entitlements
have, subject as stated below,
been paid as to 50 per cent in
cash, with the other 50 per cent
taking the form of a deferred
bonus, which has been satisﬁed by
an allocation of shares in the
Company via an employee share
ownership trust. Shares allocated
by way of deferred bonus do not
vest in the allottee, either legally or
beneﬁcially, until a period of three
years has expired from the date of
original allocation, subject to the
allottee still remaining in the
employment of the Group.
However, where a Director already
holds shares in the Company
equal or greater in value at the time
of a bonus payment to three times
his basic salary, the Director may
take the bonus entirely in cash. In
view of his already signiﬁcant
shareholding in the Company, Mr N
A Porter’s bonus for 2003 will be
taken in cash. In addition the
bonuses paid to Messrs D P
Ransome and S L Bernstein in
respect of the periods from 1
January 2003 to the dates of their
respective resignations from the
Board were paid entirely in cash.
The Group intends, subject to
shareholder approval, to introduce
a share based long term incentive
plan (“LTIP”) to reward strong
performance and to promote equity
participation amongst all
employees. The LTIP , which is
intended to be introduced during
ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January
2005, will replace the employee
share ownership trust as the
mechanism to reward and retain
employees through share based
deferred remuneration. Due to the
phasing out of the employee share
ownership trust, any bonuses for
the Executive Directors for the year
ending 31 December 2004 will be
satisﬁed in cash. The criteria on which LTIP entitlements will be
based will include comparison with
the benchmarked performance of
other companies and the
achievement of the commercial
objective of the Group.
Long-term Incentives
In addition to the annual bonus
referred to above, the Group seeks
to encourage and reward good
long-term performance by
providing incentives linked to the
performance of the Company’s
shares. These incentives have, to
date, been provided in the form of
ordinary share options and details
of all options awarded to the
Directors are set out in the
“auditable part” of this Report.
In August 1999 the Company
adopted The UNITE Group plc
Approved Company Share Option
Scheme (the “ Approved Scheme”)
being a scheme approved by the
Inland Revenue. In April 2000 the
Company also adopted The UNITE
Group plc Unapproved Share
Option Scheme (the “Unapproved
Scheme”). Under the Approved
Scheme, the total market value of
shares, at the date of grant, over
which any participant may be
awarded options is £30,000, whilst
under the Unapproved Scheme,
the total market value, at the date
of grant, of all shares over which
any participant may be awarded
options (including options granted
under other schemes), must not
exceed four times his total
remuneration. The Non-Executive
Directors do not participate in
either the Approved Scheme or the
Unapproved Scheme.
Options previously granted under
the Approved Scheme have not
been made subject to
performance conditions, which is
considered appropriate in view of
the relatively small number of
options that may be granted to
individuals under such schemes.
Options previously granted to
Directors under the Unapproved
Scheme are exercisable as to 50
per cent provided the total
shareholder return for the Company
is such that it is equal to or exceeds
the median total shareholder return
of companies included in the FTSE
Small Companies Index (excluding
investment trusts) over the three
year period from the date of grant.
The remaining 50 per cent are
exercisable provided the
Company’s net asset growth
exceeds the average net asset
growth of companies included in
the FTSE Small Companies Index
(excluding investment trusts) over
the three-year period from the date
of grant. Such performance criteria
were agreed with institutional
shareholders at the time the
Unapproved Scheme was adopted.
Any grant of options made to
Executive Directors under the
Unapproved Scheme after 1
January 2004 will be subject to
revised performance criteria based
solely on total shareholder return,
such that options will be exercisable
only as to 50 per cent if the total
shareholder return for the
Company, over the three year
period from the date of grant, is
such that it is equal to the median
total shareholder return of
companies included in the FTSE
Small Companies Index (excluding
investment trusts) over that period.
If the Company’s performance
would put it in the upper quartile
(upon the basis described above),
100 per cent of the options
awarded will be exercisable.
Between median and upper quartile
performance, the number of options
which may be exercised will be
calculated on a straight line basis.
Service Contracts and 
Notice Periods
In accordance with general market
practice, each of the Executive
Directors has a rolling service
contract requiring twelve months’
notice of termination on either side.
Such contracts contain no speciﬁc
provision for compensation for loss
of ofﬁce, other than an obligation to
pay for any notice period waived
by the Company.
The dates of the executive Directors’
service contracts are as follows:
Messrs D P Ransome and S L
Bernstein, who resigned as Directors
of the Company on 30 June 2003
and 17 November 2003 respectively,
were employed under service
contracts dated 14 January 1999
and 23 March 2001 respectively.
Each of the Non-Executive
Directors have speciﬁc letters of
engagement, the dates of which
are set out below:
Non-Executive Directors are
appointed for an initial term of three
years, subject to normal provisions
as to retirement by rotation.
Subsequent terms of three years
may be awarded. Current
appointments will expire at the
annual general meeting in 2005 in
the case of Mr G K Maddrell; at the
annual general meeting in 2006 in
the case of Mr N P Hall and at the
annual general meeting in 2007 in
the case of Mr S R H Beevor. The
appointment and re-appointment
and the remuneration of Non-
Executive Directors are matters
reserved for the full Board.

upon him leaving the employment of
the Group on 27 February 2004.  Independent auditors’ report to 
the members of The UNITE Group plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 38 to 58. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 31, this includes
responsibility for preparing the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our
responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession's ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the directors' report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding directors' remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on pages 27 to 31 reﬂects the company's compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board's statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's corporate governance procedures or its
risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the
directors’ remuneration report , and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group's circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 31 December 2003 and of the
loss of the group for the year then ended; and 
■ the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

(forming part of the ﬁnancial statements)
1. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modiﬁed to include investment and development
properties at valuation and in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985 except as stated under
investment and development properties.
In the Company’s ﬁnancial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are revalued annually to the underlying net asset value of
these undertakings. This is considered an appropriate treatment by the Directors, since the activity of the subsidiaries, namely property
investment, is such that net assets are an appropriate valuation method.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. Unless otherwise
stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under the acquisition method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired
or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated proﬁt and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own proﬁt and loss account.
Intangible ﬁxed assets 
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the
separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation is capitalised. Goodwill comprises two elements. Firstly, an element relating to
synergy beneﬁts arising from the increased scale of the portfolio which is amortised over 20 years. The second element represents the
anticipated beneﬁts, in the form of future development gains, arising from access to the acquired group’s portfolio of potential projects. 
This further element will be written off to match the recognition of gains on these pipeline projects. Should the value of this goodwill become
recognised as impaired, an impairment charge would be made against operating proﬁt.
Investment and development properties
Development properties comprise both properties in the course of construction and those held as sites for future construction whereas
investment properties are those where construction has been completed. All these properties are held for their long term investment potential.
In accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No 19 Accounting for investment properties:
i investment properties are revalued annually at market value determined in accordance with the Guidance Notes on the valuation of assets
issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Surpluses and deﬁcits arising are transferred to the revaluation reserve except that
any impairment in the value of an investment property (to the extent that it is less than cost) is taken to the proﬁt and loss account for the
year; and
ii no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20
years to run.
This treatment, as regards the Group’s investment properties, may be a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act concerning
depreciation of ﬁxed assets. However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that
systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate. The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true
and fair view. Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reﬂected in the annual valuation and the amount which might
otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identiﬁed or quantiﬁed.
Net gains or losses on disposal of investment and development properties are calculated by reference to book value at the date of disposal
and any revaluation surpluses of earlier years are transferred from revaluation reserve to the proﬁt and loss account as a reserve movement.
Properties held for future development and developments in progress are revalued annually based on market value. They are not subject to
depreciation, since the Directors consider that the useful economic life of the assets does not begin until the properties are completed.
The cost of investment and development properties includes amounts relating to interest and attributable overheads, in addition to direct
costs. For this purpose, the interest rate applied to funds provided for property development is arrived at by reference, where appropriate, to
the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes and, in regard to that part of the development cost ﬁnanced out of general
borrowings, to the average rate paid by the Group on these borrowings. 
Interest transferred to the cost of properties is applied gross of associated tax relief.
Tangible ﬁxed assets and depreciation
For assets other than investment and development properties, depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value
of tangible ﬁxed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold improvements Life of lease
Fixtures and ﬁttings 4 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Plant and machinery 4 – 20 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Interest rate transactions
Interest rate swap and option agreements are used to manage the interest basis of borrowings. Interest receipts and payments under these agreements
are accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related ﬁnance expense. No amounts are recognised in respect of future periods.
Notes 43 Notes
(continued)
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Borrowings
Borrowings are carried at their nominal value net of any issue costs. Issue costs are written off to the proﬁt and loss account over the
expected life of the borrowing.
Leases
Assets acquired under ﬁnance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors. Operating lease
rentals are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For work in progress and ﬁnished goods cost is taken as production cost,
which includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the Group’s external activities during the year.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences between the
recognition of certain items for taxation purposes and their recognition in the ﬁnancial statements under the Group’s accounting policies.
In accordance with FRS19, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed at the balance
sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future except as otherwise provided by FRS19. Deferred tax is not
recognised when ﬁxed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the
gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Post retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an
independently administered fund. The amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in
respect of the accounting period.
2. Segmental analysis of operations
Included in the development loss for the period to 31 December 2003 is the loss relating to the under recovery of manufacturing overheads
of £1,246,000, which is not expected to recur.
Included in corporate costs for 2003 are non-recurring costs of £609,000 relating to the cessation of emplyment of two Executive Directors.

Notes
(continued)

Manual issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) by CB Richard Ellis Ltd and Messrs King Sturge, Chartered Surveyors as
external valuers. 
Developments in progress and properties held for future development have been incorporated at valuations by the directors at acquisition or
when planning permission and appropriate pre-let agreements are in place, plus subsequent expenditure. These valuations were based on

56   Notes 30. Financial instruments and derivatives
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS13 that short term debtors and creditors be excluded from the following disclosures.
The Group holds or issues ﬁnancial instruments for two main purposes:
To ﬁnance the development and subsequent long term retention of investment properties;
To manage the interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of ﬁnance.
In addition, various ﬁnancial instruments – such as trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments – arise directly from the Group’s
operations. The majority of ﬁnancial instruments are of sterling denominations. The Group does not trade in ﬁnancial instruments or derivatives.
The Group ﬁnances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and fresh issues of equity. The
Group borrows from major UK clearing banks and specialist development funding banks at both ﬁxed and ﬂoating rates of interest, using derivatives
where appropriate to generate the desired effective interest rate basis. The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps.

Notes 57 Notes
(continued)
30. Financial instruments and derivatives (continued)
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk and market price risk, and to a lesser extent, currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. 
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed by using interest rate swaps, interest rate caps
and, in some cases, simple ﬁxed rate borrowing. The Group’s policy is separated into three areas:
i) Development ﬁnance
The majority of the Group’s development borrowing at 31 December 2003 was held at ﬂoating rate reﬂecting the Group’s view of the stability
of the current interest rate environment and the relatively low cost of adverse interest rate ﬂuctuations in the context of the total development
cost. The Group continues to review the appropriateness of this policy on a regular basis. 
ii) Reﬁnancing risk
The Group’s principal exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates, which
affect the quantum of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion. Signiﬁcant adverse movements undermine the Group’s
capital recycling strategy.
The Group increasingly manages this risk via a programme of pre-hedging, through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps. At 31 December
2003 approximately £124.4m (2002: £88.2m) of the Group’s anticipated reﬁnancing was hedged for an average term of 20.0 years (2002: 21.7 years).
iii) Medium and long term ﬁnance
The Group holds its medium and long term bank ﬁnance under ﬂoating rate arrangements. The majority of this debt is hedged through the
use of interest rate swap agreements. During 2003, the Group’s policy has been to hedge around 80% of the Group’s exposure for terms of
approximately 20 years. Mandatory break options are included within these arrangements to minimise cost. The Group’s bond issuance
attracts a ﬁxed rate of interest over an average life of 19.4 years.
At 31 December 2003, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 79.2% (2002: 92.4%) of the Group’s medium and long term borrowing was
held at ﬁxed rates.
The Group’s long term ﬁnance (after taking derivatives into account) is ﬁxed at an average rate of 6.68% (2002: 6.63%) over an average
unexpired term of 16.9 years (2002: 21.5 years), again reﬂecting the Group’s bond issuance.
Liquidity risk
With respect to its development activities, the Directors have adopted a policy whereby the Group injects the full amount of equity required
for each development before drawing debt under associated facilities. In this way, the funding requirements of each scheme are substantially
“ring fenced” and secured at the outset of works.
The Group’s medium term banking facilities are fully revolving, allowing the Group to apply its cash surpluses in the temporary reduction of
its debt obligations.
Market price risk
The Group’s primary market price risk is interest rate exposure. It monitors this exposure through a process of sensitivity analysis, estimating
the effect on operating cash ﬂow over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates.
The Group’s policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk, provided the effects of the various potential changes in rates remain with certain
prescribed parameters.
Currency risk
The Group carries on a small amount of trade in Euros. The Directors do not consider the volumes of this trade signiﬁcant enough to warrant
a formal foreign exchange policy. To the extent that this trade increases in the future, the Directors will implement an appropriate policy.
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets does not differ from the book value. The fair value of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities is disclosed
in note 11 to the accounts.
Gains and losses on hedges
At 31 December 2003, the Group had unrecognised losses on hedges of £1,231,000 (2002: losses of £5,954,000). The future recognition of
these losses is dependent upon movement in prevailing interest rates, which the Group has not sought to estimate.

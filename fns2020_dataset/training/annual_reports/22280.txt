Charles Stanley provides a full range of 
Investment Management, Financial Planning,
Advisory and Execution-only services to 
private clients, trusts, charities and corporates. 
As at 31 March 2015 Charles Stanley managed 
and had funds under administration totalling 
£21.3 billion.
“2015 was a challenging year for the Group 
and the financial performance disappointing.
However, significant changes have been made 
to the management team, our strategy redefined
and targets set to restore the Group’s operating
margin. There is a substantial programme of work
ahead of us, but I have confidence that we have 
the right team of people across the Group to deliver
our plans to continue to better our client offering,
to improve shareholder returns and to provide a
rewarding environment for staff.”

Report and Accounts 2015

The year to 31 March 2015 has seen some of the most significant changes in Charles Stanley in the 
two centuries since the business was first established. While we marginally increased our revenue, 
our profits have been adversely impacted by the changes and we ended the year with a loss before 
tax of £6.1 million (2014: profit £6.1 million). After amending for adjusting items we recorded an 
underlying profit before tax of £4.2 million compared with £13.5 million the previous year.
Throughout the year our management and client-facing investment teams have been heavily engaged 
in the major programme to which I referred last year, of upgrading our systems and our record-keeping 
to meet the rising regulatory expectations across our area of the financial services sector. This has led 
to a substantial re-modelling of the interface with our extensive client base, which is moving forward 
on schedule to completion very shortly. The outcome is intended to reinforce our high-quality offer 
of service to our clients by ensuring we build and maintain a deep understanding of each client’s
circumstances and thus the suitability of the service provided. We are hugely appreciative of our 
clients’ forbearance in what has been a very demanding process.
The decline in our profitability is essentially due to a combination of the rising costs associated with 
these changes, and, to an extent, the inevitable diversion of focus from business generation. But the 
upside is that we firmly believe that we have built a stronger base to take our business forward.
MANAGEMENT
These developments have coincided with some significant management changes and the initiatives
described below have further enhanced the effectiveness of the Board. European legislation now dictates
that the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of financial services businesses should be separate.
Accordingly, our Nomination Committee was tasked with seeking a new Chief Executive Officer. After a
rigorous process the Board was delighted to appoint Paul Abberley to this role. Paul, who has held 
senior executive roles in the Aviva group, joined us in May last year as Chief Investment Officer, and 
was confirmed as our new Chief Executive Officer in December on receipt of approval from the FCA. 
I continue to serve as Non-executive Chairman.
In January 2015 we were further delighted to accept the recommendation of our Nomination Committee 
to appoint Ben Money-Coutts as our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in place of James Rawlingson, who
stepped down at that time, and to whom I should like to express the Board’s thanks. Ben joined us 
in May 2013 and subsequently held senior positions in the Company prior to his appointment as 
Chief Financial Officer.
At our 31 March 2015 year-end Michael Clark stepped down as a Director, having served throughout the
entire 27 years since Charles Stanley was transformed from a partnership to an incorporated company. 
Michael continues to be employed by the Group, and I should like to pay the warmest tribute to him on
behalf of us all for his long service to Charles Stanley.
This has been a very busy and demanding year for my fellow Non-executive Directors, who, between them,
chair our Remuneration, Audit, Nomination and Risk Committees and I should like to thank them warmly
for their support of the Group. Their reports are set out on later pages.
Overall the Company’s Board has been reduced in size and its committee structure streamlined, further
enhancing its effectiveness during an important phase in the Company’s development. Separately, a 
Chief Risk Officer (CRO) has been appointed and now leads an independent risk function.
STRATEGY
Historically our strategy has been to develop the business of the Group as evenly as possible across a 
broad waterfront of different business lines, though all essentially built around our core proposition of 
a high quality of investment management, advisory and administration services to a range of different 
(but complementary) client segments. Over the past couple of years this strategy has been finessed so 
that greater emphasis is now placed on developing the core business, while retaining and building only 
those ancillary businesses which directly support and feed into the core activity. Examples of the latter 
are our successful and growing EBS SIPP operation, and our expanding Financial Planning offering.
Charles Stanley Direct, our award-winning direct-to-client digital platform, has continued to build its 
client base and Assets under Administration, and this, too, is a key element in our strategy going forward.
Clients of our Discretionary and Advisory services increasingly seek digital access to every aspect of 
their accounts. We believe that clients will welcome our planned strategic development of greater 
cross-functionality between these different elements of our service.

NARRATIVE
REPORTS
As a consequence of our increased focus and as announced previously, we have been progressing with 
the sale of our corporate broking division, Charles Stanley Securities, and our employee benefits business
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Ltd, both of which are not regarded as core. On 17 June 2015 the 
Group announced contracts had been exchanged with Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited regarding the sale 
of Charles Stanley Securities. Further announcements regarding the sale of Charles Stanley Financial
Solutions Ltd will be issued in due course.
CAPITAL
A further area on which the Board has focused during the year has been the Group’s capital position. 
The maintenance of high cash balances has always been a significant strategic objective, and although 
these remain high, the effect of reduced profitability and maintained dividends, has been to reduce 
these below target levels. At the year-end the cash balance stood at £28.5 million compared with 
£38.6 million a year earlier. So just after the year-end, in April 2015, the Group arranged a fund-raising 
which was fully taken up, predominantly by existing institutional shareholders, raising £15.8 million net 
of expenses. We are extremely grateful to our shareholders for their proactive support.
DIVIDEND
In light of the reported loss for the latest year, and in order not to dilute the newly increased capital, 
the Board has reluctantly decided to re-base its dividend payments. While the interim dividend, paid 
in November 2014, was maintained at 3.00p per share, it has been decided to recommend a final dividend 
of 2.00p per share, which compares with last year’s final dividend of 9.25p. This was flagged to shareholders
at the time of the fund-raising in early April, and is now confirmed as the Board’s recommendation. 
We fully expect, once profitability picks up, to return to our previous pattern of steadily increasing 
dividends over time, with dividend cover of at least two times (as adjusted for the amortisation of
intangibles).
EMPLOYEES
This has been a challenging year for everyone in the Group and this is my opportunity to say thank you to
them all, on behalf of the Directors and shareholders, for coping with all the demands in such good spirit, 
in taking their Company – your Company – further ahead.
OUTLOOK
The changes in key management in the Group are bedding in well. We are going through a significant process
of change so as to refocus Charles Stanley, ensuring the continued excellence of our client service and to
place ourselves at the front of the regulatory curve. There is a substantial programme of work ahead of us
but I believe that shareholders should have every confidence in the team that we have built to take this
forward.
As always both the domestic and global economic conditions have a very significant effect on our business.
Despite some obvious geopolitical risks, the broader outlook seems more benign than it has for several years.
Growth has returned to our economy and to that of the USA, and there are better signs of an uptick in
Europe too. True, the signals from China could herald a slow-down in world growth. The forthcoming 
UK referendum on Britain’s EU membership creates some – but perhaps limited – uncertainty. On the other
hand this could well turn out to be positive, with the chance of meaningful reforms giving a boost to growth
across Europe.
While remaining, as always, very cautious, I think there are signs for a little more optimism in the 
year ahead.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Having been appointed Chief Executive Officer in late 2014 my immediate priorities have been threefold:
 Ensuring our staff continue to aim for the highest possible level of client delivery. Client service 
and outcomes form the bedrock upon which we will continue to grow Charles Stanley;
 Diagnose and address the near term deterioration in profitability; and
 Review, and as necessary, reshape our corporate strategy.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Several of the underlying elements of the Group’s financial performance for the year ending 31 March 2015
were encouraging but the overall result was unsatisfactory.
Total Funds under Management and Administration (FuMA) grew 6.0% to £21.3 billion, revenues rose 
0.5% to £149.7 million, but our underlying profit before tax fell from £13.5 million to £4.2 million and 
our actual reported profit turned from a profit before tax of £6.1 million in 2014 to a loss before tax of 
£6.1 million in 2015. This loss resulted in a decline in net assets attributable to equity shareholders to 
£68.9 million (2014: £83.4 million) and of our year-end cash balance from £38.6 million the preceding 
year to £28.5 million.
Underlying these disappointing numbers there are nevertheless some encouraging trends, most notably:
 13.4% growth of Discretionary Funds under Management;
 23.0% increase in fees generated from our Managed investment activities; and
 35.0% growth of Charles Stanley Direct’s Assets under Administration (AuA) on its core 
direct-to-client platform and 37.1% increase in revenues.
These figures give substance to the view that the core activities of the Group and quality of client service
are fundamentally sound, but that much needs to be done to drive greater overall revenue growth and the
productivity of our staff whilst ensuring tight control of our cost base.
KEY INITIATIVES FOR THE YEAR AHEAD
Implementation of the revised strategy will begin in earnest. We will focus exclusively on wealth
management in the UK, and accordingly have already announced our intention to dispose of 
non-core operations.
We remain an investment-led firm and retain our commitment to providing genuinely bespoke investment
management for our clients. We know our clients value a personal service, delivered by an empowered
investment professional. Our investment offering will continue to extend to Advisory and Execution-only
services in addition to the core Discretionary portfolio management.
Increasingly, our clients require advice and we are renewing our commitment to make such support
available. Our Financial Planning staff will be combined into a single Financial Planning division, enlarged
over time, and offering a high quality and consistent suite of services, focussing upon but not limited to,
retirement and inheritance.

NARRATIVE
REPORTS
A number of our teams provide both specialist Asset Management products to clients and research support
to our core Investment Management division. These units include PAN Asset Management, the Collectives
Portfolios Service, the IHT portfolio service, Matterley funds, Discretionary Fund Management and the 
central Research function. They will now be restructured and combined into a single Asset Management
division. This will allow for the cost-effective leveraging over a broad range of investment specialisms.
Research support for our private client investment teams will be further enhanced. Asset management
solutions will be offered to financial intermediaries and wholesale and institutional clients.
We will continue to provide a broad range of platforms and wrappers, reflecting the varying needs of 
our clients. These will include SIPP administration, delivered by our EBS unit.
Finally, while known for our personal service, we are also acutely aware that our clients require high quality
digital access to our products and services. Indeed, whether by choice or because more practical, some 
will continue to use this route exclusively. Accordingly, we remain committed to our highly regarded 
Charles Stanley Direct offering. The innovative delivery developed within the platform will be leveraged
across the Charles Stanley offering, benefitting all clients.
We expect the benefits from the implementation of the strategy to take a number of years to have full effect.
We have set ourselves the primary financial objective of building our operating margin to at least 15% in
2018 and expect it to grow further beyond that.
In summary, we will be active at four points on the value chain and thus vertically integrated. Each point 
will be managed as a profit centre and thus Financial Planning, provision of Platforms and Wrappers,
Investment Management and Asset Management will each contribute to the long term growth of both 
our profits and our margin. Implementation of the revised strategy will be a multi-year exercise, 
but meaningful progress will be delivered in the current financial year.

OUR BUSINESS
Charles Stanley remains one of the UK’s leading independently owned private client investment
management firms. We have a long heritage, dating back to 1792, which includes membership of the 
Stock Exchange under the Charles Stanley name since the 1850s. We manage and administer over 
£21.3 billion of assets on behalf of 80,577 clients, many of whom have been with us over decades or
generations due to the excellence of our services and commitment to client care.
These principles of service will remain at the heart of everything we do. However, in recent times we 
have begun to take significant steps to refocus our business and realign our model with the changing
requirements of our clients, our regulator and our market place. The desire to modernise the business 
has been evident in the changes we have made to our senior management team and by the commitment 
we have made to enact the recommendations of the Strategic Review of our business.
This Strategic Review, led by our new Chief Executive Officer, has involved a thorough analysis of our
businesses with a view to identifying those which have the capacity to develop further and contribute 
to our overall vision of building Charles Stanley into the UK’s leading Wealth Management Business 
by 2020. The benchmarks we employ to evaluate the extent to which we have achieved this vision shall 
be to seek top quartile, independently assessed performance in the following three key areas.
1. Client satisfaction;
2. Equity market rating (on a like-for-like basis with our peers); and
3. Staff engagement.
The timescale for the delivery of this vision demonstrates that we consider the process of redefining 
and then benefitting from our revised strategy as a major and long term project which will require
considerable endeavour from our employees and perhaps some degree of patience from our shareholders.
Our core activity is to provide investment management services to an affluent private client base, although
we very frequently act on behalf of charities, corporates and trusts. Over the past decade we have
increasingly focused on a fully Discretionary fee paying service. Our Discretionary Managed client base 
now accounts for 43.7% of our clients’ Funds under Management and Administration, up from 8.9% at 
the turn of the millennium. This trend can also be seen in the balance of our revenues which is now
provided in the majority by fee-based income. To complement our investment management business 
we are refining the offering provided by various of our central Investment Management teams (Matterley
Funds, PAN Asset Management, the Collectives Portfolio Service, IHT Portfolio Service, Discretionary Fund
Management and the central Research Function) into an Asset Management division, which is a range of
investment solutions emerging directly from our Investment Process. We are taking steps to improve and
extend the scope of our Investment Process as a part of this exercise.
Alongside this, we also retain a strong commitment to providing a spectrum of services and regard our
Advisory business and Execution-only services as an integral part of our Investment Management offering.
Furthermore, we remain excited by the prospects for growth in the online self-directed market which 
Charles Stanley Direct services. We also believe the market place for Financial Planning services will
develop considerably in the future and is one which fits naturally with our core competencies. Accordingly
we are looking to develop further our Financial Planning offering as we can see this being both an
increasingly integrated product but also as a source of new clients being introduced to the firm.

STRATEGIC REPORT
We believe we have a natural competitive advantage in these businesses which, when correctly leveraged,
will offer a differentiated and superior service for our clients. By comparison, in the instance of Charles
Stanley Securities and Charles Stanley Financial Solutions, although we have every confidence that both
businesses are well positioned to serve their client bases, we have decided that they do not have the 
desired degree of commonality with our target market to justify continued ownership by the Group.
Accordingly, we have announced our intention to dispose of these activities. The exchange of contracts 
with Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited for the sale of Charles Stanley Securities was announced to the 
market on 17 June 2015. The sale process of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions is still ongoing.
We rely upon our team of over 400 investment managers and financial planners located in offices through
the country to deliver our services and products to our clients. We believe that a close personal relationship
between adviser and clients is essential to the development of our business and is consistent with the
reputation for client satisfaction that we enjoy. Geographical decentralisation supports this. We also remain
committed to a truly bespoke service in which investment professionals achieve superior risk assessed
performance by really listening to, and understanding, the needs and desires of, their clients.
We will continue to be investment-led and to regard a personal service as the heart of our offering. 
With this as our foundation we have taken considerable steps to respond to the changing needs of 
our customers and our regulators in delivering our investment solutions. This will inevitably lead to us
developing a more targeted and differentiated investment management service. Over the last 18 months 
we have carried out a programme to understand the financial circumstances and investment objectives 
of our clients with a greater depth and rigour than ever before. Although this has involved an enormous
commitment of our time and resources we believe that the quality of the portfolios that we will deliver 
as a result will strengthen the longevity of our client relationships over the medium to longer term. 
We are currently in the midst of a review and reorganisation of our investment process and the 
consequent tools that we are able to put at the disposal of our investment managers. This review 
will enhance the quality and extent of the general asset allocation guidance which is produced by 
the Group, and will be made available as a supporting framework from which our investment manager 
can design bespoke portfolios.
We are confident that the ingredients of the Charles Stanley business remain as attractive today as at any
other point in our history, and that following the implementation of our Strategic Review we will be in an
excellent position to drive greater value for all of our stakeholders.

NARRATIVE
REPORTS
OUR SERVICES
Investment Management
The core of our business is contained within our Investment Management Services division. This accounts
for approximately 87.7% of the total assets. We manage and administer 81.2% of Group revenue. 
The services of our Investment Management division are provided by our investment managers via 
our network of regional branches and London Head Office.
Within our Investment Management division our flagship offering is Discretionary Investment Management.
This is predominantly a fee-based service directed at private clients who wish to delegate the management
of their investment portfolio to a recognised professional. Our investment managers create bespoke
portfolios tailored to the individual objectives and personal risk tolerances of their clients. Our investment
managers use their own investment expertise and experience, and a wealth of in-house research and tax
efficient wrappers provided by the Group to manage client assets. We are currently upgrading our
investment process with a view to providing our investment managers with an even stronger asset allocation
framework to serve as the foundation for the bespoke portfolios they create.
Within our Discretionary Investment Management service we also offer our Collectives Portfolio Service 
and Pan Asset Management. Both are model-based services which provide clients a low cost method of 
gaining access to our investment process and expertise via exposure to collective investment vehicles 
as opposed to direct exposure to individual securities. These products are primarily aimed at clients 
with modest investible assets and for whom a fully bespoke portfolio is not cost effective. The model
solutions are available to all of our investment managers and are also made selectively available to 
financial intermediaries via external investment platforms. We shall be making changes to the 
operation of our model-based services as part of the upgrading of our central investment proposition 
into an Asset Management division. We would expect this to be a considerable area of growth for the 
Group over time.
Within the Investment Management Services division we offer a full suite of Advisory, Dealing and
Execution services. We provide Advisory Managed services to those clients who wish to have their
investment portfolios managed by an investment professional but wish to retain the ultimate decision
making power over individual investment decisions. We report the assets we manage within our 
Advisory Managed business together with the assets of our Discretionary Managed business and 
describe this as our Managed business.
We selectively offer an Advisory Dealing service to a number of individuals with a keen interest in and
considerable experience of investment and markets. This remains an important part of our offering as 
it still accounts for £2.1 billion of our Funds under Management and Administration. Accordingly it is one 
which we will continue to offer to appropriate clients. Our Execution-only service provides a dealing,
custody and administration service to clients who wish to make their investment decisions over all 
or part of their portfolio, and who accordingly require no advice. This service may be accessed via an
Investment Manager, through a dedicated telephone-based dealing service or online via Charles Stanley
Direct.
Across the Investment Management Service division we offer clients access to a variety of services 
and products which are designed to ensure the efficient administration of their portfolios both from 
a custodial and a tax perspective. We offer clients the opportunity to hold their investments with us 
via a Charles Stanley Nominee account or via CREST personal membership and offer clients a full cash
management service. From a tax efficiency viewpoint, we also offer clients access to our in-house 
Individual Savings Accounts, Self-Invested Personal Pensions and Inheritance Tax Portfolio Service.
Charles Stanley Direct
Charles Stanley Direct has been developed in recent years to service the requirements of a growing
customer base that wish to use an online platform to conduct aspects of their investment activities and 
are comfortable in making their decisions without access to advice. We believe that this group of clients 
will continue to grow. Since its launch in 2013, Charles Stanley Direct has attracted more than 20,000
accounts and now has well in excess of £1 billion of Assets under Administration.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Financial Planning
Our financial planners advise clients across the full spectrum of their needs with a particular expertise 
in the pensions, retirement and inheritance fields. The Financial Planning service is offered through our
branch network and is delivered alongside an investment management service. We believe the financial
planning market will continue to grow and is complementary to our core investment management activities.
We will seek to roll out this service further and extend our team of Chartered Financial Planners
accordingly.
OUR MARKETS
Charles Stanley operates solely within the UK’s wealth management industry. This is a sizeable market 
place with over £737 billion of assets being administered by UK based Wealth Management institutions. 
The table below sets out the total assets managed by Charles Stanley and those we consider to be its
immediate peers.

Figures based on latest audited accounts and other publicly available information. All are as at 31 March 2015, 
with the exception of Close Brothers AM which is as at 30 April 2015.
Despite its size the market remains highly fragmented with at least 180 firms in operation. The top 
10 players control only 31% of the market place.
We believe the industry will continue to undergo rapid change. For example we estimate that the number 
of individuals with between £50,000 and £5 million of investible assets will increase 18% by 2018. This is
partly evidence of the pace of retirement of the baby boomer generation gathering speed. The UK has an
increasing number of elderly, with a disproportionate amount of wealth concentrated in individuals over 
65 years old. This group is faced with making provision for long years of retirement as life expectancies
continue to increase. This will inevitably increase the demand for investment management and financial
planning services.
There is no doubt that the recent changes that have been made to pensions legislation both in regard to
auto-enrolment and in the removal of the requirement for annuity purchases will increase the pool of 
capital available to the wealth management industry. We anticipate that we will need to extend the 
provision of our services to a changing client base and that the industry will respond to these trends 
with an evolving product suite.
Our industry is also confronting the challenges posed by the increasing technological requirements of 
our natural client base. Our clients are increasingly comfortable in handling their financial affairs on mobile
devices and are managing sizeable transactions via this medium. There is an increasing demand for up to
the minute online access to investment portfolios and the ability to trade remotely. Although we have
developed a number of innovative solutions to these changing requirements it remains an ongoing 
challenge to ensure that the technological capabilities can service these needs, and ensure that access 
and transactions are carried out with the requisite levels of security.
Furthermore, the regulatory environment in which we operate has been rapidly developing and we
anticipate that this trend will continue. We, like many others in the industry, have been investing heavily 
to ensure that our processes and systems place us in a position to comply with the increased regulatory
scrutiny in which we manage our clients’ money. We believe that the investment we have made will lead 
us to be in a better position to service our clients’ needs.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR
Charles Stanley’s performance
Whilst elements of Charles Stanley’s financial performance for the year ended 31 March 2015 were
encouraging, most notably the continued growth of our Funds under Management and Administration
(FuMA), the growing proportion of Discretionary Managed funds, and the continued rapid growth of
Charles Stanley Direct, other critical aspects of the Group’s performance were disappointing, most 
obviously the deterioration of the operating margin owing to increased costs. These factors, together 
with a number of other charges, ultimately led to a reported pre-tax loss for the year of £6.1 million.
Funds under Management and Administration
Total Funds under Management and Administration at 31 March 2015 reached a new high 
of £21.3 billion, up 6.0% from £20.1 billion at 31 March 2014. Within this, Managed Funds increased 9.8%
with Discretionary Funds up 13.4% to £9.3 billion and Advisory Managed Funds constant at £3.0 billion.
Administered Funds increased 1.1% and Advisory Dealing Funds declined to £2.1 billion. Nevertheless, 
we retain a strong commitment to providing an Advisory Dealing Service as part of our full spectrum
offering, although we see it becoming a more specialist service for individuals with a keen interest in 
and considerable experience of investments and markets, and thus priced accordingly. Execution-only 
funds grew 6.2% to £6.9 billion with particularly strong growth of 15.5% through our direct-to-client
platform, Charles Stanley Direct.

Group revenue
Group revenue from continuing activities increased by 4.9% to £141.0 million for 2015 from £134.4 million 
in 2014. Revenues of the Held for sale activities of Charles Stanley Securities and Charles Stanley Financial
Solutions declined 40.4% largely as a result in a fall in corporate finance fees. As a consequence overall
Group revenues were up 0.5% to £149.7 million from £149.0 million in the prior year.
A more detailed analysis of revenue by division is set out on page 24 of the divisional review.

Group underlying operating expenses
Group operating expenses from continuing activities increased 9.4% from £123.6 million in 2014 to 
£135.2 million in 2015. Approximately 74.0% of this increase was accounted for by headcount and 
associated remuneration increases, and 7.8% by establishment due to the Group taking an additional 
floor at its main London office. The expenses of the Held for sale activities declined 15.3% to 
£10.5 million largely due to a £3.7 million reduction in the variable remuneration paid to Charles Stanley
Securities staff. Combined underlying operating expenses were £145.7 million (2014: £136.0 million).
Group underlying pre-tax profit margin
The Group’s pre-tax profit margin for its core continuing operations fell from 8.4% for 2014 to 4.3% for 
2015 and that of its Held for sale activities from 15.1% in 2014 to a negative margin of (20.7%) in 2015. 
In overall terms, the pre-tax profit margin fell from 9.1% to 2.8%. The main driver of this decline was the
sharp increase in the cost base against relatively flat revenues. This level of profitability is unsustainable 
and the Board’s highest single priority regarding financial performance is to restore the margin to at least
15% by no later than calendar year 2018.
Adjusting items
The Board considers the underlying profit before tax and earnings per share as a better reflection of
business performance rather than looking at results on a statutory basis only. To calculate the underlying

NARRATIVE
REPORTS
FSCS Levy (£1.3 million)
The Group incurred FSCS Levy charges of £1.6 million for the period. During the year the FSCS was
successful in recovering some of its costs in relation to claims made in previous years. As a result the 
Group received a rebate of £0.3 million of its 2011 Levy.
Amortisation of client relationships (£1.8 million)
Payments made to new investment managers and third parties for introduction of customer relationships
that are judged to be intangible assets are capitalised. We amortise these intangibles over the useful life 
of the client relationship, which has been assessed to be 10 years. We have excluded amortisation charges
for the client relationships from the underlying profit as it is a significant non-cash item.
Branch acquisition costs (£0.3 million)
The Group was joined by a team of investment managers in Leicester in October 2013. This led to various
one-off costs due to their being in a start-up phase. No further acquisition costs are expected in relation 
to this branch.
Impairment of assets (£8.3 million)
The Board has conducted a thorough review of the carrying value of the goodwill relating to a number of
assets and has decided it would be appropriate to write down the goodwill associated with a number of
activities as summarised below:

STRATEGIC REPORT
Non-recurring professional costs (£0.1 million)
At the request of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Group engaged Ernst & Young to 
help review its processes for conducting client suitability assessments, make recommendations 
for their improvement, and subsequent validation testing to ensure changes made in line with these
recommendations had been implemented and were working as intended. This process has now been
concluded.
Reduction in deferred consideration (profit £0.3 million)
Last year as part of the acquisition of Pan Asset Capital Management Limited (PAN) an estimate based 
on the Funds under Management was made of the deferred consideration payable. The Funds under
Management of PAN have since fallen and as a result the deferred consideration payable has decreased.
Sale of Fund asset (profit £1.2 million)
In September 2014 the Group sold the Matterley Undervalued Asset Fund to Miton Group for an 
initial consideration of £0.75 million. Based on the current level of assets in the fund, further deferred
consideration of £0.45 million will be payable in December 2015 and has therefore been recognised 
through the income statement in the current financial year.
Taxation
Even though the Group is reporting a loss before tax, its continuing operations have a small 
taxable profit, hence a small tax expense of £0.04 million in relation to the current financial year 
(2014: expense £1.4 million). A full reconciliation of the tax charge on continuing activities is provided 
in note 12 of the financial statements. A tax credit of £0.3 million arises on the losses attributable to the
discontinued activities and this is shown separately in note 11.
Earnings/(loss) per share
The basic loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2015 was (13.46p) compared with earnings of 
10.51p in 2014. On an underlying basis for continuing operations, earnings per share fell 47.4% to 13.14p 
(2014: 24.98p).
Dividends
In view of the Group's trading performance for the year and the need to strengthen the Group’s capital
reserves, the Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.00p. Taken together with the interim dividend of 
3.00p, this will represent a total dividend for the year of 5.00p (2014: 12.25p).

Where possible, administrative expenses are charged directly to the division to which they are attributable.
However, a significant proportion of the Group’s administrative expenditure is incurred by middle and 
back office functions. Examples of these include our Operations, Finance, Information Technology,
Compliance, Risk, Internal Audit, Marketing, Professional and Facilities departments as well as the costs
associated with being a publicly listed company. Historically the Group has allocated some but not all 
of these expenses to the four operating divisions. In order to understand better the profitability of each
division, the Board has conducted a full cost allocation exercise. Accordingly, the total administrative
expenses of £157.2 million attributed to the operating divisions include £57.8 million of centrally 
allocated costs. 
In 2014 £26.5 million of central costs were allocated to divisions and £23.4 million remained unallocated.
These costs totalling £49.9 million have now been fully allocated to provide prior year comparatives. 
It should be noted that elements of the allocation are judgemental and that in the event a business or
division is sold, any fixed or semi-variable costs that have been allocated to them would need to be
reallocated to other areas (as they would, for example, in relation to the costs associated with being 
a publicly listed company).

STRATEGIC REPORT
Funds under Management and Administration
FuMA is the main driver for the financial performance of the Investment Management Services division.
Investment Management FuMA has increased by 5.1% from £17.7 billion at the beginning of the year 
to £18.6 billion at 31 March 2015. Managed Funds, comprising Discretionary Managed and Advisory
Managed Funds, respectively changed by +13.1% and (0.01%), in part owing to a shift of Advisory Managed
funds to the Discretionary service. This is expected to be a continuing pattern.

Fund flows during the past financial year were substantially driven by market movement rather than 
net inflow of new funds. This was disappointing but we believe it was substantially accounted for by 
our investment managers being heavily engaged in the client suitability repapering exercise which has 
been a very major undertaking. Whilst ensuring the suitability of our services for our clients and alignment
of their investment portfolios to their requirements is an ongoing undertaking, the upgrade programme 
we have been undertaking draws to its conclusion at the end of June 2015. We are hopeful that with the
conclusion of this exercise, our investment managers will be able to focus more time on marketing activity.
We can expect that this, along with the Group bringing greater focus to its overall marketing strategy 
(one of its key initiatives), will lead to increasing levels of new business.

STRATEGIC REPORT
IMS Revenues
The revenues of the IMS division comprise Investment Management fees, trading commission and interest 
turn. Revenue within IMS increased 3.7% to £121.6 million in 2015 from £117.3 million in the previous year.
This can largely be attributed to the growth in Funds under Management over the period driven by 
market gains.
Income generated from Managed services is shown in the following table:

bps bps bps bps bps bps bps %
Revenue margin 86 91 71 89 97 69 (4.0) (4.5%)
The very healthy growth of 23.0% in fees from £50.5 million to £62.1 million in our Managed business 
was partially offset by a decline in commission of 9.6% from £31.3 million at the end of last year to 
£28.3 million in the current year. This trend has been driven by our focus on encouraging more clients
toward a fee-paying Discretionary service at the expense of charging lower commission or none at all.
Commission revenues further declined as a result of lower dealing activity.  In overall terms, the volume 
of commission-earning bargains declined 18.8% year on year. Finally, interest turn on aggregated client cash
balances, where we share with clients the benefits of wholesale rates that we can achieve on large balances
(typically in excess of £1 billion at any one time) versus what can be achieved on individual small retail
deposits, declined 25.0% on the prior year to £2.4 million. In the near term it is likely that this aspect 
of our revenues will decline further as we remain in a low interest rate environment, and few banks wish 
to take these deposits because of the high level of regulatory capital they are required to set aside against
client cash.
Whilst our overall revenues from Managed business increased in 2015, our revenue margin on Funds under
Management declined from 89bps to 85bps. This is a key performance indicator and one we will be seeking
to improve upon in coming years. Although superficially we believe it does not appear to be out of step 
with our competitors, we believe it is low relative to the average size of client portfolio we manage. 
Stanley Report 14th Proof 24 June 2015_Stanley R/A 1st proof 16/3  23/06/2015  21:10  Page 29 The revenue performance of the administered element of our Investment Management division’s business 
is summarised in the table below. This comprises Advisory Dealing and Execution-only services. 
Total revenue fell 10.8% from £32.3 million in 2014 to £28.8 million in 2015. The drivers of this performance
were similar to that of the Managed business, in this instance comprising higher fees and higher interest
turn (because of higher average cash balances held by clients) offset by a marginal decrease in FuMA and
commission income.

IMS costs
IMS’s underlying costs increased 9.5% during the year from £101.6 million to £111.3 million and including
adjusting items they increased 8.6%. The major contributory elements to this increase of £9.7 million were
employment costs (£6.4 million), IT costs (£1.4 million) and establishment costs (£0.6 million).
By far the most significant cost the division incurs is employment costs (as is the case for the entire Group)
which rose to 50.1% of revenues from 46.8% in the prior year. Improving productivity of our investment
management teams is a key area of focus for the Board. This can be achieved by increasing the FuMA
managed by each investment manager; increasing the revenues charged on those assets, optimising the
ratio of front office to middle and back office staff by improving and standardising workflow processes, 
and by revising compensation structures.
IMS operating profit
IMS achieved an underlying operating profit of £10.4 million, a decline of 34.2% since the prior year. 
This decline was caused by its increased cost base. Its operating margin was 8.6% compared to 13.5% 
in 2014.

Financial Planning and Wealth Management
The Financial Planning and Wealth Management department has increased its gross revenue by 16.7% 
over the year from £4.8 million to £5.6 million. This is a satisfactory result despite trail commission being
replaced by adviser charging and customer agreed remuneration. We have addressed the issues raised by
the RDR and believe the business is well placed to face the challenges presented, such as the changes to
pension scheme regulations.
Direct costs in the business increased by £0.9 million to £4.4 million (2014: £3.5 million), as a result of
increased employment costs arising from the recruitment of a number of senior financial planners into 
the division to grow the business. Consequently, the operating contribution has decreased by 7.7%.
EBS Management PLC
During 2015 EBS continued to achieve strong growth of schemes under administration, up 31.0% since 
2014. Whilst this is the leading indicator of the health of the business, its revenues and profits lagged 
for two key reasons. First, the majority of the scheme growth came from lower margin white-labelled 
SIPPs which have had a negative impact on our average revenue per scheme under administration. 
We improved the pricing on a number of our schemes toward the end of the financial year which 
will drive revenues more strongly in the future. Secondly, we have had to recruit a number of additional
staff to deal with both the sheer volume of additional schemes and all the changes brought about by 
the Government’s overhaul of pension scheme legislation and flexibility of drawdown. In the upcoming 
year, the Group intends to invest in new systems for EBS at an estimated cost of approximately 
£0.4 million. With over 10,000 SIPPs and SSASs already under administration and with continued 
strong growth in scheme numbers despite almost no direct sales or marketing effort, EBS has the 
scale to merit this systems spend. The Board believes this investment will significantly improve 
EBS’s operating efficiency, scalability and control environment, thereby supporting its continued
development with significantly improved operating margins.
Charles Stanley Pan Asset Capital Management
Charles Stanley Pan Asset (PAN) made a full year’s contribution of revenue for the first time in 2015 of 
£1.3 million, having been acquired in December 2013. Planned cost savings have begun to be realised 
now that the team has been integrated with the rest of the Group’s Investment Management operations.
A proportion of the consideration for PAN was paid in December 2014 and a further amount is 
payable in June 2015. The amount payable is contingent upon PAN’s FuMA being above £500 million. 
As at 31 December 2014, the FuMA was £488 million which was below the required amount, therefore 
no deferred consideration was paid on that date. As at 31 March 2015, PAN’s FuMA was £512 million, 
upon which we anticipate £40,000 will be payable in June 2015. We will continue to monitor the 
FuMA up to the due date in June 2015.

Matterley
Matterley manages a range of open ended investment funds, predominantly targeted internally either
toward smaller clients to provide them with proper asset diversification in a cost efficient fashion or 
to meet specific needs (for example the UK & International Growth Fund which is managed by our
successful Court of Protection team).
During the year the Matterley Undervalued Assets Fund was sold to Miton Group for an initial consideration
of £0.75 million and a deferred payment based on the Assets under Management (AuM) of the Fund. 
As at 31 March 2015, we have recognised a deferred payment of £0.45 million based on its AuM at 
that date.
Excluding the Undervalued Assets Fund, the Matterley funds have seen growth of 19.6% since the 
previous year, with notable growth in the UK & International Growth fund.

by Peter Geikie-Cobb and Jeremy Palliser, aims to achieve a total return of 5-6%, combining both 
income and capital growth along with downside protection strategies. The Fund will invest 
predominantly in highly liquid investments and is an Absolute Return Bond Fund.
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions’ revenues declined marginally during the year from £3.5 million 
in 2014 to £3.2 million in 2015.
Although we have every confidence that the business is well positioned to serve its client base, it faces 
potential headwinds in relation to the capping of pension charges and removal of pensions commissions
from April 2016. We have decided that the company does not have the desired degree of commonality with
our core Investment Management and Financial Planning services, so consequently it is now Held for sale.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Revenues in the business have increased by 37.1% with some 7,141 new accounts opened in the year, 
taking the total to 20,595. Average client size is steadily improving at £63,000 per client. Underlying direct
operating costs have increased year on year from £2.8 million in 2014 to £4.7 million; however, allocated
costs have decreased by 28.6%. After allocated costs, the division reported an underlying operating loss 
of £1.9 million (2014: £2.1 million). The total Assets under Administration stood at £1.6 billion as at 
31 March 2015 (2014: £1.4 billion).
Costs in the business have been significantly addressed in 2015 and stabilised and the website has been
reworked in closer alignment with the Charles Stanley Group with new brochureware offering a cleaner
message to new clients. The service is already seeing greater interaction and improved client journeys 
to registration as a result. New client acquisition is served by a digital marketing strategy encompassing 
paid search, display advertising, re-targeting and social media advertising as well as by internal broker 
and Garrison transfers.
The service desk in Edinburgh and the investment helpdesk in Beverley continue to handle significant
numbers of client calls on a monthly basis, as well as handling a large amount of the administration
functions for the service. Digital efficiencies continue to be sought in the service centre processes 
and this efficiency drive will continue in the upcoming financial year. The progress that has been 
made to date has been pleasing.
The Board has conducted a thorough review of the carrying value of the goodwill relating to Charles Stanley
Direct and in particular its Garrison Investment Analysis business. It had been decided that an appropriate
write down of goodwill associated with Charles Stanley Direct is £3.0 million leaving a residual value of 
£5.2 million.

Charles Stanley Securities
Charles Stanley Securities provides advisory, broking and corporate finance services for the smaller and
mid-cap sector. It has experienced a decrease in revenue of 44.2% from £14.7 million in 2014 to £8.2 million
in the current financial year primarily as a result of reduced corporate finance fees as well as lower
secondary commissions in equity and bond trading. Although its costs have fallen as variable remuneration
paid to staff has been reduced significantly, the decline in revenues has led to the division declaring a loss
for the year of £1.7 million (2014: profit £1.1 million).

a part of the core activities of the Group. In June the Group announced contracts had been exchanged 
with Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited for the sale of the divison excluding the Equities Trading business. 
For this reason the division is treated as a discontinued activity and included as an asset Held for sale in 
our accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL POSITION
Charles Stanley & Co. Limited (CSC) is an IFPRU 125K Limited Licence firm regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the consolidated regulatory capital position is shown as though 
the Group was subject to the same regime. At 31 March 2015, the Group had regulatory capital resources 
of £37.7 million as shown in the table below:
2015 2014
£’000 £’000
Tier 1 capital resources 67,291 83,403
Prudential deduction* (29,561) (35,286)
Total capital resources 37,730 48,117
*Prudential deductions include all intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets.
The Group monitors a range of capital and liquidity statistics on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. 
The Group’s internal risk appetite is to maintain capital levels of at least 125% of the regulatory capital
requirement. Capital levels fell below this internal target level during the year to 31 March 2015, arising
from adverse trading results and movements in the defined benefit pension scheme. The Group’s capital
position was strengthened following the capital-raising in April 2015, and the Group continues to monitor
capital levels carefully. The Group maintained a surplus of regulatory capital at all times during the year.
As required under FCA rules, the Group maintains an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
(ICAAP), which includes performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory
capital and liquidity that the Group needs to hold. The last review conducted and signed off by the Board
was in April 2015. The ICAAP process includes the performance of a number of stress tests to determine
the appropriate levels of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group needs to hold. Capital forecasts 
are performed monthly and take into account expected dividends and intangible asset acquisitions and
disposals as well as expected trading results.
The Group’s Pillar III disclosures are published annually on our website (www.charles-stanley.co.uk/
investor-relations/pillar-3-disclosure) and provide further details about regulatory capital resources 
and requirements.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets arise principally from acquired Funds under Management and are categorised as client
relationships. Goodwill arises on consolidation. At 31 March 2015, the total carrying value of intangible
assets was £29.1 million (2014: £35.3 million). This figure includes £3.0 million disclosed as Held for sale
assets. During the year £1.6 million in customer relationships and £2.6 million of internally generated
software were capitalised. No goodwill was acquired during the year or in 2014.
Client relationship intangibles are amortised over the estimated useful life of the client relationship –
10 years.
Goodwill arising from business combinations is not amortised, but is subject to an annual impairment test.
Following this review impairment charges have been allocated against goodwill, including £1.5 million 
in respect of the Durlacher business, £0.3 million in respect of PAN Asset, £2.0 million in respect of 
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions and the Plymouth employee benefits business, and £3.0 million in
respect of Charles Stanley Direct.
Further details on the Group’s intangibles are provided in note 14.

NARRATIVE
REPORTS
Capital expenditure
During the year the Group has continued to invest in its infrastructure, principally through the
enhancement of ICT infrastructure through purchase of enhanced mainframe systems (£1.6 million) 
and the refurbishment of our offices (£0.9 million). Improving the systems continues to be a focus of 
the Group, whether through improving existing systems or investing in new ones.
Further details on the Group’s capital expenditure are provided in note 15.
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme, which has been closed to new members for
several years. Each year actuarial valuations are carried out based on the position at 31 March 2015.
The fall in discount rates used to value the scheme’s liabilities has outweighed growth in asset prices during
the year. As a result the scheme deficit increased to £13.1 million at 31 March 2015 (2014: £6.9 million).
The Group has established a working party to examine the extent that pension risk can be mitigated, 
and expects to take positive steps in this regard during the current financial year.
Further details on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme and the assumptions underpinning the
valuation are provided in note 9.
Cash at bank
Risk targets have been set to help the Group monitor the bank balances (see risks and uncertainties below).
The Group experienced downward pressure on its cash balances during the year, arising from the adverse
trading results noted above.  Bank balances are monitored daily and forecast to ensure they do not fall
below £25 million.  Cash balances were £28.5 million at 31 March 2015 and strengthened post year-end
following the capital raising referred to above.
The Group regularly reviews the counterparties with whom it holds both client and its own monies 
and determines that all operations are in accordance with the policy set by the Treasury Committee.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK DESCRIPTION
Charles Stanley is committed to maintaining its financial strength in order to
support its business objectives, meeting its regulatory capital requirements and
providing shareholders with an acceptable return on their investment.
At present Charles Stanley has no acquisition plans; it is recognised that the Group
may be subject to acquisition-related risks in the future. As the Group re-structures
around its core wealth management strategy, certain peripheral activities and
teams may be divested during 2015.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
A Board Risk Committee comprising two independent Non-executive Directors was formed. In addition 
a Chief Risk Officer was appointed reporting to the Risk Committee and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board has developed and approved a Risk Appetite Statement (RAS). The RAS is a core component 
to the Group’s risk management framework and was developed taking into consideration the Group’s
strategic objectives, strategy and business plans. This new level of RAS articulation is driving the
implementation of more robust risk monitoring and risk reporting process, which continue to evolve. 
As the Group implements these processes, the Board will periodically review the RAS to ensure that it
continues to reflect the risk appetite of the Group.
The RAS sets out the Group’s tolerance to various types of risk and includes both quantitative and
qualitative measures against which management and Board monitor risk on a periodic basis.
Set out on the next two pages are the key risks relevant to the Group’s long term performance.

NARRATIVE
REPORTS
KEY MITIGANTS AND CONTROLS
To achieve the Group’s financial goals the following targets have been set:
   Return on Equity – 4% for 2016 rising to 7% in 2017;
    Cash balances – £25m;
  Regulatory Capital – 125% of the requirement + pension risk; and
    Dividend Cover – 2x earnings per Ordinary Share.
These are monitored by the Board on a regular basis.
Any proposed acquisition should offer an immediate and sustainable increase in the Group’s market
share in the local or national market and have minimal execution risks associated with it and allow 
the Group to maintain conservative levels of liquidity and capital. A number of specific quantitative 
and qualitative parameters are used to assess the appropriateness of potential new acquisitions and
divestments:
 Target operational cash breakeven point should not be expected to exceed 18 months;
  Number of “significant” acquisitions should not generally exceed three deals per 18 months;
 The target company should not be involved in any potential or existing litigation, which the 
Group’s management consider to be unmanageable or which could impact on the Group’s 
reputation and/or acquisition criteria; and
  Divestments should fit in with the Group’s strategy and aim to maximise the profit and loss 
impact whilst reducing the Group’s capital requirements. In particular, attention should be paid 
to any long term risks and liabilities which might remain after the divestment.
All clients are risk-profiled to ensure the Group clearly defines, agrees and manages its clients’
portfolios in accordance with these risk profiles and investment objectives. Suitability is a major focus
for the Group which has quality assurance processes in place to assess suitability reviews performed 
by its investment managers. Careful monitoring of investment decision making against the risk profile
helps to ensure it achieves appropriate and suitable outcomes. The Group measures these outcomes 
in a number of ways including:
 Number and nature of complaints;
  Internal client suitability file reviews; and
 Customer surveys.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK DESCRIPTION
Financial crime risk is the risk of reduction in earnings and / or value, through
financial or reputational loss, associated with financial crime and failure to comply
with related regulatory obligations. These losses may include censure, fines or the
cost of litigation. This includes risks associated with money laundering, market
abuse, sanctions breaches, fraud, bribery and adverse media through monitoring 
of the client base.
The Group recognises that its reputation and financial success is dependent on the
performance of its people. Charles Stanley personnel establish and maintain close
relationships with its clients and the loss of key personnel can have a significant
impact on the Group from an operational, reputational and financial perspective.
Financial
crime risk
People risk
Charles Stanley is exposed to credit risk through the potential failure of its clients
or counterparties to fulfil their contractual obligations.
Credit and
counterparty
risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The Group operates
in a business environment that is subject to significant technological, regulatory
and economic changes.
Fraud is one of the key risks the Group is exposed to and it includes, but is not
limited to, incidents such as the following: external cyber-attacks, identity fraud and
broker fraud. Charles Stanley is part of a cross-industry effort to combat fraudulent
activity. Data-sharing initiatives have provided us with valuable intelligence to assist
us in protecting our franchise and our clients.

KEY MITIGANTS AND CONTROLS
The Compliance Committee serves as the principal forum for reviewing and challenging the
management of financial crime risk including the overall strategy and performance and engagement
with financial crime authorities. The Compliance Committee is accountable for ensuring that, at 
Group level, financial crime risks are effectively identified and managed within risk appetite and 
that strategies for financial crime prevention are effectively coordinated and implemented across 
the Group.
Charles Stanley has historically had low levels of staff turnover but key departures may be
symptomatic of more fundamental issues within the organisation that require attention. 
Senior level departures will consequently trigger a formal exit review assessment.
The Group’s Treasury Committee is responsible for the initial assessment and ongoing monitoring 
of deposit taking counterparties and the Board has defined the following criteria, which govern how
management manages the Group’s credit and counterparty risk:
 Assets will only be placed and maintained with counterparties (i.e. authorised institutions 
or groups) that are deemed to be financially sound as determined by Charles Stanley's 
Treasury Committee;
 Client and Group cash held at any individual counterparty group or authorised institution 
should not exceed its respective counterparty limit set by the Treasury Committee unless 
a written approval has been provided by the Treasury Committee;
The Market Exposure Committee (MEC) is responsible for the Group’s market exposure. In particular 
it is responsible for counterparty limits for the purpose of trading;
 Counterparties with no set trading limits will be assessed on an individual basis at the time 
of the trade by the MEC; and
 Breaches of any of these counterparty trading limits without approval will be escalated 
immediately to the MEC.
NARRATIVE
REPORTS
Insurance cover is in place, which is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that the amount of cover 
is appropriate to manage the impact of operational losses against the Group’s capital reserves. 
The Group records and monitors its operational losses and near misses. Management is required 
to notify the Board of all significant operational incidents. Furthermore, management regularly 
reports to the Board in relation to the total dealing and trading losses.
The Group operates a number of IT platforms which have controls in place designed to prevent 
cyber-attacks, phishing and other relatively common occurrences. Whilst the Group has no appetite 
for any fraud-related incident, it recognises that certain attempts at fraud (i.e. those relating to
external fraud) may be outside of its control. Consequently, specific risk parameters in relation 
to fraud are in place, which drive monitoring and reporting to the Board:
 In relation to internal fraud, the Board will be made aware of all instances of internal 
fraud attempts (whether successful or not) and any incidents; and
 In relation to external fraud, the Board will be made aware of any unusual (but unsuccessful) 
external fraud attempt as well as all successful attempts.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK DESCRIPTION
Charles Stanley operates in a heavily regulated financial services sector.
Compliance with regulation is paramount to the Group, and management 
recognises that the Group undertakes numerous control-related activities 
to manage the Group’s regulatory risk.
The Group has built a reputation as a high quality provider of investment
management and client services. This has been carefully developed over many 
years and there is a risk that reputational damage could lead to a loss of its 
existing client base, which could possibly lead to financial loss.
Regulatory
risk
Reputational
risk
The Group’s conduct starts with ‘the tone at the top’ which is reflected in the
standard of conduct which employees and associates hold themselves to. 
Conduct risk has been a major theme across the financial services industry 
and is at the heart of everything the Group does.
Conduct risk
Charles Stanley does not undertake any propriety trading other than that arising
from incidental dealing errors and therefore takes no market risk. Losses in relation
to dealing errors are captured as operational losses. 
Market risk
Charles Stanley continues to support a defined benefit (DB) pension scheme which
accordingly exposes the firm to pension risk. The scheme is closed to new members
and is regularly reviewed for viability.
Pension risk

KEY MITIGANTS AND CONTROLS
Management monitors developments in regulation, assesses the impact on the business and
implements any changes that will be required to meet those requirements and ensure that the 
Group’s capital levels meet or exceed the regulatory requirements.
Periodic reviews are conducted internally to reduce the likelihood of significant regulatory breaches,
which could result in regulatory censure or fines.
The risk is monitored and managed by an emphasis on compliance with all aspects of 
relevant regulation.
In order to evidence good conduct the Board has established a governance framework flowing down 
to the Board committees and management processes which are designed to ensure that appropriate
controls, checks and balances are in place with safety valves where decisions and processes can 
be challenged.
NARRATIVE
REPORTS
N/A
The pension deficit level is monitored regularly and currently stands at £13. 1 million. Macroeconomic
factors (e.g. long term bond yields) are also monitored and persistently negative macroeconomic 
trends that could impact on the DB scheme’s investment performance are reported to the Board. 
The Risk Committee has set up a working group to take appropriate steps to mitigate future liabilities.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Charles Stanley has an enviable track record in relation to the quality and breadth of its private client
wealth management services, its commitment to innovation and the scale of its operations. However, as 
the financial results for the past financial year show, its strategy and business model has failed to keep 
pace profitably with the challenges the external environment has posed in the form of increased
competition, greater complexity in achieving clients' financial requirements and increased regulation.
Although the basic steps to return the Group to a sustainable level of profitability are not complex 
focus on core strengths, eliminate loss making activities, increase revenues and control costs –
the timescale for enacting them is likely to be a number of years because both client and staff 
relationships have to be managed sensitively. Moving too quickly on certain aspects will raise 
just as many risks as moving too slowly.
Having made changes to the management team, strengthened our balance sheet and defined our strategy,
our focus over the next twelve months will be on execution. In particular we will:
 Review our pricing architecture in conjunction with our service levels;
 Review our compensation and incentivisation arrangements to ensure alignment 
of interests between client outcomes, shareholder returns and staff engagement;
 Work to improve the co-ordination of the range of our activities, both front and back office, 
to improve client service and drive operating efficiencies; and
 Dispose of our non-core activities, Charles Stanley Securities and 
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions.

during the period under review by the 
controlling shareholder and or any of its 
associates; and
(iii)so far as the Company is aware, the 
procurement obligation included in the 
Agreement has been complied with during 
the period under review by the controlling 
shareholder.
The Company is not aware of any agreements
between holders of securities that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights. Each of the Company’s
Executive Directors has options as detailed 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 72, 
which are exercisable from January 2018 should
the options vest subject to the performance
conditions pursuant to the Long Term Incentive
Scheme. With regard to the appointment and
replacement of Directors, the Company is
governed by its Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code,

amended by a special resolution of the Company’s
shareholders. Copies of the Articles of Association
can be obtained from Companies House or 
by writing to the Company Secretary.
The Directors propose (Resolution 15 in the 
Notice of Meeting) to renew the authority 
granted to them at the Annual General Meeting
held in 2014 to allot equity securities up to 
an aggregate nominal value of £4,213,804 
(the ‘section 551 authority’). If approved at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the
authority will expire no later than 15 months 
from the date on which the resolution is passed,
or at the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting to be held in 2016, whichever is the
earliest.

last year’s Annual General Meeting to allot equity
shares for cash other than pro rata to existing
shareholders expires no later than 30 October
2015. Subject to the terms of section 560 
of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors

so as to give them the ability, until the Annual
General Meeting to be held in 2016, to issue
ordinary shares for cash, other than pro rata to
existing shareholders, in connection with a rights
issue or up to a limit of 10% of the ordinary share
capital issued at the date of this report. 
The Directors recommend that you vote in 
favour of Resolutions 15 and 16 to maintain 
the Company’s flexibility in relation to future
share issues.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
The Remuneration Committee aims that our Directors’ remuneration should:
 be aligned with the interests of shareholders, with a significant proportion of Executive Director 
remuneration being performance-related to areas which impact shareholder value;
 be competitive, but not excessive in relation to other relevant peer companies;
 take into account Group-wide pay and employment conditions; and
 not encourage the taking of risks which fall outside the Board’s risk appetite.
At last year’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), to reflect the new regulations, we tabled a new
remuneration policy for shareholder approval which was designed to support these underlying aims. 
We were very pleased to receive strong support for this policy (with in excess of a 99% vote in favour).
Key new features of this policy included (i) a re-designed annual bonus plan and (ii) an entirely 
new long-term share-based incentive arrangement (i.e. the Performance Share Plan (PSP)).
Launching both of these new incentive arrangements would, even in the normal course, have 
presented challenges.
However, last year was not a “normal” year for Charles Stanley. There were a number of Directorship
changes, all of which had ramifications from a remuneration perspective. In April 2014, Anthony Scott
was appointed to the Board. In December 2014 Paul Abberley was appointed Chief Executive Officer,
with Sir David Howard becoming Non-executive Chairman. In January 2015 Ben Money-Coutts 
assumed the role of interim Chief Financial Officer following the resignation of James Rawlingson. 
Ben’s appointment as a main Board Director was formally approved by the FCA and he was appointed 
to the Board on 10 June 2015. Lastly, Michael Clark stepped down from the Board on 31st March 2015.
In addition, a significant amount of time and resources have been devoted during the year to 
improving investment management systems and controls. This project, together with challenging 
market conditions, resulted in a notable fall in commission income which in turn has contributed 
to a significant decline in profits.
It has been in this context that the Committee has approached the key decisions it has taken in
connection with remuneration. These key decisions have included:
 agreeing the packages of Paul Abberley, Ben Money-Coutts and Anthony Scott;
 agreeing the fees for Sir David Howard as Non-executive Chairman;
 granting the first tranche of awards under the PSP. For various reasons, it was not possible to 
grant these awards until later in the financial year than was originally intended. In addition, 
it was agreed that Paul Abberley should receive an award over shares worth 100% of salary 
to reflect his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, with the other Executive Directors receiving 
awards over 50% of salary. These awards vest based on a blend of EPS and margin targets described 
in last year’s Report which are tested based on performance delivered in 2016/17 and which are 
explained more fully in this Report;
 determining the outturn for 2014/15 under the main Executive Director bonus plan – annual bonus 
was based on adjusted PBT performance. No annual bonuses were paid to the Executive Directors 
for the year under this plan, although Anthony Scott received a payment under a legacy incentive 
arrangement in place prior to his appointment to the Board; and
 agreeing that there will be no increases to base salaries for the 2015/2016 financial year.
Finally, as I mention above, shareholders approved our remuneration policy at the last AGM. However,
reflecting recent Board changes (e.g. Sir David Howard becoming the Non-executive Chairman) and 
to provide more general flexibility we are proposing to revise our policy with the primary change being
to clarify the position on Non-executive Directors receiving benefits up to a prescribed cap of £25,000
per annum. The full policy incorporating the proposed change is set out below and will be proposed 
for vote at the 2015 AGM (with the implementation section of the report also to be voted on).
I hope you find this Report clear and will support the approach taken by the Committee. However, 
I would welcome any comments you may have.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
INTRODUCTION
We have presented this Report to reflect the
reporting requirements on remuneration matters
for companies, particularly Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The Report also describes how the Board has
complied with the provisions set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code relating to
remuneration matters.
At our 2015 AGM we will be holding two votes
relating directly to this report: a vote on the
Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in the
policy section of this Report, and a vote on 
the implementation section of this Report. 
The auditors have reported on certain parts 
of this Report and stated whether, in their 
opinion, those parts of the Report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006. Those sections of the 
Report which have been subject to audit are
clearly indicated.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Key features of the policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy as set out in
this section of the Report will take effect for all
payments made to Directors from the date of 
the AGM on 31 July 2015 and replaces the 
policy for which shareholder approval was sought
at the 2014 AGM (albeit that the only material
change concerns Non-executive Directors
benefits). The remuneration policy for Executive
Directors is summarised in the table on page 70,
along with the policy regarding Non-executive
Directors’ fees.
How the Committee takes account of 
wider pay issues when setting the policy
When setting Executive Director remuneration,
the Committee takes into account Group-wide pay
and employment conditions, along with market
and commercial factors (although, reflecting
prevailing commercial practice, the Committee
does not consult with employees in preparing 
the Policy or its implementation). For example,
when determining any base salary increases for
Executive Directors, the Committee reviews the
average Group-wide increase, paying particular
attention to the senior manager population. 
The annual bonus opportunity of the Executive
Directors is similar in a number of respects to the
“discretionary” bonus opportunity of a significant
number of other Group staff in that both personal
performance and overall Group profitability shape
payouts. However, only the Executive Directors’
bonuses are subject to individual caps, mandatory
share deferral and clawback/malus. Executive
Directors are eligible to participate in the full
range of Group benefits offered to employees. 
In addition, they are eligible for certain
remuneration to which other employees are 
not eligible. For example, Executive Directors 
may receive a salary supplement in lieu of
pension, which is not available to all other
employees. In addition, Executive Directors 
are eligible to participate in the PSP, participation
in which is not intended to be extended widely.
However, all employees are eligible to participate
in the all-employee share schemes described 
in the table below.
How shareholders’ views are taken 
into account when setting the policy
Each year the Committee will take into account
the approval levels of remuneration-related
resolutions at the previous AGM when reviewing
the current policy. More generally, the Committee 
will also seek to build an active and productive
dialogue with investors on developments in the
remuneration aspects of corporate governance
and any changes to the Group’s executive pay
arrangements. In addition, in line with the
Investment Association’s Guidelines on
responsible investment disclosure, the 
Committee is comfortable that the incentive
structure for Executive Directors does not raise
any environmental, social or governance risks by
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Policy and the FCA Remuneration Code
The Committee will regularly review its
remuneration policies to ensure compliance 
with the principles of the Remuneration Code 
of the UK financial services regulator, as
applicable to Charles Stanley. The remuneration
policy is designed to be consistent with the
conservative management of risk and the
sustained, long-term performance of the 
Group. The Committee believes that the 
remuneration policies neither encourage, 
nor reward, inappropriate risk-taking.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ELEMENT AND
PURPOSE
Base salary
This is the core
element of pay
and reflects the
individual’s role
and position
within the Group,
with some
adjustment to
reflect their
capability and
contribution.
Benefits
To provide other
benefits valued
by recipient.
Base salaries are considered with
account taken of levels paid by
companies of similar size and
complexity. However, the Committee
does not strictly follow benchmark
data but instead uses it as a reference
point in considering, in its judgment,
the appropriate level having regard to
other relevant factors including
corporate and individual performance
and any changes in an individual’s role
and responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
Provide market competitive benefits 
in kind.
POLICY AND OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
Base salary levels will be
formally reviewed at such
times as the Committee
considers appropriate. If any
increases are made, it is
expected that they will be in
line with general workforce
increases (save where a
higher increase is necessary
to reflect a significant change
in role and/or responsibilities).
Any base salary increases
normally take effect from
1 October.
Details of the current benefits
provided can be found to the
right. The Committee reserves
discretion to introduce new
benefits where it concludes
that it is in the interests of 
the Group to do so, having
regard to the particular
circumstances and to market
practice. The Committee will
monitor overall benefit costs
and will ensure that they do
not increase by more than 
the Committee considers 
to be appropriate in all the
circumstances.
*This section does not technically form part of the policy and is for information only.

Provide a competitive level of post-retirement
benefits. 
The Executive Directors participate in money
purchase arrangements. Contributions have
been made into a SIPP for Anthony Scott and 
are taken as a salary supplement by other
Directors.
Annual bonus levels and the appropriateness of
measures are reviewed annually to ensure they
continue to support the Group’s strategic goals.
Bonus outcomes are paid in one tranche 
(less any deferred share award) following 
the year end.
Any bonus earned in excess of 50% of salary
under the main bonus plan is to be deferred 
into shares for a period of three years.
During the period until vesting of deferred share
awards, the numbers of shares awarded are
increased by the value of dividends notionally
payable in respect of the vesting shares.
Malus/clawback provisions apply to amounts
deferred which can be reduced in later years in
exceptional circumstances such as (i) material
misstatement of accounts, (ii) action that
causes material reputational damage to the
Group, and/or (iii) in the event of material
regulatory censure.
Contributions to the pension
arrangements may be reviewed
when considered appropriate by
the Committee.
To reflect the Group’s strategic
objective of driving growth and
improved quality of profits, 
the core annual bonus plan is
structured as a “profit pool”
under which an agreed
percentage of adjusted PBT can
be distributed to the Executive
Directors, with a portion of 
this distribution based upon
performance against individual
targets. There is a cap of 6% 
of adjusted PBT that can be
allocated to the pool. In addition,
no Executive Director may receive
a bonus in excess of 100% of
their salary under this plan. 
Due to the profit pool nature of
the bonus, there is no prescribed
amount of bonus that is payable
for any particular level of
performance.
Adjusted PBT is defined as PBT
adding back bonus pool accrual,
the FSCS or similar levy and, in
exceptional circumstances, any
other items the Committee
consider appropriate to reflect
the underlying financial
performance of the Group.
Pension
To aid retention
and remain
competitive
within the
market place.
Annual Bonus
To incentivise
Executive
Directors 
to deliver 
against 
annual
performance
targets.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS

The performance
measures applied
may be financial or
non-financial and
corporate, divisional
or individual.
The annual bonus
remains a
discretionary
arrangement and 
the Committee
reserves discretion
to adjust the 
out-turn should 
it consider that 
to be appropriate
(albeit within the
limits set out in 
this policy table).
N/A No changes were made to pension arrangements in 2014/15 and none 
are anticipated for 2015/16.
The Executive Directors receive the following payments: 
Michael Lilwall – 25% of base salary
Paul Abberley – 20% of base salary
Ben Money-Coutts – 20% of base salary
Anthony Scott – 20% of base salary
Gary Teper – 20% of base salary
2014/15 Annual Bonus
At the start of the year the Remuneration Committee determined that the overall size of
the bonus pool available for distribution under this plan to the Executive Directors was
to be between 3% and 6% of adjusted PBT.
50% of this bonus pool was to be allocated across all the Executive Directors on an
equal basis. The remaining 50% of the bonus pool (or such lesser amount as the
Committee considered appropriate) was to be allocated to each Executive Director
based upon their performance against pre-set individual performance objectives.
As there was no adjusted profit no annual bonus pool was accrued or paid for 2014/15
under this plan. For information, the objectives against which the Directors were
individually measured included effective contribution at Board level, the integration 
of a range of business units and the delivery of the project to revisit each client’s
objectives and circumstances (suitability).
In addition to the above, and reflective of the Company’s policy on internal recruits,
Anthony Scott was entitled to participate in a legacy profit sharing arrangement relating
to his previous role as an active Investment Manager prior to joining the Board and
reflecting his continuing client relationship management responsibilities. He received 
a payment under this legacy arrangement which is described more fully below.
2015/16 Annual Bonus
The bonus will be operated in a similar manner to 2014/15 (i.e. a profit pool will be
created worth up to 6% of adjusted profit which will be distributed based, in part, 
on performance against individual objectives). Given the nature of the individual
objectives, they are considered commercially sensitive and are accordingly not
disclosed in this Report (although they will relate to their contributions to delivering the
targeted improvement in profitability and the delivery of the detailed plans built 
to guide the implementation of the corporate strategy). Further information regarding
these targets will be included in next year’s Report. Anthony Scott will also continue to
participate in his legacy profit sharing arrangement for 2015/16 and 2016/17 (albeit at
reducing levels of entitlement) at which point he will fully transition to the main board
plan (with his legacy arrangement ceasing). Any payments he receives under this
legacy plan may be taken into account when determining his bonus entitlement
under the main plan.

Awards under the PSP may be in the form 
of nil-cost options, conditional awards 
(rights to receive shares for nil-cost) or 
cash-based “phantom” awards.
During the period until vesting of awards, the
numbers of shares awarded are increased by 
the value of dividends notionally payable in
respect of the vesting shares.
Awards previously granted but not yet vested,
and shares received following vesting, can 
be reduced/reclaimed in exceptional
circumstances such as (i) material
misstatement of accounts, (ii) actions that
cause material reputational damage to the
Group, and/or (iii) in the event of material
regulatory censure.
Executive Directors are required to retain 
50% of shares (net of tax) which vest under 
the PSP or bonus deferral until such time 
that they hold a specified value of shares. 
Once the shareholding guideline has been met,
individuals are expected to retain these levels
as a minimum. The Committee will review
shareholding annually in this context.
The formal limit under the PSP 
is 100% of salary (and 200% 
in exceptional cases).
The Committee expressly
reserves discretion to make 
such awards as it considers
appropriate within these limits.
Actual grant levels may be
determined by reference to
individual performance in the
prior year, with vesting then
based upon performance against
three year targets.
At a threshold level of
performance against these 
three year targets, 20% of an
award is capable of vesting.
100% of salary for the 
Executive Directors.

2014/15 Awards
Awards were made over shares worth up to 50% of salary under the PSP 
to Messrs Lilwall, Money-Coutts, Scott and Teper, with Paul Abberley receiving
an award of 100% of salary.
50% of each award will vest subject to adjusted EPS targets, with 50%
subject to operating margin targets, each measured over a three year 
period to 31 March 2017 .
Further details of the targets that applied to the awards are set out in 
the Implementation Report.
2015/16 Awards
Awards will be made with similar targets to the 2014/15 Awards (albeit using
absolute EPS targets, rather than percentage growth targets for 50% for each
award to provide greater transparency). Further details of the targets that will

Executive Directors are able to participate in 
all-employee share plans on the same terms 
as other Group employees.
The fees paid to the Non-executive Directors 
aim to be competitive with other fully listed
companies which the Board consider to be 
of equivalent size and complexity.
Fee levels are periodically reviewed by Board.
However, the Company does not adopt a
quantitative approach to pay positioning 
and exercises judgment as to what it 
considers to be reasonable in all the
circumstances as regards quantum.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive
Directors who chair a Board Committee or 
who have other additional responsibilities 
(such as being Senior Independent Director).
Non-executive Directors do not participate 
in the annual bonus or share incentive
arrangements.
Non-executive Directors may also receive
benefits within prescribed limits as to value.
Sharesave – individuals may
save up to a maximum of £250 
(or such amount permitted by 
the HMRC approved limit) each
month for a fixed period of three
or five years. At the end of this
period, they may use their
savings to buy shares in the
Company at a discount currently
capped at 15% (although the
rules permit 20%) of the market
price set at the launch of each
scheme.
Share Incentive Plan –
individuals may purchase, out 
of their pre-tax salary, shares 
in the Company up to a value of
£150 per month (or such amount
permitted by the HMRC approved
limit). Free shares worth up to
£3,000 (or such amount
permitted by the HMRC approved
limit) can also be granted each
year. Also, the rules of the Plan
allow matching shares to be
granted based on the number of
shares purchased (although the
Company does not currently
operate the free share and
matching elements of the Plan).
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
Fee levels for Non-executive
Directors are reviewed annually
and are only expected to increase
in line with market norms and 
to take account of additional
time commitments and
responsibilities.
The annual limit on benefits 
is £25,000.
The cap on fees payable to 
Non-executive Directors for 
their services is £0.45 million 
per annum. This will accommodate
the appointment of additional 
Non-executive Directors to
strengthen the balance of 
the Board.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
N/A
Consistent with
normal practice,
these awards 
are not subject 
to performance
conditions.
In 2014/15, the following fee structure was in place:
 Base fee was £40,000 (increased to £42,500 on 1st January 2015 in 
recognition of the fact that the workload has increased following the 
appointment of the Non-executive Directors to the Charles Stanley & Co 
Board which meets monthly)
 additional fees were as follows:
David Pusinelli also received additional fees for undertaking the role of
Chairman of the Nominations Committee from 1 July 2014 at an annualised
rate of £5,000. From 1 January 2015 Sir David Howard became Non-executive
Chairman and receives an annual fee of £125,000. Sir David will take over 
from David Pusinelli as Chairman of the Nomination Committee immediately
following the 2015 AGM, for which he will receive no additional fees.
2015/16
No changes are proposed to the above fee arrangements.

How the policy shapes actual Executive Directors’ pay
Our remuneration policy results in a significant portion of the Executive Directors’ pay being
dependent on performance. The charts below demonstrate this, showing how their pay will vary 
based on different levels of performance (with increases in share price and dividend re-investment
ignored for these purposes) i.e.:
 “minimum performance” – this assumes that performance is such that no annual bonus is warranted 
(due to no profit being generated in a particular year) and no PSP awards vest (due to the minimum 
performance threshold not being reached). Therefore, Executive Directors only receive their fixed 
pay (i.e. salary, benefits and pension);
 “on target performance” – this assumes a “target” level of performance, resulting in threshold vesting 
of PSP awards (i.e. 20% of an award over a “target” award of 50% of salary). As the annual bonus 
is based on a profit pool and, therefore, has no prescribed “on target” opportunity, to reflect the 
approach adopted last year we have valued the bonus based on the actual payment under the plan 
for the prior year (i.e. zero). Fixed pay remains unchanged;
 “maximum performance” – this assumes a very strong level of performance, resulting in full vesting 
of PSP awards at the proposed 2015/16 level and a maximum bonus payout of 100% of salary. 
Fixed pay also remains unchanged.
Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules 
and subject to the limits/other provisions set out in the policy table above. The Committee retains
discretion, consistent with market practice, in a limited number of respects, in relation to the operation
and administration of these plans. These discretions include, but are not limited to, the following:
 the selection of participants;
 the timing of grant of an award/bonus opportunity;
 the size of an award/bonus opportunity (subject to the overall plan limits set out in the policy table);
 the setting of PSP and bonus performance targets and the determination of performance against 
such targets and resultant vesting/bonus payouts;
 discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
 determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plans and the appropriate 
treatment chosen (as summarised in the table on page 66 below); and
 adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events 
and special dividends).
Under the rules of both the PSP and annual bonus plan and reflecting general market practice, 
the Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures if events occur
(e.g. material acquisition, share issue and/or divestment of a Group business) which cause it to
determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the amendment is required so 
that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy. 
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders.
The Directors' service contracts
Executive Directors
Paul Abberley, Ben Money-Coutts, Anthony Scott and Gary Teper have service contracts containing 
a notice period of six months and a payment in lieu of notice clause limited to base salary only. 
Michael Lilwall has a service contract containing a notice period of 12 months and a payment in 
lieu of notice clause limited to base salary only. There are no other special provisions in these 
contracts relating to compensation for loss of office, nor are there any clauses in contracts amending
employment terms and conditions on a change of control.
In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the Committee will 
pay due regard to (i) best practice (ii) the circumstances surrounding the termination and 
(iii) the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate his/her loss, while also adhering to the relevant
contractual terms.
All Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election. Executive Directors may take on external
appointments, subject to prior approval by the Board. The fees from such appointments (where
relevant) are retained by the Director concerned. During the year, Sir David Howard acted as 
a Director of the The Wealth Management Association and of the Chartered Institute for Securities 
and Investment, for which he received no fee.
Sir David Howard relinquished his executive duties and became Non-executive Chairman 
on 1 January 2015. Sir David received no payment in respect of loss of office/employment.
James Rawlingson ceased to be a Director of Charles Stanley Group PLC and its subsidiaries on 
7 January 2015. The payments Mr Rawlingson received are disclosed in the implementation report.
Michael Clark resigned as a Director of Charles Stanley Group PLC and its subsidiaries 
on 31 March 2015 but is expected to continue to be an employee until 31 March 2016. 
It is expected that Mr Clark will receive no payment in respect of loss of office/employment.
Sir David Howard, Mr Rawlingson and Mr Clark did not participate in the 2014/15 annual bonus 
and did not receive a PSP award.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, but instead have Letters of Appointment
for an initial three year term, subject to annual re-election by the Company’s shareholders. Either party
can terminate the Letter of Appointment on giving three months’ written notice. There are no special
provisions in the Letters of Appointment for compensation in the event of loss of office.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to
honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors. Details of any payments 
to former Directors will be set out in the relevant report going forward as required by the new
Regulations.
Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider these form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, 
we have been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another) and
business travel for Directors (and occasionally their families) may technically come within the
applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise 
such activities within its agreed policies.
Our approach to remuneration on recruitment
The Group’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure
the appointment and promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and
secure the skill sets required to deliver our strategic aims.
The following represents guidelines considered reasonable by the Committee in relation to securing an
appropriate candidate whose appointment would be in shareholders’ best interests.
 In terms of the principles for setting a package 
for a new Executive Director, the starting 
point for the Committee will be to look to 
the general policy for Executive Directors 
as set out in the policy table on page 55 and 
structure a package in accordance with 
that policy.
 Base salaries will be set based on the 
individual’s role and experience, with 
consideration given to internal relativities.
 Benefits will be provided in line with those 
offered to other employees at the similar 
level. In the case of new Executive Directors, 
individuals will be given a choice of either 
participation in a defined contribution pension 
or a cash allowance in lieu of pension.
 Ignoring any special recruitment buy-out 
arrangements which may prove to be 
necessary, the annual bonus or long-term 
incentive arrangements will operate (including 
the maximum award levels) as detailed in the 
policy table in relation to any newly appointed 
Director.
 For an internal appointment, any variable pay 
element or arrangement that exists in respect 
of the prior role may either continue on its 
original terms or be adjusted to reflect the 
new appointment as appropriate. For external 
and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain 
relocation expenses as it considers appropriate 
and/or make a contribution towards legal fees 
in connection with agreeing employment 
terms.
 A new Executive Director will not, save in 
exceptional circumstances, be offered a 
service contract with a notice period in 
excess of one year.
 Where it is necessary to make a special 
recruitment-related buy-out award to an 
external candidate, the Company will not pay 
more than is, in the view of the Committee, 
necessary and will in all cases seek, in the 
first instance, to deliver any such buy-out 
awards under the terms of the existing 
incentive pay structure as outlined in the 
policy table. It may, however, be necessary 
in some cases to make such special buy-out 
awards on terms that are more bespoke than 
the existing incentive plans in order to secure 
a candidate, which may require reliance upon 
Listing Rule 9.4.2. All such special buy-out 
awards will be appropriately disclosed and 
will take account of all relevant factors. 
For example, the commercial value of the 
buy-out award will reflect the commercial 
value of the amount forfeited from the 
previous employer, with the performance 
conditions and the potential timing of vesting 
also taken into account.
 For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum 
amounts for incentive pay as stated in the 
policy will not apply to special buy-out awards. 
The Committee has not placed a maximum 
limit on any such buy-out awards as it is not 
considered to be in shareholders’ interests 
to set any expectations for prospective 
candidates regarding such awards. However, 
as stated above, the commercial value of the 
amount forfeited from the previous employer 
will be reflected in the quantum of such award.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
Our policy on Executive Directors leaving Charles Stanley
In practice, the facts surrounding any termination do not always fit neatly into defined categories 
for “good” or “bad” leavers. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Committee to consider the suitable
treatment on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at 
that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and 
any treatment which the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under 
the terms of any incentive plans. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are
summarised below.
The Company has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation
to settle potential legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice on termination of 
an Executive Director’s employment, the Company may pay a contribution towards the individual’s 
legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees 
would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. Should it become necessary 
to make additional payments in respect of such professional fees that were not ascertained at the 
time of reporting, the Company may do so up to a level of a further £10,000. For the avoidance 
of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.

IMPLEMENTATION REPORT – UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The Remuneration Committee’s main responsibilities during the year
The Terms of Reference of the Committee (chaired by Bridget Guerin, with David Pusinelli the other
member) are available at www.charles-stanley.co.uk/committees. During 2014/15 the Committee’s 
main responsibilities were to:
 Determine the remuneration arrangements for the new Executive Directors;
 Monitor the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors;
 Monitor Executive Directors’ performance and to recommend PSP awards based on 
this performance to the Board;
 Determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration policy and the approval of all elements 
of pay for the Chairman of the Board and the other Executive Directors; and
 Prepare this Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Committee meets twice a year but more frequently if required. During 2014/15, eight Committee
meetings were held and details on attendance at meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance
Report on page 84. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than 
as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-Directorships or day-to-day involvement in
running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director plays a 
part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
How the Remuneration Committee sought advice
The Committee received independent remuneration advice during the year from its appointed advisers,
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT). FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group
(the professional body for such consultants) and adheres to its code of conduct. FIT provided no other
services to the Group, and accordingly the Committee was satisfied that the advice provided by FIT 
was objective and independent. FIT’s fees in respect of 2014/15 were £32,997 (2013/14: £48,000)
(exclusive of VAT). FIT’s fees were charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of business 
for advice provided. The Committee also consulted with Sir David Howard and Paul Abberley 
(save in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration) and the Group’s HR function.

Review of past performance
The graph below shows the value by 31 March 2015, on a total shareholder return basis, of £100
invested in the Company on 31 March 2009 compared with the value of £100 invested in the 
FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts). This Index is considered to be an appropriate
comparator for this purpose as it is a broad equity index of which the Company is a constituent.
The table below shows the total remuneration figure for Sir David Howard and Paul Abberley over the
same six year period. The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus paid in each of these
years. The new Regulations require this table to state proportion of annual bonus paid and long-term
incentive vesting in each relevant year as a percentage of the maximum available. However: 
 the Group did not operate with a maximum bonus opportunity until 2014/15; and
 No long-term incentive plan vested during these years.
Consequently, we have simply included the total remuneration in each of the relevant years, while 
also setting out details of the bonus each actually received based on performance in these years 
(the bonus level for 2014/15 being 0%).
These amounts are calculated using the same methodology as that used to produce the single figure
table. This includes a value for pensions that is based upon the increase in the Director’s accrued
pension in the year, which is a significant cause of the variance across the six year period for 
Sir David Howard.

Departed from the Board on 7 January 2015. In accordance with the terms of his service agreement Mr Rawlingson received 
a payment in lieu of salary of £115,000 for which he was entitled during his notice period together with £43,100 relating to 
contractual benefits to which he was entitled during his notice period (i.e. pension contribution, accrued holiday payment 
and modest other benefits). In addition and in line with the Company’s policy that the Company will pay due regard to the 
circumstances surrounding a termination (e.g. to avoid legal claims), the Committee agreed to pay a further payment of £30,000 
in respect of loss of office. A contribution of £2,500 was made towards Mr Rawlingson’s legal fees again in accordance with the 
Company’s policy.

This payment was made pursuant to a legacy profit sharing entitlement relating to Mr Scott’s previous role as an active investment 
manager prior to joining the Board and which will, in accordance with the Company’s policy on internal recruits and reflecting his 
continuing client relationship management responsibilities, continue for  2015/16 and 2016/17.

Benefits
An explanation of the benefits received by the Executive Directors can be found in the policy table 
on page 55. In summary, the benefits received by Executive Directors comprise a car allowance, 
private medical cover and telephone.
For the Non-executive Directors amounts reported relate to expenses such as travel and
accommodation expenditure incurred on Group business. While these payments are the 
reimbursement of expenses and not benefits per se, they are included as being a payment 
which is subject to tax. Sir David Howard also receives benefits relating to provision of a car.
Annual bonus outcomes for 2014/15
No annual bonuses were paid to Executive Directors in 2014/2015 under the main plan as there 
was no reported profit.
As described above, Anthony Scott received a payment pursuant to a legacy profit sharing arrangement
relating to his prior role as an active investment manager before joining the Board and reflecting his
continuing client relationship management responsibilities. The precise terms of this arrangement are
commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosed.
Pensions
The current Executive Directors participate in money purchase arrangements. Contributions have been made
into a SIPP for Anthony Scott and are taken as a salary supplement by the other Directors. Details of the levels
of pension arrangements can be found in the summary policy table on page 70.
Messrs Howard and Clark are members of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme which provides for a
pension equal to 1/60th of final salary (as defined) for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of
40/60ths. The scheme has a normal retirement age of 65.
Both of these Directors have now passed the age of 65 but neither is drawing a pension from it. Instead their
pension entitlement is accumulating by a figure determined in each case on advice from the scheme’s actuaries.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum benefit equal to nine times Michael Clark’s basic annual salary 
at the date of death is payable to him. This mirrors similar arrangements for the employees of Charles Stanley 
& Co Ltd.
More specific detail of the retirement benefits is provided below:

E Michael Clark —— 178,471 166,801 4,172,000 3,465,000 707,000
a) The accrued pension entitlement shown is that which would have been paid annually on retirement based upon pensionable 
service to the end of the financial year (or date of leaving the pension scheme if earlier), excluding any future statutory 
entitlement to increases prior to retirement which would be due after the financial year.
Sir David Howard and E Michael Clark are both above their respective normal retirement dates. The accrued pension 
entitlement shown in respect of these two members as at 31 March 2014 is at their respective normal retirement dates 
and not at their age on 31 March 2014. We have amended the accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of these 
two members as at 31 March 2015 to be at their age on 31 March 2015 and not at their respective normal retirement dates. 
The increase in the accrued pension entitlement over the period is due to late retirement factors being applied to their benefits. 
b) The value of remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2015 excludes allowance for any late retirement factors applied 
to benefits.
c) Directors in the scheme do not pay contributions. The value of remuneration is calculated using a modified version of 
HM Revenue and Customs’ tax rules for pension savings. The calculation methodology is laid out in the regulations. 
Normal retirement date means an age specified in the pension scheme rules (or otherwise determined) as the earliest 
age at which, while the individual continues to accrue benefits under the pension scheme, entitlement to a benefit arises 
a) without consent (whether of an employer, the trustees or managers of the scheme or otherwise), and b) without an 
actuarial reduction, but disregarding any special provision as to earlier repayment on grounds of ill health, redundancy 
or dismissal. Disclosure of benefits has been made in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2013 for Directors’ pension disclosures.

Share awards
Save As You Earn
In 2014/15, the Company operated three Save As You Earn Schemes, which were open to all employees
and Executive Directors, except Sir David Howard, once they have met the necessary service
requirements. Options were offered at a discount of 15% to the average of the mid-market closing 
price for the three days prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing 
three years after the saving contract commencement date. In common with similar schemes, 
the exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions.
As at 31 March 2015, no Directors held interests under the Save As You Earn Schemes.
Performance Share Plan 
As explained in the Directors’ remuneration policy, shareholder approval was granted for the new 
PSP at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on 1st August 2014. The following awards were
granted under the plan on 9th January for all Executive Directors. PSP awards were made at the
following levels: Mike Lilwall, Ben Money-Coutts, Anthony Scott and Gary Teper received PSP awards
of 50% of their salary; Paul Abberley received 100% of his salary.
The three year performance period for these awards will be measured following the year ended 
31 March 2017.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
For both the EPS and margin targets, the profit figure used will be the Group’s reported profit adding
back the FSCS (or similar) levy and adjusted for any other items that the Committee believe are
required to ensure that the Group’s true underlying financial performance is being measured.
The Committee approved these performance measures as they are directly linked to the objectives 
of driving growth and improved quality of profits, thereby enhancing shareholder value and providing 
a clear “line of sight” for participants between performance and reward.
The performance conditions applying to the 2015 Awards will also relate to (1) absolute targets in
Earnings per Share for 50% of the Award, and (2) margin targets for the other 50% of the Award, 
both measured based on performance in 2017/18. The details of these targets are shown in the

Stanley Report 14th Proof 24 June 2015_Stanley R/A 1st proof 16/3  23/06/2015  21:11  Page 74 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
This is the ninth annual corporate social
responsibility (CSR) report for the Group. 
The implementation and management of the 
CSR Policy is recognised as a Group-wide
responsibility and this report, made over the 
last 12 months, evidences the ongoing commitment
to CSR at all levels of the business. As a financial
services organisation, our primary responsibility 
is to maximise investment returns to our clients 
in accordance with our contractual relationships.
However, we continue to recognise the 
non-financial considerations that are taken 
into account in the running of our business and 
the wider network of stakeholders to whom the
Group has a responsibility. For this reason, the
Directors and senior managers within the Group
are committed to ensuring the Group interacts
responsibly with its employees, clients,
shareholders and the wider environment. 
Each year we report on our aim to develop 
our CSR Policy and practices in our four key 
areas: business integrity, our people, the
environment, and the community. The CSR
Committee meets biannually to review and 
develop policy in each of these areas.
BUSINESS INTEGRITY
Corporate governance
We follow the corporate governance guidelines
contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the “Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting
Council and annexed to the Listing Rules of the
UK Listing Authority.
We ensure that, where practical, the Group
complies with the Code or, where it has not done
so, explain why this is the case. We compete fairly
in the markets in which we operate and believe 
in the concept of business transparency and
ethical behaviour. More details can be found in 
the Corporate Governance Report on page 81.
The Group is an inaugural corporate member 
of the Chartered Institute for Securities and
Investment (CISI) and has signed up to its 
Code of Conduct. Core to this is the commitment
to support success in CISI qualifications and to
foster a culture of integrity, ethical behaviour 
and of continuing professional development 
for employees.
Client care
We are committed to the highest standard of
client care and support the FCA’s Treating
Customers Fairly regulatory framework. 
We work with our clients to ensure our
relationships deliver investment performance,
protection from inappropriate risk and
communications that are clear, fair and not
misleading.
Disclosure
All Charles Stanley staff are expected to conduct
business in such a way as to enhance the Group’s
reputation and to safeguard against unfair or
unethical business practices. Our disclosure 
policy (concerning instances of whistleblowing) 
is monitored and enforced where necessary.
Conscious of our obligations under the Bribery Act
2010 and other associated rules and regulations,
we take a zero tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption. We carry out periodic risk
assessments to determine exposure to the
possibility of these risks and update our policies
and procedures to mitigate them. We have strict
Anti-Bribery and Gifts and Hospitality policies 
in place, which are reviewed regularly as well 
as High Level Principles for Procurement.
PEOPLE
The Group acknowledges that the reputation 
and success of Charles Stanley is due to the
services provided to clients by highly qualified 
and committed staff. Our staff are one of the key
assets of the organisation and it is our policy to
attract and retain the best people from diverse
backgrounds and cultures, to create a vibrant
working environment that thrives on new ideas
and creative thinking.
Employee involvement
Charles Stanley recognises the importance of
ensuring that staff are kept informed of the 
latest developments within the business and 
our internal public relations team provides regular
email updates on all major events or initiatives. 
Our interactive intranet site is constantly 
updated and staff have the opportunity to 
make suggestions via the ‘suggestion box’ 
feature. We try to consult with staff on any
occasion where we feel that their interests 
may be affected and we arrange forums 
for discussion between staff and senior
management. All staff must participate 
in the appraisal system and dialogue with 
line managers is actively encouraged.
To enable staff to become involved in the 
financial performance of the Group, participation
in the Charles Stanley Save As You Earn Scheme 
(SAYE Scheme) and/or Share Incentive Plan 
(SIP) is encouraged. These schemes are open 
to all employees (with the exception of 
Sir David Howard, Bridget Guerin and 
David Pusinelli) with good take up for 
both schemes. SIP membership for 2015 
was 22.5% (2014: 22.7%). A new SAYE Scheme 
is launched each year, and 50% of all eligible 
staff now participate in at least one SAYE 
scheme.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Training
The Group continues to meet its business
objectives by having a highly trained and
professional workforce. We have a dedicated
learning and development department to ensure
that our training policy, designed to invest in 
staff, provides for career development and 
allows for succession planning.
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) 
is recognised as an important part of staff
development. All FCA authorised staff who
provide retail advice to clients hold a Statement 
of Professional Standing (SPS) in line with 
the FCA’s requirements. This means they 
adhere to the CISI Code of Conduct, 
FCA APER requirement and must achieve 
their CPD requirement each year.
Similarly, non-FCA authorised staff are
encouraged to gain appropriate professional
qualifications for their roles and are required 
to undertake sufficient and relevant continuing
professional development to ensure that their
skills are up to date. Our interactive learning 
and development website provides great access 
to materials and resources enabling their career
progression.
Benefits
The flexible benefits system called “Choice”
continues to be a success. Choice is an intranet
access application which allows staff to self-select
benefits which match their lifestyle. The Choice
system has proved very popular, with 79% 
(2014: 60%) of all employees participating in 
one or more flexible benefits.
The benefits currently included in the Choice
system are smart pension exchange, Denplan,
charitable give-as-you-earn, extra death in service
life cover, childcare vouchers, and the ability to
acquire additional annual leave. We have also
introduced some new benefits for 2015 including a
mobile phone scheme, cancer screening and 
the option to apply for a discount card with the
Gourmet Society. All these benefits offer savings
through salary sacrifice. The Choice benefits are

for all our employees including interest-free
season ticket loans, above average contributions 
to pensions, private medical insurance, permanent
health insurance and death in service benefits.
To ensure the health and wellbeing of our
workforce we also provide subsidised gym
membership in London and a Ride-2-Work Scheme
that allows employees to purchase bicycles at 
a reduced cost for the purpose of commuting.
The Group provides an employee assistance
programme, First Assist, which offers a
confidential helpline providing advice on a 
wide range of health and wellbeing issues. 
We also provide access to dedicated medical
facilities in the London offices including annual
health screening.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment made by disabled
persons are given full and fair consideration,
having regard to the particular aptitudes and
abilities of the applicant. In the event of
employees becoming disabled, the Group makes
every effort to ensure the individuals’ continuing
employment within the Group through the
provision of suitable equipment and arranging
appropriate training as necessary. The Group
ensures that, so far as is possible, the training,
career development and promotion of disabled
employees are identical to that of other staff
members.
Ethos
Charles Stanley believes in supporting the
work/life balance of all of our employees. 
We do not expect our employees to work
excessive or unnecessary hours and we 
provide childcare vouchers and the possibility 
of flexible working hours.
In addition to the above we also have policies 
in place to ensure that all employees can expect 
a working environment free from discrimination
and harassment. We believe in informing and
involving our employees and we consistently 
strive to improve our staff retention rates. 
Staff losses were 11.35% (2014: 9.1%), with 
gains of 17.52% (2014: 17.9%).
The Company is a Living Wage employer having
made a commitment to meet the living wage for 
all staff and principal contractors who work on 
the premises.
Diversity policy
Equality of respect and recognition is central to
how we treat each other at Charles Stanley and 
to how we treat all of those with whom we do
business. The Group recognises the value of a
diverse and skilled workforce and of maintaining
an inclusive and collaborative workplace culture
that will engender sustainability and excellence 
of service to our clients.
The Group has a clearly defined diversity policy
which is reflected in our recruitment processes,
flexible working options and equal opportunities
policy. The Group has a strong commitment 
to ensuring that all our staff meet our high
standards; a key factor in this is making sure 
that employees are selected from the widest 
pool of talent possible.
Currently approximately 14% of our trainees 
are female and, while not imposing any form 
of discrimination, we continued to try to 
raise this proportion over the year to 40%. 
The Group is aware of the European Commission
recommendations on gender diversity and
acknowledges that Boards perform better when
they include people of different backgrounds, 
skill sets and perspectives. At 31 March 2015,
women make up 41.0% of all Charles Stanley
employees, 12.5% of the Board is female and
33.3% of the Non-executive Directors are 
female (above the European Commission’s
recommendation).
Whilst we believe that we are successful 
in implementing our diversity policy, we
acknowledge that the diversity of our workforce
can always improve and we are open to new
initiatives to encourage it.
COMMUNITY
The Group continues to foster strong relationships
with the communities in which we are based and
we have links with local businesses, primary
schools and charities. We are a socially responsible
employer and aim to make a positive contribution,
both locally and nationally, as a sustainable and
responsible business leader.
Schools
One of our stronger community links continues 
to be Lawdale Primary School which is 
co-ordinated by the Tower Hamlets Business
Education Partnership. Since 2007 a group 
of London-based employees volunteer to visit 
the school on a weekly basis to assist the 
children with their reading. The school has
confirmed that the pupils on the scheme 
improved their reading and comprehension at
double the rate of those who are not part of 
any scheme. Charles Stanley is keen to have 
a positive impact on the local community 
and continues to develop initiatives for local
involvement.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Charities
Delete Blood Cancer UK was chosen by a staff
vote to be the Charles Stanley’s Charity of the Year
for 2014/15. This charity aims to increase the pool 
of lifesaving stem cell donors for those diagnosed
with blood cancer. Through the hard work and
generosity of the staff, £15,000 was raised for 
the charity.
Our Charity of the Year for 2015/16, again chosen
by popular vote, is Great Ormond Street Hospital
Children’s Charity. This charity raises money to
provide world class care for the hospital’s young
patients and their families, by contributing to 
the rebuilding and refurbishment of the hospital,
supporting ground breaking research and
providing accommodation for parents. We
anticipate another successful year of fundraising.
In addition to our Charity of the Year, the Group is
committed to sponsoring individual staff members
who are taking part in fundraising for charity.
There are also various charity events held
throughout the year across our branch network.
The Group also offers employees the facility to
give-as-they-earn in a tax efficient manner via 
the Charities Aid Foundation.
ENVIRONMENT
The Group continues to recognise its impact on
the environment and takes steps to minimise it.
Although our activities have only a comparatively
small impact, Charles Stanley is aware that
environmental risks and uncertainties impact 
to some extent on all companies.
Health and safety
The Group is committed to ensuring a working
environment that meets and exceeds the required
health and safety standards. All our staff have
access to and are encouraged to practice the
Health and Safety Policy. The Policy is reviewed
and updated on an ongoing basis taking into
account any changes in the law and staff are
notified of any changes that are made. In the past
year, the Group has introduced an interactive
health and safety training portal, which ensures
staff are inducted in, and are regularly reminded 
of current Health and Safety regulations and 
our Policy.
Mandatory Greenhouse Gas report results
This report details Charles Stanley's Greenhouse
Gas (GHG) emissions for the 12 months ending 
31 March 2015. 
Using an operational approach Charles Stanley
Group identified all of the activities and facilities
for which it is responsible that generate carbon
emissions and reported on the material GHG
emissions. Scopes 1 and 2 activity data were
identified and collected and provided to
independent consultant, Carbon Clear. 
The validity and completeness of the data 
were checked both in-house and by Carbon Clear
and used to calculate the GHG emissions for 
the Charles Stanley Group. The calculations
performed follow the ISO-14064-1:2006 standard
and give absolute and intensity factors for the
Group's emissions.
The results show that total gross GHG emissions
in the period were comprised of the following:
Direct Emissions (Scope 1) amounted to 79.4
tonnes of CO2e or 4% of Charles Stanley's total
GHG emissions (2014: 117.3 tonnes); and
Indirect Emissions (Scope 2) amounted to 2,172.2
tonnes of CO2e or 96% of Charles Stanley's total
GHG emissions (2014: 1,761.2 tonnes).

Environmental initiatives
During the past year all electricity procured across
the property portfolio have been transferred to
‘green’ renewable energy sources. The properties
with half-hourly reporting electricity meters have
been monitored and plant running times reduced
or plant shut down when not essential to reduce
energy consumption and operating energy cost.
We assess the environmental policy of our
principal contractors and aim to source products
from sustainable suppliers. All our marketing and
publicity documentation is made from sustainably
sourced paper and we recycle almost 60% of all
waste produced in our London offices. We also
organise specialist recycling of light tubes and
batteries. Our offices benefit from motion sensor
lights which help to save energy consumption and
we operate an automated shutdown process which
ensures all monitors are switched off overnight.
We utilise a software application which allows
Board and Committee papers to be distributed
electronically, eliminating the need for printing
lengthy Board packs and thus saving resources.
Our printers include the pull printing feature
which requires user authentication at the printer
station in order to retrieve documents. Research
shows that this methodology significantly reduces
the amount of paper wasted by unwanted printing,
as well as increasing security and efficiency.
Charles Stanley remains committed to seeking 
out new and innovative ways to reduce our
environmental impact.
Commitment
Charles Stanley continues to run a Ride-2-Work
Scheme on an annual basis and this not only
promotes a healthier lifestyle for our employees,
but also reduces the environmental impact of the
journey to work for those employees who take
part in the scheme. There were 11 new entrants 
to the scheme this year (2014: 23).
Charles Stanley continues to build on its efforts 
to encourage recycling at all of our offices, by
encouraging all staff to separate recyclable 
waste from general waste. This has resulted 
in a significant decrease in the amount of waste
being sent to landfill. We recognise that the
business saves costs and increases efficiency
through reducing and managing resource use, 
and that we have a responsibility to promote
environmentally friendly business practices as 
part of our commitment to the local community
and our wider network of stakeholders. Ultimately,
we aim to ensure that a responsible environmental
policy is implemented consistently across our
entire branch network.
Investment
Finally, whilst the overall investment policy of 
the Group is concerned solely with obtaining the
best return for clients, in addition to the financial
analysis that occurs as part of normal investment
procedures, we also offer our clients a completely
bespoke, socially responsible investment service
which takes into account their personal
preferences in relation to environmental and
ethical matters.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
The Directors recognise the benefits of good
corporate governance and are committed to a 
high standard of compliance with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 
(the Code). The Directors ensure that the
Company keeps up to date with all corporate
governance developments and best practice
wherever practical. A copy of the Code may 
be viewed at www.frc.org.uk.
The Code governs the relationship between 
the constituent parts of the Company, namely 
the Board and its committees; relations with
shareholders; and accountability and audit. 
The current position of the Group in each of 
these areas is explained in the paragraphs 
below, together with the Directors’ Report 
(pages 48 to 50), the Directors’ Remuneration
Report (pages 53 to 74) and Strategic Report
(pages 9 to 47), describing how the principles 
are applied within the Group.
THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
The Group has a two-tier management structure
which comprises the Board of the parent
Company, Charles Stanley Group PLC 
(the Board) and the Board of its primary
operating subsidiary, Charles Stanley & Co.
Limited. There are four companies within the
Group that are regulated by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (the FCA).
At the beginning of the financial year the Board
comprised nine Directors, being the Chairman, 
six Executive Directors and two Non-executive
Directors. During the year Sir David Howard
relinquished the position as Chief Executive
Officer to comply with the requirement of
separating the roles of Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer under the Capital Requirements
Directive of the European Union (CRD IV). 
Sir David remains on the Board as Non-executive
Chairman. Paul Abberley was appointed to the
Board on 19 December 2014, and became 
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. 
James Rawlingson resigned as a Director of 
the Company on 7 January 2015. The Company
announced on 19 March 2015 that Ben Money-
Coutts had been appointed as Chief Financial
Officer and would became a Director of the
Company upon receipt of regulatory approval 
by the FCA, which was granted on 10 June 2015.
Michael Clark resigned as a Director of the
Company on 31 March 2015.
The Company falls within the definition of a
“smaller company” within the Code, for which 
the Code provides that there should be “at least
two independent Non-executive Directors”.
Two of the Non-executive Directors, 
David Pusinelli and Bridget Guerin, have been
determined by the Board to be independent.
David Pusinelli is the Senior Independent Director.
Sir David Howard is not considered to be
independent. The Non-executive Directors
provide a robust, independent element on the
Board and they constructively challenge and
examine the performance of management. 
They bring well-considered and constructive
opinions, skill and knowledge to Board
discussions.
In January 2015, an Executive Committee,
reporting to the Board of Charles Stanley & Co.
Limited was formed. The Committee meets 
weekly to manage the day-to-day running of the
Company. The Executive Committee consists of
the Executive Directors, the Chief Risk Officer, 
the Head of Distribution and the Chief Operating
Officer. The Head of Compliance attends the
meetings on request, but is not a member of the
Committee to ensure that the role remains
independent from the executive management 
of the Company.
The Company maintains a formal schedule of
matters which require direct Board oversight
and/or approval. This schedule is approved by 
the Board annually. The matters for which
approval is retained by the Board include:
 Overall management of the Group;
 Setting of Group strategy and long-term 
objectives;
 Reviewing Group performance;
 Annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any material changes to them;
 Changes to capital or corporate structure;
 Internal controls and risk management;
 Interim and Annual report and accounts and 
financial statements;
 Approval of the dividend policy and 
declaration or recommendation of dividends;
 Major capital projects, material contracts, 
major investments or disposals;

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
 Changes to Board composition;
 Remuneration policy and any introduction 
of or changes to share incentive plans; and
 Material litigation.
In addition to the scheduled Board meetings, 
at which strategy is periodically reviewed and
debated, all the members of the Board (including
the Non-executive Directors) as well as the
remaining members of the Executive Committee
took part in a full day meeting in May 2015 to 
discuss and develop the Group’s strategic
objectives. The objectives having been set 
and prioritised, there followed a significant
programme of debate and engagement amongst
Directors and senior managers to develop and
articulate the Group’s strategic priorities in 
more extensive detail.
The FCA has been conducting a major policy
initiative to raise the standards surrounding the
suitability of investment advice and management
provided to private clients, trusts and charities,
and the completeness of the record-keeping. 
In common with a number of regulated companies
in the same field this has occupied a considerable
amount of our management time. We have 
re-shaped elements of our governance structure 
to meet this challenge, creating appropriate
working groups, and a governance committee
comprising the Board of Directors so as to
supervise the process.
Other Board initiatives during the year include:
 Major reorganisation of the Group’s Boards 
and Committees;
 The recruitment of a Chief Executive Officer 
to split Sir David Howard’s dual role;
 Recruitment of a Chief Risk Officer and the 
creation of an independent Risk department, 
reporting jointly to the CEO and the 
Risk Committee;
 Establishment of an Executive Committee; and
 Oversight of the sale process for Charles 
Stanley Securities and Charles Stanley 
Financial Solutions.
Changes within the Group structure
Much of the Group’s detailed operational activity
is conducted by the principal subsidiary Charles
Stanley & Co. Limited, both by its Board and by 
its range of committees. This includes oversight 
of the other group subsidiary companies, which
work together collectively to offer a variety of
services to our client base, so as to produce
optimal customer outcomes. Part of the growth 
of the Group derives from the acquisition of good
quality complementary businesses, and unless
there is a particular reason to retain the separate
identity of the acquired business our approach 
is to absorb it into an existing subsidiary and 
wind down what remains. This is in line with 
our policy of seeking always to simplify the 
Group structure.
The business of our subsidiary Charles Stanley
Pan Asset Capital Management Limited 
has now been successfully absorbed into 
Charles Stanley & Co. Limited, and its
authorisation by the FCA has been withdrawn.
Development
Appropriate training and induction is made
available to newly appointed Directors, taking 
into account any previous experience they may
already have as Directors of a public limited
company or otherwise. Training sessions are
undertaken for the entire Board and individually
as appropriate.
Board effectiveness review
In December 2013 the Board appointed 
CMS Cameron McKenna LLP to conduct a 
formal review of its effectiveness, and this took
the form of interviews with a number of Directors,
extensive study of Board and management papers
(including minutes of the committee meetings),
and attendance at Group and subsidiary Board
meetings. This incorporated the views of the 
Non-executive Directors on the performance of
the Chairman. The table on page 83 shows the 
key points raised in this review in relation to 
both the Charles Stanley Group PLC Board (CSG) 
and the Charles Stanley & Co Limited Board
(CSC) and the actions that the Company has
taken.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
Appointment of Directors
The appointment of the Directors is governed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association, the
Companies Act 2006 and other applicable
regulations and policies, and is subject to
recommendation by the Nomination Committee.
The Directors’ service agreements or letters of
appointment are available from the Company
Secretary for inspection. In accordance with 
the Articles of Association Directors are elected
by the shareholders of the Company in general
meeting, or, if appointed by the Board between
general meetings, confirmed by the shareholders
at the subsequent general meeting. Although the
Code does not provide that Directors of smaller
companies need submit themselves for re-election
annually the policy of the Company is that 
they should do so, and accordingly five 
Directors seek the support of shareholders for
their re-election at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting. Being the first Annual General
Meeting since their formal appointment Paul
Abberley, Ben Money-Coutts and Anthony Scott
offer themselves for election. Biographies of 
each of the Directors (including Paul Abberley)
are set out on pages 51 and 52.
The number of meetings of the Board and 
of its committees attended by each of the
Directors during the year is shown below.
After due consideration, the Chairman confirms
that in his view all the Directors continue to
perform effectively and demonstrate commitment
to the role, and he recommends that all Directors
be re-elected by shareholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has a policy and effective procedures
for managing and, where appropriate, approving
conflicts or potential conflicts of interest.
Directors are invited periodically to confirm 
or amend any conflicts of interest and are
encouraged to report these as and when they
arise. A Register of Conflicts is held by the
Company Secretary and a log of all conflicts 
raised is maintained and updated accordingly. 
All Directors are aware that it is their
responsibility to raise and update any 
conflicts of interest they may have.
Committees of the Board
The Board had four standing committees at 
the end of the year: the Nomination Committee,
Remuneration Committee, Risk Committee and
the Audit Committee. These Committees have
written terms of reference, which are reviewed
regularly and any amendments are approved 
by the Board. Minutes of all Board Committee
meetings are reviewed by the Board. The terms 
of reference of the Audit, Nomination and
Remuneration Committees can be viewed 
on the Company’s website, together with
Committee membership.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors meet
frequently throughout the year without Executive
Directors present, but these meetings are either
informal or in the context of other committee
meetings. Similarly, while the three Non-executive
Directors meet frequently and on their own during
the year this arrangement is informal. To meet
Code provision A.4.2, more formal meetings are
being held by the Non-executive Directors with
and without the Non-executive Chairman.
All the Committees are able to call on
independent professional advisers if they 
consider it necessary.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the two
independent Non-executive Directors, 
David Pusinelli and Bridget Guerin. It is chaired 
by David Pusinelli, who qualified as an ACA at
Coopers & Lybrand and has extensive experience
within the financial services sector. The Board is
satisfied that he has recent and relevant financial
experience. A report from the Audit Committee 
is set out on pages 90 to 93 of this Report.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the 
two independent Non-executive Directors, 
David Pusinelli and Bridget Guerin. It is chaired 
by Bridget Guerin. A report from the Committee 
is set out on pages 53 to 74 of this Report. 
This includes a description of the proposals to
include significant performance-related elements
in the remuneration package of the Executive
Directors, which, for the year under review,
broadly reflected corporate rather than individual
performance. Principle D.1 of the Code provides
that remuneration should be structured to link
rewards both to corporate and individual
performance. The PSP award, outlined in 
the report of the Remuneration Committee, 
was implemented during the year.
Risk Committee
Following the recommended actions of the Board
Effectiveness Review, the Board Risk Committee
was created in July 2014. Its composition and
responsibilities are detailed on pages 87 and 88 
of this Report.
Nomination Committee
Composition and responsibilities
The Committee chaired by David Pusinelli
comprises Sir David Howard (Non-executive
Chairman), and the two independent 
Non-executive Directors, David Pusinelli 
and Bridget Guerin. 
A report from the Nomination Committee 
is set out on page 89.
Diversity
The Group is committed to extending the
proportion of female employment and
representation. 12.5% of the Board is female.
Further details about diversity in the Company 
are contained in the report on Corporate Social
Responsibility on pages 75 to 80.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising
the Board on all Corporate Governance matters 
as well as ensuring good information flows within
the Board and its Committees. All Directors have
access to the services of the Company Secretary
and may take, if necessary, independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Company has granted indemnities to all of its
Directors (and Directors of subsidiary companies)
on terms consistent with the applicable statutory
provisions. Qualifying third party indemnity
provisions for the purposes of section 234 of 
the Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in 
force just after the end of the financial year 
ended 31 March, and remain in force at the 
date of this report.
Insurance
The Company maintains appropriate insurance
cover in respect of litigation against the Directors.
Relationship with shareholders
The Company places great importance on
communication with shareholders and aims 
to keep shareholders informed by regular
communication. Directors meet regularly with 
the Company’s institutional investors, analysts 
and financial press. The Company’s website is 
kept up-to-date with investor relations material,
including annual and interim reports, and these
are also distributed to anyone expressing an
interest in the Company. The Board is provided
with regular feedback following meetings with
shareholders. The Company welcomes all
shareholders to its AGM, with the opportunity 
to ask questions formally at the meeting or 
more informally with all members of the Board
afterwards. The Company’s policy is to announce
at the AGM the number of proxy votes cast on
resolutions.
Going concern
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in
business for the foreseeable future and that it is
therefore appropriate for the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2015 to have been
prepared on a going concern basis.
Compliance with the principles and 
provisions of the Code
At the start of 2015, as detailed above, Sir David
Howard stepped down as Chief Executive Officer
allowing the Company to comply with the 
Code provisions and CRD IV. As a result 
of Sir David Howard stepping down as 
Chief Executive Officer and the succession 
by Paul Abberley, the Company now complies 
with the provisions of the Code.

RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
The Board established the Risk Committee during
the first half of this year to provide centralised
oversight and advice in relation to the risk exposure
of the Group and its risk appetite. The roles and
responsibilities of the Risk Committee as well as its
activities over the last year are set out in this report.
The Risk Committee is comprised of 
two independent Non-executive Directors –
Bridget Guerin (Chairman) and David Pusinelli. 
The Committee meets at least four times a year 
with additional meetings being scheduled as
deemed necessary. The meetings are attended 
by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and any other
employees as and when required. In the past year,
attendees included the Head of Compliance and 
the Chief Executive Officer.
The CRO reports to the Committee on a number 
of matters including:
 Issues arising from the Enterprise Risk 
Management Committee which is chaired 
by the CRO;
 ICAAP related matters;
 Internal Audit findings and recommendations;
 Any policy breaches and proposed actions; and
 Any other key risk issues that require the 
attention and input from the Risk Committee.
Following recent revisions to the Group’s
governance structure, the Committee has 
reviewed its terms of reference and these 
have been approved by the Board.
Committee responsibilities:
Responsibilities of the Risk Committee include:
 Reviewing and providing challenge to the 
ICAAP to ensure that the overall risk appetite, 
tolerance and strategy remain appropriate 
for the Company;
 Ensuring the Risk Management function has 
adequate resources and appropriate access 
to information to enable it to perform its 
function effectively;
 Approving the annual Compliance plan;
 Reviewing the Group’s risk exposure and 
adherence with the Group’s risk appetite 
and any management action;
 Advising and providing relevant information 
to other Committees and the Board on 
risk management issues including proposed 
changes to strategic direction;
 Oversight and sanction of the Group’s risk 
and control management framework; and
 Reviewing material breaches and assessing 
the adequacy of proposed management action.
Committee activities:
The Risk Committee has undertaken the following
key activities over the last year:
 Appointment of the CRO;
 Approval of appropriate resources for the 
new dedicated Risk function;
 Defined the role and responsibilities of the 
Committee through the Terms of Reference;
 Reviewed and monitored management 
responsiveness to internal audit findings 
and recommendations in conjunction with 
the Audit Committee; and
 Reviewed the role and responsibilities of 
the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Committee which is chaired by the CRO 
and attended by the Chief Executive Officer, 
Head of Compliance and other staff as 
necessary.
Risk Management Framework:
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) allows 
the organisation to identify, assess, manage and
monitor risks that the Group faces in relation to 
the execution of its business objectives and strategy.
The Group uses the three lines of defence model to
manage risk and provide assurance to management
and the Board of the level of effectiveness of the
Group’s control environment.
 The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that risk is appropriately managed 
in the Group through a robust control 
environment. Any risk events or areas of

AND GOVERNANCE
concern that have arisen in the business are 
initially brought to the ERM Committee and 
escalated, as appropriate, firstly to the 
Executive Committee (ExCo) followed by 
the Board;
 The Risk Committee is an oversight committee 
and is responsible for ensuring that risk 
monitoring and escalation to the Board/ExCo 
operates appropriately within the agreed 
framework. The CRO provides the 
Risk Committee with a report of all risk 
related activities and concerns;
 The risk department has set up a series of 
rolling business and support area reviews 
through which the ERM Committee brings 
in business and department heads for detailed 
deep dive reviews of risks associated with their 
business or activity. This ensures that every 
area of the Group has undergone scrutiny at 
least annually which supplements the regular 
risk reporting provided by all departments to 
the risk team;
 The risk department provides a monthly report 
to the ERM Committee which includes current 
issues and a series of metrics. Risk also 
prepares an ICAAP risk monitoring report 
for the Board on a monthly basis; and
 As part of the annual ICAAP process, senior 
management participate in workshops to 
identify key scenarios and stress test 
parameters. The risk appetite of the 
Group is set by the Board.

MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The Committee comprises myself as Chairman, 
Sir David Howard (Non-executive Chairman of 
the Board) and Bridget Guerin, an independent
Non-executive Director who chairs the Risk and
Remuneration Committees. In addition, the Chief
Executive Officer attends meetings by invitation 
and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to 
the Committee. The Committee held four regular
meetings during the year and all three members
attended all four meetings.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the
composition of the Board and Board Committees 
to ensure they are properly constituted and
balanced in terms of skills, experience and 
diversity. In particular, the Committee manages 
the search process for new Directors and
recommends to the Board the appointment 
of such Directors as well as considering 
succession planning more widely.
MAIN ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
The principal focus of activity has been considering
and responding to the Board Effectiveness Review
commissioned in the previous year (referred to in
more detail on page 82) as well as the implications 
of CRD IV in terms of the combining of roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
One of the conclusions of this review was that
corporate governance could be both simplified 
and strengthened by conforming the memberships
of the Boards of both Charles Stanley Group PLC
and Charles Stanley & Co. Limited, the principal
regulated subsidiary in the group. As a result,
certain Executive Directors of the subsidiary
resigned from that Board and Bridget Guerin 
and I were appointed as Non-executive Directors.
As a further consequence, Sir David Howard
stepped down as Chief Executive Officer last
September and the Committee initiated the process
for appointing his successor. An independent
external search consultancy, Crewdson & Partners,
was retained for the appointment and both internal
and external candidates interviewed. This led to the
recommendation that Paul Abberley be appointed
as Chief Executive Officer last December.
Following the resignation of James Rawlingson as
Chief Financial Officer last January, the Committee
considered the options for his succession and
concluded, after a careful review of his
qualifications, that the role was best filled by a
strong internal candidate, Ben Money-Coutts, 
who was appointed as Chief Financial Officer 
with effect from 19 March 2015 and appointed 
to the Board following regulatory approval from 
the FCA on 10 June 2015.
The Committee considered the benefits of diversity,
including gender, during these deliberations on
these positions, which were filled by the most
qualified candidates based on merit. The Committee
is mindful of the benefits of diversity and 12.5% 
of the Board is female. Further details about
diversity are contained in the report on 
Corporate Social Responsibility on pages 75 to 80.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S
INTRODUCTION
The past year has seen significant changes 
in the oversight and control functions of 
Charles Stanley. Key changes have been made 
to the Board membership, Board roles and the
Group’s various committee structures. Both our
Compliance and Finance Departments have been
restructured and a Risk Department under a 
CRO has been established. Finally, the processes
surrounding client take-on and suitability
assessment have been substantively revised. 
As well as conducting its regular activities, 
the Audit Committee has played an active part 
in ensuring these changes have taken place in a
measured way to deliver substantially enhanced
governance and controls.
ROLE, RESPONSIBILITIES AND 
MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE
The role and responsibilities of the Committee are
set out in terms of reference which are reviewed
annually and approved by the Board.
The Committee comprises the independent 
Non-executive Directors, being myself as 
Chairman and Bridget Guerin. The Board is
satisfied that we have recent and relevant 
financial experience. I am a chartered accountant
and both Bridget and I have extensive experience
of the financial services industry. We met on 
eight occasions during the year. The Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
Head of Internal Audit and external audit partner
and manager attend most meetings by invitation. 
The Head of Compliance attends when required.
ACTIVITIES OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
DURING THE YEAR
The Committee has established an annual cycle 
of work to ensure all responsibilities are duly
discharged. Each of our meetings has addressed 
a number of standing agenda items, plus additional
current matters such as reports issued by 
Internal Audit since the previous Committee
meeting. The work undertaken within the
Committee during the year principally fell 
into the following three main areas:
1 Internal controls
 Reviewed and agreed the scope of the 
risk-based audit plan as proposed by 
Internal Audit;
 Considered reports from the internal auditors 
and their assessment of relevant mitigating 
controls;
 Monitored progress in resolving audit issues 
raised in audit reports;
 Reviewed the resources of the internal audit 
function and agreed the costs; and
 Considered the effectiveness of the 
Audit Committee.
2 External audit
 Considered and approved the audit approach, 
and scope of the audit work;
 Reviewed reports on audit findings;
 Reviewed and approved the policy on the 
independence of the external auditors;
 Considered the independence of the auditors 
with particular focus on the nature of 
non-audit work as well as the mix of audit 
and non-audit fees;
 Considered the recommendations of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code regarding 
external audit; and
 Considered letters of representation given 
to the external auditors by management.
3 Accounting, tax and financial reporting
 Reviewed the annual financial statements;
 Considered all significant financial reporting 
judgements;
 Considered the appropriateness of preparing 
the annual financial statements on a going 
concern basis; and
 Reviewed principal disclosures in the financial 
statements with particular regard to those 
areas subject to significant financial reporting 
judgements.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The provision of internal audit activities has 
been outsourced to Grant Thornton. This provides
flexible resourcing and ensures access to a full
range of audit expertise across the Group’s
businesses.
The audit plan is approved annually in advance by
the Committee. We maintain a rolling three-year
plan to ensure all critical areas of the business 
are covered over this period then overlay a risk
assessment to determine the prioritisation of the
internal audit plan for the coming year.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The annual budget for the internal audit function
is agreed between me and the Chief Financial
Officer having regard to the planned scope of
work. The cost of any ad hoc or additional work
required over the course of the year is also
reviewed and agreed by the Committee and 
the Chief Financial Officer as it arises.
The Committee reviews Internal Audit reports
considering the effectiveness of mitigating controls
and proposed actions to address any issues found.
Particular attention has been paid during the year
to ensuring that all proposed management actions
arising are tracked to completion on a timely basis.
A total of 13 reports were undertaken by Internal
Audit and reviewed by the Committee this year.
Major topics covered included a number of reviews
of our client take-on processes and suitability
assessments which have been substantially
upgraded over the past 18 months; a review of the
effectiveness of the Group Compliance function;
and a review of our CASS procedures to ensure
that they are in line with the current requirements
of the FCA.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
Performance and effectiveness of our 
external auditor
During the year we have reviewed the
effectiveness of KPMG who are our external
auditors. Whilst the review highlighted several
ways of improving communication between the
firm and KPMG, we remain very satisfied with 
the performance and effectiveness of the audit
services received.
Non-audit services
We have reviewed the independence and the
nature of non-audit services supplied by KPMG
and non-audit fee levels relative to the audit fee.
Our prior approval is required where the fee for 
an individual non-audit service is expected to
exceed £50,000. Fees for non-audit services paid
to the auditor should not, in aggregate, exceed
100% of the audit fee or £360,000 in any year
without our prior written approval.
We recognise that, given their knowledge of the
business, there are often advantages in using the
external auditor to provide certain non-audit
services. Fees other than for audit or assurance
payable to KPMG in 2015 were £85,975 
(2014: £677,000).
We have reviewed the safeguards to 
independence that have been put in place by
KPMG in undertaking the non-audit engagements
throughout the year and are satisfied that these
are appropriate. The safeguards and terms of
engagement were reviewed and approved by 
us prior to KPMG commencing work.
We agreed the external auditor’s fees (which are
shown in note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements) and reviewed the audit engagement
letter. We also had discussions with the external
auditor with no management present to provide 
an opportunity for any concerns to be raised and
discussed.
Audit tender
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
audits should be subject to tender at least once
every ten years. KPMG was appointed as the
group auditor for the 2011 year end as a result 
of a competitive tender process and the
Committee intends to conduct an audit tender
process again before the tenth anniversary thereof.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED 
BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Following discussions with both management 
and the external auditor the Committee has
determined that the following areas form the 
key risks to misstatement of the annual financial
statements:
1. Impairment of goodwill;
2. Impairment of intangible and other 
non-financial assets;
3. Available for sale assets and other receivables;
4. Risk of losses arising from litigation;
5. Pension deficit; and
6. Assets Held for sale and discontinued 
operations.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill has arisen over many years, principally
from the acquisition of subsidiaries, and typically
represents the difference between the total cost 
of acquisition and the fair values of the assets of
the acquired business. Goodwill is shown at a
value of £16.0 million (2014: £25.5 million) on 
the balance sheet and is detailed in note 14.
We have considered the review of goodwill 
which is performed by management annually 
or earlier if an erosion of goodwill is suspected.
Stanley Report 14th Proof 24 June 2015_Stanley R/A 1st proof 16/3  23/06/2015  21:11  Page 91 Charles Stanley Group PLC

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
The review requires that impairment is made if 
the recoverable amount is less than its carrying
value. The policy adopted is first, to calculate fair
value less cost to sell and to consider value in 
use only if the carrying value fails this first test.
The majority of the goodwill (£9.1 million) 
relates to private client investment management
businesses acquired and no impairment is
considered necessary in relation to these other
than in relation to the Durlacher business.
Last year, the Durlacher business, which was
primarily an options trading business, accounted
for £1.5 million of goodwill. The Group ceased 
this option trading business during the current
year and transferred all the assets under
management to a third party for nil consideration.
Accordingly this goodwill has been written off 
in its entirety.
Charles Stanley Direct accounted for £5.2 million
(2014: £8.2 million) of goodwill. This business
comprises our on-line investment service and
includes the former direct businesses known as
Garrison and Fastrade which have been subsumed
into the Charles Stanley Direct cash generating
unit.
Charles Stanley Direct is an award winning
platform, continues to grow its core assets and
revenues at a healthy rate and is trending toward
profitability. Nevertheless, considerable judgment
is required to quantify future revenue flows and
profitability and the conclusion has been made
that it would be appropriate to write down the
value of its attributable goodwill by £3.0 million.
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions and the
employee benefit business run out of Plymouth
account for £1.5 million of the total goodwill
balance (2014: £3.5 million). The Board has
announced that it has signed Heads of Agreement
to sell Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Ltd
which is consequently now Held for sale. 
The goodwill attributed to these businesses 
has been written down by £2.0 million to take
account respectively of the anticipated proceeds
and expenses of sale and future trading prospects
of the Plymouth business.
Impairment of intangible and 
other non-financial assets
The Committee considers that the principal area
for review is the impairment of client lists brought
to the firm following the acquisition of individual
or teams of investment managers. These were
valued at £7.3 million as at 31 March 2015 
(2014: 8.6 million). These assets are amortised
over their useful life, which causes them to be
reflected on the balance sheet as decreasing 
in value each year.
The Committee has looked for evidence of
impairment in light of the loss of any senior
investment managers that may indicate the 
risk of outflow of clients and associated funds
under management. During the second half of 
the year the Truro team, whose customer list had
a carrying value of £1.1 million at the half year, 
left to join a rival firm. Whilst a number of Truro
clients have now transferred to other Charles
Stanley branches, the Board has considered 
it appropriate to write down the value of this
customer list by 75% to £0.3 million and an
impairment charge of £0.7 million has been
recognized.
The Committee has also reviewed evidence
prepared by management which monitors the
causes of the underlying rate of loss of clients.
During the year, the closure of client accounts
stayed low and the main cause of lost clients
remained death which erodes the client base 
by 3% to 4% each year.
The Committee considered the useful lives of 
the customer lists acquired under a business
combination and those acquired on an ongoing
basis. The Committee determined that it was 
not appropriate to continue to recognise a
difference in the useful lives and accordingly
decided that all customer lists should be amortised
over a 10 year period, being a conservative
reflection of actual experience.
Part of the consideration payable for 
Charles Stanley Pan Asset Capital Management 
is contingent on certain AuM targets being
achieved, which the Group now considers

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
unlikely. Accordingly, the deferred consideration
has been reduced and an impairment charge has
been recognised to reduce the corresponding
intangible asset to £1.1 million (from £1.4 million).
Available for sale assets and other receivables
During the year the Group impaired the value 
of its investment and loan in Masterlist by 
writing it down from £1.0 million to £0.25 million.
The £0.75 million impairment charge is included 
in the consolidated income statement.
Risk of losses arising from litigation
Risk of losses from litigation is dealt with in 
note 29.
The Committee recognises that all commercial
enterprises are at risk of losses arising from
litigation, either because the firm loses the legal
case or from material legal costs arising, and that
this can be material to the financial statements.
Accordingly, management performs a review of
actual and potential sources of litigation at the
financial year end and during the period leading
up to the signing of the annual financial
statements.
A competitor company has taken legal action
against the Group over the recruitment of a
number of individuals associated with the 
opening of the Leicester branch. The competitor
alleges, amongst other things, losses of 
£1.6 million. Charles Stanley has lodged a 
defence both against the basis of the claim 
and its amount.
The Committee recognises that management has
discussed this case with their legal advisers and
has also taken action to mitigate any potential
losses arising either from an adverse finding or
from significant legal costs by making a settlement
offer. Accordingly the Committee has noted that
the accounts contain a provision for £250,000.
Based on legal advice obtained, this appears a 
fair estimate of liability relating to this litigation
although there remains a risk that the provision
estimate is materially understated.
Pension
The pension fund continues to show a deficit
according to the latest IAS 19R actuarial valuation.
This year the deficit is valued at £13.1 million and
this is further detailed in note 9. The Committee
has reviewed the most recent actuarial valuation
and has noted the conclusions of KPMG’s
specialists on the nature of the assumptions 
used by the actuaries. The recovery plan that 
was proposed and agreed following the 2011
valuation was reviewed, and the conclusion 
made that the recovery plan remains appropriate.
Notwithstanding this the Board has set up a
working group to review further options for
mitigating future defined benefit pension
liabilities.
Whilst the government announced a change in
July 2010 permitting benefit augmentation in
private sector occupational pension schemes to 
be based on CPI, the Committee is satisfied that
the defined benefit obligation can continue to be
calculated on RPI on the basis that the Trust Deed
states a requirement only to use a government
approved index.
Assets Held for sale and 
discontinued operations
The Committee considered the treatment of the
Charles Stanley Securities and the Charles Stanley
Financial Solutions businesses in light of the
Group’s strategic decision to dispose of both
businesses. The Committee considered the
relevant IFRS standards and determined that 
both businesses should be categorised as Held 
for sale and that Charles Stanley Securities as 
a major reporting line should be disclosed as a
discontinued operation.

DIRECTORS’ REPORTS
AND GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent
Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
Group and parent Company financial statements
for each financial year. Under the law the
Directors have prepared the Group financial
statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent Company
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent
Company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and appropriate;
 state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
and
 prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and the parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the parent Company's
transactions and disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the
Directors are also responsible for preparing a
Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance
Statement that comply with that law and those
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance
and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report,
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and
responsibilities are listed in the Corporate
Governance Report confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
 the Group and parent company financial 
statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
 the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; and
 the Strategic Report and financial statements 
include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position 
of the Group and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING 
FROM OUR AUDIT 
1 Our opinion on the financial statements 
is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of
Charles Stanley Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2015 set out on pages 101 to 156. 
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 
and of the Group’s loss for the year then 
ended;
 the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU);
 the parent company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
 the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the
financial statements the risks of material
misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated 
to CS Direct (£5.2 million)
Refer to page 91 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 150 (accounting policy) and pages 125 
to 126 (financial disclosures).
The risk
The consolidated statement of financial 
position includes a significant goodwill balance.
The carrying amount of goodwill could be
materially misstated if inappropriate judgements
and estimates were used by the Directors in
calculating the recoverable amount for each 
cash generating unit (‘CGU’) as part of their
impairment assessment. Whilst this risk exists 
over the overall goodwill balance, the more
significant risk attaches to the goodwill relating 
to CS Direct and, therefore, this CGU was the
focus of our audit procedures in this area.
The CS Direct CGU, which accounts for £5.2m 
of the total goodwill balance, represents an early
stage separate business segment that, whilst
growing the assets administered on its platform, 
is currently unprofitable. Furthermore, CS Direct
includes business previously undertaken through
Garrison, the discount financial intermediary
subsidiary that, prior to the integration into 
CS Direct, had shown a decline in trading
revenues. CS Direct also has a second legacy
income stream which is now expected to cease 
in 2017. In these circumstances, forecasting 
future revenue and net cash inflows is particularly
subjective and there is an increased risk that 
there could be a material difference between 
the forecast revenues used to determine the
recoverable amount and the actual revenues
earned. Assessing the recoverable amount
therefore requires judgement and, as a result,
there is a higher risk that goodwill may be
overstated. The Directors have used a value in 
use approach and have impaired this asset by 
£3m as at 31 March 2015 reflecting more
conservative cash inflow forecasts as a result 
of declining legacy revenues and slower growth
projections on core platform business.
Our response
Our audit procedures included testing the 
Group’s assessment of the recoverable amount 
by comparing the Group’s assumptions, including
Stanley Report 14th Proof 24 June 2015_Stanley R/A 1st proof 16/3  23/06/2015  21:11  Page 95 Charles Stanley Group PLC
Report and Accounts 2015
96
revenue and cost growth rates, and discount rates,
to externally derived data as well as our own
assessments based on our knowledge of the Group
and the industry. We examined the revenue and
cost projections of the three component parts of
CS Direct, confirming whether the projections for
the two legacy elements tailed off appropriately
and whether the growth projections for the core
online platform, particularly its terminal value,
were supported by current trends. We have
compared the discount rate applied to peer
analysis and our own assessment. We also
undertook sensitivity analysis and stress 
testing of each assumption.
We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures
in note 14 appropriately reflected the risks
inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Valuation of defined benefit pension liability:
£13. 1 million
Refer to page 93 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 147 (accounting policy) and pages 116 to 120
(financial disclosures).
The risk
Significant estimates are made in valuing the
Group’s post-retirement defined benefit scheme
and relatively small changes in assumptions and
estimates used to value the group's net pension
deficit can have a significant effect on the results
and financial position of the Group.
Our response
Our audit procedures included using the support
of our own actuarial specialists to challenge the
key assumptions and estimated inputs used in 
the calculation of the pension liability. The key
assumptions and estimates we tested included the
discount rate, RPI inflation, salary growth and life
expectancy. This included a comparison of key
assumptions against externally derived data and
our benchmark ranges for similar schemes. 
We also tested the valuation of the scheme’s assets
by reference to the most recent scheme valuation
report and applying market return assumptions 
for the year ended 31 March 2015.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s
disclosure in respect of the sensitivity of the
liability to these assumptions.
Provision for legal disputes: £250,000
Refer to page 93 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 147 (accounting policy) and page 144
(financial disclosures).
The risk
The Group is currently in dispute with Brewin
Dolphin plc in relation to certain matters regarding
the departure of investment managers from
Brewin Dolphin plc and subsequent employment
by Charles Stanley Group PLC. Brewin Dolphin plc
is alleging breach of contract and economic loss
and claiming certain costs. Management has
provided £250,000 in respect of the claim. At the
date of this audit report the legal process of
discovery of facts continues between the two
parties. Consideration of the outcome of current
legal disputes is highly subjective and requires
considerable audit judgement. There remains 
a risk that the Group’s provision estimate is
materially understated if all information 
currently available is not included in the 
estimate or if further information comes to 
light that substantially weakens the Group’s case
and the court finds in favour of the litigant.
Our response
Our audit procedures included detailed discussion
with executive management to understand the
facts and circumstances surrounding the dispute.
We reviewed correspondence between the litigant
and the Group to understand and assess the
nature of the claim. This included consideration 
of potential points of law, claims regarding
causation and claims of potential losses by the
litigant. In addition we read the legal opinion
obtained by management from Queen’s Counsel
and considered the results of this in forming our
conclusion.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s
disclosures in note 29 in respect of this matter.

3 Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements
as a whole was set at £750,000. It was determined
with reference to a benchmark of Group revenue
(in the prior year a materiality of £700,000 was
determined with reference to a benchmark of
profit before tax). We consider Group revenue to
be a more appropriate benchmark in the current
year as the Group has incurred losses. Revenue 
is one of the principal considerations for members
of the Company in assessing the financial
performance of the Group. Materiality represents
0.5% of Group revenue.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report 
to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements
we identified through our audit with a value in
excess of £40,000 in addition to other audit
misstatements that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
We have audited five Group components, covering
100% of Group revenues, Group profit before
taxation and Group assets. Materiality for those
components ranged from £28,000 to £636,000.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
5 We have nothing to report in respect of the 
matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, based on the knowledge we
acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that
contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is
otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired during 
our audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
 the Audit Committee Report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to
report to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent Company financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or

 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 48, 
in relation to going concern;
 the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 81 to 86 relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above
responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 94, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied
that they give a true and fair view. A description 
of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
members as a body and is subject to important
explanations and disclaimers regarding our
responsibilities, published on our website at
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a 
which are incorporated into this report as if 
set out in full and should be read to provide 
an understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the basis of 
our opinions.

9 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those
of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group also sponsors the Charles Stanley & Co. Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme (the “plan”), which is a 
funded defined benefit arrangement. This is a separate trustee-administered fund holding the pension plan assets 
to meet long term pension liabilities for some 74 past and 30 present employees. The level of retirement benefit is
principally based on salary earned in the last three years of employment prior to leaving active service and is linked 
to changes in inflation following retirement.
The plan is subject to the funding legislation, which came into force on 30 December 2005, outlined in the Pensions Act
2004. This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial
Reporting Council, set out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interests of the plan’s beneficiaries. The appointment of the
trustees is determined by the plan’s trust documentation. It is policy that at least one third of all trustees should 
be nominated by the members.
A full actuarial valuation is currently being carried out as at 13 May 2014 in accordance with the scheme funding
requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and the funding of the plan is agreed between the Group and the trustees 
in line with those requirements. These in particular require the surplus/deficit to be calculated using conservative, 
as opposed to best estimate actuarial assumptions.
The actuarial valuation at 13 May 2011 showed a deficit of £1,989,000. The Group has agreed with the trustees that 
it will aim to eliminate the deficit over a period of 7 years from 13 May 2012 by the payment of annual contributions 
of £315,000 in respect of the deficit. In addition and in accordance with the actuarial valuation, the Group has agreed
with the trustees that it will pay 25.5% of pensionable earnings in respect of the cost of accruing benefits and will
meet expenses of the plan and levies to the Pension Protection Fund. Member contributions are payable at a rate 
of 3% (except for Directors) and this is included within the rate of 25.5%.

For the purposes of IAS 19 the preliminary results of the actuarial valuation as at 13 May 2014, which was carried out
by a qualified actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2015. There have been no changes in
the valuation methodology adopted for this period’s disclosures compared to the previous period’s disclosures.

Deferred tax 2,617 1,387 2,064
Net liability to be recognised (10,470) (5,546) (6,912)
The present value of plan liabilities is measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out 
by the plan using the projected unit credit method. The value calculated in this way is reflected in the net liability in 
the balance sheet as shown above.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which allowance is made for projected
earnings increases. The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the plan liabilities, whose
calculation differs from that under the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumption for future earnings
increases. In assessing this figure for the purpose of these disclosures, allowance has been made for future statutory
revaluation of benefits up to retirement. At the balance sheet date the accumulated benefit obligation was £43,865,000.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the year in which they occur in the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income (page 102).
The Group has reviewed the implications of the guidance provided by IFRIC 14 and has concluded that it is not necessary
to make any adjustments to the IAS19 figures in respect of an asset ceiling or Minimum Funding Requirements as at 
31 March 2015.

The Occupational Pensions (Revaluation) Order 2010 issued in July 2010 confirmed the government’s intention to 
move to using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI) as the inflation measure for
determining the minimum pension increases to be applied to the statutory index-linked features of retirement benefits.
Charles Stanley has used RPI in calculating the liability for 2015.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 March 2015 are 100% of the standard tables S2PxA, Year of Birth, no age
rating for males and females, projected using CMI_2013 converging to 1.50% p.a. These imply the following life
expectancies:
Life
expectancy
at age 65
Male retiring in 2015 22.7 years
Female retiring in 2015 24.7 years
Male retiring in 2035 24.9 years

The fair value of assets shown above includes £1.0 million (2014: £1.3 million) of shares in Charles Stanley Group PLC.
None of the other fair values include any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group. All of the scheme
assets have quoted market prices in an active market with the exception of the trustee’s bank account balance.
It is the policy of the trustees and the Group to review the investment strategy at the time of each funding valuation.
The trustees’ investment objectives and the process to measure and manage risks inherent in the plan investment
strategy are documented in the plan’s Statement of Investment Principles.
There are no asset-liability matching strategies currently being used by the plan.

Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation
Change in assumption Change in liabilities
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 4.9%
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% Increase by 1.4%
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year Increase by 3.2%
The sensitivities shown are approximate. Each sensitivity considers one change in isolation. The inflation sensitivity
includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation, salary growth and pension increases. The average
duration of the defined benefit obligation at the period ended 31 March 2015 is 20 years.
The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, salary growth risk,
mortality risk and longevity risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy
would result in an increase to plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give
rise to increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value 
of the plan’s bond holdings, and in qualifying death in service insurance policies that cover the mortality risk.
Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The best estimate of contributions to be paid by the Group to the plan for the period commencing 1 April 2015 
is £745,000.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective 1 April 2014) and to 20% (effective from 
1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge
accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2015 has been calculated based on the rate of 20%, as substantively enacted

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
a) Goodwill (continued)
The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) are determined by first calculating the 
fair value less cost to sell. If the fair value less cost to sell is found to be lower than the carrying amount the recoverable
amount is then determined based on value in use calculations. The fair value less cost to sell calculations are largely 
based on a percentage of Funds under Management. Where this approach is not appropriate a turnover multiple is used.
The rates used are those implied by recent transactions in the market or, where appropriate, similar quoted businesses. 
When calculating the fair value less cost to sell, key assumptions were stress tested to determine whether the calculations
were sensitive to a reasonably possible change in these assumptions.
The value in use calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on revenue and expense forecasts.
i) Investment Management Services
Following the strategic decision to cease providing Execution-only access to traded options, the Group 
assessed the recoverable amount of the Durlacher business. As a result, an impairment charge of 
£1.5 million has been recognised. The impairment charge was allocated fully to goodwill, reducing 
the Durlacher carrying value to nil, and is included in impairment of intangible assets and investments 
in the consolidated income statement. The recoverable amount of the Durlacher business was assessed 
as nil as the business has been shut down.
ii) Financial Services
During the year the Group confirmed that negotiations had been ongoing regarding the sale of the 
Charles Stanley Financial Solutions business to a third party. As at 31 March 2015 a Heads of Terms 
Agreement has been signed. The recoverable amount has been calculated based on the key elements 
of the agreement. As a result an impairment charge of £0.9 million has been recognised. The impairment 
charge was allocated fully to goodwill, reducing the Charles Stanley Financial Solutions goodwill to 
£1.5 million, and is included in impairment of intangible assets and investments in the consolidated 
income statement. The goodwill of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions has been reclassified as assets 
Held for sale.  The Plymouth employee benefits (EB) business has not been included as part of the sale 
of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions. The Group assessed the recoverable amount of the Plymouth EB 
business. As a result an impairment charge of £1. 1 million has been recognised. The impairment charge 
was allocated fully to goodwill, reducing the Plymouth EB carrying value to nil, and is included in 
impairment of intangible assets and investments in the consolidated income statement.

14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
iii) Charles Stanley Direct
The recoverable amount of the CGU was assessed based on the projected revenue and profitability 
of the business over the next four years. The three different revenue streams of the business 
(Direct-to-client; Fidelity; Garrison) were assessed. The Fidelity and Garrison revenue streams 
are forecast to reduce towards 2018 and 2019. The direct-to-client stream is forecast to continue 
growing Assets under Administration, client account numbers and thus ultimately revenue. 
A value in use calculation was performed using the forecast profitability of the division over the 
next four years. The forecast profitability assumed certain inflows of FuM based on recent historical 
fund inflows. The carrying amount of the CGU was determined to be higher than the recoverable 
amount and an impairment charge of £3.0 million has been recognised. The impairment charge was 
allocated fully to goodwill, reducing the Charles Stanley Direct carrying value to £5.2 million, and is 
included in impairment of intangible assets and investments in the consolidated income statement.
The key assumptions used in the valuation were as follows:
Discount rate 12%
Funds under Management growth rate 18% compound growth rate (over a 5 year period)
Operating costs to remain relatively stable over the period
iv) Charles Stanley Securities
The CGU has been recognised at the lower of:
 fair value less costs to sell
 carrying value
The fair value less cost to sell of the CGU was greater than its carrying value. The carrying value 
is supported by the expected proceeds from the sale of the business. The carrying value of 
Charles Stanley Securities (£1.5 million) has been reclassified as assets Held for sale.
b) Customer relationships
Purchases of customer relationships relate to payments made to investment managers and third parties for the 
introduction of customer relationships.
During the year the Truro business left the Group to join a rival firm. The Group performed a review on the likelihood 
of retaining the Truro clients. The Group determined that it was unlikely that a significant portion of those clients 
would be retained and as such an impairment charge of £0.8 million has been recognised to reduce the Truro intangible 
asset to £0.3 million.
A proportion of the consideration payable for Charles Stanley Pan Asset Capital Management is contingent upon certain 
AuM targets being achieved. The Group performed a review on the likelihood that the target levels will be achieved. 
The Group determined that it was unlikely that the targets will be achieved and as a result both the deferred consideration 
has been reduced and also an impairment charge has been recognised to reduce the Charles Stanley Pan Asset Capital
Management intangible asset to £0.9 million (from £1.2 million).
c) Internally generated software
The cost and accumulated amortisation for the prior year were reclassified to include internally generated software, 
which had been reclassified from office equipment, included in property, plant and equipment. This reclassification 
has represented the substance of internally generated software, which is software designed, developed and commercialised
by the Group.

Property, plant and equipment include fully depreciated assets of £10.5 million (2014: £10.4 million) which are still 
in use.
Freehold premises includes £285,000 for a freehold property that was valued at the current market value by GVA Grimley ,
a firm of independent chartered surveyors. The historical cost of the freehold was £189,321. The Directors consider that
the value in use of the property approximates its carrying value.
Additions to freehold premises in 2014 relates to the acquisition of freehold property which is subject to a charge as
security for a bank loan (see note 23).
Certain balances within office equipment and motor vehicles were reclassified in the prior year to internally generated
software (see note 14.c).

The fair value of listed investments is determined by reference to quoted prices on active markets.
Listed investments include a £2.0 million holding in Gilts which is pledged to our clearing house.
Unlisted investments include the Group’s holding of 6,030 shares in Euroclear plc for which no observable market 
data is available as to its value. The Directors believe it is appropriate to value this holding on a dividend yield basis.
Previous revaluation now realised on disposal amounted to £62,000 (2014: £140,000).
During the year the Group revalued and impaired its equity investment in Masterlist. The valuation was based on the
Net Asset Value of the operating entity of Masterlist. As a result, the shares owned by the Group have been impaired
to nil. The £0.5 million impairment charge is included within impairment of intangible assets and investments in the
consolidated income statement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
24 FAIR VALUES AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Through its normal operations the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are market,
credit and liquidity risks.
Market risk
This is the risk that arises from fluctuations in values of, or income from, assets or in interest or exchange rates. The Group
only trades as principal for the purposes of executing client orders. Other principal positions may arise from dealing errors.
All position limits are monitored daily in accordance with policies determined by the Board. 
The Group has small currency exposures. We run positions in a variety of currencies, principally the US dollar , to support
clients’ dealing activities. Group policy requires any significant net exposures to be hedged using forward currency
contracts as soon as a commitment is made.
Equity risk
The Group is exposed to equity market risk through its equity holdings. These comprise: i) available for sale financial
investments, ii) held for trading assets and liabilities and iii) the impact on investment management fees.
The Group has performed sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of a 10% increase or decrease in underlying equity
prices. The results shown below are indicative of the impact at the year end.
i) Available for sale investments
Note 17 summarises the available for sale investments held at the year-end date, and the disposals and fair value
movements made in the year.
Approximately 50% of the Group’s available for sale investments are unlisted. A 10% increase/decrease in the 
Group’s investments would have an impact on reserves of £705,000 (2014: £701,000).
ii) Held for trading assets and liabilities
The Group’s exposure to market risk on its held for trading positions is monitored daily and reported to the appropriate
Directors and senior management. Positions are monitored against limits set down by the Risk and Regulatory Review
Group/Compliance Committee. Any breaches of the limits are notified immediately to the Compliance Director.
A 10% increase/decrease in equity prices of trading assets and liabilities would increase/decrease profit in the 
Income statement by £10,000 (2014: £12,000).
iii) Investment Management fees
A 10% increase/decrease in equity prices would increase/decrease profit on investment management fees in the
Income statement by £3.9 million (2014: £3.2 million).

24 FAIR VALUES AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
Foreign exchange risk
The table below summarises the Group’s currency exposure arising from unmatched monetary assets or liabilities 
not denominated in the Group’s functional currency:
2015 2014
£’000 £’000
Net assets
Euros 195 229
US Dollars 490 551
Other currencies 391 1,065
1,076 1,845
The Group’s activities are primarily denominated in British pounds and it does not enter into forward exchange
contracts for hedging anticipated transactions. The risk of adverse currency movements for settlement of non-GBP
trades on behalf of clients is not borne by the Group. The Group is exposed to currency risk for settlement of non-GBP
trade suppliers and miscellaneous income streams. At 31 March 2015 these totalled £23,629 (2014: £73,775).
Interest rate risk
The Group has interest-bearing assets, principally in cash and cash deposits and available for sale financial assets,
and liabilities including loan notes accruing interest at fixed rates. The Group views such exposure to interest rate
fluctuations as immaterial. If interest rates had been 200 basis points higher profit for the year would have been 
£571,060 higher (2014: £771,000). If interest rates had been 200 basis points lower profit for the year would have 
been £110,000 lower (2014: £325,000).
Credit risk
This represents the risk of loss through default by counterparty . The most significant risk to the Group is either a client 
or market counterparty failing to settle a trade. Given the wide range of retail clients of the Group it is not considered that 
a material default by connected counterparties would arise. Other credit risks, such as Free Delivery of stock or cash, are
not deemed to be significant as the Group has an effective credit control department to recover any monies or stock owed
through default.
The Group monitors both the collateral requirements of individual client accounts, as well as any debit balances that 
occur if stock purchases are not settled on due date, or that are due to losses that have been incurred during client 
trading activity , on a daily basis.
Shares are only delivered free of payment to a client or their agents once settlement has been achieved and there is no
outstanding debit balance on the account. In the event of an error , it will again be made immediately apparent the next day
when both the debit balances and collateral requirements of clients’ accounts are monitored.
On occasion delivery of stock to a recognised professional counterparty may take place free of payment via an electronic
settlement system, but only on prior confirmation from their custodians that the required funds in settlement will be wired
to our appropriate bank account. There have been no instances where this has created an irrecoverable loss.
Exposures for trades that are outstanding beyond the contractual settlement date are monitored on a daily basis.
The Group has a Market Exposure Committee (MEC) (comprising three Charles Stanley Group PLC Directors and other 
Charles Stanley senior managers as deemed necessary) that reviews exposures to market counterparties on a daily basis.
The Committee also sets exposure limits to individual market counterparties.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
24 FAIR VALUES AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
Trade receivables represent monies due from clients and market counterparties. The risk department undertakes
reviews of new accounts and periodically reviews all counterparties.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with regulated financial institutions with investment grade credit rating. The list 
of approved banks is reviewed at least annually by the Treasury Committee. The Group has no concerns over the credit
quality of these institutions.
The following table of financial assets analyses amounts by ageing:

Excluded from the above are assets of £339,300 (2014: £665,000) for which provision of £339,300 has been made
(2014: £665,000).
Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to
meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents that is designed to meet the Group’s operational and trading
activities. The Group does not use the wholesale markets for any funding and is confident that it has sufficient liquidity for
the foreseeable future. At 31 March 2015 the Group had £28.5 million in bank accounts and accordingly a high degree of
liquidity .
The Group’s liquidity risk is overwhelmingly short-term in nature and arises from the settlement of trades within the
stockbroking business.
The treasury function operates within strict policies and procedures approved by the Board, which include strict controls on
the use of financial instruments in managing the Group’s risk. Our policy is to use a combination of high credit rated banks 
to deposit client money . This is done to guard against the risk of using only one bank.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items including trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. We review the credit quality of counterparties and we
limit aggregate credit exposures accordingly .
The majority of the short-term creditors arise from settlement of clients’ trading activities, and it is the policy to pay
stockbroking creditors on Settlement Day or when the stock is delivered, whichever is later . The policy is also to 
pay suppliers in accordance with their payment terms.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and financial liabilities which are all repayable on
demand or within three months.

24 FAIR VALUES AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
Capital risk management
The Group has an internal capital adequacy assessment process, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),
which it uses to manage capital. This assessment is Group-wide and covers current and projected capital
requirements. The Group is satisfied that there is and will be sufficient capital to meet these requirements.
The process, which has been approved by the Board of Directors, includes both qualitative and quantitative analysis 
of the requirements as calculated using both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 methodologies. Any change to the Group’s business
activities is considered within this framework.
Capital adequacy is monitored daily by the Group’s management for all regulated companies within the Group.
Compliance with FCA regulatory requirements was maintained during the year.

b) Measurement of fair values
i) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
Financial instruments measured at fair value
The table below analyses recurring fair value measurements for financial assets.
These fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on 
the inputs to valuation techniques used. The different levels are defined as follows.
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can 
access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 – Inputs for assets that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

Net change in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets —
Balance at 31 March 2015 3,269
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. If one 
or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. 
Specific valuation techniques used to value the financial instrument grouped under level 3 include 
discounting future cash flows and calculating the dividend yield. All valuations performed are presented 
to the Group Executive Directors for final approval. Significant valuation issues are reported to the 
Group Audit Committee.
Equity securities – available for sale
The level 3 balance comprises amounts relating to holdings in unlisted investments. At 31 March 2015 
these unlisted investments had a fair value of £3.3 million (31 March 2014: £3.8 million). Included within 
this balance is the Group’s holding of 6,030 Euroclear plc shares with a fair value of £3. 1 million 
(31 March 2014: £3. 1 million).
This fair value has been determined using a valuation technique that used significant unobservable 
inputs.
This was because the shares are not listed on an exchange. During the year, Euroclear conducted 
a tender process for the buy-back of its shares. The successful bidders ranged in prices from 
€640-€790 per share. The Group’s bid was unsuccessful as the price tendered was above the 
maximum accepted of price of €790 per share. The Group’s current valuation of Euroclear values 
the shares at €720, the mid-range point in the range.
For the Euroclear investment a 1% increase/decrease in the expected dividend yield would 
increase/decrease other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity by £20,000 
(31 March 2014: £20,000).
Contingent consideration
The level 3 balance comprises an amount payable on the acquisition of Evercore Pan Asset Capital 
Management Limited (PAN) and an amount due for the sale of the Matterley Undervalued Asset 
Fund to Miton Group.
At 31 March 2015 the fair value of the deferred consideration for the acquisition of PAN was £40,057 .
The fair value is determined using a percentage of PAN's Funds under Management.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
24 FAIR VALUES AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
The significant unobservable input is management's view that no further clients will leave which 
would decrease PAN's Funds under Management, which in turn would reduce the contingent 
consideration payable.
A 1% increase/decrease in Funds under Management would increase/decrease contingent consideration 
by £0.01 million.
For the sale of the Matterley Undervalued Asset Fund an initial consideration of £0.75 million was paid 
on completion of the transaction in December. Further consideration will be paid subject to the overall 
level of funds transferred to Miton Group.
At 31 March 2015 the fair value of the deferred consideration to be received was £0.45 million. 
The fair value is determined by estimating the total Funds under Management as at December 2015 
and is payable then.
The significant unobservable input is management's view that the Funds under Management won’t 
move into a higher banding which as per the agreement will mean a further £0. 1 million will be due.
A 1% increase in the anticipated value of funds transferred would increase the deferred consideration 
recognised by £0. 1 million and a 1% decrease would have no impact.

29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
A competitor company has taken legal action against the Group in relation to staff who chose to leave them and join
Charles Stanley, claiming losses of £1.6 million plus legal costs. The Group has lodged a robust defence both in relation
to the merits of the claim itself and the quantum of the claim. Nevertheless, the Group has recognised a provision of
£0.25 million (2014: £0.25 million) in respect of this potential liability. Significant judgement has had to be exercised 
in assessing the possible outcome of the claim and there is a risk that the ultimate loss will be greater than this
amount due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation,
A recent ruling by the European Court of Justice indicated that under the European Working Time Directive, 
‘normal pay’ for the purposes of calculating statutory holiday pay includes contractual commission as well as 
basic salary. The UK Employment Tribunal considered the implications for UK employers under the Working Time
Directive 1998 and, as expected, has ruled in a similar manner to the European Courts of Justice, although it has 
also ruled that non-guaranteed overtime payments should be included for the purposes of calculating holiday pay
entitlements. The decision by the UK Employment Tribunal is currently subject to appeal and, as yet, no hearing date 
has been set to consider it. Based on this information and advice to date, the Group does not expect the impact to 
be material. However, in the event that analysis, judgements and/or appeals are determined to ultimately be different,
the Group may be exposed to a material additional liability.
30 COMMITMENTS
At 31 March 2015 capital expenditure authorised and contracted for but not provided in the financial statements 
amounted to nil (2014: nil).
31 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
In April the Group announced plans to raise £15.8 million net of expenses by way of a share placing to institutional
investors. The Group’s brokers placed 4,596,000 shares at 355p per share. The placing shares represented just under
10% of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Group. The placing shares were admitted for trading on the
main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange on the 17th April 2015.
In May 2015 the Group signed a Heads of Terms Agreement with Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited regarding the sale 
of Charles Stanley Securities (excluding the Equity Sales Trading) operation. On 17 June 2015 the Group announced 
to the market that contracts had been exchanged, subject to certain conditions being met. The final sale price is
capped at £6.5 million.
Also in April 2015 the Group signed a Heads of Agreement regarding the sale of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions
Limited to its management team.

YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
33 REPORTING ENTITY
Charles Stanley Group PLC (the Company) is the parent Company of a group of companies (the Group) which provides a 
range of investment and financial services within the United Kingdom.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 25 Luke Street, London EC2A 4AR.
34 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Group’s consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements are presented and prepared 
on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union and IFRIC Interpretations (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.
The Directors assessed the going concern of the Group in light of its current trading performance. The Directors looked at 
the forecasts covering the 18 month period from 31 March 2015 to 30 September 2016 and applied stress tests for adverse
scenarios, which had been determined as part of the ICAAP process. As a result it was determined that the Group has enough
liquidity to cover all anticipated payments. The Directors also considered the regulatory capital of the Group and determined
that based on the forecasts, the Group has sufficient regulatory capital for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the Financial Statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Further details are contained
in the Corporate Governance Report on page 81.
Certain comparative figures have been amended to conform with current period presentation.
Details of the Company and the Group’s accounting policies, including changes during the year, are included in notes 38 
and 39.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 June 2015.
35 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY
These consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements are presented in British pounds
which is the Group’s functional currency. All financial information presented in British pounds has been rounded to the
nearest thousand unless otherwise indicated.
36 USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, and the Parent Company financial statements, management has 
made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking account of historical experience and future expectations.

36 USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)
36. 1 Intangible assets and goodwill (note 14)
This should be read in conjunction with note 14.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Company and the Group value goodwill and client relationships based on the
valuation of individual units making up the relevant intangible asset in accordance with the accounting policy set out in 
note 36. These fair value calculations require the use of assumptions which are set out in more detail in note 17 .
During the period the Group assessed the recoverable amount of the Durlacher business and the Charles Stanley Financial
Solutions business. As a result impairment charges of £1.5 million and £0.9 million respectively were recognised.
The Plymouth employee benefits (EB) business has not been included as part of the sale of Charles Stanley Financial
Solutions. The Group assessed the recoverable amount of the Plymouth EB business. As a result an impairment charge 
of £1. 1 million has been recognised.
The recoverable amount of the Charles Stanley Direct goodwill was assessed based on the projected revenue and
profitability. Two of the three different revenue streams are forecast to decline over the next 2-3 years, while the third 
stream (direct-to-client) is forecast to continue to grow Assets under Administration and client accounts. The carrying
amount of the Charles Stanley Direct goodwill was determined to be higher than the recoverable amount and an 
impairment charge of £3.0 million has been recognised.
The impairment charges were allocated fully to goodwill and are included in impairment of intangible assets and 
investments in the consolidated income statement. For further details on these impairments refer to note 14.
The Group also performed a review of the deferred consideration payable on the acquisition of Pan Asset Capital
Management. As a result the deferred consideration payable has been reduced by £0.3 million and an impairment 
charge has been recognised to reduce the Pan Asset Capital Management intangible asset.
It was concluded that no other impairments to the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets are required.
During the period the Group reassessed the useful life of client lists acquired. As a result the Group determined that the
useful life of client lists acquired should be in line with client lists that are acquired under a business combination and so 
the useful life of client lists acquired was changed to 10 years. The impact of this for the current reporting period is that 
costs are proportionally lower by £0.4 million, and this is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated 
income statement.
The Group performed a review on the likelihood of retaining the Truro clients after the business left the Group to join a 
rival firm. The Group determined that it was unlikely that a significant portion of those clients would be retained and 
as such an impairment charge of £0.8 million has been recognised.
36.2 Revenue recognition (note 1)
Fee income receivable is estimated based on current portfolio valuations, historical experience of debt collection 
and future expectations.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
36 USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)
36.3 Retirement benefit obligations (note 9)
In consultation with its actuary the Company and the Group make estimates about a number of long term trends and market
conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit scheme. These long term forecasts and estimates
are highly judgemental and subject to the risk that actual events may be significantly different from those forecast.
The valuation performed as at 31 March 2015 resulted in an increase in the actuarial deficit of £6m which has been reflected
in these financial statements.
36.4 Available for sale assets and other receivables (note 17)
Unlisted available for sale financial assets include an investment in Euroclear plc. The fair value of this investment 
has been estimated by the Directors using dividend yield.
During the year, the value of the investment and loan in Masterlist was reviewed based on the net asset value of the 
operating entity. As a result, the value was impaired by £0.75 million from £1.0 million to £0.25 million.
No new information has become available that would require a change in the valuation of any further unlisted investments.
36.5 Legal action (note 29)
A competitor company has taken legal action against the Group. Charles Stanley has lodged a defence against the claim. 
The legal process in relation to this action is continuing and considerable uncertainty exists in relation to the possible
outcomes. Significant judgement has therefore had to be exercised in assessing the likely economic impact, if any, to the
Group.
37 BASIS OF MEASUREMENT
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of 
land and buildings, available for sale financial investments, and financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through
profit and loss.
38 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently followed the same accounting policies, presentation and methods
of computation in these consolidated financial statements as applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for
the year ended 31 March 2014.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential
amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 April 2014.
a) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
As a result of IFRS 10, the Group has changed its accounting policy for determining whether it has control 
over and consequently whether it consolidates its investees. IFRS 10 introduces a new control model that 
focuses on whether the Group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns. Adoption of IFRS 10 did 
not change the Group’s determination of control over any of its subsidiaries.

38 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
b) IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
As a result of IFRS 11, the Group has changed its accounting policy for its interests in joint arrangements. 
Adoption of IFRS 11 has not impacted the Group financial statements as the Group does not have interests 
in joint arrangements.
c) IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities
The Group has adopted the amendments of IFRS 12 relating to the disclosure of interests in subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. As a result, the Group has included 
disclosures of its holdings in unconsolidated structured entities (see note 26).
d) Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36) (2013)
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 36 (2013). As a result, the Group has expanded its disclosures 
of recoverable amounts when they are based on fair values less costs of disposals and an impairment is 
recognised. Refer to note 14 for further details.
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the following new
standards, which are currently not yet effective and are not yet endorsed by the EU.
a) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement. 
It includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 is 
only effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.
b) IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is 
recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 is only effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.
39 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
39. 1 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated 
from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

39 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are
eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
39.2 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance
of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of the parent Company that makes strategic decisions.
Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision maker include items directly attributable to a segment as
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
39.3 Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into British pounds using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the income statement.
39.4 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold property is shown at fair value, based on periodic valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent
depreciation for buildings. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying
amount of the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. All other property, plant and
equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs
and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of freehold property are credited to other reserves in shareholders’
equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against other reserves directly in equity; all
other decreases are charged to the income statement.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or
revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold and leasehold properties 3 to 50 years
Vehicles 3 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater
than its estimated recoverable amount (note 36. 1).
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
within “other (losses)/gains – net” in the income statement.
When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.

39 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
39.5 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in “intangible
assets” . Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment
losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating
to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those 
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified
according to operating segment.
(b) Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Those
customer relationships acquired outside of a business combination are initially recognised at cost. The customer relations
have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over their useful lives estimated at ten years.
(c) Internally generated software
Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware or has been developed internally by the Group is
recognised as an intangible asset when the Group is expected to benefit from future use of the software and the costs are
reliably measurable. Computer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their
useful lives (3 years).
39.6 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets, such as goodwill, are regarded as having an indefinite useful life when there is no foreseeable limit 
to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. These assets are not subject 
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets 
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (Cash Generating Units or CGUs). 
Fair value less costs to sell is established based on recent public transactions for similar businesses. If the carrying 
amount relating to any CGU exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted 
cash flow method. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
39.7 Non-current assets Held for sale
Non-current assets Held for sale are classified as assets Held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use.

39 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
39.8 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables,
and available for sale. The classification depends on the nature of the instruments and the purpose for which the financial
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
39.8. 1 Classification
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Assets in this category are classified as current
assets.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting
period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables
and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.
(c) Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the
other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose
of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
39.8.2 Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial 
assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially
recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised
when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” are presented
in the income statement within “other (losses)/gains – net” in the period in which they arise. Dividend income from financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as part of other income when the Group’s
right to receive payments is established.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised 
in equity are included in the income statement as “gains and losses on available for sale assets” .
Interest on available for sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement
as part of finance income. Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement as part
of other income when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.

39 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
39.9 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group
of financial assets is impaired. 
Assets classified as available for sale
These include listed and unlisted securities. The cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost
and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from
equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the separate income statement on equity
investments are reversed through equity. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of debt instrument classified as available
for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised
in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the separate income statement.
39. 10 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from clients and other counterparties for services performed in the ordinary course of
business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less provision for impairment.
39. 11 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash held at call with banks.
39. 12 Segregated funds
Segregated funds are held in trust by the Group on behalf of clients in accordance with the Client Asset Rules of the FCA 
and the corresponding liability to clients is not shown in the statement of financial position.
39. 13 Trade payables
Trade payables consist of amounts payable to clients and other counterparties and obligations to pay suppliers for goods or
services in the ordinary course of business. Account payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 
one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method.
39. 14 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are valued subsequently at
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

39. 15 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity. In this case the tax is recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date in the UK.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax
is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is
determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is not provided on temporary timing differences arising on goodwill as the temporary timing difference
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
39. 16 Employee benefits
39. 16. 1 Pension obligations
The Group operates two pension schemes - a defined benefit and a defined contribution scheme. A defined contribution 
plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or
constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay employees the benefits
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan which is not a defined
contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit
asset or liability and is presented in operating expenses.

Report and Accounts 2015
154
39 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the
defined benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA credit rated
corporate bonds that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit obligation arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on
a mandatory contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been
paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
39. 16.2 Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is
provided. Payments made in advance of services being provided are treated as prepayments.
39. 17 Share-based payments
The Group operates various equity-settled share based payments schemes. There is a Save As You Earn scheme and a 
Long Term Incentive Plan under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments
(share options or share awards) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
the share options or share awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference
to the fair value of the share options or share awards granted on the grant date:
 including market performance conditions;
 excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
 including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share options or share awards that are
expected to vest. 
The total employee expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share
options or share awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact 
of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the share options or share awards are exercised the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any
directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the share
options or share awards are exercised.

39. 18 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales
within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; it is probable that future economic
benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below.
The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction
and the specifics of each arrangement.
(a) Commission
Commission income and expenses are recognised on a trade date basis.
(b) Fees
Investment management, administration and corporate finance retainer fees are recognised evenly over the period the
service is provided. Corporate finance success fees are recognised when earned.
(c) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(d) Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. 
39. 19 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the period of the lease.
Leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance
leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement date at the lower of fair value of the leased property and the present
value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance
balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the
asset and the lease term.
39.20 Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
39.21 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less, where appropriate, provision for impairment.

39.22 Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly
distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:
 represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations;
 is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area 
of operations; or
 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria 
to be classified as Held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and OCI 
is re-presented as if the opinion had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.

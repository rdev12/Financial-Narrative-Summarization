At a Glance
What we do
At JUST EAT, we operate the world’s leading online and mobile 
marketplace for takeaway food, providing consumers with an 
easy and secure way to order and pay for food from local 
takeaway restaurants. Takeaway restaurants who join the 
JUST EAT platform have their menu made accessible to online 
consumers. These consumers search for local restaurants using 
their postcode and any cuisine preference. We transmit the 
details of their order to the takeaway restaurants via proprietary 
Just Connect Terminals (“JCTs”), which restaurants use to accept 
orders and send confirmations to the consumer. Once prepared, 
the restaurant will deliver the food to the consumer, who can 
choose to pay securely online at the point of ordering or cash 
upon delivery.
We derive the vast majority (76%) of our revenue from 
commission charged to restaurants on the value of successful 
orders placed. This, plus certain administration fees, typically 
related to card payments, comprise the B2C order-driven revenue 
that in total accounts for 89% of all revenues. The remaining 
11% of our revenue consists of one-off connection fees paid by 
restaurants to join JUST EAT, top-placement advertising fees 
and other revenues.
Our mission is to empower consumers to love their takeaway 
experience. It’s about providing breadth of selection, 
transparency, security and convenience. 
We want to give consumers better information and more choice. 
With the huge range of cuisines we offer through the 45,700 
contracted restaurant partners on our platforms, supported by 
over seven million reviews, consumers can make more informed 
choices than ever, whether ordering through online, mobile 
and apps.
Where we are
Since the first JUST EAT website was launched in Denmark in 
2001, we have expanded globally with operations in Belgium, 
Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the UK. In early 2015, we 
expanded into Mexico with the acquisition of Sindelantal Mexico. 
We are market leader in the majority of our countries; a key 
success factor in our sector. The UK, where we are clear market 
leader, is the largest of JUST EAT’s operations in terms of 
number of takeaway restaurants, orders and medium term 
opportunity, representing 73% of total Group revenues. 
Our team continues to grow with over 1,500 people now working 
for JUST EAT globally. Our headquarters are in the heart of 
London, but this is very much a local business and we have 
teams on the ground in every country including dedicated 
in-house customer care teams.
How We Generate V alue
People
Our people are integral to all 
that we do at JUST EAT. We 
have an outstanding central 
team who are responsible 
for designing, implementing, 
maintaining, supporting 
and promoting our websites 
and apps, as well as great 
local teams who lead sales, 
marketing and operational 
functions in-country. 
T echnology
Our technology is making 
life easier for consumers and 
restaurants. The JUST EAT 
system enables restaurants 
to efficiently manage their 
order process by reducing 
communication errors that 
could be made over the 
phone and reducing the 
time spent on processing. 
The JUST EAT websites and 
apps enable consumers 
to make informed choices 
about what food to order in 
a quick and convenient way. 
Brand
Consumers have the 
reassurance of ordering 
from a well-known, trusted 
brand, receiving customer 
service through JUST EAT 
online support or offline 
through our call centres. 
Brand association helps 
restaurants to drive scale in 
orders by enabling efficient 
entry to the online market.
Scalability
When creating, developing 
and maintaining our 
technology, we recognise 
the importance of scalability. 
We invest heavily to ensure 
our platforms and apps are 
robust, flexible and secure 
enough to meet increasing 
peaks of demand from 
consumers and restaurants.  3 www.just-eat.com

Strategic Summary
Our strategy is focused on three interlinking areas for business growth: improving 
the consumer experience, bringing greater choice and ultimately driving channel 
shift. Given the strategic importance of the UK, our initiatives are first trialled and 
launched in this geography and then rolled out to our other countries.
Set out below is a summary of our key strategic initiatives, our achievements during 2014, how we measure our progress and what 
risks could disrupt us from delivering on our strategic initiatives.

Chairman’s Statement
A year of excellent progress
We aim to deliver predictable and transparent financial 
performance. JUST EAT’s significant operational leverage saw 
margins expand as revenues grew, more than offsetting our 
substantial ongoing investments in group infrastructure, technology 
and markets. Furthermore, the business has an attractive cash 
profile, with a very favourable working capital cycle.
As well as sharply higher order volumes in 2014, which increased 
52% year-on-year, we have seen a continuing shift to mobile. 
Through our mobile-led strategy, this channel now provides over 
60% of orders for the UK. We also enhanced our relationship 
with our restaurant partners, who are embracing the improved 
tools we offer them.
2014 was a landmark year, with our IPO in April being an 
important milestone and we were delighted to attract such a 
high-quality shareholder base. We believe that the investment 
community is increasingly recognising the value of JUST EAT,  
as we continue to deliver on our commitments. Our business 
model delivers value to consumers and restaurants, which in  
turn creates value for shareholders.
The IPO has given us the financial strength to develop through 
acquisition if opportunities to buy leading positions in markets of 
scale present themselves. In the short-term, our strategy is to 
continue to build our business by extending our leadership in 
existing markets and to focus on technology and innovation.
Strong governance
Governance is at the heart of the way the Board operates and 
central to the way the Company behaves. Although at the time  
of the IPO the Board did not fully comply with the requirements 
of the Corporate Governance Code, as the financial sponsor 
shareholders sell down, we are committed to developing a Board 
that fully complies. By the end of the 2014 financial year we had 
already ensured that all committees of the Board were and 
remained fully Code compliant.
This year we have recruited three extremely experienced 
independent Non-Executive Directors, and I welcome Gwyn Burr, 
Andrew Griffith and Henri Moissinac to the Board. Their 
backgrounds in major consumer, food and mobile technology 
businesses are already proving immensely valuable, and their 
subject matter expertise highly complements our plans for 
the Company.
Laurel Bowden stepped down from the Board on 1 October 2014 
and I would like to extend my thanks for her invaluable 
contribution since becoming a Director in 2011. 
This has been another excellent year 
for JUST EAT, with revenue up 62% to 
£157.0 million and Underlying EBITDA up 
131% to £32.6 million, demonstrating 
the scale of the market opportunity and 
our ability to drive top and bottom line 
growth by meeting the needs of 
consumers and restaurants.   7 www.just-eat.com

An outstanding team
JUST EAT has built a senior management team with tremendous 
depth and understanding of both our business and the market  
in which we operate. Our ambitions mean we will continue to 
strengthen our leadership, bringing in the capabilities we need  
to take full advantage of the opportunities presented to us.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone at 
JUST EAT for their commitment and contribution to our success 
this year.
Looking ahead
JUST EAT has an extensive opportunity to grow over the 
coming years. We are determined to grasp that opportunity 
and to maximise the benefits for our consumers, restaurants, 
employees and shareholders. 
Our prospects are underpinned by our leadership positions, 
a takeaway food market growing faster than global GDP, and 
above all, the sizeable potential for channel shifting orders from 
phone to online, which is still in its early stages.
Over time, our opportunity to continue to build the global leader 
in this space is clear. The strength of our brand and technology 
and our ability to innovate will also open up adjacent markets for 
us, such as collection, giving us access to new sources of 
growth, revenues and profits.

CEO’s Statement
Continued strategic progress
We are committed to leading the industry and improving our 
consumers’ experience. During 2014, we continued our mobile-
led product evolution, with our web refresh meaning users see 
the same product flow, whatever device they are using. We 
expanded our pilot in real-time order tracking with trials now  
in 11 restaurants. In the long-term, we believe our ability to 
innovate at scale will profoundly change the consumer 
experience and reinforce the benefits of building the leading 
market place for the fragmented takeaway industry.
Our technology gives us a real competitive advantage in bringing 
greater choice. JUST EAT has more than a decade of experience 
in building, operating and enhancing a complex real-time 
eCommerce platform. At peak, we now process 1,100 orders  
per minute through our contracted network, demonstrating  
our ability to reliably deliver scalable solutions to our 45,700 
restaurant partners. We have recently worked on expanding  
into the collection market and have now signed over 1,000 
collection-only restaurants in the UK; initial results from this 
market are positive.
Consumers trust strong brands. We believe that television 
remains the best way to reach a mass-market audience, to help 
create and strengthen our brand and accelerate channel shift 
from telephone to online. We remain strongly committed to 
building our brand in all of our markets, and we are now a TV 
brand in the majority of them. This investment increases loyalty 
and consumer allegiance to JUST EAT, ensuring we remain the 
clear choice for hungry consumers. In the UK, top-of-mind 
awareness
1 
increased from 39% in December 2013 to 44% 
in December 2014.
In our business, being market leader is critical for many reasons, 
crucially to ensure the consumer has a strong single source of 
information and choice in a highly fragmented sector. We 
continue to build clear leadership positions wherever we operate. 
In Brazil, we merged our business with iFood to give us a 25% 
share of the undisputed market leader, increasing our stake to 
30% after year-end. In France we increased our share in market 
leading alloresto.fr from 50% to 80%. These deals have 
strengthened our position in two of our key international 
markets. We also cemented our leadership position in Ireland 
with the purchase of Eatcity.ie in November 2014. 
Order growth is a key measure of 
JUST EAT’s success. It illustrates how 
well we have executed on our strategy 
and reinforces the attractiveness of  
our market for the long-term. In 2014, 
orders grew by 52% to 61.2 million, 
worth over £1 billion to our restaurant 
partners. 
Revenue grew 62% to £157.0 million. 
Underlying EBITDA increased to £32.6 
million from £14.1 million, which is an 
excellent result in a period where we 
made significant investment in our 
future growth.

Clear priorities
We have a clear focus on delivering on our three strategic 
initiatives, including completing appropriate M&A and developing 
our people for the long-term. 
We are continuing to increase our investment in engineering and 
product into 2015, to accelerate the introduction of new features 
on our platforms. We are driving channel shift through initiatives 
such as mobile and brand refresh; improving the consumer 
experience through innovation and improved information whilst 
expanding choice through restaurant signings. 
We completed seven M&A transactions during the year and three 
post year-end. These delivered on our stated aims of acquiring 
leaders in markets of scale, making in-market acquisitions and 
advancing our technology base. 
People are integral to what we do and we have an outstanding 
team of more than 1,500 passionate and dedicated JUST EATers. 
We are committed to enhancing our team by selective 
recruitment and developing our existing team through our 
in-house talent management programmes. We have opened a 
new office in Bristol with support from Invest Bristol & Bath and 
are building a relationship with the University of Bristol to attract 
the best technical engineering graduates in the West Country 
and Wales, an area with a history of success within the 
technology sector. 
Outlook
Looking forward, we must capitalise on our clear leadership 
positions both in established markets such as the UK and in 
large, developing markets such as France, Brazil and Spain, 
markets of significant scale but in which online ordering is still at 
an early stage. Building leadership positions in those markets will 
create great long-term value for shareholders.
Going into 2015, JUST EAT is in a very strong position. We are on 
track to deliver on our growth targets and in 2015 we currently 
expect revenues marginally in excess of £200 million, at current 
exchange rates. 
We will continue to drive channel shift and further strengthen 
our brand. We will also continue to innovate and then scale that 
innovation, to ensure new products and features are available  
to the vast majority of our 8.1 million Active Users, truly 
empowering them to love their takeaway experience.

Market Overview
Our current markets
The optimal market for JUST EAT is where eCommerce is 
established and where the high street is highly fragmented, 
consisting of lots of independent takeaway restaurants and few 
chains. This has been key in choosing those territories in which 
we invest. The UK, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy and Spain are 
particularly strong examples of a highly fragmented takeaway 
market in which aggregators such as JUST EAT should thrive.
As might be expected, we experience some seasonal fluctuations 
in our order growth rates, particularly in the UK and Northern 
Europe where the seasons tend to be more pronounced, 
characterised by long cold winters and short days. When it  
is cold and wet, more consumers choose to stay inside and  
order takeaway.
Who are our consumers
The biggest demographic of JUST EAT consumers are families 
and students. Families tend to place orders of higher value, as 
opposed to our student consumers who typically order more 
cheaply and for fewer people. Lifestyles have shifted, with 
consumers looking for convenience options that fit with their 
increasingly busy daily routines. This, combined with the growing 
variety of takeaway food, including increasingly healthier choices 
becoming available, has resulted in consumers embracing 
takeaway as a feature of their daily routine.
Our aggregator model works best  
in geographies with a fragmented 
takeaway restaurant market and

Current market trends
The markets in which JUST EAT currently operates were 
estimated to represent a total annual takeaway order value (for 
delivery) of £20.0 billion in 2013, of which the UK represented 
the largest amount at £4.4 billion.
This highlights the significant potential of scale in the online 
takeaway delivery market. In the UK, our core market, the most 
recent survey from February 2015 now puts the market for the 
delivery of takeaway food at £5.5 billion. The UK’s phone and 
collect market, which we are only now starting to address, adds 
an estimated further £2.6 billion, highlighting the scale of 
opportunity open to JUST EAT.
In recent years, the takeaway food market has been growing 
faster than GDP, with online ordering growing much faster 
fuelled by the adoption of eCommerce and increased 
smartphone/tablet penetration
1
. The online channel shift 
experienced in the ordering of takeaway food is similar to the 
migration towards the use of the Internet by consumers in other 
highly fragmented markets, such as holiday and airline bookings, 
insurance, tickets for live entertainment, classified advertising 
and restaurant bookings.

Our Business Model
JUST EAT operates a simple success-based 
business model which has a beneficial 
cash flow cycle, creating value for 
consumers, restaurants and shareholders.
Consumers are attracted to the JUST EAT platform due to the 
brand, choice of restaurants, ordering convenience and the 
ratings and reviews available. Consumer orders on the platform 
create benefits for other users by increasing the number of 
restaurant ratings and reviews. More consumers attracts more 
restaurants to sign-up, which in turn increases choice and drives 
more consumers to order takeaway through JUST EAT, 
completing the virtuous circle.
Success-based revenue model
We have a simple success-based revenue model which is highly 
scalable. Order-driven (“B2C”) revenues account for 89% of total 
Group revenues, comprising commission paid by the restaurant 
on successfully fulfilled orders and payment card or admin fees. 
Commission revenue is driven by the number of orders placed, 
the average order value (“AOV”) and commission rates. Thus, an 
increase in any one of these three variables will have a positive 
impact on the B2C revenue. The AOV is principally driven by the 
demographic of the consumer ordering, such as families or 
students and increases with food/service inflation. The 
commission rates are agreed in the contractual terms with the 
restaurants and vary by country. In January, we successfully 
raised commission rates in the UK from 11% to 12% with only  
a handful of restaurants leaving the network as a result.
Five per cent of the Group’s revenue consists of connection  
fees, which is a one-off charge of up to £850 (depending on 
geography) paid by a restaurant to join the JUST EAT network.  
It is important to JUST EAT that restaurants are making a 
conscious decision to join the JUST EAT platform and that  
they have an interest in treating the orders sent to them from 
our platforms with the same care and attention as all their  
other orders. 
A restaurant may also pay for additional services such as 
promotional top-placement on the JUST EAT platform and 
branded commodity products, which together constitute 6%  
of the Group’s revenue. Top-placement fees are charged to 
restaurants who want to be listed in one of four clearly-labelled 
sponsored slots at the top of search results in a particular 
postcode. By paying this fee, the restaurant secures a top-
placement slot for a particular postcode for a period of up to 
12 weeks. Our “organic” listings below these top-placement slots 
are not affected by restaurant payments and are ordered by 
restaurant ratings and distance from the consumer.
Beneficial cash flow cycle
When a consumer pays online, JUST EAT collects the full order 
value on behalf of the restaurant. Payment to restaurants of the 
funds collected, less our fees, is typically made twice per month. 
As over 60% of orders are paid for by card, JUST EAT operates 
with a very favourable working capital cycle.
Revenue Journey
Payment card/
admin fees
A small fee is charged 
typically on orders paid 
for by card. Restaurants 
can choose to pass this 
fee on to the consumer. 
Connection fees 
Restaurants pay a one-off 
fee to join the JUST EAT 
network. The pricing of 
connection fees varies 
with geography, depending 
on market maturity.
Commission 
Commission is charged to 
restaurants on the value of 
successful orders placed by 
consumers. The rate charged 
varies by country. In January 
2014, we successfully raised 
commission rates in the 
UK from 11% to 12%.
T op-placement fee 
and other revenue
Restaurants can choose to 
pay for additional services 
such as promotional top-
placement and branded 
commodity products, 
which we can supply 
at lower prices.   15 www.just-eat.com

How We Generate V alue
The diagram below summarises the key drivers behind how JUST EAT achieves sustainable growth. It is based on four  
inter-linking value drivers – scalability, technology, brand and people. Through our focus on these areas, we generate  
value for our consumers, restaurants and shareholders.
Scalability
When creating, developing 
and maintaining our 
technology, we recognise 
the importance of 
scalability. We invest 
heavily to ensure our 
platforms and apps are 
robust, flexible and secure 
enough to meet increasing 
peaks of demand from 
consumers and restaurants.
T echnology
Our technology is making 
life easier for consumers 
and restaurants. The 
JUST EAT system enables 
restaurants to efficiently 
manage their order process 
by reducing communication 
errors that could be 
made over the phone and 
reducing the time spent on 
processing. The JUST EAT 
websites and apps enables 
consumers to make 
informed choices about 
what food to order in a 
quick and convenient way. 
People
Our people are integral to 
all that we do at JUST EAT. 
We have an outstanding 
central team who are 
responsible for designing, 
implementing, maintaining, 
supporting and promoting 
our websites and apps, 
as well as great local 
teams who lead sales, 
marketing and operational 
functions in-country. 
Brand
Consumers have the 
reassurance of ordering 
from a well-known, trusted 
brand, receiving customer 
service through JUST EAT 
online support or offline 
through call centres. 
Brand association helps 
restaurants to drive scale in 
orders by enabling efficient

Who we create value for
Consumers
Our platform allows consumers to make informed choices about 
what food to order and then do so in a convenient manner.  
The consumer can examine the full menu for each takeaway 
restaurant and read consumer reviews and ratings. In the  
UK they can also click on a link to the Food Standards  
Agency ratings. 
Consumers can choose to store their card details securely with 
JUST EAT, along with contact details, favourite restaurants and 
favourite meals. They can choose to place an order wherever 
they are using one of our mobile apps or mobile website. The 
consumer has the reassurance of ordering from a well-known, 
trusted brand, receiving customer service through JUST EAT 
online support or offline through our call centres. 
This access to readily accessible relevant and recent information, 
combined with ordering simplicity helps to drive channel shift, 
one of our strategic initiatives for growth.
Shareholders
2014 has been a milestone year for JUST EAT on our long-term 
journey of growth and development. In April, the Group 
successfully entered the High Growth segment of the London 
Stock Exchange, subsequently transferring to a Premium Listing 
in May and joining the FTSE 250 in June. 
By delivering value to our consumers and restaurants, we 
ultimately drive long-term financial value to our shareholders. 
Given the high growth of the business, the Group intends to 
retain any earnings generated in the short-term in order to fund 
development and expansion. As such, despite a 200% increase 
in adjusted EPS to 4.2p, we have not paid a dividend in 2014 
since IPO (one was paid in April 2014 prior to the IPO as part of 
a capital restructuring) and it is anticipated that dividends will 
not be paid in the foreseeable future. Our focus remains on 
driving growth through our strategic initiatives in the medium-
term across all our markets.
Business Model  
continued
Consumer Journey
Postcode 
The local JUST EAT websites 
and apps enable consumers 
to search for restaurants 
in their area using their 
postcode, sorted by cuisine 
choice and preference for 
delivery or collection.
Payment method 
The final stage in placing an 
order is for the consumer 
to choose to either pay 
securely online with stored 
card details or pay cash 
on delivery/collection.
Choose 
restaurant
Consumers can make 
an informed choice 
by reading customer 
reviews and examining 
the full menu. There are 
currently over seven million 
reviews on JUST EAT. 
Delivery method 
If the restaurant provides 
the option, a consumer can 
choose delivery or to collect 
the order themselves.

Restaurants
Takeaway restaurants may not have the knowledge or readily 
available capital to invest in creating their own platform. 
Additionally, many do not have the time or investment to spend 
on marketing, particularly dealing with the complexities of online 
search and promotion or building a broader brand. Brand 
association helps restaurants to drive scale in orders.
JUST EAT provides an easy solution to these problems, enabling 
efficient entry to the online market. In addition, takeaway 
restaurants often see an increase in average order values for 
online orders as consumers shop the whole menu at their own 
pace. The JUST EAT platform improves restaurant efficiency; 
accepting an online order is significantly quicker and more 
efficient than processing a telephone order.
The receipt of clear print-outs, rather than hand written notes  
of consumer orders also reduces communication errors. This 
improvement in speed and efficiency is particularly beneficial 
during peak ordering times, reducing or eliminating orders lost 
through an engaged phone line.
We help takeaway restaurants to develop their businesses 
through feedback for consumer preferences and reviews left on 
the JUST EAT platform, ultimately helping to drive standards in 
the takeaway food industry. We also utilise our buying power to 
offer restaurants JUST EAT branded commodity products at a 
lower price than is available to them individually.
Peak orders per minute
Demand is highly concentrated at weekends and evenings. Our 
core platform has maintained high availability whilst managing 
peak volumes, such as the 1,000 orders a minute processed for 
the hungry romantics ordering on St. Valentine’s Day 2014. The 
growth in the peak volumes is shown below.
Strong, Active Relationships with T akeaway Restaurants
More orders 
An online presence and 
access to JUST EAT’s 
8.1 million Active Users, 
helps restaurants to 
generate more orders. 
More efficient 
order processing
The JUST EAT platform 
reduces communication 
errors and enables 
restaurants to significantly 
reduce processing time.
Higher value 
Consumers who order 
online through JUST EAT, 
on average, tend to 
spend more than when 
ordering on the phone.
Services 
Restaurants have access 
to other benefits such as 
cheaper menu printing 
and branded commodity 
products, as well as feedback 
on consumer preferences.

When ordering takeaway food for 
delivery, consumers are focused on three 
aspects: choice, delivery time and the 
quality of their food.
Continued innovation
We will continue to invest in technology and product, both to 
ensure our platform scalability and to innovate our consumer 
offer and restaurant technology platforms. During the year,  
we have been developing and piloting real-time order tracking, 
which will enable consumers to track their order through every 
stage from placement to delivery. We remain excited about how 
this innovation will fundamentally change the consumer ordering 
experience and it is now being trialled in 11 restaurants. Our 
focus in 2015 will be on addressing the challenge of scaling  
order tracking both technically and operationally across the 
JUST EAT network.
Better information
Having better information is key in enabling consumers to make 
empowered choices. 
Consumer reviews, which can only be placed by those who  
have ordered, offer valuable insight into other people’s views on 
food quality, service and delivery. At 31 December 2014, we had 
3.7 million reviews on our UK platform. In addition to these 
reviews which are updated daily, we also include a link to the 
Food Standards Agency for access to historical regulatory data.
Once a postcode is entered, the Search Engine Results Page 
(“SERP”) lists the restaurants that are available to deliver. There 
are four clearly labelled top-placement slots at the top of the 
SERP. All of the restaurants listed below these are ranked based 
on the consumer rating they have received and distance from 
the consumer, placing the higher-rated restaurants at the top. 
In 2014 we added drive distance to our SERP. When using a  
web browser, the restaurant distances are shown next to the 
restaurant name and rating. Those ordering on a tablet device 
can view the distances on a map. Geo-location is now functional 
on the iPhone and Android apps and tablets.
 Denmark segment
We had over 230,000 restaurant reviews on the 
Danish platform at the end of 2014. 
 Other segment
In Spain we successfully implemented saved cards 
which enables consumers to securely store their 
credit card details for ease of future ordering.

Enhancing our offering to restaurants 
will drive loyalty from our existing 
restaurant partner base and encourage 
other restaurants to join. Consumers  
are focused on making informed choices 
and by increasing our coverage we  
will attract more consumers to the 
JUST EAT platform.
Technology advances
Our vision is to be fully integrated into how a takeaway 
restaurant operates, moving away from traditional transaction 
methods. This means not just facilitating JUST EAT orders but 
enabling us to offer our takeaway restaurant partners the right 
tools to manage their businesses. In order to accelerate this 
initiative we completed the purchase of EPOS technology 
business Meal2Go, whose market-leading EPOS technology is 
specifically designed for the takeaway restaurant industry. We 
have continued to adapt this technology, now called OrderPoint. 
This level of technology will only be applicable to a proportion  
of restaurant partners, as it goes beyond the requirements of a 
small, independent establishment. For those smaller restaurants, 
we are developing a less complex, tablet-based order-
management platform called Orderpad. Over 300 takeaway 
restaurants have Orderpad trial units installed and as we develop 
it further, we plan to expand this number during 2015.
Coverage
With the growing popularity of JUST EAT’s mobile apps, we 
anticipate that ordering for collection will become an increasing 
part of the Group’s business. Entering the collection-only market 
offers significant growth opportunity. The total phone and collect 
takeaway market in the UK alone is estimated at £2.6 billion,  
a significant proportion of which should be addressable  
by JUST EAT. 
During the first half of the year we conducted a collection pilot  
in Brighton, and based on the findings from this trial, have made 
several improvements to the collection-specific capability offered 
on the JUST EAT platform. Discounts have been offered on the 
connection fees paid by the restaurants to encourage early 
sign-up by collection-only restaurants as we build our offering to 
the consumer. We have now signed over 1,000 collection-only 
restaurants to the JUST EAT platform across the UK and are 
planning further expansion in 2015. 
The total number of contracted takeaway restaurants on 
JUST EAT platforms has increased by 26% to 45,700 as at 
31 December 2014, compared with 36,400 at the end of the prior 
year. As we continue to broaden our offering to consumers, by 
adding collection-only restaurants and potentially growing our 
directory-style listings of restaurant contact details, the number 
of takeaway restaurants will no longer provide a clear underlying 
performance benchmark and ceases to be a valid KPI in its own 
right. There is now a greater focus on consumer order-driven 
metrics. Further detail is provided within the Key Performance 
Indicators section on page 26.
 Denmark segment
We have focused on the collection market and this 
now represents 5% of the total Danish estate.

We launched an online JUST EAT merchandise 
store for restaurants in Spain and Ireland.

Driving channel shift from traditional 
telephone to online ordering continues 
to be the focus for JUST EAT. Even in the 
UK, one of our more developed markets, 
over 70% of takeaway orders are still 
placed using the telephone.
This channel shift represents the main opportunity for JUST EAT. 
Consumer migration from offline to online ordering remains in its 
early stages in the vast majority of our geographies. 
We expect to see online ordering continue to grow, particularly 
with the increasing propensity of consumers to use their mobile 
devices to purchase goods and services. 
We believe improving the consumer experience will help to  
drive further channel shift from traditional telephone to online 
ordering. During 2014 our Active Users grew by 37% to 
8.1 million, up from 5.9 million at 31 December 2013.
Mobile-led strategy
Mobile penetration has increased significantly, due to the rise in 
popularity of smartphones and tablets. In the UK, smartphone 
penetration of households has increased to 68% from 51% 
between 2013 and 2014. Similarly, tablet penetration has 
increased to 46% from 24% over the same time period
1
. Our 
mobile-led strategy has resulted in over 60% of JUST EAT UK 
orders now being placed using a mobile device. This is coupled 
with evidence that shows that app users order more frequently. 
We will continue to focus on this throughout 2015. In the UK, 
orders can now be made through Android (tablets and phones), 
iPhone, iPad or Windows 8 mobile, Kindle Fire tablets and of 
course, a PC. The additional benefit of mobiles is that orders 
coming via app direct to JUST EAT rather than via search  
engines avoid search engine fees, the chance of competitor 
redirection and reduces the risks associated with changes in 
search provider algorithms.
Building the brand
To encourage migration of consumers from offline to online 
ordering, we continue to build the JUST EAT brand through 
innovative campaigns such as the #minifistpump campaign 
launched in October 2014. Consumers trust well-known brands 
with which they identify, helping make our business model highly 
defensible as we become a more established brand in all of our 
geographies. We now undertake television marketing in the 
overwhelming majority of our countries. 
JUST EAT’s spontaneous brand awareness among UK takeaway 
consumers increased from 39% in December 2013 to 44% in 
December 2014
2
. This measures the percentage of consumers  
for whom a given brand is the first that comes to mind in a 
category and demonstrates how brand investment increases 
consumer loyalty.

Our People
to attract the best people from the West Country and Wales. We 
hope that initiatives such as these will enable us to attract talent 
that fits with the JUST EAT culture and can also be our leaders 
and innovators of the future.
Losing the Group’s culture is considered a principal risk  
(see page 36). Whilst the Group has been on a growth journey 
and processes and controls sufficient to manage this have been 
in place and operating effectively, there is no doubt that the 
listed environment creates a new dynamic that we are 
consciously managing. 
Please refer to the Corporate Social Responsibility section on 
page 40 for further details on our employee policies which 
enable us to attract and retain the highest calibre of employees. 
One of the highlights of the Group’s calendar is the annual 
“World Party”. Every eligible employee is invited to spend the day 
with their colleagues from around the world. The day consists of 
a CEO update, Executive Team briefings and awards to celebrate 
individual and team successes. This is combined with team 
building and social activities to ensure the cultural spirit (known 
as the “JUST EAT JAM”) that has driven our success to date is 
reinforced and spread.
Our people are an integral part of 
JUST EAT’s ongoing success. They are 
responsible for helping to design, 
implement and deliver on our strategic 
objectives, as well as developing new 
initiatives to enable us to maintain  
our growth. 
We strive to maintain a high performance, entrepreneurial 
culture. As part of this, we launched the JUST EAT Academy  
in 2013. Its flagship course, the JUST EAT Management Stars 
(“JEMS”) programme was fully rolled out in 2014. This is 
multi-tiered, open to all levels of management and aimed at 
developing our future leaders. As we transition towards 
becoming a large company we have started to focus more on 
staff development and career planning, including formalising  
our annual review and development process.
As well as developing our existing staff, we seek to attract the 
best talent in the market. We are introducing a new graduate 
development programme starting in 2015. We have also opened 
our technology site in Bristol, with support from Invest Bristol & 
Bath and are building a relationship with the University of Bristol

Disciplined Approach 
to M&A
There are consumer benefits from having 
a single, strong brand which brings 
together the highly fragmented 
takeaway restaurant market in a single 
place. This is the key driver for the 
emergence of clear market leaders by 
geography in our sector. Network effects 
such as the breadth of comparable 
information (from reviews), single 
branded point of contact, platform scale 
and efficiency and depth of restaurant 
relationships all drive these consumer 
benefits and thus, typically the 
emergence of a player of scale.
For this reason, our approach to M&A is one that is focused on 
achieving our strategic objectives whilst remaining financially 
disciplined. We will continue to focus on building and maintaining 
our existing market leading positions where we have a proven 
track record. Acquisitions will either consolidate our existing 
market positions, or enable our entry into new markets of scale 
through the acquisition of market leaders.
In 2014 we purchased Meal2Go and Orogo for their technological 
innovation. We acquired number two player Eatcity.ie in Ireland 
to consolidate our market position there, and completed the 
French (alloresto.fr) and Brazilian (iFood) deals to secure market 
leadership in those markets. Since the year end, we have 
completed the purchase of Sindelantal Mexico. The Mexican 
market is one of the most exciting in our portfolio and 
Sindelantal is the largest online takeaway food provider  
in the country. 
After the year end, as well as the Mexican acquisition, we 
increased our share in our Swiss business from 64% to 100%.

Key Performance 
Indicators
As we finalise our trials in the collection-only market and 
directory-style service in order to achieve greater completeness 
for consumers, the total number of restaurants as a KPI in itself 
will cease to be a valid measure. We therefore plan to review  
the appropriateness of this KPI, particularly since its relevance 
declines as market penetration increases and the focus shifts  
to more order/consumer centric measures such as our mobile 
app penetration.
The KPIs used by JUST EAT, together with their performance 
over the last four years, are shown below.

The growth in 2014 was delivered alongside an increase in 
Underlying EBITDA in the UK and Denmark and, as planned, our 
Other segment losses were in line with 2013 but generated 83% 
more revenue. The returns generated in the UK and Denmark 
more than offset the ongoing investment in Other and Head 
Office resulting in the Underlying EBITDA for the Group 
increasing by 131% to £32.6 million.
Underlying EBITDA converts strongly to operating cash flow due 
to the beneficial working capital cycle inherent in the business 
model. In 2014, operating cash flow represented 117% of 
Underlying EBITDA (2013: 136%). 
The investment seen during 2014 is expected to continue in 2015 
as we strengthen our team, expand our marketing activities and 
develop existing and new products. This investment is expected 
to deliver long-term growth and for 2015, the Board currently 
expects revenues to marginally exceed £200 million (at current 
exchange rates).
The results of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 demonstrate 
the ongoing strength of the JUST EAT 
business model, with revenue growth of 
62% (65% on a forex neutral basis) and 
continued margin expansion.
This significant increase in revenue  
and the operational leverage achieved 
resulted in the Group Underlying 
EBITDA

 margin growing to 21% from 
15%. This is pleasing in a year in 
which we delivered a successful IPO, 
completed seven M&A transactions and 
continued to drive long-term growth 
through further investment in staff, 
marketing, technology and product. 
1 Underlying EBITDA is defined as earnings before finance income and costs, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation and additionally excludes the Group’s share of 
depreciation and amortisation of the joint venture and associates, long-term employee 
incentive costs, exceptional items, foreign exchange gains and losses and “other gains”.  29 www.just-eat.com

The Income Statement includes some significant fluctuations  
that are not considered part of normal business operations.  
These include the “other gains”, long-term employee incentive 
costs, exceptional items (such as the IPO costs and acquisition 
costs) and foreign exchange. These are removed from the 
measure of profit before tax, along with interest, depreciation  
and amortisation to arrive at Underlying EBITDA. This is the 
measure we use to assess our operational and segmental 
performance. We believe this Underlying EBITDA measure  
more accurately reflects the key drivers of long-term profitability 
for the Group and removes those items (both positive and 
negative), which are mainly non-cash and do not impact 
underlying trading performance.

Segmental review
The Group reports its results under three operating segments, 
the UK, Denmark and Other. The UK and Danish operations are 
shown separately as they are our most established markets in 
terms of market penetration and maturity. The Other segment 
contains all other controlled businesses, which are at various 
stages of growth and development. Some are profitable whilst 
others are still at an earlier stage requiring significant investment 
relative to their size, particularly in sales and marketing. To 
ensure appropriate measurement of success by segment, the 
results of each segment include its fully allocated share of central 
technology, product and head office costs, as explained below.
Technology and Product continue to be areas of significant 
additional investment, with head count in 2014 increasing to 206 
from 126. It is predominantly run as a single integrated team to 
improve efficiency and speed up internationalisation of products. 
The individual trading segments are allocated the full cost of this 
support and development (including all servers, maintenance, 
innovation and engineering) on a per fixed order fee basis for 
those nine countries on our “core” platform representing 95% of 
orders. During 2014, only a small proportion of specific project 
costs were not allocated which were either included as part of 
Head Office costs or capitalised. As we move to further develop 
the innovative technology referred to in the CEO statement, we 
expect some of the additional investment in technology 
development to be capitalised in 2015 and beyond.  30 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Head office costs include both the ongoing central costs of 
operating the Group as a whole and those functions required for 
efficiency of shared expertise, such as Search Engine Marketing 
(“SEM”), finance, legal and HR. Those Head Office costs that can 
be reasonably attributed to individual segments are allocated on 
a consistent basis and therefore, the reported Head Office costs 
are the true central costs remaining after such allocations.
The results from Joint Ventures are equity accounted and 
presented separately since the Group does not control  
these operations.

The UK business had another excellent year and continues to be 
the main driver of revenue growth in the Group. The order-driven 
revenues (predominately commission) continued to grow, both  
in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue. These 
represented 92% of total UK revenue (2013: 88%). 
The key drivers of UK order growth (up 56% to 45.5 million) 
include:
• expansion of the restaurant partner network where we added 
over 4,500 new takeaway restaurants to the platform during 
the year (2013: 4,700). Included within this number for the 
first time are over 1,000 new restaurants signed as part of our 
trial to expand our offering to include collection-only 
restaurants (i.e. those who do not offer delivery services). 
Expansion of this trial will continue in 2015 and our focus will 
be on driving consumer adoption; 
• an overall increase in Active Users in the UK to 5.5 million at 
31 December 2014 from 3.9 million at 31 December 2013;
• continuous improvement of our mobile offering, including  
the launch of iPad and Android tablet apps. During the year 
total mobile orders (including tablets) in the UK accounted  
for almost 61% of total orders (2013: 43%) and orders via  
our apps now account for 55% of these mobile orders (up 
from 43%);

• investment in marketing, which continued to grow with an 
increase in total spend of 42%, all of which was expensed to 
the income statement. 2014 saw a number of new initiatives, 
namely the refresh of our brand and launch of our 
#minifistpump campaign, along with sponsoring ITV’s Take 
Me Out and becoming the main shirt sponsor for Derby 
County Football Club. These complemented our ongoing 
activities in digital, trade and brand marketing. Despite the 
size of the increase in marketing investment, spend as a 
percentage of revenue reduced to 18% from 21% last  
year; and
• year-on-year order growth comparatives can be impacted by 
particularly hot or cold and wet weather. However, the very 
wet spell in the UK at the end of 2013 and into early 2014 has 
had little overall effect on the year-on-year growth rates as 
the positive impact in January/February 2014 was offset by 
tougher prior year comparatives for December 2014.
The UK continued to break daily order records through the year 
and in November reached the milestone of processing its 100 
millionth UK order since it started trading in March 2006.
On 1 January 2014 the commission rate charged to restaurants 
on orders increased to 12% from 11%, the first increase in three 
years. Only a handful of restaurants left the network following 
this price change, which we feel supports the work we have done 
in building relationships with our restaurant partners and in 
demonstrating the value JUST EAT brings to their businesses. 
This commission increase was the major driver in the 10% 
increase year-on-year in UK Average Revenue per Order 
(“ARPO”). This is up from the 2013 year-on-year ARPO growth  
of 2.4% that was driven just by food/service price inflation. 
Underlying EBITDA margin (the segment result) in the UK  
grew to 40% (2013: 37%). Our belief in the scale of the 
opportunity in the UK means that we will continue to invest  
in UK sales, marketing, technology and new products to  
drive long-term growth.

The Danish business has continued to perform well in the 
relatively mature Danish online takeaway market, a credit  
to the team. Revenue, up 10% (2013: 16%) to £12.8 million  
(2013: £11.6 million), was driven mainly by an increase in  
orders up 7% to 4.5 million (2013: 4.2 million) and conversion  
of top-placement advertising. 
On a forex neutral basis, revenue growth in Denmark would have 
been 16% (2013: 10%).
The Underlying EBITDA margin in Denmark was maintained  
at 40% (2013: 40%) generating £5.1 million of Underlying 
EBITDA (2013: £4.6 million). As with revenues, the weakness  
of the Danish Kroner reduced the reported 2014 EBITDA on 
conversion to Pound Sterling compared with 2013. We continue 
to believe there remains steady revenue growth prospects in  
the Danish market and as such we will manage margins in 
Denmark to maximise such growth rather than optimise for 
short-term profitability. 32 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

This segment consists of the trading entities we control outside 
the core UK and Danish businesses, including our higher 
potential growth opportunity countries of France, Canada and 
Spain. Our French business became part of this segment in July 
2014 when we obtained control by increasing our shareholding 
from 50% to 80%. Brazil ceased to be consolidated from 
November following that businesses’ merger with iFood when 
JUST EAT’s stake reduced to 25%. We increased this stake to 
30% post year-end. 
Progress in this segment remains good with total revenue up 
83% to £29.8 million in 2014, up 96% on a forex neutral basis. 
This growth includes the impact of consolidating the French 
business from July but having to exclude the Brazilian business 
from November. Adjusting for these changes, the growth would 
have been 64% on a forex neutral basis. Additionally, the 
contraction of our Dutch business has a notable detrimental 
impact on our reported growth in this segment. 
This segment represents a blend of growth rates across the nine 
geographies. Spain and Italy are amongst the fastest growing 
countries, with slightly slower growth in our more mature 
markets such as the now profitable Irish business. The only 
outlier is the highly competitive Benelux region, which contracted 
slightly during the year and where we remain the number two in 
the market.
Orders remain the key driver of growth in this segment, growing 
by 62% year-on-year (2013: 60%). On a like for like basis 
(adjusting for the changes in control), orders grew 51%. The 
Other segment also benefitted from rising food prices and 
commission rates being gradually increased in some territories, 
leading to an ARPO increase of 8.7% (2013: 15.7%).
With continued investment in growth full-year Underlying EBITDA 
losses in the Other segment remain in line with 2013 at £11.8 
million, although reducing significantly as a percentage of 
revenues. Initiatives including the launch of television advertising 
in Spain and the expansion of French sales activities outside 
Paris, were planned and delivered with considerable success. The 
additional revenue generated by these initiatives was reinvested 
to build long-term growth potential. This, combined with the low 
levels of online penetration for takeaway ordering in the majority 
of these geographies, provides substantial runway for JUST EAT 
and we will continue our investment to drive consumer channel 
shift and secure market share.
Share of profits from the joint venture and associates
The Indian associate remained in this category all year and was 
the main driver of the reported JV losses. It was classified as 
Held for Sale in the balance sheet as it was sold after the 
year-end (see note 20).
The results of the French business moved from being classed as 
a Joint Venture into being a subsidiary in the Other segment in 
July 2014.
The joint venture and associates continue to perform strongly. 
We are delighted to have merged our business with iFood to 
create the undisputed market leader in Brazil in which we owned 
25% at the year-end. Following the merger, this business has 
become one of the fastest growing geographies in the Group  
and now has over 480,000 orders per month. Given the market 
potential in Brazil we expect to continue to invest heavily in  
this associate.
Head Office Costs
Head Office costs, after recharges, have significantly increased 
year-on-year due to the expenses of being a publicly listed 
company and the impact of further investment in people, 
technology and product. The vast majority of technology and 
product costs are expensed as incurred. As described above, 
technology and certain Head Office costs are allocated to the 
Group’s operational businesses such that segmental EBITDAs 
include all appropriate costs. 
The Group has opened a second UK technology site in Bristol in 
order to attract talent from the West Country and Wales.

Items between Underlying EBITDA and Operating Profit
Depreciation
The depreciation charges mainly relate to the JCT terminals that 
are in situ in the vast majority of the 45,700 restaurants on the 
JUST EAT network. These are depreciated over three years. 
Amortisation
The amortisation charge principally relates to the intangibles 
acquired as a result of the many acquisitions completed by the 
Group. The assets principally acquired are the restaurant 
contracts, the brand of the acquired company and any 
intellectual property, typically relating to the underlying 
technology platform. The increase in the charge in 2014 
compared to 2013 (up £1.8 million to £2.7 million excluding the 
joint venture and associates) is principally a result of the 
intangible assets recognised as part of the Meal2Go purchase in 
February 2014 and the French step-up in July 2014. The full year 
impact of this additional amortisation will be felt in 2015. 
Long-term employee incentive costs
Long-term employee incentive costs of £4.9 million (2013: £1.7 
million) primarily relate to share awards granted to employees, 
recognised over the vesting period of the awards. The increased 
charge reflects the additional awards granted at or around the 
time of the IPO, including the free share award granted to all 
qualifying employees in April 2014. As a rapidly growing 
technology business, we expect equity participation to remain an 
important element of attracting and motivating the right people.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items of £2.7 million (2013: £1.0 million) included 
£2.3 million of costs relating to the IPO and £0.4 million of 
acquisition costs.
Foreign currency translation 
A foreign currency transaction gain of £0.2 million (2013: loss of 
£0.6 million) arose due to retranslating monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies. 
Items below operating profit
Other gains
The business has recorded a significant non-cash gain on two 
deemed disposals in relation to our French and Brazilian operations. 
The Group increased its stake in the French business from 50% 
to 80%. This resulted in a change in control and so the business 
was no longer treated as a joint venture, but as a subsidiary. The 
transaction resulted in a non-cash gain of £32.0 million, of which 
£17.8 million was the gain on the deemed disposal of the Joint 
Venture and £14.2 million resulted from the fair value gains on 
the Group’s option to acquire the remaining shares. 
The control of the Brazilian business also changed in the year. 
The business changed from being classified as a subsidiary to an 
associate, resulting in a further non-cash gain of £5.8 million. 
The 2013 comparative comprised £3.4 million non-cash gains on 
control changes in our Swiss and Indian businesses.
These non-cash gains are considered to be non-operational and 
so are excluded from Operating Profit and Underlying EBITDA. 
The gains recorded in 2014 are substantial, but are not taxable 
as they do not arise in the local books of the business.  
Net finance income
The finance income results from interest on deposits held. This  
is offset by the unwinding of the present value of the deferred 
consideration due on the French business, where an annual 
charge of c.£0.1 million is expected through to 2017. 
Profit before tax
Profit before tax for the year of £57.4 million (2013: £10.2 million) 
mainly included the operational profits of the Group, plus  
the non-cash gains made on the disposal of the French and 
Brazilian operations.  34 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Strategic
Report
Corporate

Financial
Statements
Taxation
The income tax expense was recognised at the tax rate 
prevailing in the respective jurisdictions on the estimated taxable 
profits for the year. The Group’s tax charge has increased to £5.6 
million (2013: £3.4 million) but the Effective Tax Rate (“ETR”) has 
fallen to 9.8% from 33.3% last year. The Adjusted ETR, after 
adjusting for the impact of the other gains, exceptional items, 
long-term employee incentive costs, foreign currency translation 
differences, amortisation in respect of acquired intangibles and 
their associated tax impact, is 22.6% (2013: 37.6%).
The reduction in the Adjusted ETR results primarily from the 
recognition of deferred tax assets in the UK and Switzerland, and 
the reducing corporate tax rates in the UK and Denmark. 
The Group pays significant tax on profits made in the UK and 
Denmark, but as losses generated in other jurisdictions cannot 
be offset against these profits, the Group’s ETR is higher than 
the prevailing UK corporate tax rate of 21.5%. We expect the 
Group’s ETR to trend towards this rate over time.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 9.8p (2013: 1.5p), representing a 
553.3% year-on-year increase.
Adjusted earnings per share were 4.2p (2013: 1.4p), up 200%. 
This excludes the impact of non-trading items that fluctuate  
from year to year, many of which have no cash impact. The 
Directors believe that this adjusted measure more appropriately 
reflects the underlying performance of the Group. Adjusted 
earnings per share is calculated using the adjusted profit 
attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares as set out  
in the table below.

The movement year-on-year on both measures is due to  
the higher Group profit, partly offset by dilution arising 
predominantly on the primary issue of shares on IPO.
Balance sheet
The relatively straightforward business model and low 
operational capital expenditure requirements of JUST EAT  
results in a simple balance sheet at an operating level.  
The consolidated balance sheet is more complex due to

Cash balances have increased mainly due to trading, the net 
proceeds from the IPO in April 2014 and the increase in cash 
held on behalf of restaurants due to order growth. Restaurant 
cash of £27.7 million was paid across to them shortly after  
the year-end.
Other current assets increased primarily due to the loans issued 
to employees and directors in relation to recent Joint Share 
Option Plan (“JSOP”) grants. There is a corresponding entry in 
share capital and share premium, and overall the cash impact on 
the Group from this transaction was nil.
Current liabilities increased due to growth in our operations, 
which increases trade payables and also results in a higher 
balance owed to restaurants at the year-end. The Group acquired 
borrowings of £0.5 million as a result of the French acquisition. 
Of these borrowings, £0.2 million has since been repaid and the 
remaining £0.3 million will be repaid during 2015. 
Non-current liabilities increased by £12 million to £14.2 million, 
primarily due to forward contracts to acquire non-controlling 
interests as explained in note 26 to the financial statements. 
Cash flow
The Group continued its high level of cash conversion, benefiting 
from collecting the gross order value ahead of making twice-
monthly net payments to restaurants. In 2014, cash generated 
from operations was £38.1 million (2013: £19.2 million).

The Group invested £19.3 million in investing activities during  
the year. Of this, £13.2 million (2013: £3.7 million) was spent 
acquiring subsidiaries and associates. The £3.7 million Meal2Go 
acquisition in February enabled us to acquire the market-leading 
EPOS technology for the UK takeaway sector and later in 2014 
we acquired the collection-app business Orogo. The Group 
strengthened its position in Ireland by buying number the two 
operator, Eatcity.ie; in France by acquiring a further 30% stake  
in Alloresto for £5.8 million; and in Brazil through its merger  
with iFood. 
The Group raised £95.7 million (net of fees) through the primary 
proceeds of the IPO and paid a pre-IPO dividend of £18.1 million. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group had cash balances totalling 
£164.4 million (2013: £61.6 million) and borrowings of £0.3 million 
(2013: £nil).
The Board has not recommended a dividend since the IPO, as in 
order to deliver longer term value, the Group intends to retain 
any earnings to invest in development and expansion as 
opportunities arise.
Post balance sheet events
The Group has completed three M&A transactions since the  
year end (Mexico, India and Switzerland) and has signed a 
facility agreement with a syndicate of banks consisting of 
Barclays Bank plc, HSBC plc and RBS plc, for a revolving credit 
facility for £90 million. This has a one-off fee and will result in  
an increase in interest costs for the Group in 2015, depending  
on the amount drawn down. As at the date of signing, the facility 
is unused.

Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties
The Board is responsible for leading the development of a comprehensive risk 
framework and a system of internal controls. This is to ensure the Group properly 
identifies, evaluates, prioritises and addresses the principal risks and uncertainties. 
There are general business risks faced by JUST EAT, which are those generally faced by other comparable online businesses. 
However, there are also more concentrated risks and uncertainties that affect our specific industry. The principal risks presented 
below are those risks considered by the Board to have a potentially material impact on the Group not achieving its long-term strategic 
objectives. There may be other risks that affect the Group’s performance.
As this is our first Annual Report as a listed Group, the change in the risk status has not been presented. In the future we plan to 
report the year on year change in risk status.

Corporate Social 
Responsibility
At JUST EAT we recognise our wider 
responsibility to manage and conduct 
our business in a socially responsible and 
ethical manner. 
We are progressing with a comprehensive review of the Group’s 
Corporate Social Responsibility policies, with the aim to integrate 
this as part of our broader corporate values and strategy.
People policies
The Group’s employment policies are designed to ensure that the 
Group is able to attract the best people from all sectors of the 
communities in which it operates, enabling JUST EAT to compete 
at the highest level. We value diversity in the workplace and are 
committed to providing equality of opportunity to all current and 
potential employees.
Our focus on advanced technologies requires a high level of 
technical expertise, and management works closely with vendors 
to ensure that employees are trained appropriately. We are 
committed to building an environment where each employee can 
fulfil their potential and encourage continuous training and skill 
development. Our multi-tiered in-house JUST EAT Management 
Stars programme (“JEMS”) is aimed at identifying and developing 
our leaders of the future. We also create a training schedule 
each year in order to meet our wider employee development 
needs as identified during their personal development reviews. 
External suppliers create bespoke courses based on these needs 
and individuals can choose to sign up online in order to manage 
their own development.
Our personnel practices ensure that every employee, wherever 
they work, whatever their role, is treated equally, fairly and 
respectfully at all times. Adherence to health and safety 
standards ensures that our people are properly protected and 
cared for, wherever they operate.
To support our commitment to open communication, we discuss 
with employees, through briefings and an international portal, 
matters likely to affect employees’ interests. Information on 
matters of concern is given through notices, meetings and 
reports, including information to help employees achieve a 
common awareness of the factors affecting the performance  
of the Group. We strive to achieve this whilst continuing to 
maintain a fun and energetic environment.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is available to all employees  
on the Company intranet. This details how employees can raise 
concerns surrounding risk, malpractice or wrongdoing that may 
affect our employees, consumers, restaurants, or which may be 
of public interest.
We conduct an externally managed annual employee satisfaction 
survey in order to gain insight into our people’s opinions on 
working at JUST EAT. We use this insight to continuing making 
JUST EAT great place to work. We have used this external 
consultancy company for two years, and have been listed  
in the top quartile of the 250 companies they survey.
Supporting graduates
Over the course of the year we have been developing new 
graduate development programmes which are due to commence 
in September 2015. The roles will include time spent in sales, 
operations, marketing, finance and HR, gaining exposure to all 
parts of the business. 
Diversity
We maintain consistent and transparent diversity policies 
across all our markets. We firmly believe that career opportunity, 
recognition and reward should be determined by a person’s 
capabilities and achievement, not their age, sex, race, religion 
or nationality.
Our policy for the employment of disabled persons is to provide 
equal opportunities compared with other employees, having 
regard to the maintenance of a safe working environment.
Gender
A breakdown of our Board, senior managers and all employees 
by gender at 31 December 2014 is provided below:
Number %
Male Female Male Female
Directors 8 1 89% 11%
Senior managers 27 4 87% 13%
All employees 901 584 61% 39%
We have determined that those members of management within 
the General Management Team (“GMT”) meet the definition of a 
senior manager.
At JUST EAT we remain committed to gender diversity and 
acknowledge the Davies report recommendations that at least 
25% of Board members should be female by 2015. We firmly 
believe in recruiting the right people but recognise we must 
progress a longer-term succession plan process to improve the 
gender balance in senior management positions.  41 www.just-eat.com

Culture
The JUST EAT culture goes hand-in-hand with the success of our 
business, helping our people around the world work together 
harmoniously to grow the business, whilst remaining a fun and 
energetic place to work. Our culture is driven by four key values 
known as “The JAM”; being frank, innovate, passionate and 
working as a team. It governs all that we do, and we believe it’s 
important that our people live and work by our values as this is 
what makes JUST EAT a unique, engaging and fun place to work.
Frank:
• Listen carefully
• Challenge honestly
• Laugh about it afterwards
Passionate:
• Love what you do
• Push yourself
• Inspire others by your example
Innovative:
• Try new things
• Create the future
• Keep improving
Working as a team:
• Help each other
• Share success
• Put the team before the player
Community
In 2014 we chose Starlight to be our nominated charity partner. 
Starlight is a charity who helps grant wishes for seriously and 
terminally ill children. They also provide entertainment, fun, 
laughter and distraction in every children’s hospital ward and 
hospice throughout the UK. All of their activities are aimed at 
distracting children from the pain, fear and isolation they can 
often feel as a result of their illness.
A total of 93% of funds raised by Starlight are put back into 
charitable spending, which was one of the factors used to select 
them. Since becoming our nominated charity, employees at 
JUST EAT have helped raise over £7,000 which has been 
matched by the Company and has gone towards granting wishes.
Human rights issues
Whilst the Group has no specific policy in place regarding human 
rights, we have an equal opportunities and a Code of Ethics 
policy that governs how all employees, officers, consultants, 
contractors, volunteers, interns, casual workers and agency 
workers are treated. We remain mindful of the spirit of any 
regulation when conducting our business. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions for the financial year ending 
31 December 2014 have been measured as required under the 
Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Account and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013. There is no 
comparative data as this is the first year for the Group to present 
such information. The main activities which release GHG include 
usage of purchased electricity, waste disposal, business travel, 
usage of vehicles, and staff commuting.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting standards (revised edition), data gathered to fulfil the 
requirements under the CRC Energy Efficiency scheme, and 
emission factors from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014 to calculate the disclosures.

lower carbon footprint in transportation when compared to 
recycled paper.

Corporate Governance 
Report
In the case of JUST EAT, although a relatively young company, 
we already had good governance practices in place before our 
IPO. There were regular and structured Board meetings with 
active participation by Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
alike. We had active Audit and Remuneration Committees 
comprised solely of Non-Executive Directors. We had a 
commitment to good practice in corporate governance as an 
essential part of creating shareholder value over the long-term. 
These were not adjuncts to the success of the business – they 
were right at the core of that success being achieved. 
Building on these firm foundations, we took the opportunity  
of the Company’s IPO to refresh our Board and Committee 
governance arrangements and bring them into line with 
recognised good practice for fully-listed companies based  
on the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “UK Code”).  
This has included:
1. Appointing three new independent Directors, Gwyn Burr and 
Andrew Griffith, in advance of our IPO, and Henri Moissinac 
following the IPO. They provide diverse, valuable and fully 
independent representation to our Board.
2. Reconstituting the Audit and Remuneration Committees with 
our new independent Directors and with updated terms of 
reference, and appointing a new Nominations Committee on a 
similar basis. Each of these Committees is now fully compliant 
with the recommendations of the UK Code.
3. Appointment of Andrew Griffith as our Senior Independent 
Director in addition to his role as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee.
4. Formalising other governance arrangements such as the 
division of responsibilities between David Buttress as CEO and 
me as Chairman and expanding the matters specifically 
reserved for the decision of the Board (reported on more fully 
in the report of our Board commencing on page 46).
5. Moving the remuneration of our Executive Directors towards 
more typical practice for listed companies (reported on more 
fully in the report of our Remuneration Committee 
commencing on page 58).
We view these developments as part of an ongoing process. Our 
view is that achieving best practice in corporate governance is a 
journey rather than a destination. In the same way as JUST EAT 
in the past year completed its IPO so it will continue to evolve in 
Bringing a company to the public 
markets provides its Board with an  
ideal opportunity to look afresh at its 
governance arrangements. Transparency 
is both welcomed and expected. 
Independent Board representation is 
mandatory. Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements are often amended.  43 www.just-eat.com

other ways that will require ongoing development of its 
governance arrangements. Our commitments to high standards 
of corporate governance and business integrity will allow us  
to continue to set the tone as well as the direction of the 
management of the Group. This will remain an important 
contributor to the continued creation of value for shareholders 
on a sustained basis over the long-term. 
UK Code compliance
This Corporate Governance Report, including the sections that 
follow, sets out how the Company has applied the main principles 
of good governance contained in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code for the period from the date of the Company’s IPO to 
December 2014. The Board considers that the Company has 
been compliant with the Code provisions that applied during this 
period, and will comply with those that apply after, with the 
following exceptions: 
1. Code Provision B.1.2 recommends that at least half the 
members of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should 
comprise Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board  
to be independent. For the purposes of assessing compliance 
with the Code, the Board considers that Gwyn Burr, Andrew 
Griffith, and Henri Moissinac are independent of management 
and free from any business or other relationship that could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement. 
The Board also considers that I, as Chairman of the Company, 
was independent at the time of appointment.
 As well as our two Executive Directors, we have three other 
Non-Executive Directors who were nominated by major 
shareholders and are therefore not considered to be 
independent for the purposes of the Code. Whilst the Board  
is therefore not fully compliant with this part of the Code, we 
believe its current membership works well, and intend to 
move to full compliance as the Board changes under the 
terms of the Board Representation Agreement, details of 
which are given in the Directors’ Report on page 146. 
2. Although the memberships of our Audit and Remuneration 
Committees were not fully compliant with Code Provisions 
C.3.1 and D.2.1 respectively immediately following IPO, the 
Remuneration Committee became fully compliant as soon  
as Henri Moissinac was appointed as its third independent 
member; and the Audit Committee became fully compliant 
when Fredric Coorevits stepped down from this following  
the transition period to its new Chairman. 
I look forward to reporting to you next year on how our 
governance arrangements continue to develop. This will include a 
report on the evaluation to be undertaken of the effectiveness of 
our Board in the first year since the Company’s IPO and on any 
actions we undertake in response to this. We view measurement 
of performance, targeting improvement and reporting results to 
be important for us as a Board as it is for our business.

Report of the Board and 
Nomination Committee
As part of its role, our Board provides both support and 
constructive challenge to management in the review of 
proposals, in the monitoring of performance and in the  
targeting of achievement of the Group’s aims, over the  
both the long and shorter terms.
Later in this Governance Report are specific reports from  
our Audit and Remuneration Committees. This report 
summarises the role and activities of our Board and its 
Nomination Committee. 
Membership of the Board
The Board currently has nine members:
• its Non-Executive Chairman, John Hughes, who was 
independent on appointment;
• two Executive Directors, David Buttress (Chief Executive 
Officer) and Mike Wroe (Chief Financial Officer); 
• three independent Non-Executive Directors, Gwyn Burr, 
Andrew Griffith and Henri Moissinac, each appointed shortly 
before or shortly after the Company’s IPO; and 
• three non-independent Non-Executive Directors, Frederic 
Coorevits, Ben Holmes and Michael Risman, each of whom 
have been nominated by a major shareholder and served 
since before the Company’s IPO.
Further details of our Directors are provided on pages 44 and 45. 
The diversity of our Directors provides the Board with a broad 
range of experience of both the Group’s business and of other 
businesses, including in the publicly listed environment. This 
enables high quality, diverse and relevant input into Board 
discussions, enriching debates and allowing carefully considered 
judgements to be reached, consensus arrived at, and decisions 
then taken. 
All Directors have a deep interest in helping the Group achieve 
its long-term objectives. They all devote sufficient time and 
attention to their Board duties and responsibilities. They take 
collective responsibility for the Board’s performance. A proper 
balance of influence is maintained without one person or 
separate group of people having undue powers of decision-
making. All the Non-Executive Directors bring strong and 
valuable judgement to bear on the Board’s deliberations and 
decision-making process.
The Board believes that its current structure and membership  
is appropriate for this stage in the Group’s development and 
represents a good balance of skills and experience necessary  
to manage the Company and its business in an effective and 
successful manner. 
Our Board provides leadership  
to the Group, sets and monitors 
implementation of its strategy and,  
with its standing Committees, oversees 
controls, risk management and senior 
remuneration in the Group. It aims  
to ensure that the Group has in place 
appropriate people, financial and  
other resources to enable value to be 
maximised for shareholders and other 
stakeholders over the long-term.   47 www.just-eat.com

Role of the Board
Key activities of our Board include the following: 
Agrees the Group’s strategic aims after considering 
recommendations from the Executive Directors.
The Board reviews matters of strategic importance at each of 
its main meetings. This is usually done in the context of a 
presentation on a specific matter of strategic interest by a 
member of senior management. In the past year, this has 
included consideration of improvements to the consumer 
experience, increasing the choice available to consumers and 
driving channel shift. It also includes review and, where 
considered appropriate, approval of acquisitions and other 
new business opportunities. As part of Board discussions of 
strategic proposals Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge matters when they feel appropriate as part of 
reaching an overall consensus. In addition, the Board reviews 
and seeks to identify risks at a strategic level.
Aims to ensure that the Group has the necessary 
financial strength and human resources in place  
to pursue the agreed strategy.
This includes regular reviews of the financial performance 
and requirements of the Group. It also includes regular 
updates from the CEO on plans for the ongoing development 
of the management team in the context of the growth of 
the Group. 
Reviews Group performance against the agreed  
strategy and considers any variations that may  
become appropriate to this strategy.
As well as financial performance, the Board reviews the 
operational development of the Group and its markets to 
ensure its strategy remains appropriate and to consider and 
decide upon any adjustments that may improve this.
Where appropriate, works with the operating 
management to assist in the achievement of  
the strategy.
As well as regularly reviewing presentations at Board 
meetings, Directors have open and constructive relationships 
with members of senior management who can draw on their 
wide business experience.
Sets the tone as well as overseeing implementation 
of the Group’s values and standards.
The Board leads the Group in a way that is intended to 
maximise business integrity and allow its people and other 
stakeholders to operate in a transparent and ethical way  
as an important part of ensuring the long-term success of 
the Group. 48 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Board and Committee meetings
The Board meets at regular intervals through the year both at 
scheduled meetings and other meetings as required. At these 
meetings, it reviews:
• Progress against previously agreed actions;
• Business Performance;
• Shareholder communications and feedback;
• The Group’s industry and M&A activity;
• Operational matters of particular note for the Board;
• Strategic considerations; and
• Reports of proceedings of Board Committees.
Further details of the meetings of the Board and of our Directors’ 
attendance at these are given in the adjoining table. Where a 
Director is unable to attend a particular meeting, full 
documentation for the meeting is issued to them, their views 
sought in advance and briefings are provided subsequent to the 
meeting as appropriate.
Members of management in addition to the Executive Directors 
may be invited to present relevant matters to the Board where 
considered appropriate. Executive Directors and members of 
management may also attend and present on relevant matters at 
Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chairmen.
Directors have the right to request that any concerns they may 
have are recorded in the appropriate Board or Committee 
minutes (although no such requests were made during the 
period). Minutes are circulated for comment by all Directors 
before being formally approved at the next relevant meeting.
Support to Directors
The Directors have free access to the Company’s management 
and advisors and to visit the Company’s operations. When new 
Directors are appointed, they receive a comprehensive induction 
facilitated by the Company Secretary. This induction includes 
meetings with key members of management together with 
briefings on the Group’s business, its industry and public 
company duties generally. Directors have access to ongoing 
training as required.
All Directors also have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary 
to each of the Board Committees reporting in these roles directly 
to their Chairmen, and advises through their Chairmen on 
compliance with Board and Committee procedures and applicable 
laws and regulations on governance matters. Directors are able 
to take external advice at the expense of the Company, should 
they feel this is necessary.

Division of Responsibilities
Whilst the Directors take collective responsibility for the management of the Group, the effective operation of the Board in 
conjunction with management benefits from a clarity of responsibilities. Key elements of this are set out below:
Matters reserved to the Board
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for its or its Committees’ decision 
which include:
• the Group’s strategy, which is reviewed by the Board and 
management when appropriate during the year; 
• the business plan and annual operating budget; 
• internal controls and risk management, which are reviewed 
regularly by the Audit Committee;
• major investments and capital projects, in which the Board 
monitors their subsequent performance;
• accounting policies, which are reviewed in detail by the 
Audit Committee;
• shareholder communications, such as announcements of 
results, this annual report and the accompanying notice of 
AGM to shareholders;
• the Board structure, composition and succession planning, 
which are handled in more detail by the Nomination 
Committee;
• Executive remuneration policy and the remuneration of the 
Chairman, which are handled by the Remuneration 
Committee; and
• the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
Subject to such reserved matters, and any other matters which 
the Board determines are appropriate for its specific decision as 
they arise, authority for the operation of the Group is delegated 
to Executive and other management within a system of defined 
authority limits. The matters reserved for the Board’s decision 
are reviewed periodically and updated as considered 
appropriate.
The Chairman, CEO and SID
Another important aspect of the division of responsibilities in 
any listed company is between the roles of Chairman and the 
CEO. In JUST EAT, these roles are separate and distinct with 
a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company 
established, agreed and set out in writing at the time of 
the IPO:
1. The Chairman is primarily responsible for managing the 
Board, facilitating the effective contribution of all Directors, 
and ensuring effective communication with shareholders, 
and that all Board members are aware of the views of 
major investors.
2. The CEO, together with the CFO, has been delegated 
appropriate responsibilities and authorities for the effective 
leadership of the senior management team in the day-to-day 
running of the business, for carrying out the agreed strategy 
and for implementing specific Board decisions relating to the 
Group’s operations.
In addition, Andrew Griffith, as Senior Independent Director, is 
available to fellow non-executive directors, either individually or 
collectively, should they wish to discuss matters of concern in 
an alternative forum.
Standing Board Committees
In addition, certain matters have been delegated to three 
principal Board Committees within clearly defined terms of 
reference which were approved at the time of the IPO. These 
remits, together with the composition of each Committee, will 
be reviewed periodically. The current terms of reference for the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees are available 
on the Company’s website at www.just-eat.com/investors. 
Summaries of the roles of each of these Committees are 
included later in this Corporate Governance Review.  50 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises John Hughes, its 
Chairman, who was considered independent on appointment, 
and our three independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience of the Directors. It also reviews  
the composition and structure of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board on retirements and appointments 
of additional and replacement Directors, including succession 
planning. The appointment of our current independent Non-
Executive Directors followed a formal, rigorous and transparent 
recruitment process with the assistance of The Zygos 
Partnership, a leading external recruitment firm with no other 
connection with the Company, after assessing the skills and 
character profile that would be required. This included 
candidates meeting ongoing Directors prior to their 
recommendation for appointment by the Board.
One of the key considerations on any appointment to the Board 
relates to diversity. Gender and international experience are  
two important aspects of diversity. In this context, the Board 
was particularly pleased to welcome its three new independent 
Directors since among them both genders and broad 
international experience are represented. The Board policy  
is to continue to seek diversity, including with regard to gender, 
as part of the overall selection of the best candidate for  
Non-Executive Director roles. Any appointments to Executive 
Director roles will also be made within the Group’s aims set out 
in our CSR Report on page 40. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, all our Directors 
will retire at each AGM and, if decided appropriate by the Board, 
may be proposed for reappointment. In reaching its decision the 
Board acts on the advice of the Nominations Committee. 
Following evaluation of the performance, the Chairman confirms 
that the performance of each of the Non-Executive Directors 
continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to 
their role. The Board considers that they each provide distinct 
and valuable input to the overall operation of the Board.
The Committee has already started discussions regarding the 
expected ongoing evolution of the Board and has considered 
matters in relation to the senior management team.
Performance reviews and Directors’ development
An evaluation of the performance of the Board, its individual 
Directors and its Committees, and of the Chairman, will be 
undertaken following the first full year after the Company’s IPO. 
This will be reported on further in next year’s Annual Report. 
Part of the evaluation of the Board will assess the training 
activities and needs of Directors. Directors receive regular 
briefings on matters in relation to the Group and more generally.
 
During the period the Chairman held both formal and informal 
discussions with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Shareholder relations 
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications 
with existing and potential shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives. A comprehensive investor relations 
programme underpins this commitment. The Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have regular 
dialogue with institutional shareholders in order to develop an 
understanding of their views which is communicated back to, and 
discussed with, the Board. 
Presentations given to analysts and investors covering the  
annual and interim results, along with all results and other 
regulatory announcements and further information for  
investors are included on the Company’s website at  
www.just-eat.com/investors. Additional Shareholder  
Information is also set out on pages 150 and 153.
Shareholders are able to contact the Company through the 
Company Secretary or Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Griffith, the Senior Independent Director, serves as  
an additional point of contact for shareholders should they  
feel that any concerns are not being addressed properly  
through the normal channels. He may be contacted through  
the Company Secretary.

Annual General Meetings
All shareholders are encouraged to attend, and have the 
opportunity to ask questions at, the Company’s Annual General 
Meetings and at any other times by contacting the Company. As 
well as the Chairman, CEO and CFO, the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees will be available at 
the Annual General Meeting to answer questions relating to the 
responsibilities of those Committees. All Directors will retire at 
every AGM and, where considered appropriate by the Board, be 
proposed for reappointment by shareholders. 
The Notice convening the 2015 AGM to be held on 13 May 2015 
will be issued along with this Annual Report at least 20 working 
days in advance of the meeting to provide shareholders with  
the appropriate time to consider matters. Separate resolutions 
will be proposed on each substantially separate matter. The 
results of the proxy votes on each resolution will be collated 
independently by the Company’s registrars and will be published 
on the Company’s website after the meeting.

Audit Committee
Membership
Our committee comprises three independent Directors, Gwyn 
Burr, Henri Moissinac and myself, Andrew Griffith. During the 
period from the Company’s IPO until October last year, Frederic 
Coorevits also served as a member of the Committee to assist 
with the transition to the new membership, having been its 
Chairman before the IPO. We are grateful to Fred for his valuable 
input during this period.
Role and activities
We met five times as a Committee after the IPO during the year, 
and three times subsequently since the year-end. We considered 
this frequency of meetings appropriate during JUST EAT’s first 
year as a public company although anticipate less frequent 
meetings in the coming year. Mike Wroe, our Chief Financial 
Officer, and senior representatives of the financial management 
team also attend our meetings as do representatives of the 
external auditors as appropriate. At our meetings in the past 
year, we received presentations on, and reviewed and considered 
the following matters:
• the remuneration and proposed reappointment of our  
external auditors;
• the framework for the engagement of the external auditors  
in non-audit services;
• the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the 
external auditors;
• the plans for and outcome of the preparation and review of 
the Group’s half year results and audit of the full year 
accounts including presentations from both management and 
the external auditors on these;
• the Group’s accounting policies, procedures and its financial 
control environment; 
• the Group’s system of internal controls, including financial, 
operational and risk management, supplementing at a more 
granular level the Board’s consideration of strategic risks;
• key internal policies including anti-bribery and related policies 
and whistleblowing arrangements which include an externally 
managed hotline; 
• the establishment of and reports from the internal audit 
function in the Group reporting directly to the Committee and

The Committee also meets privately with the external auditors at 
least once per year and did so prior to its recommendation to the 
Board on approval of the Annual Report.
Significant Issues
Prior to each meeting of the Audit Committee at which they are to be considered, management produces a paper providing  
details of any significant accounting, tax, HR and legal issues. Management are also invited to attend these meetings where 
further guidance is required. The significant issues considered by the Audit Committee in respect of the 2014 Annual Report  
are as follows. 
Significant issues the Committee has considered How the issue was addressed
Business combinations
There were a number of changes to the Group structure during 
the year, including a number of acquisitions and the merger of 
our Brazilian subsidiary with iFood. The total cash consideration 
paid during the year was £14.4 million, which resulted in an 
increase in the Group’s goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
balances. In the Income Statement a gain has been recognised 
in respect of the step acquisition of FBA Invest SaS. In addition, 
a gain was recognised on the disposal of JUST EAT Brazil 
Services Online Ltda following the merger with iFood. These  
two gains were based on business valuations performed by 
management. Provisions have been established in respect of  
the buy-out of the minority shareholders of FBA Invest SaS  
and Orogo Limited.
The valuations and accounting papers prepared by 
management were reviewed and considered by the Audit 
Committee, to confirm that the valuations and accounting 
treatments adopted are appropriate. This included:
1. considering the cash flows and discount rates used in the 
business valuations and the calculations minority buy-out 
provision calculations;
2. considering the key inputs used on the intangible assets 
valuations;
3. reviewing and considering the other fair value adjustments 
made by management to arrive at the fair values of the 
assets and liabilities acquired; and
4. reviewing the approach taken to identifying acquired 
intangible assets and challenging the balance of goodwill 
as compared with intangible assets.
The Committee was satisfied that management used a 
consistently applied model for identifying and valuing assets 
that are core to the existing business model. Independent 
valuation experts were consulted when required such  
as for the Meal2Go acquisition where additional insight  
was required.

Long-term employee incentive costs
Several share-based incentive schemes are in place for the 
Directors and employees of the Group. The total charge for 
long-term employee incentive costs in the year was £4.9 million. 
The charge relates to grants made prior to the Group’s listing on 
the London Stock Exchange. As a result the fair value of the 
options granted could not be based on the Company’s listed 
share price, but had to be based on other valuations available or 
determined by management. In addition, the plans are bespoke 
and are accounted for accordingly. 
The valuations of the Group prepared by management,  
that supported the fair values of the latest grants made  
in February 2014 were presented to the Audit Committee. 
The accounting for each of the various schemes was 
considered by the Audit Committee. Further details  
regarding the schemes are disclosed within note 37  
to the financial statements.
The main judgement area concerning share based payments 
was with regards to the valuation of the business. As this was 
concluded upon IPO, this is now less of a judgement area. 
Potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
At 31 December 2014, the Group had goodwill balances  
totalling of £51.2 million and other intangible assets totalling 
£12.7 million. 
Impairment reviews have been performed by management 
on the Group’s cash generating units (“CGUs”) to which 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated.  
The cash flow forecasts used were based on the budgets 
approved by the Board together with assumed growth  
rates, thereafter. The key assumptions around future  
growth rates and discount rates used were reviewed  
and considered by the Audit Committee. In addition, the 
Committee reviewed management’s sensitivity analyses 
regarding these assumptions. 
The Committee has been satisfied that there was no 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as at 
31 December 2014. Please refer to notes 16 to the financial 
statements for further information. 
Meeting the new reporting requirements of being a 
listed entity
In April 2014 JUST EAT listed on the London Stock exchange, 
bringing with it additional regulatory and reporting requirements. 
Being a listed entity brings with it additional reporting 
requirements and the Group’s 2014 Annual Report is the first 
prepared under such requirements.
Management have employed experienced individuals to 
ensure all reporting requirements are met. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the disclosures in the Annual 
Report, including those included for the first time, and 
discussed them with management and the Group’s auditors.   55 www.just-eat.com

Internal controls and risk management environment
The Board is ultimately responsible for the operation of an 
effective system of internal control and risk management 
appropriate to the business.
The Company has complied with the FRC’s revised Internal 
Control Guidance for Directors on the Code published in 2005 
(the Turnbull guidance) throughout the period and up to the date 
on which these financial statements were approved.
Day-to-day operating and financial responsibility rests with  
senior management and performance is closely monitored on  
a monthly basis.
Set out below is further comment on the areas of internal control 
and risk management.
Internal control environment
The following key elements comprise the internal control 
environment which has been designed to identify, evaluate and 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risks faced by the Group in 
seeking to achieve its business objectives and ensure accurate 
and timely reporting of financial data for the Company and 
the Group:
• an appropriate organisational structure with clear  
lines of responsibility;
• a comprehensive annual strategic and business  
planning process;
• systems of control procedures and delegated authorities 
which operate within defined guidelines, and approval limits 
for capital and operating expenditure and other key business 
transactions and decisions;
• a robust financial control, budgeting and rolling forecast 
system, which includes regular monitoring, variance analysis, 
key performance indicator reviews and risk and opportunity 
assessments at Board level;
• procedures by which the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements are prepared, which are monitored and 
maintained through the use of internal control frameworks 
addressing key financial reporting risks arising from changes 
in the business or accounting standards;
• an experienced and commercially focused legal function that 
supports the Group’s operational and technical functions;
• established policies and procedures setting out expected 
standards of integrity and ethical standards which reinforce 
the need for all employees to adhere to all legal and 
regulatory requirements; 
• an experienced and qualified finance function which regularly 
assesses the possible financial impact of the risks facing the 
Group; and
• an ongoing risk management programme, including  
a comprehensive disaster recovery and business  
interruption plan.
An Internal Audit function was established during the year to 
carry out regular reviews of the Group’s systems of internal 
control and risk management. The aim of the Internal Audit 
function is provide assurance that the system of internal controls 
is operated correctly in the Group.
How we manage risk
As shown on the following page, the Company has a robust  
risk management process that follows a sequence of risk 
identification, assessment of probability and impact, and assigns 
an owner to manage mitigation activities. A register is kept of all 
corporate risks and is monitored by senior management and 
reported to the Audit Committee.
Throughout the period of review, the risk register and the 
methodology applied is the subject of continuous review by 
senior management and updated to reflect new and developing 
areas which might impact business strategy.
The Audit Committee actively review the risk register and assess 
the actions being taken by senior management to monitor and 
mitigate the risks. Those risks which are considered to be the 
principal risks of the Group are presented on pages 36 to 39.  56 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Review of effectiveness
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed  
the effectiveness of the internal control systems and risk 
management processes in place during the period, taking 
account of any material developments since the financial period 
end. The Committee has not identified, nor been advised, of any 
failings or weaknesses that it has determined to be significant. 
Independence and performance of the auditors
The Audit Committee has set a policy which is intended to 
maintain the independence and integrity of the Company’s 
Auditors when acting as auditor of the Group’s accounts. The 
policy governs the provision of audit, audit-related assurance and 
non-audit services provided by the auditor and, in summary, 
requires approval by the Committee for all projects with an 
expected cost in excess of £50,000. 
During the year, the audit-related assurance services provided  
by the Auditors to the Group mainly comprised the review of the 
half-year results. Other services performed by the Auditors in 
2014 related mainly to their work as Reporting Accountants in 
connection with the Company’s IPO, and subsequent step-up  
to the Main Market from the High Growth Segment. They also 
included, tax compliance and tax advisory work. Primarily due to 
their role as Reporting Accountants for the IPO and Main Market 
step-up the non-audit fees have exceeded the audit fees in the 
2014 financial year. 
The fees paid for these other services during the year 
represented 239% of the fees paid for the statutory audit and 
audit-related assurance services together. However, excluding 
the fees in relation to their role as Reporting Accountants, this 
proportion was 54%. Further details of these amounts are 
included in note 10 of the accounts. The Company intends to 
comply with the new EU rules in relation to non-audit fees to the 
Auditors which are to come into force in 2016 (which excludes 
work carried out as Reporting Accountants).
The external Auditors are not permitted to provide internal 
auditor services to the Group. PwC have been selected as the 
co-sponsor for our Internal Audit work. Before any former 
employee of the external or internal audit team may be 
employed by the Group, careful consideration must be given as 
to whether the independence of the Auditors will be adversely 
affected, and approval of the Audit Committee is required. This 
particular circumstance has not arisen since the IPO.
Deloitte were appointed as the Group’s Auditors in 2009 and the 
most recent partner rotation took place in 2013. Whilst we do 
not consider it necessary to have a policy for the rotation of the 
external audit firm immediately following the Company’s IPO, we 
plan to keep this possibility under review in the coming years and 
will continue to comply with the audit tender rules applying to 
the Company. The Auditors are required regularly to report on 
and confirm their independence in their role.
The Audit Committee has assessed the performance and 
effectiveness of the 2014 external audit process in the past year 
primarily through dialogue with the senior members of the 
finance and company secretarial teams. A detailed follow-up will 
be scheduled upon completion of the audit process (including the 
individual subsidiary statutory accounts audit process) where 
additional feedback will be sought from senior managers around 
the business (not limited to the finance team) through the use of 
audit quality questionnaires. The initial results of the assessment 
were discussed with the Group finance team, before being 
presented to the Committee, to inform our recommendation to 
the Board for the annual re-appointment of the external auditors. 
We believe that the Group’s procedures as summarised above 
safeguard the objectivity and independence of the Auditors.

Report of the 
Remuneration Committee
2014 was a very significant year for 
JUST EAT, covering its IPO in April. 
During the first nine months of trading 
as a publicly listed company, the 
Company generated a circa. 19% total 
return to its shareholders (from the 
Placing Price to the closing price on 
31 December 2014) compared with 
a 0.2% return for the FTSE 250 as a 
whole. As set out more fully earlier 
in this Annual Report, our operating 
and financial performance remained 
strong and provides a good platform 
for future growth.
The year-on-year increase in all of our KPIs (as presented on 
page 26 and 27) demonstrate how successful this first year as a 
listed business has been for the Group. The 2014 Directors’ 
annual bonus scheme was based around two of these KPIs 
(revenue and Underlying EBITDA) as well as personal/strategic 
objectives. The weighting and achievement of these targets, 
along with the total bonus earned, is set out in further detail 
later in this report (see page 75). Looking forward over the 
longer term, in 2015 we plan to grant performance share awards 
that vest based on EPS and Total Shareholder Return based 
performance conditions over the next three years as summarised 
on pages 64 and 65. This aligns to our underlying commitment to 
deliver sustainable, above market, returns to our shareholders.
By reporting on a financial year during which the Company 
undertook its IPO, our Remuneration Report for this year 
inevitably shows a position of transition in terms of the payments 
made to Directors. However, recognising our new status as a 
listed company, we are also using the Remuneration Report to 
set out our future Directors’ Remuneration Policy which, if 
approved at our 2015 AGM, will apply to all payments made to 
our Directors for three years from that date.
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy
At the point of IPO the Company concluded that, as its pre-
existing long-term incentive arrangements did not fully vest on 
IPO (as was the position with the majority of other IPO’s in 
2014), it was unnecessary to distract the IPO process by focusing 
on senior executive remuneration. Instead, and as referred to in 
the Prospectus, the Company decided it was more appropriate 
for the newly appointed Remuneration Committee (consisting of 
the independent directors appointed at IPO) to undertake its own 
review of remuneration following the IPO with a view to putting 
in place a clear, robust, fair and not excessive policy to be 
applied for the future.
To achieve this, the Committee selected its own independent 
adviser, commissioned a review of both the underlying policy and 
the more detailed remuneration arrangements and consulted 
with the Company’s principal shareholders. The resulting policy is 
set out in the appropriate detail over the following pages, with 
the key points being:
• The overall remuneration policy is to set Executive Directors’ 
total pay by reference to (but by no means solely driven by) 
the median of data for companies with an equivalent market 
capitalisation (“market cap”).
• While the generally accepted main input into remuneration 
benchmarking is market cap, the Committee was conscious of 
the Company’s relatively high market cap to revenue ratio and 
felt that some level of discount was appropriate. Accordingly, 
for the three year life of this policy, it is currently envisaged   59 www.just-eat.com
Strategic
Report
Corporate 
Governance
Financial
Statements
that a discount should be applied to the indicative benchmark 
data of approximately 20%, which is in line with our advisers’ 
assessment of the typical level of discount in less mature 
businesses with a high market cap to revenue ratio. The 
Committee noted that not all such companies apply a discount 
and, particularly as the Company itself matures, it may not be 
appropriate to retain such a discount factor during the entire 
three year period or beyond.
• The current adjusted median salary levels for the CEO 
and CFO are considered to be £465,000 and £320,000 
respectively, which the Committee will move to in two 
tranches with effect from January 2015 and January 2016. 
The second tranche will be subject to adjustment – up or 
down – based on the circumstances prevailing at the time 
(e.g. the Company’s performance and size).
• While the Company’s benefits and pension arrangements are 
felt to be modest, with the latter currently capped at a 5% 
contribution, no change is proposed.
• Recognising the continued growth aspirations for the 
Company to deliver ongoing superior returns for all 
shareholders, the below market level of benefits and size- 
adjusted salaries should be offset with moderately above 
median bonus and LTIP opportunity with:
 – a bonus maximum for the CEO and CFO of 150% and 
120% of salary respectively, which will now be subject 
to newly introduced clawback provisions to reflect 
best practice;
 – an annual long-term incentive award under the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) (which was established at 
IPO) over shares worth 200% and 160% of salary 
respectively. The first awards at this level will only be 
granted in 2016, with the 2015 grants (the first post-IPO) 
set at half the policy level to further provide a smooth 
transition towards a market-reflective package. To reflect 
emerging best practice, we are also introducing a two-year 
post vesting holding period into the PSP, with clawback 
also applying; and
 – both plans subject to appropriately demanding 
performance hurdles linked to the future success  
of the Company.
• Overall, this produces a target package consistent with  
the adjusted benchmark median albeit with a bias to 
performance-related pay through a size-adjusted market 
salary, and below market benefits which are offset by a 
moderately higher performance-related pay opportunity.  
We are also increasing our share ownership guidelines  
for the Executive Directors to 400% of salary (from the  
current 200%).
Designing a pay structure, particularly for the first time following 
our IPO, involves various judgements. We believe that, on behalf 
of all shareholders, we have fulfilled our objectives of developing 
an appropriate, robust, performance-orientated and not 
excessive approach, by transitioning to a size-discounted market 
median positioning over two years.
Format of the Report and matters to be approved at 
our AGM
The regulations governing the directors’ remuneration reports of 
listed companies require that we split our report into two 
sections: the Policy Report sets out the Company’s forward-
looking Directors’ Remuneration Policy which provides the 
appropriate level of detail of the points explained in the 
preceding section. The separate Implementation Report provides 
details of the payments made to Directors in 2014, as well as 
other required disclosures.
At our 2015 AGM, we will be holding two votes on remuneration 
matters: 
• a vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out  
in the first part of this Report; and
• a vote on the remaining implementation sections of  
this Report.
I do hope we can rely upon your support at the AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in this section of the Remuneration Report will take effect for all payments made to 
Directors from the date of the AGM, which is expected to be held on 13 May 2015. The policy has been developed mindful of the new 
Corporate Governance Code and is felt to be appropriate to support the long-term success of the Company while ensuring that it does 
not promote inappropriate risk-taking.

Base salary
This is the core element of pay and reflects the individual’s role 
and position within the Group with some adjustment to reflect 
their capability and contribution.
Base salaries will be reviewed each year by the Committee. 
The Committee does not strictly follow data but uses the 
median position as a reference point in considering, in its 
judgement, the appropriate level of salary having regard to 
other relevant factors including corporate and individual 
performance and any changes in an individual’s role and 
responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
The Executive Directors’ salaries will not be 
increased so as to exceed the median for the 
equivalent roles in companies listed on the 
London Stock Exchange with a market 
capitalisation ranking which places them within 
30 above and 30 below that of the Company at 
or about the time when the Committee obtains 
such benchmark data. In practice, the Company 
envisages, for the three-year life of this policy, 
further discounting the data by 20% to reflect 
the Company’s high market cap to revenue ratio 
but reserves the right not to apply such discount 
should it consider that to be necessary to retain 
or recruit appropriate executives. 
Once a suitable market level is achieved,  
further increases would not normally be 
increased by more than the average awarded  
to staff generally.
N/A Base salaries from Admission were as 
follows: £300,000 for David Buttress, 
and £250,000 for Mike Wroe.
With effect from 1 January 2015, 
these were increased to £420,000 and 
£300,000 respectively.
Subject to reviewing the benchmark 
data in light of circumstances 
prevailing at the time, these will 
further increase with effect from 
1 January 2016 to £465,000 and 
£320,000 respectively which will 
broadly position them at the adjusted 
(i.e. discounted to reflect the 
Company’s relatively high ratio of 
market cap to revenue) median 
against listed companies of an 
equivalent size.
Benefits
1, 2
To provide benefits valued by recipients.
The Executive Directors are reimbursed for their commuting 
costs and associated tax liabilities (up to a value of £12,000). 
Additionally, they receive a car allowance or company car (in the 
case of the CEO), private medical cover and insurance benefits. 
The Committee reserves discretion to introduce new benefits 
where it concludes that it is appropriate to do so, having regard 
to the particular circumstances and to market practice. 
Where appropriate, the Company will meet certain costs 
relating to Executive Director relocations and (if necessary) 
expatriate benefits.
It is not possible to prescribe the likely change in 
the cost of insured benefits or the cost of some 
of the other reported benefits year-to-year, but 
the provision of benefits will operate within an 
annual limit of £100,000 (plus a further 100% of 
base salary in the case of relocations and 
expatriate benefits).
The Committee will monitor the costs of benefits 
in practice and will ensure that the overall costs 
do not increase by more than the Committee 
considers appropriate in all the circumstances.
N/A Details of the benefits received by 
Executive Directors are set out on 
page 75. 
There is no intention to introduce 
additional benefits in 2015.
1. Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or 
another) and business travel for Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors and the Chairman (and exceptionally their families) may technically come within the applicable rules and so 
the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
2. Deemed benefits from JSOP participation
Payments to any Director in respect of the deemed cost of interest on loans relating to participation in the JSOP and, if relevant, the writing off of any such loans are benefits within the 
scope of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The value of any such amounts is in addition to the maximum amounts stated in the table above for Benefits for Executive Directors and for 
Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ fees.   61 www.just-eat.com

Annual Bonus Plan
To motivate executives and incentivise delivery of performance 
over a one-year operating cycle, focusing on the short/
medium-term elements of our strategic aims.
Annual Bonus Plan levels and the appropriateness of measures 
are reviewed annually at the commencement of each financial 
year to ensure they continue to support our strategy.
Once set, performance measures and targets will generally 
remain unchanged for the year, except to reflect events such as 
corporate acquisitions or other major transactions where the 
Committee considers it to be necessary in its opinion to make 
appropriate adjustments.
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes are paid in cash following the 
determination of achievement against performance measures 
and targets.
The Committee will keep under review whether it is appropriate 
for bonuses to be partly deferred into shares. Where such 
arrangements are operated, individuals would be able to receive 
a dividend equivalent in cash or shares equal to the value of 
dividends which would have accrued during the vesting period.
Clawback provisions apply to the Annual Bonus Plan as 
explained in more detail in the notes to the policy table.
The maximum level of Annual Bonus Plan 
outcomes is 150% of base salary p.a. for the 
CEO and 120% for any other Executive Director 
for the duration of this policy.
The performance measures applied 
may be financial or non-financial and 
corporate, divisional or individual and 
in such proportions as the Committee 
considers appropriate.
Attaining the threshold level of 
performance for any measure will not 
produce a pay-out of more than 25% 
of the maximum portion of overall 
Annual Bonus attributable to that 
measure, with a sliding scale to full 
pay-out for maximum performance. 
However, the Annual Bonus Plan 
remains a discretionary arrangement 
and the Committee retains a standard 
power to apply its judgement to 
adjust the outcome of the Annual 
Bonus Plan for any performance 
measure (from zero to any cap) 
should it consider that to  
be appropriate.
The proposed performance measures 
and targets for the financial year to 
31 December 2015 will be based on a 
mix of Group financial measures 
(currently Revenue (40% weighting) 
and PBT (40% weighting)), as well as 
the achievement of personal/strategic 
objectives (20% weighting). The 
Committee selected these 
performance measures for the Annual 
Bonus Plan for 2015 as they represent 
a balanced approach to recognising 
success against defined objectives.
Given the competitive nature of the 
Company’s sector, the specific 
performance targets for the Annual 
Bonus Plan are considered to be 
commercially sensitive and 
accordingly are not disclosed. The 
Committee currently intends to

Long-Term incentives
3 
To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance 
over the long term, and to promote alignment with 
shareholders’ interests, the Group intends to operate the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). The Company also has the 
ability to grant market value options under an Employee Share 
Option Scheme (“ESOS”), although it is not currently intended 
that Executive Directors will receive awards under the ESOS. 
Awards under the PSP may be granted as nil-cost options, 
conditional awards and forfeitable shares which vest to the 
extent performance conditions are satisfied over a period of  
at least three years. 
Under the PSP plan rules, vested awards may also be settled  
in cash.
The PSP rules allow that the number of shares subject to vested 
PSP awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends 
that would have been paid in respect of any ex-dividend dates 
falling between the grant of awards and the expiry of any 
vesting and holding period for awards. 
Vested awards will be subject to a two-year holding period 
during which time awards may not be exercised or released but 
are no longer contingent on future employment.
Clawback provisions apply to PSP awards and are explained in 
more detail in the notes to the policy table.
The Company will honour the vesting of all awards granted 
under previous policies in accordance with the terms of such 
awards; in particular outstanding JSOP awards (and related 
loans) will continue on their terms.
The PSP allows for awards over shares with a 
maximum value as at the date of award of 200% 
of base salary per financial year, which may be 
increased to 300% in exceptional circumstances.
The ESOS allows for market value options  
over shares with a maximum value as at the  
date of award of 300% of base salary per 
financial year, which may be increased to  
400% in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee expressly reserves discretion to 
make such awards as it considers appropriate 
within these limits (although, as stated above, it 
is not currently intended that Executive Directors 
will receive awards under the ESOS).
The Committee may set such 
performance conditions on PSP 
awards as it considers appropriate 
(whether financial or non-financial 
and whether corporate, divisional  
or individual).
Once set, performance measures  
and targets will generally remain 
unaltered unless events occur which, 
in the Committee’s opinion, make it 
appropriate to alter the performance 
conditions in such manner as the 
Committee thinks fit.
Performance periods may be over 
such periods as the Committee 
selects at grant, which will not 
normally be less than (but may be 
longer than) three years.
No more than 20% of awards vest for 
attaining the threshold level of 
performance conditions.
Annual award levels are proposed at 
200% and 160% of base salary for 
the CEO and CFO respectively.
For 2015 only, the awards will be 
made at half this level. 
3. Performance conditions for PSP awards in 2015 (for information and not part of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy)
The performance measures and targets for the PSP awards to be made in 2015 will be based on adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance, summarised as follows:
2017 EPS (adjusted as set out below, 50% of award) % of that part of the award that vests 
10.5 pence or more 100%
Between 8.5 pence and 10.5 pence Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 20% and 100%

Long-Term incentives
3 
To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance 
over the long term, and to promote alignment with 
shareholders’ interests, the Group intends to operate the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). The Company also has the 
ability to grant market value options under an Employee Share 
Option Scheme (“ESOS”), although it is not currently intended 
that Executive Directors will receive awards under the ESOS. 
Awards under the PSP may be granted as nil-cost options, 
conditional awards and forfeitable shares which vest to the 
extent performance conditions are satisfied over a period of  
at least three years. 
Under the PSP plan rules, vested awards may also be settled  
in cash.
The PSP rules allow that the number of shares subject to vested 
PSP awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends 
that would have been paid in respect of any ex-dividend dates 
falling between the grant of awards and the expiry of any 
vesting and holding period for awards. 
Vested awards will be subject to a two-year holding period 
during which time awards may not be exercised or released but 
are no longer contingent on future employment.
Clawback provisions apply to PSP awards and are explained in 
more detail in the notes to the policy table.
The Company will honour the vesting of all awards granted 
under previous policies in accordance with the terms of such 
awards; in particular outstanding JSOP awards (and related 
loans) will continue on their terms.
The PSP allows for awards over shares with a 
maximum value as at the date of award of 200% 
of base salary per financial year, which may be 
increased to 300% in exceptional circumstances.
The ESOS allows for market value options  
over shares with a maximum value as at the  
date of award of 300% of base salary per 
financial year, which may be increased to  
400% in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee expressly reserves discretion to 
make such awards as it considers appropriate 
within these limits (although, as stated above, it 
is not currently intended that Executive Directors 
will receive awards under the ESOS).
The Committee may set such 
performance conditions on PSP 
awards as it considers appropriate 
(whether financial or non-financial 
and whether corporate, divisional  
or individual).
Once set, performance measures  
and targets will generally remain 
unaltered unless events occur which, 
in the Committee’s opinion, make it 
appropriate to alter the performance 
conditions in such manner as the 
Committee thinks fit.
Performance periods may be over 
such periods as the Committee 
selects at grant, which will not 
normally be less than (but may be 
longer than) three years.
No more than 20% of awards vest for 
attaining the threshold level of 
performance conditions.
Annual award levels are proposed at 
200% and 160% of base salary for 
the CEO and CFO respectively.
For 2015 only, the awards will be 
made at half this level. 
3. Performance conditions for PSP awards in 2015 (for information and not part of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy)
The performance measures and targets for the PSP awards to be made in 2015 will be based on adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance, summarised as follows:
2017 EPS (adjusted as set out below, 50% of award) % of that part of the award that vests 
10.5 pence or more 100%
Between 8.5 pence and 10.5 pence Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 20% and 100%
8.5 pence 20%
Less than 8.5 pence 0%
TSR (50% of award) relative to the constituents, as at the 1 January prior to 
grant, of the FTSE250 excluding investment trusts % of that part of the award that vests
Upper quintile or more 100%
Between median and upper quintile Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 20% and 100%
Median 20%
Below median 0%
Performance conditions will be measured over three financial years to 31 December 2017. The EPS condition looks at the EPS achieved in the final year only based on the reported fully 
diluted EPS (subject to such adjustments as the Committee considers appropriate) and TSR compares the TSR over the three months prior to the start of the financial year in which the 
grant is made with the three months prior to the end of the third financial year.
The Committee selected these performance conditions as they provide a suitable balance between absolute growth (through EPS) and relative out-performance (through TSR) which are 
key measures of success for the Company.  66 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

No benefits are envisaged for the Non-Executive Directors 
(including the Chairman) but the Company reserves the right to 
provide benefits (including travel and office support) within the 
prescribed limits.
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
The aggregate fees (and any 
benefits) of the Chairman and the

While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or 
another) and business travel for Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors and the Chairman (and exceptionally their families) may technically come within the applicable rules and so 
the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
2. Deemed benefits from JSOP participation
Payments to any Director in respect of the deemed cost of interest on loans relating to participation in the JSOP and, if relevant, the writing off of any such loans are benefits within the

Service contracts
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is that each Executive Director’s service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination by 
the Company on 12 months’ notice or 6 months’ notice by the individual. The service agreements of all Executive Directors comply 
with that policy. 
The service agreements reserve the right for the Company to make a payment in lieu of notice to an Executive Director for the 
amount of 1.2 and 1.1 times (for the CEO and CFO respectively) of base salary for the notice period if notice is served on or after 
1 January 2015. The small premium to base salary reflects the Company’s estimate of fixed benefits costs. Such sums may be paid in 
instalments and would cease or be reduced if the individual finds an alternative role. Contracts do not contain change of control 
provisions but do contain provisions allowing for summary termination. 
The Committee reserves flexibility, for an appropriate candidate in exceptional circumstances only, to introduce a longer initial notice 
period (of up to two years) reducing over time.
The date of each Executive Director’s contract is:
Contract date
David Buttress 8 April 2014
Mike Wroe 8 April 2014
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours and at the Company’s AGM including during the fifteen minutes preceding this.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Each Non-Executive Director and the Chairman is engaged for an initial period of two years, subject to annual renewal at the AGM. 
For Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, these engagements can be terminated by either party on three months’ notice.
The Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in new awards under the Company’s incentive plans from Admission, are not entitled 
to any pension benefits and are not entitled to any payment in compensation for early termination of their appointment beyond the 
three months’ notice referred to above.
For the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director the effective date of their latest letter of appointment is:
Name Date of Appointment Term
John Hughes CBE 15 December 2011 2 years
Benjamin Holmes 10 July 2009 2 years

Recruitment Remuneration Policy
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and 
promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims. 
However, as an external recruitment at director level has not yet taken place, the preparation of this policy is challenging as it 
provides for an event which has not been the Company’s practice.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new 
Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will 
be to apply the general policy for Executive Directors as set 
out above and structure a package in accordance with that 
policy. Consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations, the caps contained within the policy for fixed pay 
do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would 
not envisage exceeding these caps in practice.
The Annual Bonus Plan and long-term incentives will operate 
(including the maximum award levels) as detailed in the 
general policy in relation to any newly appointed Executive 
Director. Any recruitment-related long-term incentive awards 
which are not buy-outs will be subject to the limits as stated 
in the general policy (e.g. 300% in the PSP). Details of any 
recruitment-related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its 
original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment 
as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses 
as it considers appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make 
additional awards in connection with the recruitment to 
buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a 
previous employer. For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out 
awards are not subject to a formal cap. 
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in 
the view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases 
seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under 
the terms of the existing Annual Bonus Plan and long-term 
incentives. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to 
make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than 
the existing Annual Bonus Plan and long-term incentives. 
All buy-outs, whether under the Annual Bonus Plan, long-term 
incentives or otherwise, will take account of the service 
obligations and performance requirements for any 
remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a 
previous employer. The Committee will seek to make buy-outs 
subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements 
in respect of service and performance. However, the 
Committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain 
cases (such as where the service and/or performance 
requirements are materially completed, or where such factors 
are, in the view of the Committee, reflected in some other 
way, such as a significant discount to the face value of the 
awards forfeited) and where the Committee considers it to be 
in the interests of shareholders.
A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained above in respect of the main policy for such Directors. 72 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Termination Policy Summary
It is appropriate for the Committee to consider treatments on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts and 
circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination (see Service 
Contracts above) and any treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of 
the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP plans. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are summarised in the table below. 
Incentives
If a leaver is deemed to be a “good 
leaver”; for example, leaving through 
death or otherwise at the discretion 
of the Committee
If a leaver is deemed to be a “bad 
leaver”; for example, leaving for 
disciplinary reasons or to join a 
competitor
Other exceptional cases;  
e.g. change in control
Annual Bonus Plan Committee has discretion to 
determine Annual Bonus 
which will typically be limited 
to the period actually worked.
No awards made. Committee has discretion to 
determine Annual Bonus.
Performance Share Plan Will receive a pro-rated award 
subject to the application of 
the performance conditions at 
the end of the normal 
performance period.
Committee retains standard 
discretions to either vary time 
pro-rating or to accelerate 
vesting (and release any 
holding period) to the earlier 
date of cessation (determining 
the performance conditions at 
that time).
All awards will normally lapse. Will receive a pro-rated award 
subject to the application of 
the performance conditions at 
the date of the event, subject 
to standard Committee 
discretions to vary time 
pro-rating.
Under the Joint Share Ownership Plan, “good leavers” will retain the rights to any vested portions of their awards for a period and 
“bad leavers” will have their awards repurchased at cost.
SIP and Sharesave provides treatments for leavers in line with HMRC rules for such plans.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal 
claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an Executive Director, the Company may 
pay a contribution towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such 
fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an 
explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
External appointments
The Company’s policy is to permit an Executive Director to serve as a Non-Executive Director elsewhere when this does not conflict 
with the individual’s duties to the Company, and where an Executive Director takes such a role, they will be entitled to retain any fees 
which they earn from that appointment. No Executive Director currently holds such an appointment.  73 www.just-eat.com

The Committee receives regular updates on overall pay and 
conditions in the Group, including (but not limited to) changes in 
base pay and any staff bonus pools in operation. There is also 
oversight of the all-employee share schemes which Executive 
Directors and all other Group employees can participate in on the

The 2015 AGM is the first occasion on which the Company will 
seek the support of its shareholders for matters relating to the 
remuneration of Executive Directors. The Committee will ensure 
that it considers all of the feedback which it receives from its 
shareholders during this process.

Taxable benefits (audited)
Until the Joint Ownership Awards are sold, the Company makes annual payments to participants, the net amount of which will 
reimburse the participants for the annual income tax charge that arises on such proportion of the outstanding beneficial loan amount 
as is attributable to the remaining jointly-owned shares. The annual payment made to the Directors and the taxable benefit arising on 
the outstanding loan amount are included within the taxable benefits column in the single total figure table. The taxable benefit 
arising on the outstanding loan amounts is detailed below:

The Executive Directors are reimbursed for commuting costs and David Buttress receives a car allowance of £7,900 per annum.
The Executive Directors are non-contributory members of the Company’s private health scheme which provides cover for them and 
their immediate family currently defined as their spouse/partner and dependant children aged under 21. 
Although not a taxable benefit, the Executive Directors participate in the Company’s life assurance scheme which pays their 
dependants a sum equal to four times salary if they die during their term of employment by the Company.

within the long-term incentive column in the year in which performance conditions are measured. 
Awards granted under long-term incentive plans with no performance conditions other than continued employment are included in the

Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)
Joint ownership awards have been made under the JSOP consisting of a joint interest in the shares subject to certain terms 
and conditions. The Ordinary Shares subject to Joint Ownership Awards are already in issue and are held by an Employee Benefit 
Trust (“EBT”).
Under the terms, the participant’s interest in the jointly-owned shares entitles the participants to share in the proceeds of sale of  
the jointly-owned shares up to the aggregate of the participant’s subscription amount and the value in excess of a set hurdle. Each 
participant was required to pay a subscription amount for the jointly-owned shares equal to the market value of the participant’s 
interest as determined by HMRC. In accordance with the terms of the JSOP, such amount was left outstanding as a liability to  
the Company. 
As a preparatory step to Admission, the Company called all outstanding subscriptions amounts on the jointly-owned shares to be  
paid up in full. In order to facilitate this, the Company has made a loan to the Chairman, Executive Directors and other participants, 
the amount of which was equal to their outstanding subscription. The loans become due for repayment at the latest by the date on 
which the jointly owned shares are disposed of and termination of continued employment. When the shares vest, if the value of the 
participants interest is less than the outstanding beneficial loan amount, the balance remaining on the loan once the participants 
interest has been deducted is no longer payable. As detailed in the taxable benefits section on page 75, the Company makes annual 
payments to reimburse participants for the income tax charge that arises on the outstanding beneficial loan amount each year. 
The Joint ownership awards vest over time, with 25% on the specified date established on grant and then equally on a quarterly or 
monthly basis until becoming fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the vest start date. Once vested, the participant can require 
the shares subject to the Joint ownership award to be sold and the net amount they will receive will equal the proportion of the sale 
proceeds that exceed the hurdle amount for their shareholding.

Performance graph and CEO remuneration table (unaudited)
The following graph shows the TSR performance of an investment of £100 in JUST EAT plc’s shares from its listing in April 2014 to the 
end of the period, compared with a £100 investment in the FTSE 250 Index over the same period. The FTSE 250 Index was chosen as 
a comparator because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent. The TSR was calculated by 
reference to the movements in share price. The Company has not paid a dividend since April 2014 and therefore the Company’s TSR 
does not include a dividend amount.

The following Non-Executive Directors were members of the Remuneration Committee during the year:
• Gwyn Burr, Chairman;
• Andrew Griffith; and
• Henri Moissinac.
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (“FIT”) were selected by the Committee last year as their remuneration advisers, after a tender 
and presentation process involving four leading firms. FIT exclusively advise the Committee and do not provide any other advice to 
the Group nor do they advise management. This has, the Committee believes, ensured their objectivity and independence. FIT are 
members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and comply with its voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK.
 
FIT have provided advice on the benchmarking and structuring of executive and senior management remuneration together with 
assistance in the Committee’s consultations with shareholders and the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy and Report. Fees 
payable to FIT in respect of their work for the year totalled £48,500.

Auditor’s Report
Opinion on financial statements of JUST EAT plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year  
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, the Company Reconciliation of Movements 
in Shareholders’ Funds, and the related notes 1 to 48. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the 
IASB
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, in 
addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards  
Board (“IASB”).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement on page 146 that the Group is a going concern. We 
confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 82 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Business combinations
As noted in the Report of the Audit Committee on page 53, 
there have been several changes in ownership of Group entities 
and acquisitions during the year. As detailed in notes 33 and  
34, the total cash consideration for the acquisitions paid  
during the year was £14.4 million and a total of £10.9 million  
of intangible assets and £43.1 million of goodwill has been 
recognised on acquisition. A gain of £32.0 million has been 
recognised on the deemed disposal of FBA Invest SaS (“FBA”) 
and a gain of £5.8 million has been recognised on the partial 
disposal of Just Eat Brazil Services Online Ltda. Provisions 
totalling £9.1 million have been recorded in respect of the 
buy-out of minority shareholders.
The accounting for these transactions is complex due to the 
judgements taken in the application of accounting standards, 
for example in the valuation of the businesses, options  
and forward contracts; the recognition and valuation of 
consideration; and the identification and valuation of intangible 
assets. The associated judgements and estimates are described 
further in notes 4e and 4f to the financial statements and in the 
Report of the Audit Committee report on page 53.
We have performed the following procedures on the key 
judgement areas:
• considared management’s assessment of the nature of the 
combination, when control passed and the level of control 
existing and compared that assessment with the provisions 
within IFRS 3 ’Business Combinations’;
• examined signed sales and purchase agreements and 
associated contractual agreements to understand the terms 
and conditions of the transactions including the 
appropriateness of the fair value of consideration determined 
by management; 
• assessed the valuation models prepared by management to 
value the FBA Invest SAS and IF-JE Participações Ltda 
businesses, the FBA option arrangements, and the intangible 
assets identified in the acquired businesses, using our 
specialists within the audit team to challenge the 
assumptions and methodology used by management; 
• examined the inputs within the valuation models, including 
the future growth patterns to the historical trends achieved 
in more developed markets; and
• assessed whether the disclosures presented in note 33 and 
34 to the financial statements are in line with the 
requirements of IFRS 3.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group holds goodwill of £51.2 million and intangible assets 
of £12.7 million on its Balance Sheet at 31 December 2014. 
As described in the Report of the Audit Committee report on 
page 54, and note 4e to the consolidated financial statements, 
the impairment review process to test the recoverability of 
goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisitions involves 
the application of judgements and estimates by management.
There are particular risks regarding the judgements to 
determine the recoverable amount, including the growth rates 
underlying projected future cash flows, the discount rates 
applied to those forecasts and the scenarios applied to test the 
sensitivity of the calculations to reasonably possible changes in 
key assumptions.
We tested the assumptions used by management within their 
annual impairment assessment to support the recoverability  
of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Our 
work included: 
• considering the projected future cash flow growth patterns 
to the historical trends achieved in more developed markets 
and comparing long-term growth rates to market data;
• engaging valuation specialists within the audit team to 
provide additional challenge regarding the calculations of  
the discount rate applied to these cash flows; and
• assessing the appropriateness of the sensitivities applied  
by management including considering whether the  
scenarios represented reasonably possible changes  
in key assumptions.
We also considered whether that disclosures on the impairment 
test performed by management in the financial statements are 
in line with those prescribed in accounting standards.  83 www.just-eat.com

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Share-based payments
The Group provides share based incentive plans for Directors 
and employees. During the year, there were certain new grants, 
schemes and arrangements made. As detailed in note 37 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, the total charge to the profit 
and loss account for the year relating to share-based payments 
was £4.4 million.
The selection and application of accounting policies in 
accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” (as explained 
in note 4b to the financial statements) is complex due to the 
bespoke nature of the arrangements in place. Further they 
require significant judgement regarding the assumptions which 
are applied in calculating the fair value of the options, 
particularly the value of shares at grant date as explained in the 
Report of the Audit Committee on page 54.
To assess the appropriateness of the application of accounting 
standards and the assumptions and judgements made by 
management we performed the following procedures:
• examined the documents setting out the scheme rules and 
terms of the schemes to determine the appropriateness of 
accounting policies made by management;
• assessed the inputs included in the fair value calculations, 
using valuation specialists within the audit team to consider 
the reasonableness of assumptions made and the 
methodology followed; 
• performed recalculations and sample-testing the source 
documentation to check the accuracy of the calculations 
provided; and
• considered the disclosures in the financial statements 
regarding the schemes, including the related disclosures in 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee and the related 
parties disclosure in note 39 to the financial statements.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed 
on pages 53 and 54.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to 
any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 84 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £1.0 million,  
which is below 5% of pre-tax profit adjusted for IPO costs and 
the gains on business combinations due to their one-off nature  
in the current year. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to  
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £20,000, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. Based on this assessment we focused on the Group’s UK 
and Danish operations, which were subject to a full audit for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. They were also selected to 
provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to 
address the risks of material misstatement identified above.  
The remaining entities were subject to a limited scope audit of 
specific account transactions and account balances, where the 
extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s 
operations at those locations. Our audit work was executed at 
levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which 
were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £433,000  
to £850,000. At the parent entity level we performed audit 
procedures on material transactions and consolidation 
adjustments. 
As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved 
full scope coverage of £127.2 million out of £157.0 million of the 
Group’s revenue, £145.1 million out of £183.8 million of the 
Group’s net assets and £67.2 million out of £57.4 million of the 
Group’s profit before tax (which excludes £9.8 million losses in 
limited scope entities).
In the current year the Group audit team visited the operations 
in Denmark, due to its financial significance to the Group, and 
met with the local management team in France, as a result of 
the increase in ownership in the year.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting 
records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report  
if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the  
part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from  
our review.  85 www.just-eat.com

Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in  
the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have 
not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

For the year ended 31 December 2014
1. General information
JUST EAT plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate an online and mobile market place for takeaway food. 
Further details about the Group’s operations and principal activities are disclosed within the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41.  
The Company is a public limited company listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The registered address is Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road,  
London W14 0QH.
2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to 
all years presented.
Going concern
For reasons noted on page 146, the financial statements has been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the 
Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of signing these financial statements. At the date of approving the financial statements, the Directors are not aware of 
any circumstances that could lead to the Group being unable to settle commitments as they fall due during the 12 months from date 
of signing these financial statements.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had net current assets of £111.2 million, cash net of borrowings of £164.1 million and generated  
cash inflows from operating activities of £38.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2014. The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41. 
Note 38 describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted
No new standards or amendments to standards had any impact on the Group’s financial position or performance nor the disclosures in 
these financial statements. 
Early adoption
The following new standards and amendments to existing standards are in issue, but have not been adopted by the Group as they are 
either subject to EU endorsement or are not yet effective:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2017)
• Annual Improvements 2010-2012 (effective 1 July 2014)
• Annual Improvements 2011-2013 (effective 1 July 2014)
• Annual Improvements 2012-2014 (effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendments to IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2016) 
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 
(effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (effective 1 January 2016)
With the exception of IFRS 15, the Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. IFRS 15 may have an impact on the Group’s revenue recognition polices 
and disclosures, however, until management’s detailed review has been completed it is not practicable to provide details of the impact 
that its adoption will have on the Group’s financial statements.  92 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2014
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by 
the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group 
has i) power over an investee; ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and iii) the ability to 
use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. 
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including i) the contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee; ii) rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and iii) the Group’s voting rights and potential 
voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interests of non-controlling 
shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The 
carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests 
in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it de-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests and the cumulative 
translation differences recorded in equity. It further recognises the fair values of the consideration received and any investment 
retained, with any surplus or deficit being recognised in profit or loss. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit 
or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were 
disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair 
value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when 
applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
b) Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3 (2008) Business Combinations 
(“IFRS 3”). The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred and 
included within exceptional items.  93 www.just-eat.com

Report

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
When the consideration for the acquisition includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the 
contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred in the 
business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are 
adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that 
arise from additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) 
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period 
adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as an asset or liabilities re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are re-measured to 
fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit  
or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for certain items which are measured in accordance with the relevant 
IFRSs. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are 
adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of 
that date.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. The 
Group’s policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is described on the following page.
c) Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when 
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control 
over subsidiaries. 94 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and jointly controlled entities are incorporated in these financial statements using 
the equity method of accounting, except for when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. 
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition 
date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised 
nor individually tested for impairment.
The consolidated income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Any 
change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the 
statement of changes in equity. 
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the 
interest in the associate or joint venture. 
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value in 
accordance with IAS 39. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant 
influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.
In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on 
the same basis as would be required in the that associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
The aggregate amounts of current and long-term assets and liabilities, income and expenses are disclosed in notes 19 and 20. Where 
applicable, the aggregate amount of capital commitments and contingent liabilities are also disclosed.
d) Fair value measurement
The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial 
statements approximate their fair values. The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in note 38.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable; and
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
The Group presents the valuation results to the Audit Committee and the Group’s independent auditors. This includes a discussion of 
the major assumptions used in the valuations.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.  95 www.just-eat.com

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
e) Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each group company are expressed in Pound Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation 
currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences on monetary 
items receivable or payable to a foreign operations which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future 
(therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income 
and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the 
date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity 
(attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). 
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign 
operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange 
differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
f) Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived from commission, payment card and administration fees, connection fees, top-placement fees, and other revenue.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Commission
Commission revenue, earned from restaurants, is earned and recognised at the point of order fulfilment to the restaurant’s consumers. 
Payment card and administration fees 
Revenue from payment card and administration fees is recognised when the service is completed, in line with the revenue recognised 
on commissions. This is the point at which an order is successfully processed and the Group has no remaining transactional obligations.
Connection fees
Our restaurant partners pay a one-off fee to join the JUST EAT network, which is comprised of a JCT equipment fee and a JCT 
connection fee. JCT’s are order confirmation terminals situated at restaurant sites for the purposes of communicating between end 
user consumers and restaurants via the central JUST EAT ordering infrastructure. 
JCT equipment fees are deferred to the balance sheet and recognised on a straight line basis over 36 months. This is considered to be 
an appropriate time period as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the JCT. 96 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

For the year ended 31 December 2014
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
The JCT connection fee revenue is payable on connection but deferred and recognised on a straight line basis over 12 months. 
In addition, our Danish and French based restaurant partners pay an annual subscription fee. Revenue in respect of subscription fees 
is recognised on a straight line basis over the annual subscription period.
Top-placement fees
Revenue from top-placement fees is recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Other revenue
Other revenue principally relates to the sale of branded merchandise to our restaurant partners. Merchandise revenue is recognised 
when the goods are delivered and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the restaurant. 
g) Operating profit or loss
Operating profit or loss is stated after charging for long-term employee incentive provisions, exceptional items and foreign exchange 
gains and losses but before other gains and losses, finance income and finance costs.
h) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are costs or credits that, by virtue of their nature and incidence, have been disclosed separately in order to improve 
a reader’s understanding of the financial statements. 
i) Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses are comprised of profits or losses arising on the disposal or deemed disposal of operations and gains and 
losses on financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss. They have been disclosed separately in order to improve a 
reader’s understanding of the financial statements. 
j) Leasing
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The Group did not have any finance leases in either 2014 or 2013.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except 
where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are 
consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The 
aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
k) Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
l) Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred 
tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using 
tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.  97 www.just-eat.com
Strategic
Report
Corporate
Governance
Financial
Statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will 
be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
m) Intangible assets other than goodwill
The Group has four classes of intangible asset: patents, licences and intellectual property (“IP”), restaurant contracts, brands and 
development costs. 
Patents, licences and IP
Patents, licences and IP are included at cost and amortised in equal annual instalments over their useful economic life, which is 
typically three to five years depending on the period over which benefits are expected to be realised from the asset. Provision is made 
for any impairment.
Restaurant contracts
A restaurant contract intangible asset is recorded as part of a business combination or when an associate is acquired or joint venture 
established. They are initially recorded at fair value and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset on a straight line basis. 
This period of time is the period over which the acquired restaurant contracts are reasonably expected to confer economic benefits to 
the Group, which is usually between three and ten years. The fair values of restaurant contracts are determined with reference to the 
present value of their after tax cash flows projected over their remaining useful lives. The cash flows and discount rates used in the 
valuations are risk-adjusted to the extent deemed necessary by management to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties 
associated with the asset. 
Brands
A brand intangible asset is recorded as part of a business combination or when an associate is acquired or joint venture established. 
They are initially recorded at fair value and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset on a straight line basis, which is 
usually between three and ten years. This period of time is the period over which the acquired brand is reasonably expected to confer 
economic benefits to the Group. The fair values of brand assets are established using the relief from royalty valuation method. The 
cash flows and discount rates used in the relief from royalty model are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary by management 
to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset. 
Research and development
Where an application or product is technically feasible, production and sale are intended, a market exists, expenditure can be 
measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and amortised  
on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product. Where these conditions are not met research and 
development expenditure is expensed as incurred. To date, a large proportion of the research and development undertaken by the 
Group has been in the initial development phase before technical feasibility has been established. As a result the majority of the 
Group’s research and development expenditure has been expensed. 98 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

n) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all 
property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line 
basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 33% per annum 
Equipment  33% per annum 
Leasehold improvements 20% per annum or the period of the lease if shorter
o) Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
Under IFRS, the Group is required to review for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. On these occasions, the Group 
reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life 
is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
p) Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset 
(or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should 
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary 
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling 
interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.
q) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials. Cost is calculated using the 
first-in first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to 
be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
r) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, 
which are initially measured at fair value.   99 www.just-eat.com
Strategic

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets “at fair value through profit or loss” (“FVTPL”), 
“held-to-maturity” investments, “available-for-sale” (“AFS”) financial assets and “loans and receivables”. The classification depends on 
the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. The Group historically has held AFS 
financial assets, “loans and receivables” and FVTPL financial assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets
UK investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but that are classified as AFS financial assets are stated at 
fair value (because the Directors considered that fair value could be reliably measured). Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value were recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the AFS reserve with the exception of impairment losses, 
interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are 
recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in the AFS reserve was reclassified to profit or loss. As at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group did not have 
any investments in unlisted shares which were classified as AFS financial assets.
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the 
spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in profit or loss are determined based 
on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as “loans and receivables”. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. The 
net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the 
“other gains and losses” line item in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 38.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition 
of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. Evidence of impairment may include 
indications that a receivable or a group of receivables is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payment, 
the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a 
measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the differences between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
De-recognition of financial assets
The Group de-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial 
asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received 
and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is 
recognised in profit or loss. 100 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities “at FVTPL” or “other financial liabilities”. The Group currently does not hold 
any financial liabilities “at FVTPL”.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective 
yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Group de-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
As at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group had one contract with an embedded derivative (see note 38).
s) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The unwinding of any discount is 
recognised in the income statement within finance expense.
t) Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the 
determination of the fair values of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in note 37.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve.
For cash-settled share-based payments a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value 
of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is 
re-measured, with any changes in the fair value recognised in profit of loss for the year.
u) Dividends
Dividends are recognised on the Company’s ordinary shares when they have been appropriately authorised.   101 www.just-eat.com

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates which are dealt with separately below, are those which management have 
made in applying the Group’s accounting policies and have the most significant effect on the financial statements are discussed below. 
a) Revenue recognition
Revenue derived from connection fees includes JCT connection fees and JCT equipment fees. JCT equipment fee revenue is deferred 
to the balance sheet and recognised on a straight line basis over 36 months. This is considered to be an appropriate time period as 
the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the JCT. Judgement is applied in determining the period over which the 
JCT equipment fee revenue is recognised.
The JCT connection fee revenue is payable on connection but deferred and recognised on a straight line basis over 12 months. 12 
months is considered to be the required period of service. Judgement is applied in determining the period over which the connection 
fee is earned.
b) Share-based payments
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at 
the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share based payment transactions requires determination of the most 
appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. Judgements are applied in relation to 
estimations of the number of options that will vest and of the fair value of the options granted to employees. Estimates of fair value 
are made using a widely recognised share option value model and are referred to third party experts where necessary. Judgement is 
applied in determining the assumptions input into the share option value model. See note 37 for details of the key assumptions used.
c) Deferred taxation
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will 
be available in the future against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. To determine the future taxable 
profits, reference is made to the latest available profit forecasts. Where the temporary differences are related to losses, relevant tax 
law is considered to determine the availability of the losses to offset against the future taxable profits. Recognition of deferred tax 
assets therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the 
deferred tax asset has been recognised. Details of the recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are included in note 21.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Discussed below are the key assumptions regarding the future, and other key sources of estimated uncertainty at the balance sheet 
date which may have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year. 
d) Acquired intangible assets
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. The identification of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations requires judgement. For each 
business combination the balance of goodwill to other intangible assets is reviewed for appropriateness. The intangible assets 
recognised as part of the 2014 business combinations are set out in notes 33 and 34.
Acquired intangible assets, comprising brands, restaurant contracts, and intellectual property are amortised through the consolidated 
income statement on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of between three and ten years. Significant judgement is 
required in determining the fair value and economic lives of acquired intangible assets.  102 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued) 
e) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group’s balance sheet includes significant goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. 
Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which the asset has been 
allocated. The value-in-use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the 
next three years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments 
that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used as 
well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for the period beyond the three budgets. The key assumptions 
used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained 
in note 16.
f) Fair value measurement and valuation process
In accounting for some of the Group’s merger and acquisition transactions, and options to acquire equity shares, businesses and 
options are measured at fair value. During the year ended 31 December 2014, the fair values of FBA Invest SaS (see note 33) and 
IF-JE Participações Ltda (see note 34) were determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the businesses. Forecasting 
the future cash flows and determining the appropriate discount rates to use required judgement and estimation. 
Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, particularly intangible assets acquired through acquisition.  
In estimating fair value, the Group uses market observable data where available. Where market observable data is not available 
recognised valuation methodologies are used. Third party valuers are used when the Group doesn’t have the necessary  
in-house skills.
5. Operating segments
The Group has three reportable segments: United Kingdom, Denmark (core business), and Other. The non-core element of Denmark 
has been included in the “Other” segment in the following table. Each segment includes businesses with similar operating 
characteristics. Underlying EBITDA is the main measure of profit used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to assess and 
manage performance. The CODM is David Buttress, the Group’s Chief Executive Officer. Underlying EBITDA is defined as earnings 
before finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) and additionally excludes the Group’s share of 
depreciation and amortisation of joint ventures and associates, long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and “other gains and losses”. At a segmental level, Underlying EBITDA also excludes intra-group franchise 
fee arrangements and incorporates an allocation of Group technology and central costs (both of which net out on a consolidated level).

UK corporation tax was calculated at 21.5% (2013: 23.25%) of the taxable profit for the year. As announced in the March 2013 
Budget, the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014. Accordingly, the 
effective rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 21.5%. 
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Taxation on items taken directly to other comprehensive income was a credit of £2.3 million and relates to tax arising on  
share-based payments.

14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested shares held pursuant to the Group’s JSOP  
and SIP.
Prior to the 8 April 2014, holders of the B Ordinary Shares had rights to share in profits which differed to those of the holders of 
Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares. Earnings per share figures have therefore been 
presented separately for the B Ordinary shares, up until 8 April 2014. The B Ordinary Shares, Preference A shares, Preference B 
shares and Preference C shares were reclassified as Ordinary Shares on 8 April 2014.   109 www.just-eat.com

14. Earnings per share (continued)
The B Ordinary shareholders were only entitled to dividends after aggregate distributions of £18.25 million had been made to the 
holders of Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares. Prior to 8 April 2014, aggregate 
distributions of this amount had not been made. As a result no earnings are attributable to the Ordinary B Shares in the earnings per 
share (“EPS”) calculations.
Diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of 
all potentially dilutive shares. The Group had potentially dilutive shares in the form of share options, warrants and unvested shares 
held pursuant to the Group’s JSOP and SIP.
Adjusted earnings per share is the main measure of earnings per share used by the Group and is calculated using underlying profit 
attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares in the parent, which is defined as profit attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares  
in the parent, before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, “other gains” (being profits or losses on the disposal  
and deemed disposal of operations, and fair value gains and losses), foreign exchange gains and losses and the tax impact of the 
adjusting items. Additionally, adjusted EPS now excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets and its tax impact, as the 
Directors believe it’s a more appropriate measure of the underlying performance of the Group. This change in the definition of 
adjusted EPS did not change the reported adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013, of 1.4p.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use 
calculations are the discount rate and the Underlying EBITDA growth rate (which is a function of expected changes in selling prices 
and costs, together with other factors). Management uses pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the particular CGU. The Underlying EBITDA growth rates are based on past experience and 
management’s future expectations. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on recent results and expectations of future 
changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board. Management expects 
that some markets will enjoy a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the current budgetary cycle to maturity 
(the medium-term). During this period each CGU will continue to acquire new consumers and increase order activity above and 
beyond the long-term growth rate applicable to each market. Management expects that all CGUs will reach maturity after a period in 
excess of five years and therefore considers it appropriate for the forecasts to extend beyond a five year period. A suitable medium-
term growth rate, based on previous experience of growth rates has been applied individually to reflect each CGU’s activity in this 
period. After this a long-term growth rate is applied. This is typically seven years from the start of the budget/forecast period.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were in the range of 10.6% to 18.4% for all geographies (2013: 9.0% to 22.7%). 
The long-term growth rates used in the forecast cash flows were in the range of 1.6% to 2.2% (2013: 1.4% to 2.1%).
Year ended 31 December 2014
For all CGUs, the value-in-use was in excess of the carrying value of the CGU. As a result no impairment was required.
Year ended 31 December 2013
An impairment charge of £0.3 million was charged to the income statement in respect of the Brazilian CGU.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for each CGU. This included reducing the future cash flows and 
increasing discount rates. For all CGUs, no reasonably expected change in the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations 
would give rise to an impairment charge.  112 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Trade receivables
Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. The average 
age of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2014 was 72 days (2013: 67 days). As at 31 December 2014, 42% (2013: 43%) of the 
trade receivables were less than 30 days old, 15% (2013: 14%) were between 30 and 60 days old, 8% (2013: 7%) were between 60 
and 90 days old and 35% (2013: 36%) were over 90 days old.
The Group has reviewed all balances and has made an allowance for debts which are considered unlikely to be collectable based on 
past default experience, and an analysis of the counterparty’s current financial position. Allowances against doubtful debts are 
recognised against trade receivables.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not 
recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. 
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the consumer base 
being large and unrelated. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, after taking into account 
the allowance for doubtful debts, is approximately equal to their fair value. At 31 December 2014 £0.7 million (2013: £0.3 million) of 
the allowance for doubtful debts was in respect of receivables more than 120 days old.  118 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. Included in the trade 
creditors balance are amounts owed to restaurants (2014: £27.7 million; 2013: £16.2 million). These amounts are typically settled on a 
fortnightly basis. The average credit period taken for restaurants is 8 days (2013: 7 days). For most suppliers no interest is charged on 
the trade payables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. 
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms. The 
Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

28. Share capital (continued)
On 8 April 2014 the Company’s Ordinary Shares were admitted to the High Growth Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange (the “Listing”). In conjunction, the Company made an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 38.5 million new one pence Ordinary 
Shares at a price of 260 pence per share. Also on this date, immediately prior to the Listing, 29.8 million B Ordinary shares, 134.3 
million Preference A shares, 48.8 million Preference B shares and 67.6 million Preference C shares converted to Ordinary Shares. 
Costs that related directly to the issue of new shares have been deducted from the share premium account. IPO costs that related to 
both the Listing and issue of new shares have been allocated between the share premium account and the income statement in 
proportion to the number of primary and secondary shares traded on admission. As a result, during the year ended 31 December 
2014, IPO costs totalling £4.5 million have been charged to the share premium account and IPO costs of £2.3 million were charged to 
the income statement. IPO costs of £1.4 million were charged to the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2013.
On 6 May 2014 the Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Financial 
Conduct Authority. This change had no effect on the issued share capital of the Company.
As at 31 December 2013, 45,500 Ordinary Shares and 222,700 B Ordinary shares had been issued to Appleby Trust (Jersey Trust) 
Limited under the Group’s Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) arrangement. As at 31 December 2013, these shares were partly paid. 
This was in line with standard practice for such JSOP arrangements. These shares were fully paid up prior to the IPO, and all shares 
are now fully paid.

Translation reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets, income and expenses of the Group’s foreign operations, from their 
functional currency into the parent’s reporting currency, being Pound Sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. 
Merger reserve
In July 2009 a group reconstruction was undertaken. Under this reconstruction Ordinary Shares were issued and cancelled and 
Preference A shares were issued. This was treated as a common control transaction under IFRS as the ultimate shareholders and their 
relative rights were the same before and afterwards. This reserve represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares 
issued and the nominal value of the shares on the group reorganisation in July 2009. The balance of this account has not changed and 
remains at £1.9 million as at 31 December 2014.
Treasury shares reserve
This reserve arose when the Group issued equity share capital under its JSOP and SIP, which are held in trust by the trustee of the 
Group’s employee benefit trust (“EBT”). See note 37 for more information on the JSOP and SIP.

Net cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries
The net cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2014 is shown within the table above. For the 
year ended 31 December 2013, the net cash outflow of £3.7 million principally related to the buy-out of the Just Eat Canada Inc. 
minority shareholders (£1.3 million) and deferred consideration payments in respect of the Group’s 2012 acquisition of Just-Eat 
Benelux BV (£2.2 million).
FBA Invest SAS 
On 23 December 2011 the Group acquired 50% of the share capital of FBA Invest SaS (“FBA”), which owns 100% of the share capital 
of Eat OnLine Sa (“EOL”), the company trading under the brand ALLORESTO.fr. At the time of acquiring the shareholding, the Group 
entered into a joint venture agreement with the other shareholders; which contained two options. The Group had the first option to 
buy 30-50% more of the shareholding not already held, thus obtaining between 80-100% of FBA’s share capital. The second option 
was held by the other 50% shareholders and only became exercisable should the aforementioned option lapse.
It was at the JV partners’ discretion to determine how much of the first option above 30% could be exercised. In June 2014 the Group 
received notification that the option was over 30% of the share capital of FBA. The Group exercised the option in July 2014, thereby 
obtaining control of FBA. The consideration paid, of £5.8 million, was based on a pre-determined range of prices set out in the 2011 
share purchase agreement.
At this point, the Group became committed to acquiring the minority 20% shareholder in 2017. The amount payable in 2017 is 
dependent upon the performance of EOL at that time. The Directors have estimated that the amount payable in 2017 will be €6.9 
million. As a result a provision of £5.6 million was established in July 2014, being the discounted Pound Sterling amount of the 
estimated amount payable. 
Up until July 2014, the Group’s 50% interest in FBA was accounted for as a joint venture using the equity accounting method. From 
the time the Group obtained control of FBA, in July 2014, FBA and EOL were accounted for as subsidiaries. As obtaining control of FBA 
and EOL was achieved in stages, the provisions of IFRS 3 relating to step-acquisitions have been applied.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of FBA and EOL was principally attributable to the future growth of EOL’s business, through 
expansion of the network of restaurant partners and through growth in the numbers of orders per restaurant. In addition, the 
goodwill balance represented the value of EOL’s active consumer base and its assembled workforce. The goodwill balance will not be 
deductible for tax purposes.
A gain of £32.0 million was recognised as a result of the transactions surrounding the acquisition of FBA. This gain was comprised 
as follows:
£m
Gain on deemed disposal of joint venture interest in FBA (note 19) 17.8
Fair value gain in respect of the second completion option 9.5
Fair value gain in relation to minority shareholder buy-out 4.7
Total gain recognised in the income statement 32.0
The gains are based on the Directors’ valuation of FBA and EOL. The gain on the deemed disposal of the joint venture interest 
represents the fair value of the consideration received of £25.5 million, less the carrying value of the joint venture interest, of 
£7.2 million and the cumulative foreign currency translation differences previously booked to equity, of £0.5 million.
The fair value gain in respect of the second completion option represents the difference between the fair value of the additional 30% 
shareholding in FBA, of £15.4 million and the amount paid for the holding, of £5.8 million. At the time the Directors’ estimate of the 
cost of exercising the second completion option equated to their estimate of the fair value of the holding that would be acquired 
through exercising the option. 
The fair value gain in relation to the minority shareholder buy-out provision represents the difference between the estimated fair 
value of the 20% minority shareholding in FBA, of £10.2 million, and the amount at which the Directors’ expect to acquire the holding 
for in 2017, of £5.5 million (discounted for the time value of money). The estimated fair value of the 20% minority shareholding in 
FBA, of £10.2 million, has been charged to equity.
The FBA acquisition accounting is provisional in respect of certain liabilities for which more information as to their fair value may come 
to light in the future. 126 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Meal2Go
On 27 February 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Meal2Order.com Limited (“Meal2Go”) for cash consideration 
totalling £3.7 million, including the repayment of loans from the selling shareholders, of £0.7 million. The Group obtained control of 
Meal2Go and as a result the acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Meal2Go was principally acquired for its leading EPOS (Electronic Point-Of-Sale) technology, specifically designed for the 
takeaway industry. 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Meal2Go was attributable to the value of the Group being able to roll out Meal2Go’s EPOS 
technology to its network of restaurants, the value associated with the Group’s competitors not being able to own the EPOS 
technology and the value of Meal2Go’s assembled workforce. The goodwill balance will not be deductible for tax purposes.
Other acquisitions
Orogo Limited
On 10 July 2014, the Group acquired 45% of the ordinary share capital of Orogo Limited (“Orogo”). On the same day it increased its 
holding to 60% through a share subscription, providing working capital to the business. The Group obtained control of Orogo and as a 
result the acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination, in accordance with IFRS 3. 
Orogo is an innovative collection only app, which enables consumers to order and pay for their lunch in advance and collect at their 
convenience, from some of central London’s most popular restaurants.
£0.6 million of goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of Orogo. The goodwill was attributable to the future growth of the business 
and the value to the Group of Orogo’s collection knowhow. The goodwill balance will not be deductible for tax purposes.
The Group is committed to acquiring the minority shareholdings in Orogo in 2017 for consideration based on the performance of the 
business at that time. A provision of £3.6 million was established for this commitment, being the discounted (for the time value of 
money) fair value of the estimated consideration payable. £3.6 million has been charged to equity as a result.
Eatcity.ie
On 3 November 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Eatcity Limited (“Eatcity”), which traded as Eatcity.ie 
in Ireland. The Group obtained control of Eatcity and as a result the acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in 
accordance with IFRS 3. 
Goodwill of £0.9 million was recognised on the acquisition of Eatcity. The goodwill was attributable to the future growth of the Eatcity 
business, expected synergy cost savings from merging the two businesses and the value associated with the Group’s competitors not 
being able to acquire Eatcity. The goodwill balance will not be deductible for tax purposes.
Menu Express and Delivery Town
During 2014, Just Eat Canada Inc purchased the assets of two small businesses. Goodwill balances totalling £0.1 million were 
recognised in respect of these acquisitions.
34. Brazilian merger
On 3 November 2014, the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Justeat Brasil Servicos Online LTDA (“JE Brazil”), merged with the iFood 
group. The Group contributed JE Brazil and £3.5 million of working capital to the merger. In return it gained a 25% stake in the 
holding company of the merged group, IF-JE Participações Ltda (“IF-JE”).
A gain of £5.8 million was recorded on the disposal of JE Brazil. This gain was calculated as follows: 
£m
Fair value of consideration received 14.0
Working capital contributed (3.5)
De-recognition of net assets of JE Brazil (including £0.7 million of goodwill) (1.7)
De-recognition of cumulative foreign translation losses recognised in equity (3.0)

Due to the complexities of the merger, the IF-JE acquisition accounting is provisional in respect of the fair values of the assets and

37. Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments, 
the value of the awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the management’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value of the options 
granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options were granted. 
The total expense recorded in relation to the long-term employee incentives was £4.9 million (2013: £1.7 million). This charge is 
comprised of £4.4 million (2013: £1.7 million) in respect of share-based payments and £0.5 million (2013: nil) in respect of employer’s 
social security costs on the exercise of options. As at 31 December 2014, the provision for social security costs on the exercise of 
options was £0.3 million (2013: nil).
The Company operates the JUST EAT plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI Scheme”), the JUST EAT plc Company 
Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) and the JUST EAT Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) for employees of the Group. 
During 2014, the share option plans were revised to take account of the bonus issue and consolidation of shares that were undertaken 
prior to the Company’s IPO (see note 28). 
EMI Scheme
Under the terms of the EMI Scheme, the Board granted options to certain employees of the Group to purchase shares in the 
Company. Options are no longer being granted under this scheme.
CSOP
Under the terms of the CSOP, the Board may grant options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company. The CSOP is an equity-
settled share option scheme approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) and was established in 2011. 
Under the CSOP, the Board may grant options over shares in the Company to eligible employees. The eligible employees to whom 
options are granted and the terms of such options are determined by the Board. All employees are eligible to participate in the CSOP, 
including employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, but not all grants are approved by HMRC. Options are not transferable.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant, in order for the 
scheme to qualify as an approved HMRC scheme.
Vested options in the CSOP scheme became exercisable on the Company’s IPO in April 2014.  129 www.just-eat.com

EMI Scheme and CSOP
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the estimated fair value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Options vest in 
stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date which is typically one year after the date of grant. Options are 
forfeited if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest and expire if they remain unexercised ten years after the date of 
grant. Details of the share options granted, under the EMI Scheme and CSOP, are as follows:

outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average exercise price of 34.0 pence (2013: 18.1 pence) and a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 8.3 years (2013: 8.6 years). 
SIPs
Under the terms of the SIP, the Board may award Ordinary shares in the Company at no cost to the employee. The SIP is an equity-
settled share option scheme approved by HMRC and was established in 2014. The shares vest between three and five years after 
grant. Awards over 472,465 Ordinary Shares were granted on the date of the IPO. The fair value of the share on the date of grant was 
£2.60. Since grant 81,270 awards have been forfeited. As at 31 December 2014 there were 391,195 SIP awards outstanding, all of 
which vest on 8 April 2017.
Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)
The JSOP is a share ownership scheme under which the employee and Appleby Trust (Jersey Trust) Limited, the EBT Trustee (“EBT 
Trustee”), hold a joint interest in Ordinary Shares. 
Interests under the JSOP take the form of restricted interests in Ordinary Shares in the Company. An interest permits a participant to 
benefit from the increase (if any) in the value of a number of Ordinary Shares in the Company over specified threshold amounts. In 
order to acquire an interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the EBT Trustee, under which the 
participant and the EBT Trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold the participant has a right to 
receive the proportion of the sale proceeds that exceed the threshold amount.
The vesting of interests granted to employees is subject to the option holder continuing to be employed by the Group. Interests vest 
in stages over a three year period commencing on a specified date typically one year after the date of the grant. The fair value of 
interests awarded under the JSOP was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. Details of the JSOP interests are

In determining the fair value of the options and interests granted under the EMI Scheme, CSOP and JSOP, the Black-Scholes Option 
Pricing Model was used with the following inputs:
Year ended 
31 December
2014
Year ended 
31 December
2013
Weighted average share price 168p 91p
Weighted average exercise price 58p 34p
Expected volatility 34.6% 39.7%
Expected life 36-48 months 36-48 months
Risk-free rate 0.38%-1.69% 0.38% – 1.69%
Expected dividend yields 0.0% 0.0%
Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to others of a similar size or operating in a similar field. The expected 
life used in the model was management’s best estimate, adjusted for the effects for non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. All such share awards are equity-settled.
38. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise both financial assets and financial liabilities. The carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities 
approximate their fair value.
Financial assets in the Group comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and a derivative financial instrument. 
The classification of these financial assets is set out in the table below. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, other 
long-term liabilities, borrowings and provisions for liabilities which are classified as other financial liabilities.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns. The capital structure of 
the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 28 to 31. As disclosed in note 41, subsequent to the year end the Group signed a 
£90 million revolving credit facility. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Financial risk management objectives
The main financial risks faced by the Group are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which include interest rate risk and currency 
risk. The Board regularly reviews these risks. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying 
amount of these assets is equal to their fair value.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
were as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is primarily exposed to the Euro, Danish Krone and Canadian Dollar.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% depreciation and 10% appreciation in Pound Sterling against the relevant 
foreign currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes 
only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in 
foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group.

The Group’s sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currencies is the result of increased activity in the foreign owned subsidiaries which 
has led to a significant increase in foreign currency denominated trade payables, trade receivables and intercompany borrowings. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date. For assets 
and floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of asset/liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was 
outstanding for the whole year. A 10% increase or decrease in the interest rate is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to 
key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. 
If interest rates had been 10% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
•  profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 would increase by £41,000 (2013: £16,000); and 
•  there would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. 132 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The 
Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its major counterparties are continuously monitored.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of consumers, spread across geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed 
on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which are stated net of impairment losses, represents 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit 
rating agencies.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. In addition, subsequent to the year end the 
Group signed a £90 million revolving credit facility, see note 41 for further details.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The 
tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group 
can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, 
the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturity is based on the 
earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

The Group has previously had access to financing overdraft facilities, which as of the balance sheet date have all been cancelled. The 
Group expects to meet its obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets.
Derivative financial instrument
At the time the Group acquired Sindelantal Internet S.L. in 2012, it granted a loan to selling shareholders in order that they could 
provide working capital to their Mexican business. Part of the loan was convertible into a minority shareholding in the holding 
company of the Mexican business. The embedded option was recognised on the 31 December 2014 balance sheet at a fair value of 
£0.4 million (2013: nil). The fair value gain arising during 2014, of £0.4 million (2013: nil), was recognised within “Other gains” in the 
Income Statement. The fair value was based on an offer made for the business around the time of the Group’s year end. This 
unobservable market information ranks as level 3 data in the fair value hierarchy (see note 3d).

On 24 March 2014, prior to the IPO, the Company called all the unpaid subscription amounts, totalling £13.2 million, in respect of 
certain shares issued under the JSOP. In order to facilitate this, the Company made loans to participants of the JSOP and Appleby 
Trust (Jersey Trust) Limited totalling £5.3 million and £7.9 million, respectively. The loans provided to the participants of the JSOP 
included loans to key management personnel totalling £4.9 million. As at 31 December 2014, the amount due from key management 
personnel in respect of these loans was £4.8 million (2013: nil). This included £3.0 million in respect of Directors of the Company 
(2013: nil).
During the year ended 31 December 2014 dividends totalling £0.3 million (2013: nil) were paid to key management personnel. Of this, 
£0.2 million (2013: nil) was paid to Directors of the Company.
The weighted average subscription price of the JSOP awards was 28 pence. Should the Company’s share price fall below the 
subscription price, on exercise by the employee or on the Company calling the loans, the Company has guaranteed to fund the 
shortfall.

40. Subsidiaries (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2014
On 27 February 2014, a Group company acquired 100% of the share capital of Meal 2 Order.com Limited. In addition, the same Group 
company acquired 100% of the share capital of three non-trading companies: Meal2Go Limited, Meal2Go Ireland Limited, and 1Epos 
Limited. See note 33 for further details about this acquisition.
On 10 July 2014, a Group company acquired 45% of the share capital of Orogo Limited. Immediately following the acquisition, the 
Group’s shareholding was increased to 60% via a share subscription. See note 33 for further details about this acquisition.
On 24 July 2014, the Group exercised its option to purchase an additional 30% of shares in FBA Invest SaS, a French holding 
company, in which the Group already had a 50% interest. This increased the Group holding in FBA and its 100% owned subsidiary, 
Eat Online Sa, to 80%. See note 33 for further details about this acquisition.
On 3 November 2014, a Group company acquired 100% of the share capital of Eatcity Limited. The trade and assets of Eatcity were 
immediately transferred into Just-Eat Ireland Limited.
On 3 November 2014, the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Justeat Brasil Servicos Online LTDA (“JE Brazil”) merged with the iFood 
group. Following the merger the Group held a minority shareholding of 25% in the holding company of the merged group, IF-JE 
Participações Ltda (“IF-JE”). IF-JE wholly owns JE Brazil and the iFood group. See note 34 for further details about the merger.
During 2014, the Group’s holding in Achindra Online Marketing Private Limited (“justeat.in”) reduced to 51%, but the Group’s voting 
rights and economic interests were retained at 49.9%.
Year ended 31 December 2013
On 1 January 2013 SinDelantal Internet S.L. was merged into Just-Eat Spain S.L. 
In January 2013, the Group bought out the minority interest in its Canadian business, Just Eat Canada Inc. This was achieved via the 
purchase of Power & Power Inc., a Canadian holding company. 
In January 2013, a Group company acquired, through the conversion of loans to equity, an additional 13% of the ordinary share 
capital of Eat.ch and gained control of Eat.ch. The Group’s shareholding increased from 50% to 63% and subsequently to 64% 
following a further loan conversion.
On 26 August 2013, the Group liquidated the non-trading entity Biteguide GmbH.
The Group’s shareholding in justeat.in” had increased from 84% to 91% over the course of 2013 via a series of capital injections. In 
November 2013, the Group relinquished control of justeat.in, as a result of Axon Partners Group and Forum Synergies India making 
investments in justeat.in. This transaction reduced the Group’s shareholding to 59%. The Group’s voting rights and economic interests 
decreased to 49.9%.
Audit exemption statement
For the year ended 31 December 2014, Orogo Limited, Meal 2 Order.com Limited, FillMyBelly Limited, Urbanbite Holdings Limited

41. Events after the balance sheet date
On 22 January 2015 the Group acquired the minority shareholdings in eat.ch GmbH, the Group’s Swiss trading subsidiary. As a result, 
the Group’s stake increased from 64% to 100%. As eat.ch GmbH was already consolidated as a subsidairy the acquisition will have no 
impact on the Group’s revenue or underlying EBITDA.
On 11 February the Group acquired a further 5% stake in IF-JE Participações Ltda (“IF-JE”), the Group’s Brazilian associated 
undertaking, bringing its total stake to 30%. The consideration payable is dependent upon the future performance of IF-JE and is 
payable in instalments over the period to 31 October 2016. Following the acquisition of the further stake, IF-JE will continue to be 
accounted for as an associated undertaking. As IF-JE is currently loss making the acquisition of a further stake will initially have a 
small negative impact of the Group’s Underlying EBITDA. 
On 13 February the Group acquired the entire share capital of Sindelantal Mexico SA DE CV (“Sindelantal Mexico”). Sindelantal Mexico 
is the market leader in mobile and online takeaway in Mexico. It has approximately 2,500 restaurant partners and generates over 
50,000 orders per month. Given the timing of the acquisition, it has not been possible to determine the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities acquired. As Sindelantal Mexico is currently loss-making the acquisition will initially have a negative impact of the Group’s 
Underlying EBITDA. 
The total consideration for the above acquisitions is expected to be around £35 million.
In January the Group sold its shares in Achindra Online Marketing Private Limited, the Group’s Indian associated undertaking, to 
foodpanda. Prior to the disposal the investment was accounted for using the equity accounting method. As a consequence the sale 
will have no impact on the Group’s revenue and a small positive impact on Underlying EBITDA, as the Group will no longer recognise a 
share of the entity’s losses. The Group will recognise its investment in foodpanda’s Indian holding company at fair value. 
In March the Group signed a facility agreement with a syndicate of banks consisting of Barclays Bank plc, HSBC plc and RBS plc, for a 
revolving credit facility for £90 million. This has a one-off fee and will result in an increased interest costs for the Group in 2015, 
depending on the amount drawn down. As at the date of signing the financial statements no debt has been drawn down. 138 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting 
standards and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The particular accounting policies adopted are described below. 
In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own 
income statement and statement of total recognised gains and losses. In addition, the Company has taken the exemptions permitted 
under FRS 1 (Revised 1996) Cash Flow Statement and FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures that allow companies for which consolidated 
financial statements are prepared not to prepare a cash flow statement and related parties disclosures. See note 39 to the Group 
consolidated financial statements for details of the Group’s related party transactions. 
Going concern
See note 2 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a 
right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing 
differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax is not provided on the revaluation of fixed assets where these is no binding agreement to dispose of these assets, nor on 
unremitted earnings where there is no binding commitment to remit these earnings.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.

On 20 March 2014 the Company’s share premium account was reduced by £40.0 million by way of a reduction of capital. On the same 
day the Company conducted a bonus issue of 2,699 shares for every one Ordinary Share, B Ordinary share, Preference A share, 
Preference B share and Preference C share in issue. This was followed by a consolidation of each of the Ordinary Shares, B Ordinary 
shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares such that the nominal value of each share increased from 
£0.0001 to £0.01.
On 24 March 2014 the Company re-registered as JUST EAT plc.
On 8 April 2014 the Company’s Ordinary shares were admitted to the High Growth Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange (the “Listing”). In conjunction, the Company made an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 38.5 million new one pence Ordinary 
shares at a price of 260 pence per share. Also on this date, immediately prior to the Listing, 29.8 million B Ordinary shares, 134.3 
million Preference A shares, 48.8 million Preference B shares and 67.6 million Preference C shares converted to Ordinary shares. 
Costs that related directly to the issue of new shares have been deducted from the share premium account. IPO costs that related to 
both the Listing and issue of new shares have been allocated between the share premium account and the income statement in 
proportion to the number of primary and secondary shares traded on admission. As a result, during the year ended 31 December 
2014, IPO costs totalling £4.5 million have been charged to the share premium account and IPO costs of £2.3 million were charged to 
the income statement. IPO costs of £1.4 million were charged to the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2013.
On 6 May 2014 the Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Financial 
Conduct Authority. This change had no effect on the issued share capital of the Company.
As at 31 December 2013, 45,500 Ordinary shares and 222,700 B Ordinary shares had been issued to Appleby Trust (Jersey Trust) 
Limited under the Group’s Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) arrangement. As at 31 December 2013, these shares were partly paid. 
This was in line with standard practice for such JSOP arrangements. These shares were fully paid up prior to the IPO, and all shares 
are now fully paid. 144 JUST EAT plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014

holding company) or certain other events, unvested executive

Directors’ responsibility statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 44 to 45 confirm that, to the best of each person’s 
knowledge and belief:
• the Annual Report, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s and the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and Parent 
Company; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and Group, together with  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors of the Company at the time when this 
Report was approved confirmed that:
1. so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
2. he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given in accordance with section 418(2) of 
the Act.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP, the Group’s auditors, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office and, on the recommendation of 
the Audit Committee and in accordance with Section 489 of the 
Act, a resolution to re-appoint them will be put to the 2015 AGM.

Notes Our brand journey …
Belly & Brain
In 2009, JUST EAT launched its first major marketing push, creating two animated characters,  
Belly and Brain. The campaign targeted busy people in their 20’s, principally students, gamers  
and professionals. “Belly”, representing a hungry stomach, and “Brain” who knows how to  
“order takeaway the smart way”.
The “Don’t Cook, JUST EAT”
In 2012, the marketing team launched a global campaign to ban 
cooking. The “Don’t Cook, JUST EAT” campaign launched on  
several platforms, and centred around Mr. Mozzarella and a fictional 
crew of takeaway chefs. The brand success meant we soon overtook 
Domino’s Pizza as the top-of-mind-brand for “delivered takeaway”.  
We also won several marketing awards, including a 2013 SABRE  
award for Best Guerrilla Marketing. Campaigns included standing  
in the Corby by-election and the high-profile “kidnapping”  
of celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson.
#minifistpump
Following the success of “Don’t Cook, JUST EAT”,  
the resulting growth in orders and awareness  
was such that we needed to extend our target 
audience demographic aimed more toward  
young professionals and families.
Our new brand
O u r c a m p a i g n , # mini fi s t p um p ,  launched in 
September 2014. It better reflects our purpose and 
values, appealing to a broader audience. 
The #minifistpump personifies that momentary,  
yet wonderful feeling you get when ordering  
takeaway from JUST EAT. It also plays well with 
countless small victories in other areas of everyday 
life. The campaign naturally lends itself to all 
communication channels, including TV,  
radio, outdoor, digital and social media. JUST EAT plc

03 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 chairman’s statement
CONTINuING 
TO DELIvER
michael bucKley
Chairman
26 April 2017
2016 has been another year 
of significant progress for 
Gaming Realms. Revenue 
increased by more than 60% 
to £34.0m (2015: £21.2m). 
The Group also delivered 
its first profitable reporting 
period in H2/16 with an 
adjusted EBITDA profit of 
£2.0m (H2/15: loss of £1.7m), 
reinforcing the Board’s view 
that its strategy of investing 
in high quality, high value 
assets and the focus on 
execution has allowed the 
Group to achieve strong top 
line growth while delivering 
an improving bottom line 
performance. 
During the first half of 2016 non-core 
assets, including our bingo sites on a 
third-party platform were disposed of, 
focusing the Group on our own platform. 
In addition, we disposed of QuickThink 
Media to Ayima, integrating our in-house 
digital marketing agency with a high 
growth full service agency in exchange 
for an equity stake in Ayima.
2016 has also been the first full year of 
integration and operation of the Slingo IP 
and social publishing business acquired 
from Real Networks in H2/15. In addition 
to driving significant new content for our 
real money gaming business, this 
acquisition has delivered third party royalty 
savings as well as providing a significant 
new addressable market for Gaming 
Realms’ game content, IP and marketing 
capability. During the year we created and 
deployed several new social apps and 
04 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Real money gaming delivered year on 
year revenue growth of c.100%. The Group 
could have shown a small profit for the 
year had we decided to invest less heavily 
in the development and marketing of our 
new social publishing business. The social 
publishing adjusted EBITDA loss was £1.8m 
(10 August 2015 to 31 December 2015: 
£1.5m) due to new app development and 
new launches including the successful 
Slingo Arcade featuring our Slingo 
Original content.
Outlook for 2017
The Board has approved the 2017 
operating plan which is to drive continued 
top line growth in uK real money gaming 
operations on our Grizzly platform and 
balance that with continuing to improve 
bottom line contribution from social 
publishing and content licensing. As in 
2016, we will invest significantly in 
marketing during H1 particularly focused 
on the real money gaming business 
through strategic Tv partnerships to build 
awareness and play frequency and reap the 
benefits of a scaled player base across the 
full year.
Following the disposal of our non-core 
assets in 2016, and as we continue to scale 
the business, we are now focused on 
profitable growth. We will allocate our 
capital and resources on the most 
profitable areas particularly real money 
gaming and our new content licensing 
revenue stream. Our plan is to achieve 
profitability for the full year in 2017. 
We plan to extend our presence in New 
Jersey, having now achieved both product 
and platform approval. With the addition 
of several new licensees including Caesar’s 
Interactive, Pala Interactive, Resorts and 
one other uS operator, we will introduce 
our real money Slingo games into that 
territory. We hope to continue to benefit 
from the investment in development and 
integration synergies which were 
undertaken during 2016 in our social 
publishing business. 
integrated aspects of the business with 
our real money gaming business. Through 
further operational synergies as well as 
innovative new product growth, it is our 
expectation that these investments and 
enhancements to the way we operate will 
deliver greater profitability in 2017.
The Board continues to review growth 
opportunities in adjacent markets for our 
existing content. The acquisition of the 
Slingo brand and IP has allowed us to 
achieve significant licensing partnerships 
with Scientific Games, Zynga and Instant 
Win Gaming which are already yielding 
c.£0.7m in recurring revenue with limited 
recurring cost. 
With increased focus on producing our 
own proprietary games for our real money 
gaming business, we are developing 
additional high margin revenue 
opportunities in social and real money 
game content licensing markets. These 
will come on stream in 2017.
We are delighted with the performance of 
our real money gaming business in which 
we were awarded the Mobile Casino 
Product of the Year award by eGaming 
Review. This is a strong endorsement of our 
execution in 2016 and how our mobile first 
strategy is yielding significant growth over 
the twelve-month period.
Our investment in producing our own 
content and developing this on our own 
platform has allowed us greater flexibility 
to deliver high rate revenue growth. As we 
scale revenue across our fixed costs this 
will deliver increased margin and enable 
us to achieve greater bottom line 
contribution. using our own platform has 
reduced content royalties by 39% in the 
last year alone. In addition, the revenue 
from new content distribution and further 
IP licensing will further drive high margin 
revenue across the same fixed costs. 
In summary, the Group has never been in 
a better position to drive further profitable 
growth across our real money gaming and 
content licensing revenue streams.

In 2016, the Group achieved 
market leading growth in 
its UK real money gaming 
business, integrated its 
new social business, built 
award winning content 
to complement its newly 
acquired IP and executed 
unique strategic partnerships 
with globally recognized 
brand licensors and 
gaming licensees.
Overview
The investment in both our proprietary 
platform and marketing has resulted in 
excellent growth in a competitive uK 
market place by allowing us to focus on 
a younger mobile based audience. Mobile 
now accounts for 84.0% (2015: 78.3%) 
of our player base. 
Growth in 2016 has been supported by 
key media deals with Fremantle including 
The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, which 
have allowed us to offer a more targeted 
gambling offering to our key demographic. 
We have augmented this by the in-house 
creation of 8 new unique ‘Slingo Original’ 
mobile games, which account for over 
£101m (2015: £56m) in wagering on the 
platform or 17% of the gross gaming 
revenue for the year. The most recent 
game Magic Mine is truly original in 
combining skill and chance as it attempts 
to mirror the ‘fun element’ of many social 
games, which are lacking in harder edged 
gambling products.
Overall wagering has increased by 51% to 
£609m (2015: £404m) and deposits have 
more than doubled to £49.0m (2015: 
£24.0m). As a more established platform 
we have been able to reduce bonus costs 
to 29% (2015: 43%) of gross gaming

SET FOR
GROWTH
06 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 revenue and lessen direct costs associated 
with the operation to 35% (2015: 42%) of 
revenue. This has allowed greater focus on 
marketing and revenue growth in the year. 
Demand for our unique content has been 
such that it has led to the development of 
a Remote Game Server (‘RGS’) which allows 
our ‘Slingo Original’ games to be licensed 
to third party operators as premium 
content. This will form an increasing part 
of our strategy in 2017 as we look 
to differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors, as well as expand the 
reach of our content into new territories. 
Licensing deals to Zynga, Scientific Games 
and Instant Win Games in 2016 have paved 
the way for further deployment of our 
content into new jurisdictions such as 
Quebec through the Provincial Lottery 
monopoly and New Jersey through 
iGaming and Pala Interactive.
We have further integrated the social 
business, bought from Real Networks in 
2015, with the creation of a shared 
development path which now allows us to 
deliver content simultaneously to both real 
money gaming and social audiences. The 
first offering in this regard is Slingo Arcade 
which, following launch in late Q4/16 
rapidly has become the second highest 
grossing social app, scaling to an average 
of $8,000 per day in March 2017. In future, 
emphasis will be on using this channel to 
monetize content developed for real 
money gaming similar to licensing our 
content to third party operators. This will 
have resulted in a reduction in headcount 
from 53 in June 2016 to approximately 29 
in June 2017 within social publishing.
disposal of non-core assets
During the year we disposed of our 
non-core legacy third party platform assets 
which has allowed us to focus resources on 
our higher margin proprietary mobile 
gaming platform and our own high 
performance game content.
The disposal of our in-house digital 
marketing agency in a strategic 
partnership between Gaming Realms and 
Ayima, has allowed the Group to benefit 
from an enlarged marketing capability. 
We have been seeing the benefits of this 
on our acquisition channels on Grizzly. 
marketing
As a result of our marketing strategy our 
cost per acquisition on our Grizzly platform 
was £86 (2015: £79), one of the lowest 
across the industry for a uK casino and we 
gained 1 16,349 (2015: 78,198) new 
depositing players in the year. Our revenue 
per depositing player increased 22% to 
£153 (2015: £125) which is reflective of 
the greater operational improvements in 
the business despite a lower than normal 
gaming margin in H2.
Key goals for 2017
 > Allocation of capital and investment 
to the most profitable business 
segments i.e. real money gaming 
and content licensing.
 > Focus on scaling uK real money gaming 
business for full year double digit revenue 
and profit growth.
 > New regulated third party licensees for 
Gaming Realms proprietary content. 
 > Profitability in social publishing through

A STRONG 
PERFORMANCE
mar K segal
Chief Finance Officer
26 April 2017
Gaming Realms has delivered 
year-on-year revenue growth 
of more than 60% to £34.0m 
(2015: £21.2m). This growth 
is a result of our proprietary 
platform scaling in both 
real money gaming and 
social publishing. 
Overview
Real money gaming on the Grizzly platform 
has grown 100% to £21.5m (2015: £10.8m), 
with social gaming and licensing adding 
£8.7m (2015: £2.5m) of which content 
licensing was £0.8m (2015: £0.1m). 
In addition, affiliate marketing of £1.8m 
(2015: £2.1m) and disposed white label 
operations and agency business of £1.9m 
(2015: £5.7m) included below under real 
money gaming and marketing services. 
Adjusted EBITDA loss was £1.0m  
(2015: £4.1m) because of the investment 
in social publishing which contributed an 
adjusted EBITDA loss of £1.8m (10 August 
2015 to 31 December 2015: £1.5m) 
due to continued app development and 
new launches including Slingo Arcade.
Marketing for the year, excluding disposed 
assets, was £13.9m (2015: £9.1m) as the 
Group continued to acquire players to 
grow its platform and revenues.
During the year, Gaming Realms disposed 
of its non-core legacy third party assets 
and its digital agency assets into a 
strategic partnership with Ayima. This has 
resulted in a profit on disposal in the year 
of £0.3m.
income statement items
Like for like revenue growth (excluding 
the disposed assets) was 106% to £32.0m 
(2015: £15.5m) driven by the increase in 
real money gaming and social publishing.
10 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 costs of £7.6m (2015: £4.6m) with respect 
to our real money gaming vertical, because 
of the increase in revenue and size of the 
operation. However, due to operational 
leverage that scale gives us, we saw a 
reduction in the year to 35% (2015: 42%) 
as a proportion of revenue. 
Real money gaming and marketing services 
delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of 
£2.8m (2015: loss of £0.8m).
social gaming and licensing
Key highlights for 2016 include:
 > Completed development of RGS enabling 
a single development platform for our 
real money gaming operations, social 
publishing and content licensing. 
 > Investments in regulatory approvals in New 
Jersey provides a new high margin growth 
market for our proprietary content.
 > New IP licensing revenue from Zynga and 
Scientific Games.
 > 22% annualised social publishing revenue 
growth despite limited impact of new 
investment in Slingo Arcade which was 
launched in December 2016. 
 > Growth in player base to 1.2m (2015: 
1.0m) average monthly active users.

During the year, Gaming Realms did not pay 
an interim or final dividend. The Board of 
Directors are not proposing a final dividend 
for the current year.
corporation and deferred 
taxation
The Group received £27,961 (2015: 
£213,083) in research and development 
credits in the year and has recognised the 
unwind of deferred tax of £248,941 (2015: 
£ 122,692) on business combinations.
r eal money gaming and 
marketing services
The increase in revenue in real money 
gaming to £21.5m (2015: £10.8m) 
reflects the continuing investment into 
development, £1.5m (2015: £1.8m) and 
marketing £9.6m (2015: £6.7m). The 
marketing performance has exceeded 
expectations in the year delivering 116,349 
(2015: 78,198) new depositing players at a 
cost per acquisition of £86 (2015: £79). 
Marketing services including disposed 
non-core assets contributed £3.7m (2015: 
£7.8m) to Group revenue, of which affiliate 
marketing services contributed £1.8m 
(2015: £2.1m) in revenue.

11 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 pr incipal ris Ks and un certainties
The Board constantly monitors and assesses risks and uncertainties 
within the Group’s trading activities. There will always be a level 
of risk which needs to be evaluated against the Group’s potential 
returns in any activity.
r isk description of risk how this risk is managed
Regulatory and 
Legislation
Online gambling and gaming is subject to 
a dynamic and complex regulatory regime. 
The Group now holds licences from the Alderney 
Gambling Control Commission, the uK Gambling 
Commission and a transactional waiver for New 
Jersey Division for Gaming Enforcement.
It is key to the Group to maintain compliance with 
all licences and any new ones that are required. 
These are critical to the continuing operation of 
the Group’s gambling activities and also the 
production and supply of its unique content into 
both its operations and other third parties.
The Group has a compliance team to ensure that 
all regulatory guidelines are maintained in its 
gambling operations. The Group also maintains 
close legal counsel to advise on any changes to 
the regulatory framework, as well as updates on 
territories currently outside the Group’s activities.
Taxation
From the end of 2014, the Group was subject 
to point of consumption tax in relation to its 
gambling activities within the uK. Any changes 
to the tax rate or the point it is incurred may 
adversely affect duty payable.
The Group continues to take advice and 
be prepared for any adverse changes in 
the gambling tax regime.
Residency
The Group has legal entities in several jurisdictions, 
including uS, Canada and Alderney. Its real money 
gaming operations are based in Alderney where 
there is a zero rate for corporation tax and is 
outside the scope of vAT. If there was a change to 
the rate of corporate tax or vAT in Alderney, it 
would have an adverse effect on the amount of 
tax payable within the Group.
The Group has undertaken a detailed transfer 
pricing exercise to ensure that revenue and profits 
are attributed correctly between the operating 
locations.
Brexit
In the June 2016 referendum, the uK voted to leave 
the Eu. This may increase the volatility of global 
currency and financial markets. In addition, it may 
reduce the Group’s ability to operate in certain Eu 
markets without a change in domiciliation, which 
could carry a higher tax burden.
The Group will continue to monitor the situation 
and respond as the timing and terms of the uK’s 
exit from the Eu become clearer.
Competition
The online and free to play gaming markets are 
highly competitive in North America and the uK. 
Failure to be able to hold a competitive advantage 
would result in attracting less players and have 
lower engagement on our apps and sites.
In following the Group’s strategy of developing 
new unique IP and content, the Group feels well 
placed to be able to compete in the markets it 
operates in. It invests significant resource to be 
able to improve its development and operations.
Diverse products and geographies also helps to 
diversify the risk.
12 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 r isk description of risk how this risk is managed
Time to market
The Group invests highly in technology and bringing 
new products and games to market. A delay in time 
to market will result in a loss of competitive 
advantage, a loss in potential revenue and also 
increasing cost of development.
The Group has invested highly in having a dual 
product track to allow its products and games to 
be ready for both licensing and publishing 
exploitation in the same release.
Extensive work is undergone on the planning stage 
to ensure that timeframes can be met and products 
go live at the highest standard.
Dependence on 
technology
As a provider of online gambling services, the 
Group’s business is reliant on technology and 
advanced information systems. If the Group does 
not invest in the maintenance and further 
development of its technology systems, there is a 
risk that these systems may not cope with the needs 
of the business and may fail. The Group is reliant on 
the Internet and is vulnerable to activities such as 
distributed denial of service attacks, other forms of 
cyber-crime and a wide range of malicious viruses.
The Group continues to invest in its proprietary 
platform to ensure the necessary features and 
functionality meet their partner needs. In addition, 
it has adopted industry standard protections to 
detect intrusions or other security breaches and 
implements preventative measures to protect 
against sabotage, hackers, viruses and other 
cyber-crime.
Dependence on 
third-party service 
providers
The Group engages with a number of providers 
of non-proprietary third party games and payment 
processing services, as well as other important 
service providers. In the event that there is any 
interruption to the products or services provided 
by third parties, problems in supplying the 
products, one or more ceased to be provided or 
are provided on onerous terms to the Group, this 
may have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business and performance.
The Group uses reliable industry suppliers and 
ensures that contractual agreements with key 
partners offer adequate protection.
The team
During the year the team has expanded across 
multiple locations. The ability to carry out the 
Group’s strategy is dependent on the engagement 
of its senior management team, its technology, 
marketing and operations teams.
The Group continues to invest in its employees 
to ensure that it can attract, recruit and maintain 
a high-quality team.
To ensure this happens, the Group has taken on 
a management and engagement course during 
the year for all roles within the business.

16 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 statement OF direct Ors’ resp Onsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European union 
and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and uK accounting standards (uK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to 
prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’).
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 > make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 > state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
w ebsite publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the uK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. 
The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity 
of the financial statements contained therein.
Strategic Report corporate governance Financial Statements
17 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 cOrp Orate g Overnance
Although companies traded on AIM are not required to provide 
corporate governance disclosure, or follow guidelines in the uK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (‘FRC’), the Directors recognise the value and 
importance of high standards of corporate governance. 
Given the Company’s size and the constitution of the Board, the 
following is a brief summary of the main aspects of corporate 
governance currently in place. 
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a 
Remuneration Committee with formally delegated responsibilities. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mark Wilson. Its other 
members are currently Michael Buckley and Jim Ryan. This 
committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors 
and makes recommendations to the Board on matters relating to 
their remuneration and terms of employment. The Remuneration 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on 
proposals for the granting of share options and other equity 
incentives. The Board sets the remuneration and terms and 
conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jim Ryan. Its other members 
are Mark Wilson and Michael Buckley. The Committee determines 
the terms of engagement of the Company’s auditors and, in 
consultation with them, the scope of the audit. It receives and 
reviews reports from management and the Company’s auditors 
relating to the interim and annual financial statements and the 
accounting and internal control systems in use by the Group. 
The Audit Committee has unrestricted access to the Company’s 
auditors. under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee 
monitors, amongst other matters, the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements. The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the re-appointment 
of the external auditors. It is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate business relationship is maintained between the 
Group and the external auditors, including reviewing non-audit 
services and fees. The Committee meets with Executive 
Directors and management as well as meeting privately 
with the external auditors. 
As the Board is small, there is not a separate Nominations 
Committee and the Board as a whole considers recommendations 
for appointments to the Board. 
The Directors follow the guidance set out by Rule 21 of AIM Rules 
relating to dealings by Directors in the Company’s securities and, 
to this end, the Company has adopted an appropriate share 
dealing code. 
going concern 
under company law, the Company’s Directors are required to 
consider whether it is appropriate to prepare financial statements 
on the basis that the Group and Company are a going concern. As 
part of the normal business practice the Group prepares annual 
and three-year plans and, in reviewing this information, the 
Company’s Directors are satisfied that the Group and the 
Company have reasonable resources and future cash flows to 
enable them to continue in business for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, the Company and Group continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial statements
23 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1. accounting policies
General information
Gaming Realms plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’).
The Company is admitted to trading on AIM of the London Stock Exchange. It is incorporated and domiciled in the uK. The address of its 
registered office is One valentine Place, London, SE1 8QH.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting 
Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRSs) as adopted by the Eu. The comparative statement of cash flows has been restated 
which has resulted in a decrease of £244,1 17 in financing inflow and an increase of £244,1 17 in operating inflow. There were no 
changes to closing cash and cash equivalents.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant 
estimates and judgments have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 2.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 31 December 2016 
and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. 
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the 
following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor 
to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a 
change in any of these elements of control.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of 
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement 
of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date 
on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In August 2017 the final deferred consideration of $4m falls due 
to Real Networks from the acquisition made on 10 August 2015. The Directors have received draft terms, subject to normal commercial 
agreements, for an external debt facility of up to £5m and therefore have confidence that sufficient funds can be raised. The Directors 
will consider the approval of this external debt facility along with other options available to them.
Having reviewed the forecasts of the business and based on the status of current discussions with regards additional investment or 
financing, the Directors have a reasonable expectation to believe it is appropriate to continue to prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis.
Revenue
Revenue comprises net gaming revenue derived from real money gaming, commissions on marketing services, licensing, advertising and 
social gaming.
Net gaming revenue derived from real money gaming
Net gaming revenue derives from online gambling operations and is defined as the difference between the amounts of bets placed by 
the players less amounts won by players. It is stated after deduction of certain bonuses, jackpots and prizes granted to players.
Net gaming revenue is recognised to the extent that its probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Marketing services
Revenue is derived from marketing services provided in relation to online bingo and casino products. The commission revenue is 
calculated either as a percentage of net gaming revenue from the operators or in line with contracts (typically based on fixed price per 
player). Commission revenue is recognised to the extent that the probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
nOt es t O the cOns Olidated Financial statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016
24 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Revenue is also derived from digital marketing services provided to both gaming and non-gaming clients. The revenue is calculated as 
a percentage of marketing spend and is recognised as a percentage of completion.
Advertising revenue
Advertising revenue derives from contractual relationships with agencies, advertising brokers and certain advertisers for advertisements 
within our social games. Advertising revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and 
the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Social gaming revenue
Social gaming revenue derives from the purchase of credits and awards on the social gaming sites. Social gaming revenue is recognised 
to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is 
recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Licensing revenue
Licensing revenue derives from contractual relationships for the use of intellectual property. Revenue is recognised where substantially all 
risk and rewards have been transferred and there are no further monetary or financial obligations to be fulfilled by the licensor. However, 
where there is ongoing obligations to the Group, license fees are recognised over the estimated period of the license to the licensee.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses include staff costs, professional, consulting and legal fees and other costs.
Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA is a non-GAAP, company specific measure. Adjusted EBITDA excludes adjusting items from EBITDA. Adjusting items are 
non-recurring material items which are outside the normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities. These items are separately disclosed 
in order to enhance the reader’s understanding of the Group’s profitability and cash flow generation. Adjusting items include costs 
arising from a fundamental restructuring of the Group’s operations, acquisition costs and share-based payment charges. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. 
Cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the 
acquiree. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and in the case of contingent consideration 
classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of 
consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial 
year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (ie the higher of value 
in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest 
group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units (‘CGus’). Goodwill is 
allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGus that are expected to benefit from a business combination that gives rise to 
the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they 
operate (their ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary 
assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in statement of comprehensive income.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the 
transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, 
are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate 
and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign 
exchange reserve.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial statements
25 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 nOt es t O the cOns Olidated Financial statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 (CONTINuED)
1. accounting policies (continued)
Exchange differences recognised as profit or loss in Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of long-term 
monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group has not classified any 
of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group’s accounting policies for financial assets are as follows:
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of 
contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their 
acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for 
impairment. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are 
recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is 
written off against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement 
of financial position. 
Available-for-sale investment
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories re classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally the Group’s 
strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value, other than those arising due to exchange rate fluctuations and interest calculated using the effective interest rate, 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-sale reserve. Exchange differences on investments 
denominated in a foreign currency and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method are recognised in profit and loss. 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of deferred and contingent consideration, customer funds, trade payables and other 
short-term monetary liabilities. 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument 
and with the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, subsequently recognised at amortised cost. Contingent consideration 
arising from business combinations that is classified as liability is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. Deferred 
consideration arising from business combinations is recognised at present value and unwound over the period until settlement.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial 
liability or financial asset.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interest is recognised at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the 
parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Share-based payments
Where equity-settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account 
by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount 
26 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Non-vesting conditions and market vesting 
conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made 
irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve 
a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is 
charged with the fair value of goods and services received.
The fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting conditions is measured by the application of the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model by reference to the grant date of the options. The fair value of share options issued with market-based vesting conditions 
is measured by use of the Monte Carlo method.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives. 
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or arise from other contractual/
legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see section related to 
critical estimates and judgements below).
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:
 > it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold;
 > adequate resources are available to complete the development;
 > there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
 > the Group is able to sell the product;
 > sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and
 > expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from selling the products developed. 
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of 
intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful economic life
Customer databases 1-2 years
Development costs 3 years
Intellectual property 8 years
Domain name 2-3 years
Software 3 years
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement 
of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
 > The initial recognition of goodwill
 > The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting or taxable profit
 > Investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference 
and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the difference can be utilised. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 
and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 (CONTINuED)
1. accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable 
costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The corresponding liability 
is recognised within provisions.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value, 
of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Office, furniture and equipment 20% per annum straight-line
Computer equipment 33% per annum straight-line
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
 
Player liabilities
Liabilities to players comprise the amounts that are credited to customers’ accounts including provision for bonuses granted by the 
Group. These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable 
that it will result in an outflow of economic benefit that can be reasonably estimated. The provision is measured at the best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax rate reflecting current market 
assessments of the time value of money and risks specific the liability. 
Standards and interpretations
There are no new standards, interpretations or amendments which became effective in the period which have had a material effect 
on the Group’s financial statements.
Management are considering whether IFRS 15 Contracts with customers and IFRS 16 Leases, which are effective for periods beginning 
after 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2019 respectively, will have a material effect on the Group’s future financial statements. 
2. critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below.
Estimates
(a) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and their values are written-down on the basis of the Group’s 
expectations of future economic benefits expected to be received by the Group. Any process which attempts to estimate future 
outcomes is subject to uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation uncertainty can give rise to material differences in asset 
carrying values, this will be stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
(b) Amortisation of development costs
Capitalised development costs are subject to amortisation over its useful life and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Group amortises the assets over the life of the product. 
The estimated useful life of these assets at period end is three years.
(c) valuation of assets acquired on business combinations 
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair 
value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are capitalised if they are separable from the acquired entity or arise from other 
contractual or legal rights. The amounts ascribed to these assets are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques to determine 
the fair value. Capitalised intangible assets are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets. This has ranged between twelve 
months to eight years for acquisitions to date. 
(d) Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences and for tax loss carry-forwards. The assessment of temporary 
differences and tax loss carry-forwards is based on management’s estimates of future taxable profits against which the temporary 
differences and loss carry-forwards may be utilised.
28 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of their losses given that this is the Group’s second period of operation and 
there is no track record of taxable profits at this time. Deferred tax assets will be recognised when the Group has established a track 
record of expected future taxable profit.
Judgements
(a) Revenue recognition
Social gaming revenue is recognised as the service is delivered. This is considered to be when the player buys credits to play the game 
on the basis that there is no further service to be delivered. In addition, revenue generated from in app ads are recognised when the 
advertisement is displayed or offer has been completed by the customer and confirmed by third-party reports.
Net gaming revenue is derived from real money gaming and is recognised as the total wagers less wins less promotional money 
to players.
Other revenue comprises of affiliate services and marketing services.
(b) Capitalisation and amortisation of development costs
The identification of development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation is dependent on management’s judgement and 
knowledge of the work done. Development costs of gaming software platforms are separately identified. Judgements are based on the 
information available at each period end. Economic success of any development is assessed on a reasonable basis but remains uncertain 
at the time of recognition.

Disposal of third-party platform driven website properties
On 4 March 2016, the Group disposed of its third-party platform driven website properties, for a total consideration of £2.4m. Black 
Spark Media Limited paid the Group an upfront cash payment of £1.2m with the remaining £1.2m payable by Silverspin Media Limited, 
settled by way of waiving the final earn out payment to the previous shareholders of Blueburra Holding Limited. Chris Phillips and Scott 
Logan, shareholders of Silverspin Media, and were Directors of the Company’s subsidiaries Blueburra Holdings Limited and Digital Blue

prevailing price of the ordinary shares and will therefore have no value unless the value of the new ordinary shares exceeds 20 pence. EMI options can only be 
granted to employees who meet the statutory working time requirement, and cannot normally be exercised before 15 July 2015. All options granted under the 
New Share Option Scheme on Admission will be exercisable over B Shares at their nominal value of £0.01 and will be capable of exercise, subject to certain 
exceptions, after two years of the date of grant.

Changes in tax rates and factors affecting the future tax charge
On 15 September 2016, the Finance Act received Royal Assent and so the previous rate of corporation tax of 20% was enacted from 
1 April 2016. Accordingly, deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2016 have been recognised at 20% (2015: 20%).
The Chancellor has further stated his intention to reduce the main rate of incorporation to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 
1 April 2020. These changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. This will have the effect of reducing 
the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly.
There are unused tax losses carried forward as at the balance sheet date of £31,365,784 (2015: £27,278,988) equating to an 
unrecognised deferred tax asset of £6,273,157 (2015: £5,455,798). No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these 
losses, as the recoverability of any asset is dependent upon sufficient profits being achieved in future years to utilise this asset. 
The timings of such profits are uncertain.

13. l oss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares 
in issue during the year. For fully diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group’s potentially dilutive securities consist of share options and performance 
shares. As the Group is loss-making, none of the potentially dilutive securities (see note 24) are currently dilutive.

Goodwill
During the year, the Group acquired 62.5% of the share capital of Hullabu Inc resulting in addition to goodwill of £75,413 (see note 25).
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets. A detailed review was undertaken at 
31 December 2016 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by net present value of futures cash flows derived from 
those assets. The Group has three cash generating unit for which the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated. The recoverable amounts 
to which the goodwill is allocated has been determined using a value in use calculation. The calculation of value in use is based on 
several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player lifetime values and experience.
Cash flow projections have been prepared for a five-year period following which a long term growth rate of 2% (2015: 2%) has been 
assumed. A discount rate of 25% (2015: 25%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows, is based on the Group’s specific 
risk adjusted Weighted Average Cost of Capital. 
38 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The key assumptions of the forecasts were as follows:
 > number of new player depositing registrations;
 > rate of retention of existing players;
 > spending patterns of players;
 > CPA or installs from different acquisition sources;
The above assumptions are based on the trends noted to date, industry standard measurements and management’s experience. 
The Directors do not believe any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would lead to an impairment of the carrying 
amount of the CGus. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the CGus as follows:

20. Financial instruments and risk management – group
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. The Group does not make any use 
of derivative financial instruments. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are shown on the face of the consolidated statement of 
financial position and in the table below and they can be classified wholly as either loans and receivables, other assets or other liabilities. 
The Group has operated with a positive cash balance throughout the year.

Financial assets of the Group are classified as loans and receivables and all financial liabilities are held at amortised cost except 
contingent consideration which is recognised at fair value through profit and loss. In the Directors’ opinion, there is no material 
difference between the book value and the fair value of any of the financial instruments.
The Group has some exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. There has been no material change to the financial instruments used within 
the business during the year except for contingent consideration and therefore no material changes to the risk management policies put 
in place by the Board which are now discussed below.
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies. Whilst acknowledging 
this responsibility, it has delegated the authority and day to day responsibility for designing and operating systems and controls which 
meet these risk management objectives to the finance and administration function. The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of 
these processes in meeting its objectives and considers any necessary changes in response to changes within the business or the 
environment in which it operates.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on translation and on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Pounds 
Sterling (GBP). The currency in which these transactions are primarily denominated is uS Dollars (uSD).
The Group’s policy is, where possible to allow group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash 
generated from their own operations in that currency. Where group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their 
functional currency cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere in the Group.

Other (3,881) 2,456 – – – –
total (2,710,683) (4,222,786) – – 41,322 20,054
The effect of a 20% strengthening of the uS Dollar against Sterling at the reporting date on the uS Dollar denominated payables carried 
at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in losses after date and decrease of net assets of 
£542,137 (2015: £844,557). A 20% weakening in the exchange rate would, on same basis decrease loss after tax and increase net assets 
by £542,137 (2015: £844,557).
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. Customer 
funds are kept in dedicated client accounts, separately from the Group’s operational bank accounts.

The fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The inputs are 
categorised into three levels, with the highest level (level 1) given to inputs for which there are unadjusted quoted prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level (level 3) given to unobservable inputs. Level 2 inputs are directly or 
indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices. Contingent consideration is recognised as managements best estimate of the 
amounts ultimately to be settled, based on probability settlement. The liability was settled at £2,400,000.
Capital management
The Group is funded entirely through shareholders’ funds.
If financing is required, the Board will consider whether debt or equity financing is more appropriate and proceed accordingly.

Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan
On 1 August 2013 the Company adopted the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan to allow, at the discretion of the Board, any eligible employee 
to be granted EMI or non-EMI qualified options at an exercise price to be determined by the Board but not to be less than the nominal value 
of a share and will vest subject to such time based and share price performance based conditions as the Board may determine. 
Options to acquire ordinary shares under the EMI plan may be granted up to a maximum of £3,000,000 (based on the market value 
of the shares placed under option at the date of the grant).
No consideration is payable for the grant to of the option and the options are not transferable or assignable. Cash consideration is 
paid to the Company by the employee at the point that the share options are exercised. 
In 2013, the Company granted options for B Shares under the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI plan. B Share value will be 20 pence less 
than the prevailing price of the ordinary shares and will therefore have no value unless the value of the new ordinary shares exceeds 
20 pence. EMI options can only be granted to employees who meet the statutory working time requirement, and cannot normally be 
exercised before 15 July 2015. All options granted under the New Share Option Scheme on Admission will be exercisable over B Shares 
at their nominal value of £0.01 and will be capable of exercise, subject to certain exceptions, after two years of the date of grant.
Options are not exercisable later than midnight on the day before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options were fair valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, or where there are market-based performance conditions, 
a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s competitors in the sector.
The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of options granted during the year under the equity-settled 
share based remuneration schemes operated by the Group.

50 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 nOt es t O the parent c Ompany Financial statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016
1. principal accounting policies
These financial statements present the results of Gaming Realms plc for the year ended 31 December 2016.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101). 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. No profit and loss account is presented by the Company 
as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling. 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2016. 
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
a)  IFRS 2 Share-based Payment disclosure, the share-based payment arrangement concerns its own equity instruments and its separate 
financial statements are presented alongside the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
b) IFRS 7 Financial Instruments disclosures, given that equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group in which the entity is consolidated. 
c)  IFRS 13 Fair value Measurement disclosures. 
d)  Certain disclosures required by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, including certain comparative information in respect of 
share capital movements.
e)  IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and related notes. 
f)  IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures relating to key management personnel compensation. 
g)  IAS 24 Disclosure of related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, given that any subsidiary 
which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value, except for investments acquired before 1 October 
2013 where shares issued to effect business combinations and the conditions of the Companies Act 2006 are met, merger relief was 
applied and the resulting investment is recorded at the nominal value of the shares issued.
Taxation
Current tax, including uK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and 
from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

1. principal accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the initial transaction is included as an exchange gain 
or loss in the profit and loss account, except where financing of a foreign subsidiary through long-term loans is intended to be as 
permanent as equity. Such balances are treated as part of the net investment and any exchange differences are recorded in reserves.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of deferred and contingent consideration, customer funds, trade payables and other 
short-term monetary liabilities. 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument 
and with the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, subsequently recognised at amortised cost. Contingent consideration 
arising from business combinations that is classified as liability is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. Deferred 
consideration arising from business combinations is recognised at present value and unwound over the period until settlement.

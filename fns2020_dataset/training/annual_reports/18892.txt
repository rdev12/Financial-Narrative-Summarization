New build jackup rigs
Lamprell has some of the 
world’s leading facilities for 
the construction of new build 
jackup drilling rigs. With a 
sophisticated engineering 
capability and state-of-the-
art construction and load out 
facilities, Lamprell has rapidly 
gained a reputation as a 
leading and reliable builder of 
drilling rigs for the international 
market. In May 2015 the 
Group successfully delivered 
its 27th jackup rig since its 
listing in 2006, comprising of 
14 LeTourneau Super 116E’s, 
seven Friede & Goldman Super 
M2’s and six multi-purpose 
GustoMSC vessels. 
Offshore platforms 
Lamprell has successfully 
undertaken a variety of 
offshore new build construction 
projects for the oil & gas 
industry . We construct complex 
living quarters, wellhead 
decks, topsides, jackets and 
various other offshore fixed 
facilities including modules 
and topsides for FPSO/FPU 
projects. In 2014 Lamprell  
was recognised by Guinness 
World Records for moving  
the heaviest load on trailers 
from its Jebel Ali facility . 
This was for the load out 
of the production, utilities 
and quarters deck destined 
for the Golden Eagle Area 
Development in the North Sea. 
Modules 
Lamprell fabricates 
packaged, pre-assembled 
and modularised units and 
has expertise constructing 
accommodation and complex 
process modules for onshore 
downstream projects. We are 
also looking to expand into 
modularised LNG. Lamprell’s 
modular fabrication activities 
offer a number of advantages 
over conventional construction. 
Fabrication and assembly are 
performed at our modernised 
facilities allowing us to ensure 
that all work is executed 
productively in accordance 
with our industry-leading safety 
and quality standards. 
Oil & gas contracting services 
Oil & gas contracting services 
consists of our four smaller

FUTURE 
GROWTH 
THROUGH 
RESILIENCE 
Challenging market backdrop 
Contrary to the predictions of many  
market participants, oil prices continued 
to slide throughout 2015. Oil & gas 
companies around the world reacted by 
gradual, and in some cases drastic, cuts  
to their capital expenditure. 
Lamprell is not immune to the oil sector 
headwinds but we are pleased to report 
on our demonstrated ability to withstand 
these challenges. Along with other energy 
industry contractors, we have seen delays 
in contract awards but we have taken steps 
to adapt by changing our approach to new 
business development. 
Maintaining a competitive position
In difficult times, companies often make  
the mistake of losing focus on their long-
term goals. Lamprell’s strong position 
allowed us to withstand the storm without 
compromising our future growth plans. 
We managed to remain competitive and 
continue to implement our strategy .
Similar to most of our peers, our pipeline 
conversion  page 8 was affected 
by project delays and cancellations. 
Nevertheless our bid-to-win ratio remained 
healthy by industry standards and this is 
an important factor indicating Lamprell’s 
strong competitive position. It gives comfort 
about our ability to recover from the difficult 
contracting environment. 
We also judge our strength by our  
ability to compete without undermining 
Lamprell’s financial performance or 
commercial position  page 20. In the 
context of increased pricing pressure, 
where numerous market players saw 
gradual margin erosion, we have been  
able to remain profitable. The gains 
delivered through Project Evolution  
 page 12 allowed us to protect our 
normalised margins whilst enabling  
us to offer attractive propositions in  
a tough market. 
This business flexibility and our strong 
client relationships have helped us maintain 
leadership in the jackup market, with a 
win of the ninth rig from National Drilling 
Company (“NDC”), one of only three 
jackup rig orders placed worldwide  
in 2015  page 25. 
Focus on the future
Whilst we are taking steps to ensure we 
successfully weather the current storm 
in the sector , we anticipate a recovery in 
the energy markets, as do most industry 
experts, and so we are also continuing 
to focus on our future. We have reviewed 
our strategy  page 14 for robustness, 
redirecting our marketing efforts from 
slower international regions around the 
world to the Middle East where we can 
leverage our position of strength. 
All 2015  
Board  
priorities  
achieved
2015 was an undeniably 
challenging year for our 
industry . We are proud  
that Lamprell was able to 
show resilience in a tough 
market environment and  
lay the groundwork for  
long-term growth.  Strategic report: Executive Chairman’s statement 5
As a Board, we have also spent 
considerable time assessing our  
medium-term positioning in the market  
and potential sources of growth for 
Lamprell. With this in mind, we have 
identified strategic partnerships as a 
potential route to a step-change in the 
scale of projects to target. In line with 
this plan, in January 2016 we announced 
a Memorandum of Understanding with 
Saudi Aramco, Bahri and Hyundai Heavy 
Industries regarding a potential partnership 
for collaboration on the Maritime Complex 
in Saudi Arabia. The discussions are still  
at an early stage, but this could become  
a sizeable business opportunity for 
Lamprell. I took on the responsibility 
of Executive Chairman to identify 
opportunities for strategic initiatives and 
other means to grow the business in an 
outward facing role. Our work on potential 
alliances continues, and we will update our 
shareholders on progress as appropriate. 
Strong Board 
In this endeavour , I have benefited from 
the support of a strong Board  page 36. 
Following the departure of Michael Press 
and the passing of Peter Whitbread  
during 2015, Lamprell has enhanced the 
Board’s independence and composition 
with the addition of two Directors with 
impressive experience and with Ellis 
Armstrong’s appointment as Senior 
Independent Director . Debra Valentine 
brings significant industry knowledge 
coupled with expertise in corporate 
transactions. Mel Fitzgerald is  
a seasoned executive with 30 years  
of industry experience. It was also  
pleasing to promote from within, with  
the appointment of Tony Wright to the 
Board in the role of Chief Financial  
Officer  page 20.
Lamprell’s Board will be completed with  
the recruitment of a new CEO following  
Jim Moffat’s announced retirement from the 
full-time CEO position in 2016. Lamprell will 
continue to benefit from Jim’s expertise for 
a year following his retirement but I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank him 
and the wider senior management team  
for their dedication and drive to secure  
a strong future for the Group.
I would also like to thank our shareholders 
for their support through these challenging 
times. The Board will continue to work 
tirelessly to deliver the strategy  page 14, 
firm in our belief in Lamprell’s future.

KPI Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report: Chief Executive’s review 6
Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Q How would you describe 2015  
for Lamprell? 
2015 will certainly be remembered as 
a difficult year for the industry, but for 
Lamprell it was an important turning point. 
After a year of recovery in 2013 and the 
exceptional performance in 2014, this 
year has shown the underlying robustness 
of Lamprell’s business with its ability to 
be flexible and adapt to the changing 
environment. In 2015 we demonstrated 
that Lamprell is resilient enough to return 
to normalised performance, even in the 
context of a challenging market.
Q What is your assessment of 
Lamprell’s performance in 2015?
Overall, our performance across the key 
metrics was strong. We focussed on the 
elements under our control, which allowed 
us to manage the impact of the external 
environment. Operationally, we have 
done well, delivering three major projects 
on time, on budget and to high safety 
and quality standards. We have seen an 
extension in scope of the project we are 
fabricating for Petrofac, a testament to 
our performance. Our yards remained full 
throughout the second half of the year .
The strength of our client relationships is 
a key driver of our performance, and we 
continued to develop these through our 
collaborative approach. Having awarded 
Lamprell the ninth jackup rig  pages 24 
and 25, NDC subsequently extended its 
options with Lamprell. We also offered 
the service of stacking client rigs in our 
facilities  page 27 in the spirit of current 
and future cooperation.
Our safety record throughout the year  
was steady with a TRIR of around 0.3. 
The Jebel Ali and Dubai facilities achieved 
a major milestone having now operated 
for three years without a day away from 
work case (DAFWC). We have set new 
improvement goals and are looking at 
new ways to strengthen the safety culture 
further within the workforce and prevent all 
avoidable incidents  page 30.
We have also significantly improved our 
efficiency and productivity in the yards.  
The implementation of Project Evolution  
 page 12 was almost entirely completed 
by the end of the year , with a new panel 
line  page 24 fully operational and with 
significant improvements in automation. 
After a year of exceptional 
financial results in 2014, 
Lamprell has maintained 
a steady operational 
performance and built 
on the strong business 
position towards long-term 
growth. The focus is now on 
executing our strategy .
BUILDING  
ON OUR 
STRONG 
FOUNDATIONS Q When are you expecting to see the 
benefits of Project Evolution? 
We started to see the benefits in terms 
of productivity almost immediately upon 
completion of each component of the 
project. As you would expect with the 
introduction of new equipment and training 
requirements, some of the initiatives took 
time to ramp up to their full rate but we 
have benefited from the improvements 
throughout the year . 
For example, welding  page 26, 
which constitutes a major component 
in fabrication with approximately 30% 
of manhours, has seen a dramatic 
improvement as we modernised our 
processes. The beam cutting robots cut 
beams to exact size multiple times faster 
and more accurately than a human can. 
We have optimised painting, crane and 
scaffolding services, as well as our use  
of yard space and assets  page 34. 
As a result, we have been able to 
accommodate the construction of seven 
concurrent jackup rigs  page 25 in our 
Hamriyah yard, a record for the Group. 
Q What are the financial benefits of 
these improvements?
When we announced Project Evolution, 
we explained that we expect full payback 
within three to four years. While this remains 
appropriate guidance, we delivered better 
savings than first anticipated in 2015. The 
savings and efficiencies generated by 
Project Evolution  page 12 allowed us 
to protect our margins whilst at the same 
time remaining competitive in a market with 
increased pricing pressure. With the recent 
appointment of Niall O’Connell as COO, 
a strong focus will be on driving these 
operational improvements even further . 
Q What were the main challenges you 
encountered and how did you adapt  
to face them?
As drilling programmes started to be 
scaled back in response to weak oil prices, 
the pace of the contract awards slowed 
down the whole supply chain. Along with 
our peers, we suffered from this which is 
reflected in the lack of major awards during 
the second half of the year . 
In response, we have continued to improve 
our approach to business development 
and, specifically, we dynamically adapted 
the composition of our bid pipeline  
 page 8 throughout the year to address 
the changing circumstances. When our 
target projects moved to the right, we 
regularly reassessed their likelihood of 
sanction or proactively replaced them with 
new bids more likely to be awarded in the 
near future. In practice, this was driven by 
a conscious shift away from the quieter 
international markets to more buoyant 
regional markets such as the Middle East 
which maintains higher activity levels  
in the current environment. 
This approach allowed us to mitigate 
the risk  page 16 of adverse impact 
in areas where we have control, but of 
course Lamprell cannot resist the market 
dynamics. While bidding activity levels are 
high, we continue to be affected by the 
industry-wide trend of projects drifting  
to the right.
Q What are your predictions for 2016?
The strong foundations laid over the last 
18 months have created a structure for us 
to be competitive and deliver operational 
excellence consistently . With our ongoing 
bidding efforts, we expect to be able to
persevere through the downturn and then 
emerge from it in a position for growth to 
deliver our strategy  page 14.
In our drive to expand our offering, we 
also built our first land rig of Lamprell’s 
proprietary design  page 27, which we 
started marketing towards the end of the 
year . We believe it will be an attractive 
product for Middle East clients, having 
been specifically designed for the region.
We believe our ability to win large projects 
could be enhanced by forming strategic 
alliances. In early 2016 we signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding regarding 
Lamprell’s potential participation in the
Maritime Complex in eastern Saudi Arabia. 
We will continue to scrutinise the market  
for other value-added alliances.
There is a lot of uncertainty in the current 
markets but Lamprell’s focus for 2016  
is on demonstrating resilience and its 
ability to progress towards future growth 
despite the industry challenges. We are 
confident in our ability to deliver on our 
strategy  page 14.

WE ARE A KEY PLAYER
IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKET
Following Lamprell’s 
record performance in 
2014, this year presented 
new challenges. However , 
challenges that test some 
organisations will create 
opportunities for others. 
Despite falling oil prices 
and slowing demand, our 
2015 bid pipeline remained 
strong. We aim to weather 
the downturn and are 
currently in a strong position 
for the anticipated recovery 
as the world’s energy 
demand is expected to 
continue its rise of around 
0.8% each year over the  
next 20 years

Macroeconomic factors and strategy
Amid the continued oil price depression, 
there continues to be a strong discipline 
around any E&P spend and new 
high profile developments are closely 
scrutinised. This has had an impact on 
project awards in 2015. However , the 
impact for Lamprell is mitigated to some 
extent by our expertise and focus which 
primarily lie in the conventional and shallow 
water activities. 
While long-term industry fundamentals 
remain strong with capex forecast to 
recover by 2020, the shorter-term capex 
for the upstream oil & gas industry is set to 
drop by a further 20% from 2015 capex
2
 
levels. Major oil companies also continue 
to delay final investment decisions due to 
cash flow affordability and less favourable 
project economics caused by current low 
energy prices. 
Offsetting this, the conventional shallow 
water in the Middle East region where  
most production costs are viable at levels 
below USD 30/bbl
3
 remains attractive  
with continued investment forecast over  
the next five years. Led by Saudi Arabia 
and Iran (post sanctions), the Middle East 
is pressing ahead with major oil & gas 
development projects. By leveraging  
our strong reputation and regional 
presence, Lamprell expects to win our 
share of these opportunities although 
we recognise that competition for such 
projects has intensified. 
Our business opportunities
We continue to diversify our bid pipeline 
portfolio across our market sectors  
and via a broader geographic footprint. 
This has strengthened our bid pipeline, 
which as at 31 December 2015 totalled 
USD 5.4 billion. With a win rate slightly 
over 30% in 2015, we continue to focus on 
converting the pipeline to contract awards. 
However , numerous projects have been 
cancelled or deferred. Consistent with our 
2015 refined corporate strategy  page 14 
we are proactively sourcing opportunities 
through diversification across markets. 
The emphasis will be to target sizeable 
opportunities through strategic alliances 
and partnerships. We recently announced  
a Memorandum of Understanding regarding 
Lamprell’s potential participation in the 
Maritime Complex in Saudi Arabia. We have 
also agreed to work with Dubai Drydocks 
to identify opportunities for cooperation on 
FPSO projects in the context of Dubai’s 
aspiration to become a strategic location  
for FPSU/FPSO.

New build jackup rigs
While the global jackup drilling 
fleet has seen a significant 
increase over the past seven 
years through aggressive build 
programmes by major drilling 
operators and speculators, 
worldwide jackup utilisation 
decreased to 67.4% at 
December 2015 versus 
83.5% at December 2014. 
Despite the current oversupply 
of jackup rigs, the market 
specifically in the Middle East 
is still promising as NOCs 
invest billions of dollars into 
redeveloping maturing fields. 
A forecast 4% CAGR rise in 
shallow water drilling over the 
next six years in the Middle 
East should compensate for 
some of this decline
4
, with 
the slowdown in new orders 
expected to continue until 
the oversupply of rigs is re-
balanced. Meanwhile, Lamprell 
has a proven capability of 
bidding competitively against 
international bidders. Of 
the three rig orders in 2015, 
Lamprell received one new 
order from an established 
drilling contractor . 
Offshore platforms 
Fixed offshore platform 
demand in the medium term is 
anticipated to remain resilient 
due to the lower sanction 
point generally required for 
shallow water as opposed 
to deep water floating 
developments. The Middle East 
region, notably Saudi Arabia, 
Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Iran, 
remains highly attractive in 
this environment. The long-
term fundamentals remain in 
place despite the near-term 
uncertainty in this sector . 
With the projected growth of 
deep water developments 
in the longer time frame, 
FPSOs are expected to be the 
preferred solution among the 
floating production concepts, 
as fixed platforms become 
technically challenging and 
cost prohibitive. With Lamprell’s 
geographical location, cost 
competitiveness and proven 
track record of world-class 
project delivery, we are well 
positioned to re-enter this 
potential growth market  
as the industry recovers. 
Modules
Despite the expected softening 
in spend due to recent over-
supply in refining capacity 
in the downstream market, 
significant investment is 
continuing in the Middle East 
and hence this remains a key 
region for Lamprell where the 
Group is strategically located. 
Investment is divided with circa 
50% on upgrades to existing 
refineries and the remainder 
split between maintaining 
existing facilities and greenfield 
projects
5
. We increased our 
volumes of modular work 
in 2015, demonstrating our 
capabilities in this area, and 
continue to actively pursue 
opportunities in all onshore 
module markets. The long-term 
outlook for the LNG industry 
remains positive as vast 
reserves of natural gas are 
being discovered in developing 
regions such as East Africa. 
Investment in LNG facilities 
has increased in recent years 
as global demand is trending 
towards natural gas, a fuel 
considered to be cheaper and 
more environmental friendly 
as highlighted at the COP21 
climate conference in 2015.
Oil & gas contracting services 
Although drilling activity is 
subdued by current oil price 
forecasts, we expect there to 
be continued activity in the 
Middle East market for jackup 
rig refurbishment services as 
the aging rig population often 
requires regular maintenance 
or upgrades. This business 
stream also includes site 
works, pressure vessels, 
static equipment and general 
fabrication works, all of 
which are required to operate 
regional facilities, and are core 
competencies of Lamprell. 
There is a relatively modest 
outlook forecast for the global 
land rig market until 2019, 
however the global rig count will 
need to expand in order to meet 
projected drilling demand

Even in today’s difficult 
market, Lamprell aspires 
to deliver predictable, 
sustainable and profitable 
growth through leading 
operational performance, 
strong management and a 
robust strategy that builds 
on our key strengths.
Our business model is structured around 
a risk-based assessment  page 16 of 
opportunities to meet the demand for 
fabrication, engineering and contracting 
services in the offshore and onshore oil 
& gas and renewable energy industries. 
Difficult times call for fresh thinking, and 
that is what we have done. In 2014 we 
looked at our key strengths, our prospects, 
the markets in which we operate and our 
competitive advantages and we asked 
ourselves: what will it take to win in today’s 
business climate? Following a detailed 
review performed in 2015, our refined 
strategy  page 14 addresses a more 
diversified market in terms of both product 
offerings and geography by recognising 
the current downturn but targeting medium 
to long-term growth.
Creating long-term value
We are focussing on creating long-term 
shareholder value by reinforcing our 
position in the Middle East as a leading 
fabricator . This has enabled Lamprell to

How our strengths  
add value
First class safety and quality
Lamprell has a strong commitment to 
continuously improving the safety and 
quality performance of our employees and 
contractors. These are a prerequisite with 
any potential top tier client.
Reliability
Lamprell has a proven reputation for quality 
standards and the delivery of competitive 
products. We have a strong track record in 
our core markets for completing projects on 
time, to specification and on budget. This 
has enabled us to diversify our pipeline. 
Client satisfaction
Lamprell is committed to customer service 
and close client relationships throughout 
the project life cycle. This has resulted in 
strong support from our major clients and  
a strong record of repeat business.
Skilled workforce
Lamprell has a strong leadership team 
focused on delivering the Company’s 
refined strategy . We value our highly skilled, 
dedicated and flexible workforce and invest 
in their continued development to ensure 
excellent project performance. Our access 
to a highly skilled, low cost workforce from 
Asia supports a competitive cost structure.
Strategic location
Lamprell is advantageously located and 
has excellent facilities including over 
1,000,000m
2
 of fabrication space and  
2km of deep water quayside access. 
We are 
committed to 
safety, quality 
and reliability
At Lamprell, 
everything we do is built 
on the strong foundations 
created by our core values.  
Just as our beliefs guide us in our  
day-to-day operations, they also provide 
the framework to guide our growth. 
Safety
We deliver world-class safety standards and leave 
nothing to chance, so everyone goes home safely .
Fiscal responsibility
Because every employee influences our costs, we 
are all accountable to ensure that we achieve the 
most cost-effective solutions.
Integrity
We conduct our business honestly , with professional 
integrity, fairly and transparently , and we are open 
and ethical in our day-to-day dealings with all 
stakeholders.
Accountability
We deliver what we say we will.
Teamwork
We strive to work together with our 
stakeholders and believe great teams  
can achieve incredible things. Time management

Strategic report: Project Evolution 12
Achievements 
We established a dedicated team which 
was tasked with investigating our current 
systems, execution and production 
processes and material handling 
techniques, to identify improvement 
opportunities that would reduce the  
costs of our operations and enhance 
product delivery . Ultimately the aim of this 
project was to make us safer and more 
competitive which, in turn, would help us 
diversify and convert our bid pipeline. 
Initially 24 opportunities for improvement 
were identified over the duration of the 
project. Part of the capital raised in the 
rights issue in 2014 was dedicated to 
Project Evolution. The Group expended 
part of this investment on upgrading 
and modernising equipment and work 
areas, warehouses, and adding major 
construction systems such as a new 
panel line in the Hamriyah facility . The new 
fabrication building housing the panel line 
 page 24 and supporting machinery were 
safely installed on a fast track basis within 
ten months, an impressive achievement 
for the Group. The panel line was officially 
launched in 2015 and by the end of the 
year was operating at full run-rate. We have 
seen returns on this investment as benefits 
are being achieved on all major projects. 
An integral part of the measures 
implemented was the investment in 
automation around parts of our facilities, 
and we have installed a variety of new 
equipment. Upgraded and new working 
areas, new cranes, robotic cutting 
machines and an automatic beam 
fabrication system have all been installed 
in order to increase the level of automation 
and reduce construction times. In addition, 
strategic procurement processes and 
systems have been implemented in order  
to deliver synergies and economies of 
scale on major projects, which has also 
resulted in significant savings for the Group.
How this helps our business
While Lamprell is not immune to the 
ongoing headwinds in the energy sector , 
we were pleased to see that our early 
implementation of the efficiency measures 
under Project Evolution positioned the 
Group to be more competitive which 
will consequently be key to our future 
success. Using an optimised blend of 
automation and low cost labour , Lamprell 
will continue to deliver a safe and high 
quality product at the best value to its 
clients following completion of the Project 
Evolution measures. Our yards have been 
modernised, our systems and processes 
are more efficient, our workforce is well 
trained and operates to high standards,  
all of which in turn helps us to win  
new projects.

Strategic report: Strategy 14
Our strategy is based on 
our fabrication capabilities 
where our Middle Eastern 
geographical location, 
low cost labour and state-
of-the-art facilities are 
fundamental differentiators, 
and is structured around 
product lines with the 
highest potential to grow the 
business going forward. 
During 2015 we reviewed the global 
market outlook, analysed our product line 
and weighed our strengths. We evaluated 
the immediate and future needs of our 
customers around the globe, exploring 
potential opportunities in new business 
segments and geographies and assessed 
the alignment between our capabilities 
and differentiators against those needs. 
The strategy was initially developed as 
part of the 2014 rights issue but had to 
be reviewed in light of the current market 
conditions. We asked ourselves: where 
are our best opportunities for delivering 
profitable growth in the long term? 
Corporate strategy statement
By 2020 Lamprell aims to be a leading 
global fabrication and EPC service 
provider of jackup rigs, offshore platforms, 
onshore modular solutions and FPSO 
structures consistently delivering safe, 
high quality , competitive, on time solutions 
to our customers while providing steady 
growth and predictable returns for our 
shareholders. This will be achieved by

AN ENHANCED 
APPROACH 
TO RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
Continuing an active risk management 
approach 
We believe that early identification and 
appropriate management of risk is vital to 
the success of the Group. With this ethos in 
mind, we continue to regularly and actively 
identify and manage risk profiles across 
each business area in the organisation, 
both at the project and enterprise level. 
Our current risk management framework, 
which was developed in 2014, remains 
highly effective and fit for purpose. All 
risks are ranked taking into account both 
impact assessment and probability, and 
on a gross (pre-mitigation) and net (post-
mitigation) basis. Following such ranking, 
appropriate risk management plans are 
developed, with defined mitigation plans 
and allocated risk owners. We have a 
Risk Review Panel, comprising of senior 
management, which meets regularly to 
review and challenge risk management 
plans. Through the Panel, increased 
focus is now being placed on risk owners 
tasked with monitoring the effectiveness 
of mitigations being implemented.
A focus on Enterprise Risk Management 
(“ERM”)
Our plan to identify and manage Enterprise 
Risks is structured in a similar way to the 
way in which we address project risks. 
Management has worked with the Audit & 
Risk Committee on behalf of the Board to 
implement an ERM system which identifies, 
documents and reports on progress to 
manage Enterprise Risks. 
Our database is used to: 
 » Ensure risk management processes are 
effective and key risks are evaluated on 
a fully-unmitigated basis, and risk action 
plans are put in place. 
 » Improve focus and perspective on risk 
providing a basis for discussion and 
benchmarking through regular meetings.
 » Provide Internal Audit with risk 
information on a quarterly basis in order 
to audit, monitor and generate Internal 
Audit’s annual cycle.
 » Provide the basis of the bi-annual 
review of our key risks by our Audit & 
Risk Committee, which reports back  
to the Board.
Principal risks and uncertainties  
for Lamprell
Lamprell faces a variety of risks in 
connection with its business and these may 
change from year to year depending on 
both external and internal circumstances. 
By way of example, our Board proactively 
decided to escalate the risk ranking for 
geopolitical security as a result of the 
heightened threat from terrorism and the 
fact that, in recent years, some of the 
Company’s Board meetings have been 
held in Paris. 
The Board considers that the principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group

Macroeconomic  
conditions 
With the continuing energy  
market downturn, demand for the 
Group’s products and services 
may be adversely impacted by  
a fall in the levels of expenditure 
by oil & gas and renewable  
energy companies.
 » Regular market reports identify projects which are expected to be 
sanctioned within Lamprell’s addressable markets.
 » Strategy refined to focus on broadening our addressable markets 
and our client base to target sectors and geographical markets 
which offer most potential for growth. 
 » Activities to implement strategic objectives under way . 
 » Bid pipeline  page 8 continues to be strong with a year-end value 
of USD 5.4 billion.
 » Use of a Client Relationship Management system to provide real 
time information on opportunities and key contacts.
Single product line
 
From 2012 to 2015, the proportion 
of Lamprell’s revenues deriving 
from new build LeTourneau-
designed jackup rigs increased 
year-on-year and that trend is 
expected to continue in 2016. 
This places heavy reliance on 
continuing demand for that 
single product line which may 
be exacerbated in 2016 if 
the proposed acquisition of 
the LeTourneau rig design is 
completed by a competitor of  
the Company . 
 » Strategy focussed on diversification of business streams away  
from new build LeTourneau-designed jackup rigs. 
 » Bid pipeline has a heavy weighting towards Offshore Platforms  
and Modules  page 9. 
 » Target strategic alliances to enable access to additional sectors.
 » Lamprell offers construction of alternative rig designs and is 
considering designing a state-of-the-art shallow water jackup rig 
having taken into account client feedback.
 » Anticipated slowdown in the jackup rig market demands a keener 
focus on non-rig sectors.

Risk description Business implication Mitigation
Winning new work 
The Group is dependent on 
a relatively small number of 
contracts at any given time, 
some of which are for the same 
customers, and strong client 
relationships are critical for a 
sustainable business. The industry 
is highly competitive and Lamprell 
is dependent on its ability to 
provide on time, high quality 
products and services at low cost.
 » Focus on delivering high quality products and services provides 
robust platform for repeat business.
 » Each business stream within our strategy has clear objectives and 
business development goals set by reference to target projects. 
 » Client account management structure ensures that good, effective 
client relationships are maintained.
 » Productivity improvements and cost efficiencies have been fully 
implemented to enhance Lamprell’s ability to compete.
 » Other activities such as a new pipe shop will target additional areas 
to drive down cost.
Geopolitical 
Given the increased global threat 
from war , civil unrest and in 
particular terrorism, the Group’s 
operations and business could be 
materially disrupted in the case 
of such an event directly affecting 
one of our operations or any of  
our key business activities such  
as Board meetings.
 » Limited remote location operations with the vast proportion of the 
Group’s operations taking place in the United Arab Emirates, which 
is stable politically and financially .
 » Group security policies and procedures updated with closer 
monitoring of travel.
 » Board meetings held primarily in the UAE.
 » Contracts include force majeure provisions as standard.
 » No material impact of EU referendum outcome on the business.
Financial risks
Financial  
disclosure 
The Group’s visible order book 
may fluctuate significantly because 
the majority of the contracts are 
structured as fixed-duration, lump 
sum projects or else as short-
term rig refurbishment projects. 
In addition, varying project cycles 
mean that revenues can be ‘lumpy’ 
making it more difficult to predict 
with certainty the future long-term 
financial condition of the Group. 
 » Proven, reliable project execution led by experienced management 
team creates predictable financial outcomes.
 » New ERP system completed  page 22, ensuring predictable and 
timely financial reporting.
 » Lamprell has a range of contract types from lump sum projects, 
framework/call-off contracts through to unit rate reimbursable 
projects.
 » Strategy refined to focus on broadening addressable markets and 
client base.
 » Regular project review meetings feed into monthly Board reports.
Counterparty  
credit risk 
Lamprell sells its products and 
services to, and also procures 
goods and services from, a variety 
of contractual counterparties 
and could therefore be subject to 
counterparty credit risk, either with 
clients, subcontractors or business 
partners. Failure by any of these 
entities to make payment may 
result in Lamprell suffering losses 
or reduced revenues.
 » Credit checks are conducted internally and through expert  
third party providers for new counterparties or in support  
of major contracts.
 » Bonds/guarantees backed by reputable financial institutions may 
be requested prior to contractual relationships being formalised. 
 » Payment terms under contract are carefully managed.
 » Protection against non-payment is built into contractual 
documentation to ensure that the Group has a right of remedy  
in the event of delayed/non-payment. 
 » Project debt facility only available for use by top tier clients,  
per lender requirements.

Compliance and legal risks
Risk description Business implication Mitigation
Contractual  
commitments  
Lamprell may be subject to 
onerous contractual terms 
for product defects, faulty 
workmanship or errors in design 
which could impact revenue or 
earnings as a result of breach or 
non-performance. With the Group’s 
increased involvement in joint 
ventures, a failure to determine 
appropriately the liabilities 
between the parties could expose 
the Group to additional risks.
 » Potential contract risks assessed at the outset following a full risk 
review, with mitigation plans created.
 » Robust training and inspection programmes implemented across 
all facilities and projects.
 » Lessons learned on earlier projects used to design work scopes, 
thus ensuring continual improvement in project execution.
 » Appropriate contract terms ensure that the Group’s risk exposure  
is acceptable and risks may be passed to subcontracting parties 
or covered by contingency, as appropriate.
 » External advisory experts are engaged, as required. 
Operational risks
Information 
management 
systems and  
cyber risks  
The Group relies heavily on 
information technology systems, 
including crucial business 
management software and our 
enterprise resources planning 
systems, which may fail to 
operate effectively or be subject 
to disruption or cyber attacks. In 
such event, the activities of the 
Group may be severely disrupted 
and, subsequently, operations may 
be adversely affected. 
 » Employee cyber security training and awareness campaigns are 
undertaken regularly .
 » We have adopted the ISO 27001 Information Security Management 
System (ISMS) standard across our business.
 » Disaster recovery plans and procedures are in place and have 
been tested in a simulated environment to ensure adequacy . 
 » Third party experts undertake penetration exercises to test 
adequacy of IT security .

The Group has incurred significant 
expenditure as part of its yard 
investment programme under 
Project Evolution  page 12. 
Although thorough analysis of the 
requirement for such investment 
has been undertaken, such 
investments may not yield the 
targeted savings and efficiency 
improvements in practice, either 
because of the changing market 
environment or due to other 
unforeseen events. 
 » Embedded culture of continuous improvement and transparency 
demonstrated on all projects and on investment programme.
 » All Project Evolution measures completed on time and on budget, 
with many operating at full run rate already .

Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 revision of the Code and taking into 
account the Group’s principal risks, the 
Directors have assessed the prospect of 
the Company over a longer period than the 
12 months required by the ‘Going Concern’ 
provision. The Board conducted this 
review for a period of three years, which 
was selected for the following reasons: 
(i) the Group’s strategic review covers a 
period with visibility on projects extending 
out for at least two years; (ii) most major 
projects undertaken by the Group last for 
a period of approximately two years; and 
(iii) the Company has a reasonable ability 
to project its likely backlog for a period of 
between two and three years.
The three year strategic review considers 
the Group’s cash flows, dividend cover , 
available debt and other key financial ratios 
over the period. These metrics are subject 
to sensitivity analysis which involves 
varying a number of the main assumptions 
underlying the forecast both individually 
and in unison. Where appropriate, this 
analysis is carried out to evaluate the 
potential impact of the Group’s principal 
risks actually occurring. The three year 
review also makes certain assumptions 
about the normal level of capital recycling 
likely to occur and considers whether 
additional financing facilities will be 
required. Based on the results of this 
analysis, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three year 
period of their assessment. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

OUR 
FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
REMAINS 
STRONG AND 
STEADY
Results from operations
We are pleased to deliver healthy and 
steady financial performance in 2015 
following a year of exceptional financial 
results in 2014. The combination of 
strong operational execution and savings 
achieved as a result of Project Evolution  
 page 12 allowed us to deliver good 
margins despite global headwinds  
in the sector . 
The Group’s total revenue for the year  
was USD 871.1 million, slightly below  
our earlier guidance due to the impact 
of the market downturn on our walk-in 
business. Our other businesses performed 
in line with expectations. The new build 
jackup segment  page 25 remained  
the main source of revenue for Lamprell, 
with a record number of seven concurrent 
rigs under construction in the yard. Our 
revenues for 2015 were heavily weighted 
to the second half of the year due to the 
phasing of construction, as several of  
our projects were at the early stages in 
their build schedules in the six months  
to 30 June 2015. 
The additional awards by Petrofac have 
provided a significant contribution to our 
module business.
Whilst we are seeing repeat business 
from our clients, the general weakness 
across the sector has driven a reduction 
in revenues from our rig refurbishment 
business  page 27. We delivered 11 
refurbishment projects in 2015. We also 
took on high quality projects, with a number 
of wins for important clients albeit of fairly 
modest value, in our E&C business unit. 
Margin performance
The Group completed the major part  
of the investment under Project Evolution  
 page 12, with the realised savings partly 
utilised to protect Lamprell’s margins whilst 
retaining our competitive position in an 
environment of increased pricing pressure. 
This investment programme allowed the 
Group to maintain its normalised margins 
despite the industry difficulties which 
impacted the financial performance of  
its sector . 
The Group’s gross margin decreased  
to USD 123.5 million from USD 182.1 
million in the previous year primarily due  
to lower revenues, project phasing and  
a return to normalised performance.  
The drop in rig refurbishment revenue 
in the current environment had a minor 
negative impact on margins, whilst our  
new build jackup business managed to 
maintain stable margins at normalised 
levels. The main reason for this was the 
savings and productivity gains delivered  
by the Project Evolution initiatives. 
EBITDA excluding discontinued operations 
and exceptional items for the period  
was USD 90.0 million (2014: USD 137.0 
million). The Group’s EBITDA margin 
decreased from 12.6% in 2014 to 10.3%  
in 2015, reflecting the absence of the  
2014 exceptional items, partially offset  
by certain one off events in 2015 such  
as bad debt recoveries.
In 2015, Lamprell delivered 
solid financial results, driven 
by consistent operational 
performance. After a year 
of exceptional results in 
2014, the Group returned 
to normalised margins 
and retained its strong 
balance sheet, a notable 
achievement in the context 
of a challenging market 
environment.  Strategic report: Financial review 21
Finance costs and financing activities
Net finance costs in the period decreased 
to USD 12.0 million (2014: USD 18.4 million). 
Gross finance costs were USD 5.9 million 
lower due to reduced interest margins and 
lower bonding costs, partially offset by 
increased commitment fees on our facilities 
following the refinancing in 2014. Finance 
income has increased by USD 0.5 million  
as a result of higher cash deposits. 
Net profit after exceptional items  
and earnings per share
The Group recorded a profit for 2015 
attributable to the equity holders of  
USD 64.7 million (2014: USD 118.1 million). 
The fully diluted earnings per share for the 
year was 18.84 cents (2014: 37.38 cents), 
based on strong underlying performance 
in the absence of the exceptional items 
reported in 2014.
Capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure in 2015 
increased to USD 59.5 million (2014: USD 
22.5 million). The main area of investment 
was yard improvement under Project 
Evolution  page 12, which comprised of 
the purchase of new equipment including 
the new panel line  page 24, beam 
cutting robots and some yard infrastructure 
enhancements  page 34. The major part 
of the investment under Project Evolution  
is now complete, with the second phase  
of Project Compass  page 22 live across 
the Group since 1 October 2015.
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s net cash flow from operating 
activities for 2015 reflected a net outflow  
of USD 0.8 million (2014: net outflow of 
USD 39.8 million) arising predominantly 
from the Group’s EBITDA and offset by 
increased working capital requirements 
due to the natural cycle on major projects. 
Cash and bank balances decreased  
by USD 82.0 million, resulting from  
a net cash outflow from investing activities 
attributable to the major capital investment 
programme and an outflow from financing 
activities. The Group’s net cash position 
remains strong at USD 210.3 million (2014: 
USD 272.6 million), a decrease in line  
with expectations due to capital spend  
on Project Evolution and the phasing  
of the construction cycle on our projects.
Balance sheet
The Group maintained a strong balance 
sheet, providing flexibility and security in a 
challenging environment for the industry .
The Group’s total current assets at the 
period-end were USD 725.3 million  
(2014: USD 780.7 million). Trade and 
other receivables increased to USD 
428.3 million (2014: USD 403.6 million) 
due to unfavourable timing on milestone 
payments as well as advance payments 
to suppliers to secure favourable 
terms for equipment procured. 
Shareholders’ equity increased from  
USD 672.2 million to USD 737.6 million at 
31 December 2015. The movement mainly 
reflects increased retained earnings of  
USD 410.4 million (2014: USD 344.5 million).

Strategic report: Financial review 22
The Group’s debt/equity ratio of 10.8%  
at 31 December 2015 (2014: 14.7%) 
emphasises our low levels of leverage  
and balance sheet strength. 
Borrowings and debt 
In 2015, following the major debt 
refinancing the previous year , the Group’s 
facilities comprised (a) a USD 100 million 
term loan amortised over five years, of 
which USD 20 million was repaid over  
the course of the year; (b) USD 50 million 
for general working capital purposes  
which remained undrawn; and (c)  
USD 200 million of working capital for 
project financing, which has not been 
taken up by our clients to date. Lamprell 
continued to market this facility as part  
of a number of bids and the aim remains  
to leverage it in future projects.
In addition, the related USD 250 million 
committed bonding facility , which  
is available for use in connection with  
new contract awards funded by the 
working capital facility detailed in  
(c) above, remained undrawn in 2015 
and the Group has been able to leverage 
its bilateral bonding facilities for better 
commission rates. 
The outstanding borrowings were  
USD 79.3 million as at 31 December 2015 
(2014: USD 99.0 million). 
Change of auditors
Following a formal tender process in line 
with market best practice, the Audit & Risk 
Committee made a recommendation for the 
appointment of Deloitte LLP as the external 
auditor for the Company, which the Board 
approved  page 52. Deloitte LLP has 
expressed its willingness to act as external 
auditor and a resolution to appoint Deloitte 
LLP will be proposed at the forthcoming 
AGM for their services in respect of the 
2016 financial year .
Going concern
After reviewing its cash flow forecasts 
for a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of signing these financial 
statements, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will 
have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Directors have concluded 
therefore that it is appropriate for the Group 
to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its financial statements.
Dividends
Given the challenging market environment 
and the Group’s strategy to retain a strong 
net cash position and balance sheet, the 
Directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend for the current financial year 
ending 31 December 2015. In the future 
the Directors will continue to review this 
position in light of market conditions at the 
relevant time.

Project Compass was launched 
to implement a new Oracle-based 
ERP system at Lamprell. Along with 
streamlining processes and connecting 
our business functions to a single 
system, it is now also helping us to 
reduce our overall operational costs by 
providing greater visibility, control and 
increased employee productivity. The 
implementation of Project Compass 
provided Lamprell with a more robust 
and flexible platform to support future 
growth. Lamprell is better equipped to 
deliver higher levels of business process 
efficiency by leveraging the latest 
technologies in ways that directly impact 
the bottom line and create further value 
for our shareholders.

MEASURES Strategic report: Operational review 24
Business overview 
The Company had to adjust its outlook 
in early 2015 in light of the challenging 
climate following the sharp oil price 
decline. Recognising the importance 
of being competitive in this market, we 
pressed on with implementing our various 
business improvement measures. This 
included the productivity improvements 
and cost efficiencies under Project 
Evolution  page 12, refinement of our 
strategic objectives to align with market 
demands  page 14 and our focus on 
maintaining our competitive position by 
leveraging our key strengths  page 11.
In the early months of 2015, we delivered 
three major projects safely, on time, 
within budget and to high standards of 
quality . During the second half of 2015, 
the Group saw a significant ramp-up in 
manpower across all three yards as all 
ongoing projects reached critical, high 
intensity phases and, during this period, 
the Group increased its project workforce 
by approximately 1,500 people. We 
achieved another record for the Group as 
we constructed seven concurrent jackup 
rigs in the Hamriyah yard, which was made 
possible because of Project Evolution  
 page 12.
Notably, given the limited number of 
awards during 2015, Lamprell was pleased 
to receive a new rig contract award in April 
2015 by our largest client, NDC, one of 
only three global rig awards throughout the 
year . The Group also agreed with NDC to 
extend the outstanding two options  
and to include a third option on its next 
jackup rigs. The Group has seen further 
awards from Petrofac on the Abu Dhabi 
project under construction in our yards.  
As a result the original contract award of 
26 pre-assembled racks has now grown 
to a total of 45 pre-assembled racks, units 
and modules. 
2015 saw each of the Jebel Ali and 
Dubai yards reach the same milestone of 
having operated for more than three years 
without a single DAFWC. In addition, the 
Sharjah facility completed over five million 
manhours without a DAFWC, with its last 
recordable incident in June 2014. Overall, 
we are proud of the Group’s proven safety 
record  page 30. However , with the TRIR 
plateauing during 2015, management will 
make this a top priority for 2016 – we want 
an underlying safety culture which prevents 
incidents and allows our workforce to go 
home free from injury . 
The Board made changes to the senior 
management team designed to create 
functions which are accountable either 
for winning new work (under the CCO), 
executing work (under the COO) or 
managing payments (under the CFO). Tony 
Wright was appointed as CFO  page 20 
and Board Director in August 2015, and 
Niall O’Connell was promoted to the role of 
COO in October . This simplified structure 
is considered to be the most efficient and 
cost-effective way of running a business of 
Lamprell’s size and complexity . 
OUR BUSINESS IS  
BUILDING MOMENTUM 
In July 2015 the new state-of-the-art 
panel line was officially opened in our 
Hamriyah facility and provided Lamprell 
with a USD 13.6 million automated and 
more efficient solution to our panel 
fabrication process. The Evolution team 
delivered the new technology safely with 
over 300,000 manhours worked with no 
recordable incidents, in ten months, on 
time and within budget. The savings and 
efficiency benefits resulting from this 
investment programme have contributed 
to all seven ongoing new build jackup rig 
projects, and to maintaining the Group’s 
competitive position by offsetting some 
of the pressure on margins experienced 
in the currently challenging environment 
worldwide in the oil & gas services sector.

Trading review 
The Group delivered three new build 
jackup rigs in 2015, namely the “Jindal 
Pioneer” to the Jindal group in February, 
the rig “Greatdrill Chaaru” to Greatship 
in March and finally the rig “Butinah” to 
NDC in May . All projects were delivered 
within budget and on or ahead of schedule 
and all were designed according to 
the Cameron LeTourneau Super 116E 
(Enhanced) Class design.
The contract for the “Jindal Pioneer” rig  
was signed in January 2013 and this  
was the second of its kind which  
Lamprell delivered to this client.  
The rig was deployed to compete for work 
offshore India.
Construction of the “Greatdrill Chaaru” rig 
was undertaken on a fast-track basis and 
completion was achieved in only 18 months 
after initial steel cutting. The rig joined its 
sister vessel, the “Greatdrill Chaaya” which 
Lamprell delivered in H1 2013. Both rigs 
were contracted to work for India’s Oil and 
Gas Corporation in the offshore Indian 
territorial waters.
The “Butinah” rig, which achieved an 
exceptional safety record, departed 
Lamprell’s Hamriyah facility in 1H 2015, 
for operations in its drilling location in the 
Zakum Field off Abu Dhabi. This was the 
sixth in a series of nine rigs being built 
and delivered by Lamprell to NDC. All of 
the NDC rigs are on charter to the ADNOC 
group of companies.
A further seven jackup rigs are under 
construction for three key clients for the 
Group and all are at different stages of 
completion. There are three rigs being 
fabricated for NDC and they are in relatively 
early phases of construction. With regard 
to the two rigs for our customer Ensco, 
they are nearing completion with deliveries 
expected to be in Q2 and Q3 of 2016.  
We are also constructing two rigs for first 
time client Shelf Drilling and they are 
both on schedule, with one of the rigs 
scheduled for delivery in Q3 2016. All 
seven rig EPC projects are proceeding  
as planned and have benefited from  
the yard optimisation measures under 
Project Evolution  page 12.
Three rigs delivered and a further  
seven under construction in Lamprell’s 
Hamriyah yard 
Having seven new build jackup rigs under 
construction concurrently is a record for 
Lamprell and was made possible due to 
the yard optimisation initiative as part of 
Project Evolution  page 12. 
To date Lamprell have delivered a total of 
27 new build jackup units, including both 
drilling units and multipurpose liftboats, to 
various clients during the last ten years. 
The Group is planning to deliver four further 
LeTourneau Super 116e jackup drilling rigs 
in 2016. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Offshore platforms 
Trading review 
The global energy markets have 
experienced a significant shift since mid-
2014 and this has impacted all contractors 
operating in the sector including Lamprell, 
with limited numbers of overall contract 
awards. This has impacted the Group’s 
ability to convert its pipeline into backlog, 
notably in the Offshore Platform business 
stream. Although Lamprell has not been 
successful with new awards in this major 
business stream in 2015, we anticipate 
growth in the long term and we have 
been able to strengthen and diversify our 
bid pipeline with a substantially higher 
proportion made up from projects in this 
sector . Lamprell’s yards are strategically 
located in the Middle East which is proving 
to be more resilient to the current market 
challenges and we are therefore targeting 
projects in this region which are expected 
to proceed.

Trading review 
In 2H 2015, one year after the start of 
construction, Lamprell successfully 
completed the load out of the first pipe 
racks for Petrofac in connection with the 
UZ750 project. By the close of 2015, 10 
pre-assembled pipe racks had sailed away 
to the North Zakum Island in Abu Dhabi to 
undergo installation and commissioning. 
In early 2016 another seven modules were 
loaded out and the remaining modules 
and pipe racks will be delivered to the 
client over the course of 2016. In addition, 
Lamprell achieved a major milestone by 
reaching two million manhours without 
a DAFWC on this project which is an 
impressive achievement and shows our 
deep commitment to safety, one of our core 
values. Some of the modules have been 
fabricated in our Sharjah facility, which by 
the close of 2015 had celebrated achieving 
over 600,000 manhours without a DAFWC 
on the project, in addition to no lost time 
incidents to date in our Jebel Ali facility 
on this project. Lamprell has developed 
a close and effective working relationship 
with Petrofac based around our high 
quality and reliable project execution, and 
this follows our strong performance for this 
client on the Laggan Tormore project in the 
North Sea, during 2013.
Both Petrofac and Zakum Development 
Company, the end user client for this 
project and operator of the Abu Dhabi 
field, have recognised Lamprell’s excellent 
performance when it comes to safety, 
quality and progress. In recognition of 
Lamprell’s high standards on the project, 
The quality of Lamprell welding has 
consistently been high, however we found 
that there were some inconsistencies 
in certain processes and techniques 
being applied, offering an opportunity for 
improvements. In 2013, 65% of welding at 
Lamprell was done using shielded metal 
arc welding, also known as stick welding. 
An alternative welding process called 
flux cored arc welding (“FCAW”) has 
been introduced to a far greater extent. 
FCAW is more efficient, significantly 
reducing the number of manhours spent 
on this activity. In addition, welders 
have been given defined KPIs which 
has increased productivity and reduced 
consumable wastage. These welding 
improvements have made Lamprell more 
productive, reduced welding manhours 
by approximately 20%, improved our 
environmental footprint and made us  
more competitive.

the Group was rewarded with additional 
work, including an award by Petrofac for 
an additional five pipe racks and a further 
three modules. This brings the total amount 
of modular structures awarded by Petrofac 
to date to 45, including 39 pre-assembled

As part of its strategy refinement  
Lamprell has grouped its four smaller 
business streams under the name 
“Oil & Gas Contracting Services”. 
Notwithstanding the low oil price 
environment, each business stream 
delivered a solid performance in 2015  
and Lamprell views each as capable  
of generating long-term growth for  
the business.
Land rig services
Land Rig Services completed 13 projects 
in 2015, covering the refurbishment and 
upgrade of land rigs or component parts 
as well as support for onshore drilling 
activities, and has worked on three projects 
for a new Kuwaiti client. Lamprell has 
started the process of marketing its first 
land rig based on its own proprietary 
design. There has been considerable 
interest in the rig and the Group has been 
giving demonstrations of its capabilities to 
clients in early 2016.
Rig refurbishment
After a positive start in 2015, the rig 
refurbishment business saw a slowdown in 
later months. In 2015 we delivered a total 
of 11 rig refurbishment projects and won 
a total of nine new contracts, all repeat 
business from established customers. 
Some clients have stacked their jackup 
rigs with Lamprell until market conditions 
improve, with a total of eight rigs located 
across our yards in 2015. This is an 
important service for clients while the 
market recovers and allows for a rapid 
response to refurbish or upgrade a rig 
when it is redeployed. 
Engineering and construction
Lamprell’s E&C business unit performed 
well in 2015 with the most significant 
contract being our involvement in the 
prestigious Kaombo project offshore 
Angola. E&C also renewed a key 
maintenance service contract with client 
Sharjah National Oil Corporation, which 
completes more than 15 years of service 
to this group. Much of the work under 
E&C is for clients with whom we have 
well-developed relationships, as they trust 
Lamprell to deliver as promised. 
Operations and maintenance 
Our O&M team continues to perform 
well and successfully retained the 
maintenance service contracts for the 
supply of manpower with key clients, some 
of whom they have worked for since the 
1980s. In spite of its small size, O&M have 
been regular winners of safety awards 
from these clients, demonstrating that 
Lamprell’s safety culture is well-established 
throughout the business.  Strategic report: Operational review 28
Key opportunities for improved efficiency 
were in the Group’s time management 
and span and control ratios, meaning 
the number of supervisors compared to 
workers being placed under their control. 
In terms of supervisor to staff ratios, 
changes have been made to ensure that 
they are not only in line with industry 
standards, but also optimal by reference 
to the work being performed, and the 
potential safety hazards arising from that 
work. The Evolution team also took steps  
in measuring the time management culture 
of our people in every facility . 
Following a series of audits, a number 
of improvement opportunities leading 
to greater efficiency were identified and 
safely implemented. The most significant 
was a targeted reduction in the non-
productive time associated with each 
workman. We saw opportunities for 
enhanced work productivity and made 
various adjustments through a focused 
measurement campaign which was 
supported by yard management and key 
supervision, ensuring our workers are 
more productive during each shift. We also 
observed that there were lengthy queuing 
times associated with our tradesmen 
getting their equipment and consumables 
from our stores, and in order to improve 
this we have provided the majority of our 
tradesmen with personal tool kits and set 
up satellite stores in different areas of our 
yards, taking consumables and tools to 
the work area locations instead of our staff 
having to walk distances to warehouses for 
collection. We have implemented a work 
package system, in line with industry best 
practice, and now use dedicated systems 
to package construction and related works

WE ARE BUILDING A  
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS
Sustainability at Lamprell
The successful implementation of new 
sustainability initiatives throughout the 
organisation during 2015 was a significant 
achievement for the Group. These 
initiatives contributed to the Company’s 
financial performance for the period 
while maintaining a safe and efficient 
operating environment for our workforce. 
The promotion of accountability and 
transparency are of paramount importance 
to the Group, which is in part achieved 
through the maintenance of a healthy  
and well trained workforce. We believe 
that our operations can have a positive 
effect upon our clients, employees, 
subcontractors, the environment and 
communities in which we operate. 
Health and safety
Highlights
Successful heat stress management 
campaign which resulted in zero 
recordable heat stress incidents 
Three years without a DAFWC for both  
the Jebel Ali and Dubai facilities
6.1 million manhours and 551 days  
without DAFWC for the Sharjah facility 
The best-in-class organisational health and 
safety management system which Lamprell 
deployed throughout 2015 continued 
to deliver positive health and safety 
performance results. These were achieved 
through a number of complementary 
mechanisms including:
 » Company-wide occupational health  
and safety campaigns focused around 
fatal risk management;
 » Dropped object safety awareness 
campaign to highlight and reduce the 
dangers associated with falling tools 
and materials on fabrication yards;
Essential to our long-
term growth is a robust 
sustainability framework 
which enables us to deliver 
value for all stakeholders. 
We operate safely, to the 
highest standards, whilst at 
the same time managing our 
impact on the environment.  Strategic report: Sustainability report 31
 » ‘Take 5’ hazard evaluation initiative 
which requires all operational personnel 
to assess their work areas for potential 
hazards and rectify them prior to any 
work being undertaken; and
 » The provision of external Institute 
of Occupational Safety and Health 
training courses for supervisors and 
Construction Industry Training Board 
certification for Company supervisors 
and scaffolders.
Lamprell is committed to achieving an 
incident and injury free culture for all 
stakeholders. To help achieve this goal, 
hazard identification workshops as well as 
client and Lamprell safety review meetings 
are now standard for each project, which 
subcontractors are required to attend. 
This process enables clear communication 
of health and safety expectations and 
standards, and allows all parties to share 
their industry experience on how to achieve 
a safer work environment. 
The Company is proud of its TRIR achieved 
throughout 2015, however it acknowledges 
that this rate has plateaued and is now 
reviewing options to drive the TRIR down 
by implementing more extensive training 
programmes for Lamprell’s supervision. 
All Lamprell employees continually strive 
to ensure that operations are performed 
in a safe working manner . However , in 
November 2015, there was a tragic  
non-operational incident in which a guard 
received burn injuries as a result of a 
fire that broke out in a security office at 
Lamprell’s facility in Erbil, Iraq. One week 
later he sadly passed away . As a result 
of this incident, a number of corrective 
actions were implemented including all 
gas appliances being connected via hard 
pipe and being fitted with a gas detection 
system initiating automatic emergency 
shutdown. In addition, a HSE audit was 
undertaken at all remote facilities to ensure 
that general safety standards are being 
maintained. The lessons from this incident 
were shared and further actions taken 
where appropriate.
Quality 
Highlights
Successful third party recertification for 
ISO 9001 and ISO TS 29001
In 2015 Lamprell’s Quality department 
successfully achieved recertification 
by Bureau Veritas and the American 
Petroleum Institute, demonstrating that we 
have maintained and complied with these 
internationally recognised standards. The 
Group also successfully completed the ISO 
27001 information security management 
system certification audit. This certification 
confirms that we have robust, secure and 
reliable IT systems in place, ensuring 
greater stakeholder confidence.
Lamprell successfully completed a number 
of audit assessments for prospective 
clients as part of our ongoing business 
development efforts. These audits enable  
the Group’s participation in bidding 
activities for potential clients. In addition 
Lamprell’s Quality department designed 
and initiated a programme to train and 
further develop the skills of its Quality 
Control and Production department 
personnel. The programme is aimed at 
creating greater efficiency and continuous 
improvement across the department.
Another major accomplishment for the 
organisation in 2015 was the completion of 
a new Lamprell shipyard quality standard 
for new build rig projects which ensures 
that we are complying with the international 
code and class requirements.

Highlights
Establishment of organisational carbon

Full regulatory compliance with all 
applicable environmental legislation 
Majority of operational waste diverted from 
landfill to be recycled
Effective and compliant environmental 
management remains a cornerstone 
of Lamprell’s operations. To drive this, 
we are using a standardised reporting 
regime, which enables timely and accurate 
measurement of all major environmental 
impacts from Group activities. A number of 
environmental management improvements 
were made possible through Project 
Evolution  page 12 initiatives such as the 
realignment of compressors to maximise 
efficiency and the replacement of some 
diesel powered cranes. A total of nine 
overhead electric gantry cranes have been 
installed at our Sharjah and Hamriyah 
facilities to replace some of the diesel 
powered crawler cranes. 
In 2015 Lamprell once again participated 
in the international Carbon Disclosure 
Project (“CDP”) in which organisations 
submit operational data that has an impact 
upon the environment. The Disclosure 
Score for the CDP report submitted for 
2015 reflected a significant improvement 
from previous years.

The CO 2e emissions from 2015 Lamprell 
Group operations are provided below: 
Lamprell Group CO 2 e emissions
52,410 tonnes Scope 1 – Emissions from

Lamprell
Throughout 2015 the Group diverted the 
majority of operational waste away from 
landfill sites and into recycling plants. This 
was achieved through a best practice 
waste segregation source management 
approach and linking the organisation’s 
waste recycling systems with a leading 
UAE recycling enterprise. While the 
overall Group waste diversion percentage 
dropped from the previous year , this 
was due to a short-term increase in un-
recyclable waste products at one facility . 
Going forward, Lamprell will continue to 
investigate and implement ways to extend 
our waste management processes into 
other sectors and improve the overall 
percentage diverted from landfill.

As part of Project Evolution  page 12, the 
yard layout optimisation measures instigated 
at our Sharjah and Hamriyah facilities 
were undertaken to maximise efficiency 
and reduce operational costs. Part of this 
project incorporated the replacement of 
older diesel compressors with new electric 
models. This capital investment by the 
Company resulted in an annual diesel 
saving of 1,572,060 litres and the reduction 
of 2,330 tonnes of CO
2e emissions which 
were not emitted through the switch to the 
cleaner (electric) energy source.

Employee welfare 
Highlights
Lamprell wins major employee health and 
wellness award for second year running
Almost 2,000 employees completed basic 
health screening
90 courses now available at Lamprell 
Assessment and Training Centre
Our core values  page 47 include  
integrity and teamwork and 2015 was 
another landmark year for employee 
welfare which continues to be centred  
on these values. In November 2015 
Lamprell received a major regional award 
for the second year in succession, for the 
“Most Improved Corporate Health and 
Wellness Performance” at the Daman 
Corporate Health Awards in Dubai. The 
Group was recognised for executing 
new initiatives such as health awareness 
campaigns on diabetes, breast cancer , 
heat stress, cholesterol management and 
dental and oral hygiene. In addition, almost 
2,000 employees underwent basic health 
screening and were provided with their 
personal follow up health report. 
In March 2015, the Company conducted 
an Employee Engagement Survey which 
provided valuable feedback from over 
1,000 office-based employees, of whom 
99% expressed their pride in working 
for Lamprell. We are implementing other 
lessons learned from this feedback. 
We also recognise the importance of  
a good work-life balance and encourage 
employees to participate in a variety  
of internal sports tournaments and  
leisure activities which we organised 
during 2015. They included basketball, 
cricket, football, badminton and bowling 
tournaments as well as our employee  
talent show – “Lamprell’s Got Talent”.  
With the high employee participation  
in our extracurricular activities, the  
Group is continuing with similar activities 
during 2016.
In terms of staff training and development, 
the Company had a strong year 
supporting both professional and trade 
development. The Lamprell Assessment 
and Training Centre currently has over 
90 individual courses available covering 
topics as diverse as leadership, English 
language, welding, fabrication, electrical 
and mechanical. Some of the courses 
have mandatory third party involvement 
including offshore survival, rigging and 
crane operations. Over 400,000 manhours 
of training and assessment were provided 
by Lamprell’s dedicated training centre  
in the UAE compared to approximately 
250,000 in 2014.
The Board and executive management 
continue to recognise that strong employee 
engagement stems from a focus on 
employee health, wellness and work-life 
balance and this commitment will continue 
in 2016.

We have invested further in our yards with 
the purchase of several new fixed and 
telescopic cranes for operations in each of 
our three main facilities servicing multiple 
new concrete fabrication pads. In order to 
reduce costs and speed up the fabrication 
time associated with cutting and preparing 
thousands of beams and profiles needed 
in our various business lines, we installed 
high technology, 3D robotic beam cutting 
facilities in each of our Jebel Ali and 
Hamriyah yards. 
We also established an in-house 
scaffolding department in Jebel Ali in 
order to reduce subcontractor costs as 
most of our projects have a high demand 
for scaffolding. In Sharjah, an additional 
blast and priming wheel abbrator unit 
with dedicated overhead cranage and 
an adjacent material laydown is now in 
operation. We also installed new pipe 
shops, paint sheds, cranes, a warehouse 
and have upgraded our blasting facilities 
with dedicated dust collection systems. 
In our Hamriyah facility, we have installed 
new paint and leg blasting sheds with 
recovery, recycling and dust collection 
systems. Centralised gas systems are up 
and running and our new airline supply 
is being fed by integrated compressor 
stations servicing the yard economically 
which has removed the costly supply 
previously provided by handling of 
thousands of cylinders. Thanks to our new 
Oracle ERP system  page 22, we now 
also have digitised, real time field access 
to commissioning and quality control 
systems, as well as new material handling 
equipment which have helped reduce our 
fabrication costs. A new yard transporter

generator power used previously . 
We also completed an underground  
utilities upgrade at both our Hamriyah 
and Sharjah facilities, which has ensured 
savings on utility charges and increased 
productivity , as well as improved safety 
standards in the yards. Our efforts to 
modernise and optimise the layout of  
our yards are benefiting all of our current 
major projects and will provide a strong 
foundation on which to bid competitively  
for future projects.

Corporate governance: Directors’ Report 38
Dear Shareholders, 
Given the importance of high standards 
of corporate governance for the effective 
leadership of any company and in 
particular a publicly listed company, I am 
pleased to report on the excellent progress 
made in delivering on the priorities set 
for 2015. These priorities were chosen as 
a result of the feedback from the 2014 
evaluation process and, in this way, the 
Board has been able to demonstrate 
accountability for its own performance and 
effective leadership of the Company . 
Board changes
In line with its stated goals, the Board 
strengthened its independence and 
composition with the appointment of 
Mel Fitzgerald and Debra Valentine as 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
This was doubly important with the 
unplanned departures from the Board of 
Peter Whitbread and Michael Press, for 
personal reasons. Peter and Michael were 
major contributors in navigating the Group 
through challenging times but Mel and 
Debra are highly experienced individuals 
who will enhance Board performance. 
Leadership succession 
We also focussed on development of our 
leadership succession plan for the Board 
and management team and there was 
progress in that regard. In August, James 
Moffat, our CEO, announced that he was 
planning to retire in June 2016 and so 
we started the search process to find a 
replacement CEO, which is now well under 
way . In addition, I agreed to take on the 
role of Executive Chairman until the 2016 
AGM in order to help the transition process 
between James and the new CEO and to 
take on an outward-facing role looking at 
potential partnerships for the Group as it 
looks to implement its refined strategy  
 page 14. 
In addition, following extensive search and 
evaluation processes, we were pleased to 
be able to promote two internal candidates 
to leading management positions. Tony 
LEADING WITH  
GOOD GOVERNANCE 
We set a number of key 
priorities to enhance the 
Company’s governance 
structures and leadership 
by the Board, and we have 
made excellent progress on 
them during the year .
The Board committed to hold at least one 
Board meeting at a Group facility and, in 
2015, the February meetings were held 
at the Hamriyah facility in the Northern 
Emirates. This site visit was planned to 
capture both presentations on key subject 
matters but also to allow the Directors 
to interact with other personnel aside 
from senior managers. This included 
presentations at the facility offices made 
during the course of the meetings. Then, 
having changed into full safety coveralls 
and after the necessary safety training 
course, the Directors took the opportunity 
to walk around the yard, meet some of 
the operations personnel and also to 
board the “Greatdrill Chaaru” rig which 
was ready for delivery at that time. 
This represented a prime opportunity 
to demonstrate greater visibility by the 
Directors with the wider workforce.

Wright moved from Deputy CFO to CFO 
and Executive Director in August and 
Niall O’Connell was promoted to COO in 
October . Tony and Niall have both been 
working in the Group for several years prior 
to their appointments, and so understand 
the business well.
Getting close to the business
An area for improvement identified 
in the 2014 evaluation process was 
communication between the Board and 
wider management. With that in mind, 
the Directors – both existing and new 
– participated in site tours around our 
Hamriyah facility where the Board held 
its February meeting. During the June 
Board meetings, members of the wider 
management team had one on one 
meetings with the Directors with a view  
to encouraging closer communication  
with Board members. 
Strategy
Lamprell had set out a clear strategy  
 page 14 during its rights issue in 
mid-2014 and has been successful in 
implementing the first phase over the 
last 18 months  page 12. Given the 
industry economic downturn, the Board 
wished to verify that the current strategy 
was still appropriate for future growth in 
the business. As such, the management 
team undertook a detailed review of the 
strategy which was completed in August 
2015, which the Board subsequently 
approved. The outcome of that review 
process is set out on  page 14 and will, 
the Board believes, continue to deliver 
sustainable growth over the longer term to 
its shareholders. 
Governance
The Company is incorporated in the Isle 
of Man and has a Premium Listing on the 
Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
The Board makes considerable efforts  
to ensure that during the relevant period 
the Company applies and complies  
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014 as the pre-eminent set of global 
standards for corporate governance  
(the “Code”, available at www.frc.org.uk). 
Where the Company does not comply, 
this is explained in this Annual Report and 
Accounts or in this Corporate Governance 
Report specifically . 
In light of our achievements in 2015, 
Lamprell benefits from an improved 
governance structure that is appropriate 
for the size and complexity of our 
business, and we continue to move in 
the right direction. Nevertheless, we look 
for new ways to improve governance 
and so, following our Board’s self-
evaluation process for 2015 using an 
external facilitator , we have agreed our 
priorities for 2016 and the outcome 
of that process is on  page 44. 
John Kennedy
Chairman of the Board
The Directors present their report on the 
affairs of the Company and the Group 
together with the financial statements and 
the auditor’s report for the year ended  
31 December 2015. 
Results and dividends
The financial statements of the Group  
for the year ended 31 December 2015 are 
set out on  pages 70 to 117. The Group’s 
profit from continuing and discontinued 
operations after income tax and exceptional 
items for the year amounted to USD 64.7 
million (2014: USD 118.1 million). The 
Directors do not recommend the payment 
of any dividend for the financial year ended 
31 December 2015.

EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP 
ACROSS THE GROUP 
As a result of the changes 
among the Directors 
during 2015, the Board 
composition, succession 
and integration have been 
key focus areas. The Board 
is collectively responsible 
for the long-term success 
of the Company and aims 
to achieve that through 
effective risk management 
and greater transparency .
Board composition 
The Board is comprised of an Executive 
Chairman, CEO, CFO and four independent 
Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”). Of 
the current Directors, Messrs Kennedy, 
Moffat, Malcolm and Armstrong served 
as Directors throughout 2015, with Mel 
Fitzgerald and Tony Wright joining the 
Board on 13 August and Debra Valentine 
being appointed as a Director with effect 
from 1 September 2015. The Executive 
Chairman, CEO and CFO are the Executive 
Directors on the Board.
There is a strong combination of industry, 
regional and operational experience 
among the Directors  pages 36 and 37 
enhanced by the diverse professional 
competences of each Board member . 
However , with the announcement by 
James Moffat of his planned retirement 
in 2016, the Board prioritised the process 
to identify a suitable replacement as 
CEO. That search has been under way 
for some months and, while a number 
of candidates have been identified and 
interviewed, the Board is continuing with 
the search as it aims to find a replacement 
with a broad array of skills, both in 
managing a business but also capable 
of delivering the longer-term aspects 
of the Company’s strategy . This search 
process will continue to be the top priority 
for the Board in 2016. In the meantime, 
John Kennedy has agreed to take on the 
role of Executive Chairman in order to 
help with the transition to the new CEO.
The Board will aim to refresh its 
membership on a regular and phased 
basis in order to bring relevant experience 
and independence to the Board while  
at the same time ensuring continuity  
and stability .

Roles and responsibilities 
The roles and duties of the Chairman  
and the CEO have been segregated, in line 
with the best practices set out in the Code, 
as agreed by the Board. This will ensure 
that effective governance is maintained 
throughout the temporary period until  
the new CEO has been transitioned into  
the Group. 
The Executive Chairman is responsible 
for providing effective leadership of the 
Board and the Group as a whole including 
strategy and direction and chairs all Board 
meetings within an effective corporate 
governance framework. In addition, for  
the period until the Chairman reverts to  
a non-executive capacity, he has also  
taken on an outward-facing role looking  
at strategic initiatives for the Group 
as it looks to implement its refined 
strategy . The CEO is responsible for 
the day-to-day running of the Group’s 
business, including execution of the 
Group’s business plans and objectives 
and communicating its decisions from/
recommendations to the Board.
The CFO is responsible for the financial 
stewardship, navigation and control 
activities of the Group as well as the 
investor relations activities. The role of 
the four independent NEDs is critical 
to ensure an effective counter-balance 
on the Board. The NEDs are primarily 
responsible for challenging constructively 
all recommendations presented to the 
Board, based on their broad experience 
and individual expertise. 
The Senior Independent Director acts as 
a sounding board and confidante to the 
Chairman and is available to shareholders 
to answer questions which cannot be 
addressed by the Chairman or the CEO. 
With the departure of Michael Press on 
13 August 2015, Ellis Armstrong was 
appointed as Senior Independent Director .
The biographical information of each 
Director as well as the memberships for 
each Board Committee are detailed on  
 pages 36 and 37.
Board meetings and attendance
The Directors met in person on seven 
occasions (five times in Dubai and two in 
Paris) during the course of 2015. However , 
where required and in order to receive an 
interim update on ongoing matters, the 
Directors may convene ad hoc meetings 
at short notice by way of conference call, 
where required. Meetings in person will 
generally take place over the course of two 
days and will include meetings of both the 
Board and the Committees.
The Company Secretary is responsible 
to the Board and provides the Board and 
each of the individual Directors with advice 
and assistance on governance matters. 
He ensures that all Board materials and 
other information are delivered in a timely 
fashion, at least five days before scheduled 
Board meetings through a secure, online 
software system.
As well as the Directors and the Company 
Secretary, it is common for members of 
the executive committee to attend parts 
of the Board meetings and to deliver

Table for Board agenda items
presentations on operational or business 
topics in greater detail. In this way, the 
Board gains an in-depth understanding 
of business-critical functions and the 
presenting managers are able to interact 
with the Directors and gain experience for 
their own personal development. 
Board topics
There is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board and the Board 
retains discretion to approve decisions on 
key subject matters such as the Group’s 
strategy , annual budget and financial 
statements. The Board also reviews other 
relevant matters including standing agenda 
items (see above) and key topics for 
discussion at that relevant time of year or as 
a result of current business requirements. 
In all cases, the agenda focuses on topics 
in pursuit of the Company’s strategic 
objectives underpinned by our core values 
 page 47, rather than administrative 
matters. The Chairman sets the agenda 
for each meeting in consultation with 
the CEO and the Company Secretary . 
At the meeting, the Executive Directors 
give an update on business, operational 
and financial matters, thereby enabling 
the Board to understand progress within 
the business but also anticipate likely 
forthcoming risks  page 16. 
During 2015, there were detailed 
presentations from key managers 
including the COO, CCO and VP of HR 
on matters such as strategy, enterprise 
risk management, business development, 
security and leadership succession 
planning. In addition, from time to time, 
the Board invites external presenters 
to speak to the Directors. This included 
a detailed discussion on the oil & gas 
industry from an economics expert from 
a major UAE bank as well as information 
from the Company’s brokers (JPMorgan 
Cazenove – “JPMC”) and lawyers. The 
Board has been particularly keen to 
keep abreast of issues in the market 
in light of the prolonged downturn. 
Between Board meetings, management 
distributes a monthly report to the Board 
providing a summary of the financial 
performance of the Group, highlighting 
developments and key risks  page 16. 
Principal Board Committees
There are three principal Board 
Committees – the Audit & Risk Committee, 
the Nomination & Governance Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee – and 
much of the Board oversight of the 
executive management team is conducted 
by delegation through these Committees. 
Given the time and resources invested 
in the appointment of the Directors, it is 
important for the Directors to operate in an 
environment of trust and responsibilities to 
be effective. 
An open and forthright environment  
is also encouraged in meetings of the  
three Board Committees. 
Meetings structure 
The Board is primarily responsible for the 
leadership of the Company and wider 
Group; however it is ably supported 
both by the Board Committees and the 
management team which makes use of a 
number of management level committees 
see  page 41 for details. It is a core 
principle for all that there is an effective 
working relationship between the Directors, 
between the Board and management 
and at the management level. Structurally 
and from a governance perspective, this 
provides a robust framework for achieving 
the Company’s strategic objectives.

Corporate governance: Directors’ Report 44
Accordingly, there are regular discussions 
outside of scheduled Board meetings, 
particularly between the Chairman and 
the other Directors, with a view to reaching 
a mutual understanding of views prior to 
wider discussions at meetings. At physical 
Board meetings, the NEDs, without the 
CEO or CFO present, share insights on 
matters of governance and sensitivity 
for management. The Chairman typically 
attends such meetings, notwithstanding his 
change of role to Executive Chairman. 
Independence and conflicts
In accordance with the Code, at least half 
of the Board (excluding the Chairman) 
is comprised of independent NEDs 
who are free from any business or other 
relationships that could materially interfere 
in the exercise of their independent 
judgement. At the date of publication, John 
Malcolm, Ellis Armstrong, Debra Valentine 
and Mel Fitzgerald are all considered by 
the Board to be independent NEDs as 
defined by the Code. 
At the beginning of each year , the 
Company asks each of the independent 
NEDs to re-confirm their independence. 
The Chairman of the Board was 
considered to be independent on his 
original appointment in June 2012. 
Integrity is a core value for the Group.  
Each Director recognises the importance 
of transparency in trying to avoid any 
actual or potential conflict of interest  
and will promptly declare such conflict, 
if one arises. This enables the Board to 
assess the possible impact of any conflict 
and take appropriate and timely action. 
The following procedures are in place for 
dealing with conflicts:
 » Any new Director is required to provide 
information on any conflicts of interest 
by means of a questionnaire prior to 
appointment;
 » Conflicts are declared and addressed 
during Board meetings and noted in the 
minutes; and
 » For conflicts arising between Board 
meetings, these are submitted to the 
Chairman for consideration, prior  
to deliberation at the next meeting.
No new, additional conflicts of interest  
were noted from the Directors in 2015,  
save as disclosed previously . John 
Kennedy remains as the Non-Executive 
Chairman of Maxwell Drummond (which 
is one of the companies who provide 
recruitment services to the Company) 
but the Board has determined that this 
potential conflict has been effectively 
managed as Mr Kennedy is not involved 
in any decision involving the appointment 
of Maxwell Drummond. All conflict 
management procedures were adhered  
to and operated effectively .
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and 
transparent process for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board and this 
is led by the Nomination & Governance 
Committee which then makes any such 
recommendations to the full Board for 
approval. Prior to embarking on a search, 
the Committee on the advice of the VP 
of HR will prepare a list of key criteria for 
any candidates, taking into account the 
Board composition, and will ordinarily 
appoint external search consultants to 
prepare candidate lists and assist with the 
recruitment/evaluation process. 
A key Board priority for 2015 included  
the appointment of at least one additional 
independent NED, which was achieved 
by the appointment of Mel Fitzgerald and 
Debra Valentine. They joined the Board 
following an extended recruitment process 
which also included interviews with  
the existing Directors and a number  
of senior managers.
Once appointed, the two new Directors 
were given full induction into the business 
including visits to the three main facilities in 
the UAE, presentations from key managers 
on business-related topics and a meeting 
with the Chairman and the Company 
Secretary, to discuss governance matters 
including the Listing Rule obligations 
for the Company, Directors’ duties and 
responsibilities, share dealing restrictions 
in accordance with the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Model Code, 
and Board procedural matters. 
All Directors are encouraged to attend 
relevant external seminars and, on an 
ongoing basis, there is training for the 
Directors as a whole by way of the 
presentations to the Board from guest 
presenters. The individual Directors  
also make efforts to remain current with  
the latest regulatory obligations for UK 
listed companies with the assistance  
of our brokers and lawyers. Similarly, any 
Director is entitled to take independent 
professional or legal advice on Company 
matters, as and when needed. No Director 
sought independent advice during the 
financial year .
The Audit & Risk Committee also 
benefits from regular briefings from the 
external auditors on any new accounting 
requirements as well as developments in 
the area of corporate governance.
Board performance evaluation
In last year’s Annual Report, the 
Board committed to making use of an 
external facilitator to assist with the 
2015 performance evaluation process. 
This process was conducted under 
the stewardship of the Nomination & 
Governance Committee, which met in 
mid-2015 to plan the evaluation process. 
The Committee considered the Code 
and, although the Company was not a 
constituent of the FTSE 350, decided 
What were the results from the Board evaluation?

that appointment of an external facilitator 
was in the best interests of the Company . 
Accordingly, the Company appointed Value 
Alpha (www.valuealpha.com) to advise 
on and facilitate an externally-managed 
Board evaluation. Value Alpha has no other 
connection with the Group.
The process focussed on review of 
the Board performance and made use 
of both an online questionnaire (with 
questions asking for quantitative ranking 
and for qualitative feedback to the Board, 
Committees and the Directors) and review 
meetings with each Director . The facilitator , 
on behalf of the Board, also sought 
feedback from specific key executives 
that have regular interaction with either 
the Board or the Board Committees. The 
externally-compiled report summarised 
the results of the evaluation on an 
aggregated and confidential basis and was 
subsequently provided to the Board which 
then discussed the results in open session. 
As a result of this external process, the 
Board has been able to structure its 
priorities for 2016 around the results  
 page 44. The NEDs, led by the Senior 
Independent Director , evaluated the 
Chairman’s performance and confirmed 
that he is performing effectively . While 
the Company was not required to use 
external facilitators, the Board consider 
that this has strengthened and enhanced 
the performance and transparency of 
discussions and decision-making at the 
Board level.
Annual general meetings 
In May 2015, the Company held its AGM in 
Dubai, United Arab Emirates and all then-
current Directors were present although 
it should be noted that Peter Whitbread 
decided not to stand for re-election for 
personal reasons. We encourage our 
shareholders to attend the AGM as an 
opportunity to engage in a constructive 
dialogue with the Board members. As has 
been the norm, all resolutions were passed 
on a show of hands; however as a matter 
of good governance and in accordance 
with the changes to the Code, voting on 
resolutions 7, 9 and 11 (which related 
to the re-election of the independent 
Non-Executive Directors) was conducted 
by independent shareholders only (i.e. 
excluding the “controlling shareholders”) 
 page 46. 
The Company plans to hold its 2016 
AGM on 15 May 2016 in Dubai and 
full details are set out in the Notice of 
Meeting which accompanies this report 
and is also available on our website. All 
Directors are planning to attend and will 
be available to answer questions from 
shareholders. Each item will be presented 
as a separate resolution. Any shareholder 
unable to attend in person but wishing to 
submit a question for consideration by the 
Directors, is invited to submit questions to 
investorrelations@lamprell.com.
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Directors are required 
to submit themselves for re-election by 
shareholders at least every three years but, 
in line with the Code and best practice,  
the Board has decided that all Directors 
will retire and stand for re-election at the 
2016 AGM. 
As also required, the Company makes 
the terms and conditions of Directors’ 
engagement available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company during 
normal business hours and also at the 
Company’s AGM 15 minutes prior to the 
meeting and during the meeting.
Communications with shareholders
As in previous years, Lamprell has 
focussed on effective and open 
communications with its shareholders, 
not least because of the impact of the 
declining oil price on the Company’s 
share price. Whilst the Chairman assumes 
overall responsibility for communication of 
shareholder views to the Board, investor 
relations activities are primarily handled 
by the CEO and CFO with the support 
of a dedicated investor relations team. 
During 2015, nearly 100 investor and 
analyst meetings were held by the investor 
relations team, of which the CEO or CFO 
attended approximately 65%.
As in previous years, Company 
representatives met with major institutional 
shareholders and market analysts following 
the announcement for our financial results 
and at other key times. In addition, the 
management arranged for an analyst 
site visit in November 2015 pursuant to 
which eight analysts and investors visited 
the Group’s facilities in the UAE, listened 
to presentations from key members of 
Consistent communication with our shareholders Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

management and had an opportunity to 
question the Lamprell team on all aspects 
of the business (within the boundaries 
of the listing rules requirements). Based 
on feedback, it was well-received and 
provided greater visibility on the Group’s 
operations, which is of added value given 
the remote nature of the business from 
its listing in London. In light of this, the 
Company will aim to make such visits an 
annual occurrence.
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are available to speak with 
shareholders and did communicate from 
time to time with shareholders on specific 
issues during 2015.
The Company has made use of the services 
of JPMC as its corporate broker since its 
listing in 2006 and JPMC has supported 
and advised the Board through a number 
of challenging corporate transactions 
since 2012. However , the Board decided 
to appoint a second broker with a view to 
accessing a wider shareholder base. Under 
the direction of the Board, a sub-committee 
comprising the CFO, Company Secretary 
and Investor Relations Officer managed a 
formal tender process for the appointment 
of the second broker and, following the 
process, the Company appointed Investec 
Bank plc as its joint corporate broker to act 
alongside JPMC. 
The Company also views the AGM as 
an important process for liaising with 
shareholders  page 45. In previous 
years, there had been significant minorities 
voting against certain resolutions at the 
relevant AGM. Following these meetings, 
the Company had engaged with investor 
advisory groups to understand the 
concerns and the Board was pleased to 
note that, at the 2015 AGM, all resolutions 
were passed with at least 97% of the votes 
cast in favour .
Significant shareholders
As at 17 March 2016, being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of 
this Annual Report, the significant interests 
in the voting rights of the Company’s 
issued ordinary shares based on the last 
request for confirmation as to the beneficial 
ownership of voting rights in the Company 
(at or above 5% beneficial ownership) were

By virtue of the size of its shareholding in 
the Company, Lamprell Holdings Limited 
and its ultimate owner , Steven Lamprell,  
are “controlling shareholders” for the 
purposes of the UK’s Listing Rules. 
Accordingly, they were required to enter 
into an agreement with the Company to 
ensure compliance with the independence 
provisions set out in the Listing Rules 
(“Controlling Shareholder Agreement”). 
The Controlling Shareholder Agreement 
regulates the ongoing relationship between 
the Company and these controlling 
shareholders. The Company has complied 
with the independence and all other 
provisions in the Controlling Shareholder 
Agreement. So far as the Company is 
aware, the controlling shareholder has 
also complied with the independence 
and all other provisions in the Controlling 
Shareholder Agreement. The Controlling 
Shareholder Agreement represents a key 
component of the Company’s corporate 
governance structure. 
Communications with other  
key stakeholders
Lamprell’s core lending group is another 
key stakeholder group for the business 
and the debt facility terms represent 
a fundamental part of the Group’s 
governance structure as it includes certain 
banking covenants and restrictions.  
The management team provides regular 
updates on key aspects of the business 
to the lending group and the CFO 
communicates frequently with each of  
the lending banks to address any queries.
Finally, the Board places considerable 
importance on positive and effective 
interaction with the Group’s workforce 
and Lamprell’s internal Corporate 
Communications team coordinates 
campaigns for the management team 
to cascade key messages throughout 
the organisation. In 2015, there were 
campaigns relating to safety and IT 
security matters as well as the launch 
of the online training for the Company’s 
Business Code of Conduct. In January  
and July 2015, the CEO presented a series 
of “town hall meetings” at each of the 
three main facilities in the UAE, which were 
focussed on the Company’s performance 
and on developments within the business. 
The CEO also presented awards for  
long service and safety achievements  
to employees.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is primarily 
responsible for determining the Company’s 
remuneration policy, taking into account the 
best practices as well as the advice from 
external consultants on peer companies. 
Details of the Company’s policy on 
remuneration, the Directors’ remuneration 
for the year ended 31 December 2015  
and their interests in the ordinary shares  
of the Company can be found in the 
Directors’ Annual Report on Remuneration 
 page 61.
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover
Each year , the Board reviews and approves 
the level of the Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance cover to ensure that it is 
appropriate in light of the circumstances, 
size and risks within the business. This is 
subject to the usual exclusions such as 
fraud or dishonesty by a Director .  Corporate governance: Directors’ Report 47
Safety
We deliver world-class safety 
performance and leave nothing to 
chance so everyone goes home

Fiscal responsibility
Because every employee 
inﬂuences our costs, we are all 
accountable to ensure that we 
achieve the most cost effective 
solutions.
Integrity

with professional integrity, fairness 
and transparency and we are open 
and ethical in our day-to-day dealings

The Board recognises 
that Lamprell is an 
organisation which 
comprises stakeholders 
from a diverse array of 
cultural backgrounds and 
nationalities and so makes 
use of core values as a 
means to align the corporate 
culture. This ensures a 
common message around 
the key drivers for the 
business and ensures that 
all stakeholders are working 
towards the same goals.

COMMITTEE REPORT
Committee members
John Malcolm (Committee Chairman and 
Non-Executive Director)
John Kennedy (Executive Chairman)
Ellis Armstrong  
(Senior Independent Director)
Mel Fitzgerald (Non-Executive Director)
Debra Valentine (Non-Executive Director)
Committee attendance 
The Committee is comprised of five 
members, four of whom are considered to 
be wholly independent, plus the Executive 
Chairman of the Board. Aside from the 
members, the Company Secretary and the 
Group’s VP of HR are typically invited to 
attend meetings.
Remit of the Committee 
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for the structure, balance, diversity and 
experience on the Board and Committees, 
and for leading the evaluation of the 
Board’s performance and effectiveness. 
It also assesses the succession planning 
needs at the senior level. In addition, the 
Committee considers the implications of 
changes in the regulatory framework and 
advises the Board on the same. With the 
increased global concerns around security , 
the Board also delegated responsibility for 
overseeing the Group’s security activities 
to the Committee, which resulted in a major 
review of the Group’s security policy .
The Committee’s written terms of reference 
are reviewed annually and are available  
on the Company’s website.
Activities during 2015
The Committee devoted most time and 
resources to two Board priorities, namely 
the appointment of at least one additional 
independent NED and the need to finalise 
the Group’s long-term succession plan  
for the Board and management, with 
positive results. 
Independence on the Board was greatly 
strengthened with the arrival of Mel 
Fitzgerald and Debra Valentine, both of 
whom became independent NEDs. Both 
individuals are highly experienced in their 
own fields and bring complementary skill 
sets to the Board which were welcomed 
following the departures of Peter 
Whitbread and Michael Press. 
With these changes, the Committee 
reviewed the composition of the Board 
Committees as a result of the increased 
number of independent NEDs. In October 
2015, the Board (on the recommendation 
of the Committee) reconstituted each 
Committee with at least three members, 
which reduces the risk of a lack of quorum.
Following a review of benchmark external 
candidates, the Committee was able to 
recommend the promotion of Tony Wright 
to the role of CFO and Executive Director 
and of Niall O’Connell to the position of 
Chief Operating Officer , which the Board 
approved. This is the first chief officer 
position for each of these individuals  
but they are experienced senior 
managers and have had the benefit 
of working several years within the 
Group. The Committee anticipates that 
Mr Wright and Mr O’Connell have the 
potential to hold these roles for the 
long term, helping to ensure stability 
at the executive management level.
It has been a busy year 
for the Committee with 
the appointment of three 
new Directors following 
the departure of Peter 
Whitbread and Michael 
Press. However the key 2016 
priority for the Committee will 
be the executive search for 
the new CEO.

Meeting attendance 49 Corporate governance: Nomination & Governance Committee Report
With regard to the search for a new CEO, 
the Committee has made use of Korn Ferry 
and Maxwell Drummond, two executive 
recruitment specialist firms, because of 
their strong profiles in the industry, proven 
assessment processes and broad contact 
networks from which to source candidates. 
Save as disclosed, these companies had 
no other connection with the Company . 
The Committee, and the Board as a whole, 
recognise the significance of ensuring that 
the candidate has the necessary skill set 
and experience to lead the Group through 
the current tough market environment and 
grow the business in the coming years. 
For this reason, the CEO recruitment 
process was the highest priority for the 
Committee during 2H 2015 and followed 
a defined path including the identification 
of candidates on long- and short-lists 
followed by interviews with a number of 
leading candidates for the role. As at the 
time of publication, the replacement CEO 
with the required credentials has not yet 
been identified and so the search process 
is continuing. The Company will make 
further announcements once the candidate 
is identified.
Leadership succession planning 
The Board considers succession planning 
and internal talent management to be 
significant for delivery of the strategy . 
As part of the development process, the 
Board implemented formal, documented 
assessment and development programmes 
for Tony Wright and Niall O’Connell as part 
of their promotion processes. This helped 
the Board to assess their capabilities and 
competencies prior to their appointments 
and also ensures that they will be properly 
developed in the coming years to fulfil 
their more senior roles within the Group. 
The Committee received regular feedback 
from the VP of HR who administers the 
programme on behalf of the Board.
Looking at the broader management 
team, the Committee continued with the 
succession planning exercise initiated in 
2014 to evaluate the leadership team’s 
critical competencies and retention risks. 
The Committee continued to oversee that 
process and received regular feedback 
from management on talent development 
and training needs for the wider team.
The Committee considers that the Company 
has made considerable progress during 
2015 in strengthening effectiveness and 
depth of the senior management team and 
governance structures at Lamprell.
Diversity policy
Noting the benefits of diversity, the Board 
implemented a diversity policy which 
included the recruitment of a minimum  
of one female Director by the end of 2016. 
During the search process for independent 
NEDs, the Committee identified a number 
of highly qualified candidates which 
included Debra Valentine who joined  
the Board as a NED with effect from  
1 September 2015. This satisfied the goal 
well in advance of the proposed deadline 
but, more significantly, provides a broader 
range of competencies on the Board 
with Ms Valentine’s experience working 
as general counsel for a leading global 
enterprise in the extractive industries  
 page 37.
Within the wider management level, 
there is broader diversity of ethnicity and 
backgrounds.
Service agreements and letters  
of appointment 
Executive Directors are employed 
under Directors’ Service Contracts with 
termination notice periods of not more than 
12 months.
Non-Executive Directors are engaged 
pursuant to letters of appointment which 
do not have fixed terms but they are 
subject to re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders at intervals of not more 
than three years. All existing Directors 
have been elected or re-elected by the 
shareholders within the last year and new 
Directors will be proposed for election by 
the shareholders at the 2016 AGM.

AUDIT & RISK 
COMMITTEE REPORT
The Committee has been 
working closely with 
management to provide 
the necessary oversight on 
significant judgements and 
on enterprise risks, to ensure 
that the financial statements 
are fair , balanced and 
understandable.
Ellis Armstrong, Committee Chairman
Committee attendance 
Throughout 2015, membership of the 
Committee was comprised solely of 
independent NEDs. As a “smaller company” 
under the Code, the Committee needs 
to only have two members but the Board 
determined that it was in the best interests 
for the Committee to have three members 
and so the Committee was pleased to 
welcome Mel Fitzgerald in October 2015. 
Ellis Armstrong has relevant financial 
experience for the purposes of the Code. 
In combination, these points ensured 
the appropriate balance of financial and 
industry experience to assess the matters 
presented to the Committee. 
Aside from the members, the Company 
Secretary and the Group’s CFO are typically 
invited to attend the meetings. In addition, 
the external and internal auditors are invited 
to meetings at key times during the year . 
On occasion, other Board members and 
managers attend by invitation.
Remit of the Committee 
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for overseeing the integrity of all of the 
Company’s announcements relating to its 
financial performance, including its financial 
results  page 20, and for considering all 
matters relating to the terms of appointment 
for , performance and independence of 
the Company’s external auditors. The 
Committee advises the Board on whether 
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair , balanced and understandable.
The Committee also oversees the 
Company’s risk management system  
 page 16 as well as its internal control 
systems, and monitors the effectiveness  
of such systems particularly against 
potential ethical or fraudulent activities.  
This includes assessment of the 
whistleblowing hotline activities.
The Committee’s written terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website.

 » reporting on the whistleblowing 
statistics and reported cases 
Significant judgements in 2015
The Committee considered the significant 
judgements below during 2015. The 
Committee was satisfied that the 
judgements made by management were 
reasonable and that appropriate disclosures 
have been included in the accounts. 
External auditor – activities  
and performance
PwC have been the Company’s auditors 
since listing in 2006. During 2015, PwC 
presented to the Committee on various 
matters (including their audit report on the 
2014 financial results) on three occasions. 
PwC also provided the Committee with 
updates on changes to accounting, 
regulatory and corporate governance laws 
and regulations that impact the Company . 
The Company’s Policy on Auditor 
Independence, which is available on the 
Group’s website, is designed to safeguard 
the objectivity of our external auditors and 
to ensure the independence of the audit is 
not compromised. This Policy was reviewed 
in detail by the Committee in 2015 and then 
re-issued after Board approval.
Under the policy, all audit-related services 
or non-audit services must receive specific 
pre-approval of the Audit & Risk Committee 
if the total annual fee for all such services 
exceeds 50% of the sum of the annual fees 
for audit services. Any and all audit-related 
services or non-audit services in excess 
of this amount must be expressly pre-
approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. 
Further , in respect of all such other 
services, a tender process is required 
for any project or scope of work which is 
anticipated to generate fees in excess of 
USD 250,000. Accordingly, the auditor may, 
under certain conditions, be engaged to 
undertake non-audit services provided 
that it does not compromise the integrity of 
their audit work. However , it also sets out 
services that the auditor is prohibited from 
undertaking under any circumstances and 
there was no breach of the policy .
In 2015, PwC provided non-audit services 
with a total value of USD 101,014 (2014: 
USD 872,000) against an annual audit 
fee including Group audit fees with a 
total value of USD 568,061 (2014: USD 
663,000). This represents a significant 
improvement in the balance between audit 
and non-audit services over previous 
years and has occurred as a result of the 
drive by the Committee and management 
to reduce the non-audit services being 
performed by PwC.
The majority of the non-audit services 
performed by PwC related to use of PwC 
for in-country tax compliance services. 
Significant judgements considered by the Committee Views/actions of the Committee with respect to significant judgements
Impact of the disposal of the non-core service businesses on the financial 
statements
The Group completed the disposal of one non-core service business in  
1H 2015. The Committee received summaries of the accounting areas such 
as the valuation of intangible assets, any gains or losses on disposal and 
any subsequent fair value adjustments made.
Review of provisions At each meeting, the Committee evaluated management’s report on 
material provisions taken in respect of matters including doubtful debts, 
contract accruals, project risks and warranty issues. The adequacy 
and appropriateness of these provisions and disclosures required were 
discussed and challenged.
Revenue recognition and estimated cost to complete on major projects The Committee reviewed the reasonableness of judgements made 
regarding the cost to complete estimate, recognition of variation orders  
and adequacy of contingency provisions to mitigate contract specific 
risks. This was discussed with management and audited by internal audit 
to ensure the operating effectiveness of internal controls. The Committee 
satisfied itself that the Company’s financial statements had been prepared 
on the basis of the accounting policy and noted that the external auditors 
had audited the methodology on that basis.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker at the reporting 
date, namely the Executive Directors. With effect from 1 January 2015 the 
business was reorganised into business units on the basis of services 
rendered. Segment comparatives are restated to reflect the organisational 
changes on the basis of the geographic location from where the services 
are rendered. The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of this segment 
reporting and were satisfied that this is consistent with the reporting 
structure for the Group.
Significant judgements in 2015 Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
52 Corporate governance: Audit & Risk Committee Report
Performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor
Under the Committee’s terms of reference, 
it assesses the auditor’s independence, 
performance and effectiveness at least on 
an annual basis, placing reliance on self-
assessment by PwC of its performance, 
on feedback from certain senior managers 
that work closely alongside the auditors 
including the CFO and the Company 
Secretary, and on its own evaluation of 
PwC’s services based on the results of its 
audit work and the challenges presented to 
the views of the management team.
Given these incremental benefits of 
PwC’s involvement and the oversight 
by the Board, the Committee considers 
that the objectivity and independence of 
the external auditor were safeguarded 
throughout the financial year . The 
Committee also determined that PwC  
was effective in providing its services  
to the Group.
Auditor tender process for 2015
The Code provides that a listed company 
should put its external audit contract out 
to public tender at least every ten years. 
As noted in the Company’s 2014 Annual 
Report, the Committee decided that it was 
appropriate and timely to re-tender for the 
external audit services during 2015. 
The Committee led the audit tender 
process with the assistance of the CFO 
and the Company Secretary . Five audit 
firms – PwC as incumbent, Ernst & Young, 
Grant Thornton, Deloitte and KPMG – 
were invited to submit written proposals 
to act as the Company’s external auditor , 
followed by an initial assessment of the 
quality and detail of these proposals. 
A shortlist of four audit firms was then 
asked to make a detailed presentation to 
the Committee and to answer questions 
about their proposals. The Committee then 
assessed the presentations and credentials 
for the shortlisted firms and made a 
recommendation for the appointment of 
Deloitte LLP as the external auditor for the 
Company, which the Board approved.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness 
to be appointed and act as external auditor 
and a resolution to appoint Deloitte LLP will 
be proposed at the forthcoming 2016 AGM 
for their services in respect of the 2016 
financial year .
Interaction with internal auditors
The Company has a well-established and 
embedded internal audit (IA) function and 
the Head of IA presents to the Committee 
at least on a bi-annual basis, providing 
updates and analysis for the internal audits, 
and submitting a proposal for the internal 
audits for the subsequent year . 
Aside from leading the annual control  
self-assessment exercises that have  
been completed during the year , the  
IA function conducted the following audits 
during 2015:
 » Analysis of implementation of  
Project Evolution 
 » Payroll Management
 » Accounts Receivable Management
 » Surprise Cash Count
 » Service level agreement with key 
service providers
 » Procurement and Supply Chain 
Management
 » Equipment Hire Process
 » Project Management – New Builds
 » Project Management –  
Offshore/Onshore
There has been close interaction between 
the IA and Group risk functions in order to 
formulate the 2016 planned internal audits 
and necessary amendments to the IA plan 
may be made during the year , subject to 
the Committee’s approval, in instances 
where the level of risk increases, or 
decreases significantly, or circumstances 
within the Group change. 
As a matter of best practice the Committee 
meets with the internal auditor without 
executives present to discuss any sensitive 
matters or concerns. Equally and much in 
the same way as with the external auditors, 
the Committee reviews the performance 
and effectiveness of the IA function and 
remains satisfied of the effectiveness of 
the IA function.
Enterprise risk management
Each of the Directors acknowledges  
and accepts that the Board as a whole  
take responsibility for risk management 
 page 16, in line with the Code 
requirements. The Board has delegated 
the administration and monitoring of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems 
to the Committee. However , the day-to-
day responsibility for developing and 
implementing the internal control and risk 
management procedures resides with 
the executive management team which 
then reports on risk to the Committee. 
In 2015, management presented twice 
to the Committee, once in May and then 
again in December . The purpose of such 
presentations was to ensure that the 
Committee, and therefore the Board, has 
appropriate oversight of enterprise risks 
and their potential impact on the business, 
with a particular focus on the risks that are 
specific to the Group. A key emerging risk 
that received particular attention from the 
Committee was the heightened security 
threats from terrorism.
This two way disclosure and monitoring 
system for enterprise risks facing the 
Group provides the Directors with 
reasonable (but not absolute) assurance 
against material misstatements and losses.

mechanisms as well as the results of this 
system can be seen in the information 
relating to the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group, together 
with the mitigating factors  pages 16 to 19. 
Risk management is being embedded 
into the daily working life of Lamprell 
employees and how they complete 
projects, aside from the enterprise risk 
management being overseen by the 
Committee. This is being done with a 
view to identifying potential hazards and 
risks on a project at an early stage and 
taking mitigating actions accordingly . 
Risk is assessed formally at the business 
unit level through risk workshops and 
via the maintenance of project and 
department risk registers. In addition, 
a more comprehensive and rigorous 
bid authorisation model is being used 
by management bidding committees to 
evaluate proposals and cost breakdowns 
when bidding for new work.
Internal controls framework
The Company has a system of internal 
controls based around the following key 
features:
 » a strategy defined and overseen by  
the Board
 » financial planning including annual 
budgets, quarterly reviews and three 
year forecasting
 » oversight and approval of projects 
and/or contract awards either through 
executive management or the Board 
 » implementation and use of an 
integrated ERP system, linking the 
various business functions
 » policies and procedures which  
define the Group’s standards of 
business including a schedule of 
matters reserved for the Board,  
a clear organisation structure and  
a delegation of authority matrix 
 » the Company’s Business Code of 
Conduct framed according to the 
Group’s core values
There are also various policies and 
procedures which embed regulatory 
requirements into the daily operations of 
the Group such as the anti-bribery and 
corruption policy, the share dealing code, 
the insider dealing and market abuse 
policy and the whistleblowing policy .
There is a multi-lingual, secure 
whistleblowing hotline which was set up 
to allow staff members to report ethical 
breaches, irregularities or simply concerns 
on a confidential basis without any fear of 
recrimination. They are all key elements 
of an internal control system which is 
designed to assist in the achievement 
of the Group’s business objectives. The 
Group also launched an e-learning module 
on the Company’s Business Code of 
Conduct in 2015 which was compulsory 
for administration staff and to date over 
97% of such employees have completed 
the training. This is available in five 
languages, namely English, Arabic, Hindi, 
Malayalam and Tagalog, to help ensure 
greater completion. This training module 
is expected to be rolled out to the yard 
workforce, which does not typically have 
access to computers, in due course.
The Committee undertakes an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the systems 
of internal control including financial, 
operational and compliance controls 
and risk management systems. This is 
performed in collaboration with both 
the internal and external auditors and, 
where weaknesses have been identified, 
the management team was tasked with 
implementing further safeguards which 
will then be re-tested by the audit teams. 
The Committee reports on its monitoring 
and observations to the Board at least 
annually . The Directors are satisfied that, as 
a result of the systems and the oversight 
functions, the internal control environment 
is operating effectively .

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Committee has had 
to respond to challenging 
market conditions as well as 
changes within Lamprell and 
has successfully achieved a 
number of key milestones, 
notably in its succession 
planning at the senior 
management level.
Dear Shareholders, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased  
to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 December 
2015.
Performance and reward in 2015
Despite difficult market conditions 
throughout 2015, the Company successfully 
delivered net profit in line with the 
performance target but fell short of the 
threshold target on new business awards. 
Along with performance against personal 
goals (which are detailed on  page 65 
of this report) and the impact of the non-
operational fatality in the Group’s Kurdistan 
operations  page 31, these were the 
key factors driving the Company’s bonus 
payment of 44.6% of annual base salary  
to the CEO.
The Company announced on 14 August 
2015 that Mr Moffat would retire from his 
role as CEO effective 30 June 2016. The 
search for a new CEO is ongoing. Also on 
14 August 2015, the Company announced 
that John Kennedy had agreed to take up  
the role of Executive Chairman until the  
next AGM and Tony Wright had been 
promoted to the position of Chief Financial 
Officer whereupon he also became an 
Executive Director of the Board. Details  
of Mr Kennedy’s and Mr Wright’s 
remuneration are detailed later in this 
report. Mr Kennedy’s appointment and 
remuneration as Executive Chairman 
are very much focused around enabling 
the Company to drive shareholder value 
primarily through key strategic initiatives. 
Long-term incentive awards were granted 
in April 2015, in accordance with the rules 
of the performance share plan, details of 
which are given on  page 57. There were 
no long-term incentive awards vesting  
in 2015.
Remuneration policy for 2016
The proposed Remuneration Policy  
to take effect from the 2016 AGM is set  
out on  pages 55 to 60. We believe that  
our Remuneration Policy must adapt  
to the challenging market conditions  
and continue to attract and reward 
executive management for delivering  
strong performance. As such, the policy 
contains two proposed revisions that  
will be submitted for approval at the  
2016 AGM, specifically in relation to the 
long-term incentive plans. These are 
highlighted in the introduction to the 
policy on  page 56. As a result, the 
Board is recommending two resolutions 
to be submitted for approval by the 
shareholders at the AGM on 15 May 2016, 
one to approve the revised Remuneration 
Policy and the second to approve the 
changes to the long-term incentive 
policy . The Committee considers that the 
revisions to the policy may be necessary 
to secure a replacement CEO of the 
calibre required to move the Company 
to the next level of its development 
and, in turn, drive shareholder value.
The Committee is satisfied that the revised 
Remuneration Policy will ensure that we 
can continue to recruit and retain the right 
calibre of senior management to maximise 
shareholder value and deliver sustainable 
growth over the longer term.
We shall be seeking your support for 
each part of this report at the forthcoming 
AGM on 15 May 2016. On behalf of the 
Committee, I recommend this Remuneration 
Report to you and I hope that you will find it 
clear , concise and understandable.

Remuneration Policy 
This part of the report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and 
has been prepared in accordance with 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The 
Remuneration Policy for the Company has 
been developed taking into account the 
principles of the Code and the views of  
our major shareholders and describes  
the policy to be applied from 2016 
onwards. The Policy Report will be put  
to a binding shareholder vote at the 2016 
AGM and the policy will take formal effect 
from 15 May 2016.
Policy overview
The Committee is responsible, on behalf 
of the Board, for establishing appropriate 
remuneration arrangements for the 
Executive Directors and other senior 
management in the Group.
Our remuneration policy aims to drive 
continuous improvements in business 
performance and maximise shareholder 
value by offering remuneration packages 
that are appropriately balanced and are 
designed to enable the recruitment, retention 
and motivation of talented Executive 
Directors and senior management. 
In setting the remuneration policy , the 
Committee considers the remuneration 
policy and levels of remuneration for the 
wider employee population, compensation 
policies and practices in the UAE and also 
in the wider market. The Committee will 
ensure that the arrangements are in the 
best interests of both the Group and its 
shareholders, by taking into account the 
following general principles:
 » To attract, retain and motivate the  
best talent without paying more than  
is necessary .
 » To ensure total remuneration packages 
are simple and fair in design and valued 
by participants. 
 » To ensure that the fixed element of 
remuneration is determined broadly  
in line with market rates, taking 
account of individual performance, 
responsibilities and experience; and 
that a significant proportion of the 
total remuneration package is linked to 
performance-related incentives. 
 » To balance performance pay 
between the achievement of 
financial performance objectives and 
delivering sustainable stock market 
outperformance; creating a clear line of 
sight between performance and reward 
and providing a focus on sustained 
improvements in profitability and returns. 
 » To calibrate carefully all performance 
metrics and associated sliding scale 
ranges to ensure that performance 
is incrementally rewarded through 
stretching targets and that executives 
are not inadvertently incentivised to take 
inappropriate business risks.
 » To maintain the highest possible health 
and safety standards where any fatality 
that takes place in a facility operated by 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
may result in discretionary withdrawal or 
reduction of incentive eligibility .
 » To provide a significant proportion 
of performance linked pay in shares 
allowing senior management to build 
significant shareholding in the business 
and therefore aligning management  
with shareholders’ interests and the 
Group’s performance. 
 » To maintain appropriate governance and 
risk management through the application 
of holding periods and clawback 
provisions on incentive plan awards.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Company is committed to maintaining 
good communications with investors 
and in particular around compensation 
matters. The Committee also considers 
the AGM to be an opportunity to meet and 
communicate with investors and consider 
shareholder feedback received as a result 
of the AGM each year and guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more 
generally . This feedback, together with any 
additional feedback received from time 
to time, is then considered as part of the 
Company’s annual review of remuneration 
policy . The Committee will also seek to 
engage directly with major shareholders 
and their representative bodies should any 
material changes be made to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy . Details of the votes 
cast for and against the resolution to 
approve last year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Board Evaluation Process
Performance metric selection
The annual bonus is predominantly based 
on key financial performance indicators,  
to reflect how successful the Group has 
been in managing its operations. The 
balance is determined on performance 
against individually determined strategic 
objectives and annual operational targets, 
including HSE.
The LTIP performance measures reward 
significant long-term returns to shareholders 
and long-term financial growth. Targets 
take account of internal strategic planning 
and external market expectations for the 
Company and are set appropriate to the 
economic outlook and risk factors prevailing 
at the time, ensuring that such targets 
remain challenging in the circumstances, 
whilst remaining realistic enough to 
motivate and incentivise management. 
Only modest rewards are available for 
achieving threshold performance with 
maximum rewards requiring substantial 
outperformance of challenging strategic 
plans approved at the start of each year . 
Discretion
The Committee will operate the incentive 
plans in accordance with their respective 
rules, the UK Listing Rules and the HMRC 
rules where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains 
discretion over a number of areas relating to 
the operation and administration of certain 
plan rules. These include (but are not limited 
to) the following: 
 » Who participates; 
 » The timing of the grant of award and/or 
payment;
 » The size of an award (up to plan/policy 
limits) and/or a payment;
 » The result indicated by the relative  
TSR performance condition may be 
scaled back (potentially to zero) in the 
event that the Committee considers 
that financial performance has been 
unsatisfactory and/or the outcome has 
been distorted due to the TSR for the 
Company or any comparator company 
being considered abnormal;
 » Discretion relating to the measurement 
of performance in the event of a change 
of control or reconstruction;
 » Determination of a good leaver (in 
addition to any specified categories) 
for incentive plan purposes and the 
treatment of leavers;
 » Adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring and special 
dividends); and
 » The ability to adjust existing performance 
conditions for exceptional events so that 
they can still fulfil their original purpose.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving 
this Directors’ Remuneration Policy , authority 
is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or 
former directors (such as, the vesting or 
exercise of past share awards).
Relative to pay and employment  
conditions in the Group 
The Committee takes account of 
remuneration levels offered to the senior 
management team in the Group as well as 
the awards affecting the wider employee 
population. When considering the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration structure and levels, 
the Committee reviews base salary and 
incentive arrangements for the management 
team, to ensure that there is a coherent 
approach across the Group. Employees 
may be eligible to participate in an annual 
bonus arrangement and receive awards 
under the LTIP , Executive Share Option Plan 
(“ESOP”), Retention Share Plan (“RSP”) or 
Free Share Plan (“FSP”). Opportunities and 
performance metrics may vary by workforce 
level with specific business metrics 
incorporated where possible. 
While the Company sees communication 
among its employees as a key priority it 
does not formally consult with employees 
in respect of the design of the executive 
remuneration policy , although the 
Committee will keep this under review.  59 Corporate governance: Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration scenarios for the  
Executive Directors 
The charts below show an estimate of the 
potential range of remuneration payable for 
the Executive Directors in 2016 at different 
levels of performance. The charts highlight 
that the performance-related elements 
of the package comprise a significant 
portion of the Executive Directors’ total 
remuneration at maximum performance.
Assumptions:
1. The Executive Chairman’s remuneration is expressed 
on an annualised basis for ease of presentation and 
will be pro-rated according to his contract.
2. Base salary levels applying on 1 January 2016.
3. Benefits are estimated, based on the annualised 
value for the year ended 31 December 2015.
4. For the purpose of the above charts, the end of 
service gratuity accrual is excluded.
5. Minimum performance assumes no award is earned 
under the annual bonus plan and no vesting is 
achieved under the LTIP; at on-target, typically 80% 
of the maximum is earned under annual bonus plan 
and typically 40% vesting is achieved under the LTIP; 
and at maximum full vesting under both plans. 
6. As per the legislation, share price movement  
and dividend accrual have been excluded from the 
above analysis.
Directors’ recruitment and promotions 
The Committee takes into account the need 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and senior managers of the 
highest calibre, while at the same time 
ensuring a close alignment between the 
interests of shareholders and management.
If a new Executive Director was to be 
appointed, the Committee would seek 
to align the remuneration package with 
the remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders, including discretion to award 
an annual bonus up to 100% of base salary 
and an LTIP award up to 120% for the CEO 
and 100% for other Executive Directors, with 
discretion, in exceptional circumstances, 
to grant an award of up to 150% of base 
salary . Flexibility would be retained to 
set base salaries at the level necessary 
to facilitate the hiring of candidates of 
appropriate calibre in external markets and 
to make awards or payments in respect of 
deferred remuneration forfeited on leaving a 
previous employer . In terms of remuneration 
to compensate forfeited awards, the 
Committee would look to replicate the 
arrangements being forfeited as closely 
as possible and, in doing so, would take 
account of relevant factors including the 
nature of the remuneration, performance 
conditions and the time over which they 
would have vested or been paid. 
In exceptional circumstances and only 
on recruitment (e.g. to buyout the value 
of awards forfeited) the Committee may 
also award share options of up to 150% 
of base salary under the ESOP . Options 
will vest dependent on the achievement 
of agreed performance and/or retention 
conditions over a three-year period and will 
be exercisable up to the 10th anniversary 
of the date of grant. Dividends that accrue 
during the vesting period may be paid in 
cash or shares at the time of vesting, to the 
extent that the options become exercisable.
For an internal appointment, any incentive 
amount awarded in respect of a prior role 
may be allowed to vest on its original terms, 
or adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. Any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue.
The Committee may also agree that the 
Company will meet certain relocation and 
incidental expenses as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Non-Executive 
Chairman or NED, the fee arrangement 
would be set in accordance with the 
approved remuneration policy at that time. 
Directors’ service agreements and 
payments for loss of office 
The Committee reviews the contractual 
terms of the service agreements to ensure 
these reflect best practice. 
The Group’s policy is that Executive 
Directors should be employed on a rolling 
term, with a notice period not exceeding 12 
months and in the event of early termination, 
the Company will not make any payments 
beyond its contractual obligations. 
The Executive Directors’ service 
agreements are terminable on up to 
12 months’ notice. In circumstances of 
termination on notice, the Committee will 
determine an equitable compensation 
package, having regard to the particular 
circumstances of the case. The Committee 
has discretion to require notice to be 
worked or to make payment in lieu of notice 
or to place the Director on garden leave for 
the notice period. In case of payment in lieu 
or garden leave, base salary , benefits and 
end of service gratuity will be paid for the 
period of notice served on garden leave 
or paid in lieu. If the Committee believes 
it would be in shareholders’ interests, the 
Company may elect to make payments in 
three separate tranches; 50% within seven 
working days of the termination date; 25% 
three months after the termination date; and 
25% six months after the termination date. 
The annual bonus may be payable in 
respect of the period of the bonus plan year 
worked by the Director; there is no provision 
for an amount in lieu of bonus to be payable 
for any part of the notice period not worked. 
The bonus will be scaled back pro-rata for 
the period of the incentive year worked by 
the Director and will still be payable at the 
normal payment date. 
Long-term incentives granted under the 
LTIP will be determined by the plan rules 
which contain discretionary good leaver 
provisions for designated reasons (e.g. 
participants who leave early on account 
of injury , disability or ill health, a sale of 
their employer or business in which they 
were employed, or any other reason at 
the discretion of the Committee). In these 
circumstances a participant’s awards will 
not be forfeited on cessation of employment 
and instead will vest on the normal vesting 
date. In exceptional circumstances, the 
Committee may decide that the participant’s 
award will vest early on the termination 
date. In either case, the extent to which the 
awards will vest depends on the extent to 
which the performance conditions have 
been satisfied and a pro-rata reduction of 
the awards will be applied by reference 
to the time of cessation (although the 
Committee has discretion to disapply

performance conditions and time pro-rating 
if the circumstances warrant it). In the case 
of death of the participant, the award will 
vest at that time, irrespective of whether or 
not any performance conditions have been 
satisfied, and the award will not be time 
pro-rated. 
In respect of legacy options outstanding 
under the ESOP , the options will be 
determined by the plan rules which contain 
discretionary good leaver provisions for 
designated reasons (i.e. participants who 
leave early on account of injury , disability 
or ill health, a sale of their employer or 
business in which they were employed 
or any other reason at the discretion of 
the Board). In these circumstances a 
participant’s options will not be forfeited 
on cessation of employment but will vest 
on the termination date instead. The extent 
to which the options become exercisable 
depends, unless the Board determines 
otherwise, on the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been satisfied 
up until the termination date or such longer 
period as the Board may decide within six 
weeks of the grant date. The performance 
period will end on the termination date 
unless the Board determines otherwise. 
In the case of death of a participant, the 
option will become exercisable at that 
time, irrespective of whether or not any 
performance conditions have been satisfied, 
and the option will not be time pro-rated.
In the event of a change of control all 
unvested awards under the long-term 
incentive arrangements would vest, to the 
extent that any performance conditions 
attached to the relevant awards have been 
achieved. The awards will, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, be scaled 
back pro-rata for the period of the incentive 
year worked by the Director (although 
the Committee has discretion to disapply 
performance conditions and time pro-rating 
if the circumstances warrant it).

DIRECTORS’ ANNUAL REPORT  
ON REMUNERATION
This report has been 
prepared in accordance 
with Part 4 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 and 
9.8.6R of the UK’s Listing 
Rules. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be put 
to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the 2016 AGM. The 
information on pages 64 to 
67 has been audited.
Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for 
determining and agreeing with the 
Board the policy on Executive Directors’ 
remuneration, including setting the 
over-arching principles, parameters and 
governance framework and determining 
the initial remuneration package of 
each Executive Director . In addition, the 
Committee monitors the structure and level 
of remuneration for the senior management 
team and is aware of pay and conditions 
in the workforce generally . The Committee 
also ensures full compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in relation to 
remuneration. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available for review on the 
Company’s website. 
Members and activities of the Committee
The members of the Committee throughout 
the relevant period were Michael Press 
(Chair) (until 13 August 2015), John 
Malcolm (member throughout the year 
and as Committee Chair with effect from  
5 October 2015), Ellis Armstrong (member 
as from 5 October 2015) and Debra 
Valentine (member as from 5 October 
2015). Membership is comprised solely  
of independent NEDs. None of the current 
Committee members have day-to-day 
involvement with the business nor do 
they have any personal financial interest 
in the matters to be recommended. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee and the Vice-President, Human 
Resources and Administration attends 
meetings on a regular basis to present and 
provide related support. The number of 
formal meetings held and the attendance 
by each member is shown in the table 
below. The Committee also held informal 
discussions as required. 
External advice received
During the year , the Committee received 
independent advice on remuneration 
matters from New Bridge Street (“NBS”), 
a trading name of Aon plc. NBS did not 
provide other services to the Group during 
the year under review and there is no other 
connection between NBS and the Company 
or the Directors. The Committee also 
consulted with the CEO and Chairman but 
not in relation to their own remuneration. 
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Code of Conduct and adheres 
to the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in 
the UK. The Committee has reviewed the 
operating processes in place at NBS and 
is satisfied that the advice it receives is 
objective and independent.
The fees paid to NBS during the year  
were £13,300.
Shareholder voting at AGM 
At last year’s AGM held on 12 May 2015,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
received the following votes from 
shareholders (see table below).
Implementation of the Remuneration 
Policy for 2016
Base salary
In accordance with an agreement made 
with shareholders in 2014, the base 
salaries of Executive Directors were 
frozen until 1 January 2016. In setting the 
base salaries for 2016, the Committee 
considered external market data, as well as 
any increase in base salary for the senior 
management team and the workforce 
generally, where the average increases 
across the Group will be 3% for the general 
workforce and 0% for management levels. 
In view of the market data and the general 
market conditions, the CEO’s base salary 
for 2016 will remain the same as 2015.
Upon his appointment as Executive 
Chairman effective 13 August 2015, John 
Kennedy’s base salary was set relative to 
external market data and to the nature and 
duration of the appointment. 
Upon his promotion to the position of  
Chief Financial Officer effective from  
13 August 2015, Tony Wright’s base salary 
was set relative to external market data, his 
experience and on the basis that it would 
be subject to review, without commitment, 
on 1 October 2016. 
Accordingly, base salaries for 2016 are as 
follows:

Annual bonus for 2016
For 2016 the annual bonus opportunity  
will be 100% of base salary for the CEO 
and 85% of base salary for the CFO, 
payable in cash. 40% of the bonus will be 
based on sales, 20% will be based on net 
cash, 15% will be based on net profit set 
in relation to the Group’s budget and the 
remaining 25% will be based on strategic 
and/or personal targets, including safety 
performance. This structure is intended 
to provide a rounded assessment of the 
Group and management’s performance 
against defined targets which are aligned 
with the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The sales targets will be within a range 
from USD 800m to USD 1.4bn with 
associated pay-outs within the range of 
20 to 100% of target. The Committee 
considers any disclosure of future net 
profits and cash to be commercially 
sensitive, however , full retrospective 
disclosure of targets and performance 
against them will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Clawback provisions will apply to all  
bonus pay-outs.
Long-term incentives 
Subject to compliance with the Listing 
Rules, awards will be made in 2016 and 
the maximum LTIP potential will be 120% 
of base salary for the CEO and 100% for 
the CFO. 50% of the award will be based 
on relative TSR (relative to the FTSE World 
Oil Equipment & Services Index), 25% 
on cumulative EBITDA and 25% on end 
of period backlog. In view of the short-
term duration of the Executive Chairman’s 
appointment, no long-term incentive 
awards are expected to be made in 
respect of his current appointment.
Relative TSR, cumulative EBITDA and end 
of period backlog are considered to be 
the most appropriate measures of long-
term performance for the Group, in that 
they ensure the Executive Directors are 
incentivised and rewarded for the financial 
performance of the Group as well as 
returning value to shareholders.

End of Service Gratuity
As required under UAE Labour Law, the Company contributes to the End of Service Gratuity Fund on behalf of the Executive Directors, 
whereby the gratuity shall be 21 days’ base salary for each year of the first five years of employment and 30 days’ base salary for  
each additional year of employment thereafter , on the condition that the total gratuity does not exceed two years’ base salary, payable 
upon termination of employment. In view of the short-term nature of the appointment, end of service gratuity does not apply to the 
Executive Chairman.
Directors’ contracts
Following changes in directors’ appointments during 2015, the following information regarding the service contracts of Executive Directors 
should be noted.
Service contract for Executive Chairman
Mr Kennedy was appointed to the position of Executive Chairman on 13 August 2015 and his Service Agreement dated 13 August 2015 
is terminable by either party on three months’ notice. Mr Kennedy’s annual base salary is £480,000 and he is eligible to participate in a 
bonus arrangement with a maximum opportunity of 100% of base salary earned in the period which will be assessed over the period of his 
contract and paid wholly in shares. Mr Kennedy’s award of 292,570 shares is expected to vest upon the earlier of (i) three months after the 
end of the executive appointment, and (ii) the Remuneration Committee determining satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions. 
Service contract for CFO
As announced on 13 August 2015, aligned with the Company’s stated intention of internal development and succession, Tony Wright  
was promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer from his former role as Deputy CFO with the Group. Mr Wright was appointed  
on a Service Agreement dated 13 August 2015 which is terminable by either party giving nine months’ notice until the first anniversary of 
Mr Wright’s appointment at which point the agreement will be terminable on six months’ notice. Mr Wright’s annual base salary equates to 
USD 410,000 and his participation in the Company’s benefit programmes and incentive plans reflects the Company’s remuneration policy 
as set out elsewhere in this report.
Outside appointments
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate external, commercial Non-Executive Director appointments provided the 
aggregate commitment is compatible with their duties and does not cause a conflict of interest with the role of an Executive Director . Such 
Executive Directors may retain fees paid for these services, which will be subject to approval by the Board. During the year John Kennedy 
served as a Non-Executive Chairman of Maxwell Drummond International Limited.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Chairman’s remuneration is determined by the Committee and the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is  
determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, all of which is based on the responsibility and time committed to the Group’s 
affairs and appropriate market comparisons. Individual Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions regarding their own fees. 
The Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive no other benefits. For the duration of 2016, the Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees will be held at 2015 rates. A summary of the current fees are as follows:
Fee at 1 January 2016 
£000
Fee at 1 January 2015

Directors’ interests in ordinary shares 
The Committee has adopted a formal policy requiring the Executive Directors to build and maintain, through the award of shares by the 
Company, a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 150% of base salary for the CEO and 125% of base salary for the CFO, when 
appointed. Until such time as this threshold is achieved there is a requirement for executives to retain the net proceeds of all vested share 
awards. Mr Kennedy, Mr Moffat and Mr Wright have not currently achieved these guidelines. 
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company discloses the beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the  
Company as at 31 December 2015 as set out below. There were no changes to the interests of the Directors in the ordinary shares

68 Corporate governance: Statutory Information and Directors’ Statements
STATUTORY INFORMATION 
AND DIRECTORS’ STATEMENTS
The Board of Directors 
has taken into account the 
latest change in the UK 
Corporate Governance 
Code 2014 by including 
an appropriate viability 
statement, in addition to 
ensuring that this Annual 
Report is fair , balanced and 
understandable.
Memorandum and Articles  
of Association
The Company’s Memorandum of 
Association sets out the objectives and 
powers of the Company . The Articles of 
Association detail the rights attached to 
each share class, the method by which the 
Company’s shares can be purchased or 
re-issued and the provisions which apply 
to the holding of and voting at general 
meetings. The Articles also set out the 
rules relating to Directors (including by way 
of example, their appointment, election, 
retirement, duties and powers). 
Capital structure and corporate 
authorities
Details of the authorised and issued 
share capital together with details of 
movements in share capital during the 
year are included in Note 8 to the financial 
statements. The Company has one class of 
share in issue, ordinary shares of 5 pence 
each, all of which are fully paid. Each 
ordinary share in issue carries equal rights 
including one vote per share on a poll at 
general meetings of the Company, subject 
to the terms of the Articles and applicable 
laws. There are no restrictions on the 
transfer of shares.
Details of the Company’s employee share 
schemes are disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report  page 54 and in

The awards under the Lamprell plc Free

and Long-Term Incentive Plan are granted 
at nil price.
Pursuant to the Company’s share schemes, 
the Employee Benefit Trust as at the year-
end, held a total of 16,268 (2014: 16,217) 
ordinary shares of 5p, representing less 
than 0.01% (2014: 0.01%) of the issued 
share capital. The voting rights attaching to 
these shares cannot be exercised directly 
by the employees, but can be exercised 
by the trustees. However , in line with good 
practice, the trustees do not exercise 
these voting rights. In the event of another 
company taking control of the Company, 
the employee share schemes operated 
by the Company have set change of 
control provisions. In short, awards may, 
in certain circumstances and approved 
proportions, be allowed to vest early or to 
be exchanged for awards of equivalent 
value in the acquiring company .
The Company was given authority at the 
2015 AGM to make market purchases of 
up to 33,000,000 ordinary shares of 5p, 
which represented approximately 10% of 
the Company’s then issued ordinary share 
capital. This authority will expire at the 2016 
AGM, where approval from shareholders 
will be sought to renew the authority for 
approximately 10% of the Company’s 
current issued ordinary share capital.
Approval from shareholders will be sought 
to authorise the Directors to allot the 
unissued shares up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £4,900,000, representing 
approximately 30% of the Company’s 
current issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) to existing 
shareholders and to issue equity securities 
of the Company for cash to persons other 
than existing shareholders, other than 
in connection with existing exemptions 
contained in the Articles or with a rights, 
scrip dividend, or other similar issue, up to 
an aggregate nominal value of £825,000 
representing approximately 5% of the 
current issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company . Authorities were given by 
the shareholders at the 2015 AGM to issue 
a similar percentage of the Company’s 
then issued ordinary share capital. The 
authorities now sought, if granted, will 
expire on the earlier of the conclusion of 
the AGM of the Company next year and the 
date which is 15 months after the granting 
of the authorities. 69 Corporate governance: Statutory Information and Directors’ Statements
Contracts of significance
Except for the debt facility agreements 
which were concluded in 2014 and the 
Controlling Shareholder Agreement  
 page 46, the Company or Group does 
not have contractual or other arrangements 
which are significant to its business with 
any person.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company 
law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial 
year . Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union. The financial 
statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 » make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 » state that the financial statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
 » prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the  
Group and the Company will continue  
in business. 
The Directors confirm that they have 
complied with the above requirements in 
preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Isle of 
Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website, www.lamprell.com. 
Legislation in the Isle of Man governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
In accordance with the principles of 
the Code, the Group has arrangements 
in place to ensure that the information 
presented in this Annual Report is fair , 
balanced and understandable. The 
Audit & Risk Committee oversees the 
implementation of this approach. The 
Directors consider , on the advice of the 
Audit & Risk Committee, that the Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair , balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy .
Each of the Directors, whose names 
and functions are listed  pages 36 to 37 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 » the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Group; and
 » the Directors’ Report includes a 
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
As far as each Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. In 
addition, each Director has taken all the 
steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make him/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Strategic Report 
 pages 4 to 35. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial Review  
 pages 20 to 23. The Company’s 
consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis. 
After reviewing its cash flow forecasts  
for a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of signing these financial 
statements, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group  
will have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Directors have concluded 
therefore that it is appropriate for the Group 
to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial information has been 
prepared under the historical cost 
convention, except as disclosed in the 
accounting policies below.

INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF LAMPRELL PLC
Report on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated and parent company financial statements (“the financial statements”) of Lamprell 
plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) which comprise the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 2015 and the 
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated and company statements of changes  
in equity and consolidated and company cash flow statements for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory notes.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with applicable Isle of 
Man law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and parent company financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. This report, including the opinion, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982 and  
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with  
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from  
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error . In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating 
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
In our opinion:
 » the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and  
of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union; 
 » the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 
2015, and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982; and
 » the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report on the following: 
The Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 require us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 » proper books of accounts have not been kept by the parent company or , proper returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 » the parent company’s balance sheet is not in agreement with the books of account and returns; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations necessary for the purposes of our audit; and
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ loans and remuneration specified by law have not been complied with.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 » the Directors’ statements in relation to going concern and longer term viability; and
 » the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

1. The remaining balance of 51% in each case is registered in the name of a Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) National/Entities owned by a GCC National, but has assigned all the 
economic benefits attached to their shareholdings to the Group entity . The Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity via management agreements and, accordingly, these entities are consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries in these 
consolidated financial statements. These shareholders receive sponsorship fees from the Group (Note 24).
2. The beneficiaries of the EBT are the employees of the Group. 
3. A UAE free zone company (“FZCO”) is required to have a minimum of two shareholders and, consequently, the balance of 10% is held by an employee of LEL in trust for the 
beneficial interest of the Group. A resolution to liquidate this entity was passed on 30 December 2013. 
4. Sunbelt Safety Services Co. Ltd. Inc. was earlier known as Maritime International Agency Services Ltd (“MIAS”). It was renamed on 5 January 2014.
5. During 2014, the Group decided to dispose of Litwin. This transaction was completed on 21 April 2015. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Isle of Man Companies 
Acts 1931 to 2004. In accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the Company has not presented its own 
statement of comprehensive income. 
After reviewing its cash flow forecasts for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Therefore, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting polices below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated and parent company financial 
statements, are disclosed in Note 4.
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
IFRS 2 (amendments), ‘Share based payment’ clarifies various issues relating to the definitions of performance and service conditions 
which are vesting conditions. The clarifications are consistent with how the Group has identified any performance and service conditions 
which are vesting conditions in previous periods. The Group has adopted this amendment and it has no impact on the Group. 
IFRS 8 (amendments), ‘Operating segments’ requires disclosure of the judgements made by management in aggregating operating 
segments and clarifies that a reconciliation of segment assets must only be disclosed if segment assets are reported. The Group has 
adopted this amendment and it has no impact on the Group.
IFRS 13 (amendments), ‘Fair value measurement’ confirms that short-term receivables and payables can continue to be measured at 
invoice amounts if the impact of discounting is immaterial. It also clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 (measuring the fair value 
of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis) applies to all contracts within the scope of IAS 39 or IFRS 9. The 
Group has adopted this amendment and it has no impact on the Group.
IAS 19 (amendments), ‘Employee benefits’ regarding employee or third party contributions to defined benefit plans. The amendments 
clarify the accounting for defined benefit plans that require employees or third parties to contribute towards the cost of the benefits.  
The Group has adopted this amendment and it has no impact on the Group.
(b)  New and amended standards and interpretations mandatory for the first time for this financial year beginning 1 January 2015  
but not currently relevant to the Group
IFRS 3 (amendments), ‘Business combinations’ clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as liabilities (or assets) 
arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall within the 
scope of IAS 39. It also clarifies that IFRS 3 does not apply to the accounting for the formation of any joint arrangement. This amendment 
is currently not applicable to the Group, as the Group has no contingent consideration arrangements arising from a business combination.
IAS 16 (amendments), ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’ clarifies how the gross carrying amount and 
accumulated depreciation are treated where an entity measures its assets at revalued amounts. This amendment is currently not 
applicable to the Group, as the Group does not measure its assets at revalued amounts.
IAS 24 (amendments), ‘Related party disclosures’ clarifies that a management entity is a related party subject to the related party 
disclosures and is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. This amendment is currently not applicable  
to the Group, as the Group does not receive any management services from other entities.
IAS 40 (amendments), ‘Investment property’ clarifies that IAS 40 and IFRS 3 are not mutually exclusive when distinguishing between 
investment property and owner-occupied property and determining whether the acquisition of an investment property is a business 
combination. This amendment is currently not applicable to the Group, as the Group has no investment property .
(c)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2015  
and not early adopted 
IFRS 5 (amendments), ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’ regarding assets (or disposal groups) disposed  
of either through sale or distribution to owners. The amendment clarifies that changing from one of these disposal methods to the other 
would not be considered a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There is, therefore, no interruption of  
the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. This amendment must be applied prospectively . The Group intends to adopt these 
amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
IFRS 7 (amendments), ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ regarding servicing contracts. The amendment clarifies that a servicing  
contract that includes a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset. An entity must assess the nature of the fee and  
the arrangement against the guidance for continuing involvement in IFRS 7 in order to assess whether the disclosures are required.  
The amendment also clarifies that the additional disclosures relating to the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities only  
need to be included in interim reports if required by IAS 34. The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the  
accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.1 Basis of preparation continued 
(c)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2015  
and not early adopted continued
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.  
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary 
measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and fair value 
through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option 
at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the 
incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there were no changes to classification and measurement except 
for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic 
relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually 
uses for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under  
IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group  
is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 regarding the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture, 
addresses an inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate  
or joint venture. A full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised when a 
transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if those assets are in a subsidiary . The Group intends to adopt these 
amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These amendments are not anticipated to have  
any impact on the Group.
IFRS 11 (amendments), ‘Joint arrangements’ regarding acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, provides new guidance on how  
to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint venture operation that constitutes a business. The amendments require an investor  
to apply the principles of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a ‘business’.  
The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These 
amendments are not anticipated to have any impact on the Group. 
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from  
an entity’s contract with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability 
to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the goods or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction 
contracts’ and related interpretations. The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period beginning  
on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’. Under the new requirements, lessees would be required to recognise assets and liabilities 
arising from both operating and finance leases on the balance sheet. The effective date is 1 January 2019. The standard has not yet been 
endorsed by the EU. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 16.
IAS 1 (amendments), ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ Disclosure Initiative clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 
requirements. The amendments clarify: the materiality requirements in IAS 1; that specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss  
and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated; that entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present  
the notes to financial statements; and that the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must 
be presented in aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to 
profit or loss. Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement  
of financial position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016. 
Amendments to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’ regarding depreciation and amortisation, clarifies 
that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an 
activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the 
asset. The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
IAS 27 (amendments), ‘Separate financial statements’ regarding the equity method, allows entities to use the equity method to account 
for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. The Group intends to adopt these 
amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
IAS 19 (amendments), ‘Employee Benefits’ regarding the additional disclosures relating to the offsetting of financial assets and 
financial liabilities clarifies that these only need to be included in interim reports if required by IAS 34. The Group intends to adopt these 
amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016. 
IAS 34 (amendments), ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ clarifies that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial 
statements or incorporated by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the interim 
financial report. The Group intends to adopt these amendments no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial statements 82
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.2 Revenue recognition 
(a) Contract revenue 
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method. When the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated, 
revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated costs up to the year-end bear to the estimated total costs of the 
contract. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs 
incurred up to the year-end which are considered recoverable.
With respect to new build fixed price construction contracts with an expected contract duration of 18 months or greater , profit on such 
contracts will only be recognised when the contract has progressed to 20% based on the total estimated cost of the contract and the 
ultimate outcome can be reliably estimated.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of 
revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable  
that the customer will accept the claim and the amount can be measured reliably .
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, 
including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen.
The aggregate of the costs incurred and the profit/loss recognised on each contract is compared against progress billings at the year end. 
Where the sum of the costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss exceeds the progress billings, the balance is shown under 
trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of costs incurred and 
recognised profit or recognised loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables as amounts due to customers on contracts.
In determining contract costs incurred up to the year end, any amounts incurred, including advances paid to suppliers and advance 
billings received from subcontractors relating to future activity on a contract, are excluded and are presented as contract work-in-progress.
(b) Products and services 
Revenue from sale of products and services is recognised in the accounting period in which the risks and rewards are transferred or the 
service is rendered. 
(c) Interest income 
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.
2.3 Consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group  
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its  
power over the entity . Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owner of the acquiree and 
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from 
a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised 
amount of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair 
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase,  
the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations involving entities under common control do not fall within the scope of IFRS 3. Consequently, the Directors have  
a responsibility to determine a suitable accounting policy . The Directors have decided to follow the uniting of interests’ method to account 
for business combinations involving entities under common control.
Under the uniting of interest method, there is no requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities and hence no 
goodwill is recorded as balances remain at book value. Consolidated financial statements include the profit or loss and cash flows for the 
entire year (pre- and post-merger) as if the subsidiary had always been part of the Group. The aim is to show the combination as if it had 
always been combined.
Inter company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed or adjustments have been made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Financial statements 83
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.3 Consolidation continued
(b) Disposal of subsidiaries 
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, 
with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of related asset or liabilities. This 
may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(c) Joint arrangements 
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor . The Company has assessed the nature 
of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the 
equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s 
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in the consolidated income statement. When the Group’s share of losses in 
a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interest that, in substance, forms part of 
the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
(d) Associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under  
the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the 
investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill 
identified on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. 
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.  
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate  
and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of an associate’ in the consolidated income statement.
2.4 Investment in subsidiaries 
In the Company’s separate financial statements, the investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for impairment. Cost is the 
amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment. Income from such investments is recognised  
as dividend in the statement of comprehensive income. 
2.5 Foreign currency translation 
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s activities are primarily carried out from the UAE, whose 
currency, the UAE Dirham, is pegged to the United States Dollar (“USD”) and is the functional currency of all the entities in the Group 
(except MISCLP whose functional currency is the Omani Riyal, MISQWLL whose functional currency is the Qatari Riyal, LAK whose 
functional currency is the Kazakh Tenge and EBT whose functional currency is the Great Britain Pound). The consolidated and parent 
company financial statements are presented in US Dollars.
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement, 
except when deferred into other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated income statement  
within ‘finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the consolidated income statement within 
‘other gains/(losses) – net’. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial statements 84
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.5 Foreign currency translation continued
(c) Group companies 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have  
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 » assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 » income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and
 » all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is the purchase 
cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the expected useful 
economic lives of the assets as follows:
Years
Operating equipment 3 – 15
Buildings and infrastructure 3 – 25
Fixtures and office equipment 3 – 5
Motor vehicles 5
The assets’ residual values, if significant, and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably . All repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, capital work-in-progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment 
and depreciated in accordance with Group policies.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable 
amount (Note 2.22). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within  
‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the consolidated income statement.
2.7 Intangible assets 
(a) Goodwill 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Lamprell plc’s interest 
in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the value of the non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units 
(“CGUs”) or groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value 
less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) Trade name 
A trade name acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition  
if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . Amortisation is calculated  
on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. The useful life of a trade name is reviewed 
on an annual basis.

2.7 Intangible assets continued
(c) Customer relationships 
Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date 
of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably . Amortisation 
is calculated on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life. The useful life of customer 
relationships is reviewed on an annual basis.
(d) Operating lease rights 
Intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of acquisition where 
intangibles are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any . Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold right over its estimated useful life. 
(e) Computer software 
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs. Other 
development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development costs recognised  
as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives. 
(f) Work-in-progress 
Work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, work-in-progress is transferred to intangible assets in accordance with  
Group policies.
2.8 Inventories 
Inventories comprise raw materials, work-in-progress and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable 
value. Cost is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct purchase, direct labour and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
2.9 Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts receivable from customers for billing in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one 
year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor , probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within ‘general and administrative expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off 
against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against  
‘general and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated income statement.
2.10 Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from  
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented  
as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.11 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that  
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate of the amount  
of the obligation can be made.  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

2.12 Employee benefits 
(a) Provision for staff benefits 
A provision is made for the estimated liability for performance related bonus and employees’ entitlements to annual leave and air fare  
as a result of services rendered by the employees up to the balance sheet date. This provision is disclosed as a current liability and 
included in trade and other payables.
Labour laws in the countries in which the Group operates require the Group to provide for other long-term employment benefits.  
Provision is made, using actuarial techniques, for the end of service benefits due to employees, for their periods of service up to the 
balance sheet date. The provision relating to end of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability . Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise. The current service cost and interest cost is recognised in the income statement in ‘Employees’ 
end of service benefits’.
(b) Share based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received  
in exchange for the grant of the shares/options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions  
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
shares/options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares/options  
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement,  
with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company has granted rights to its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies conditional upon the completion of 
continuing service with the Group for a specified period. The total amount of the grant over the vesting period is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is recognised in each period as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary with 
a corresponding credit to retained earnings. 
In the separate financial statements of the subsidiary, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
equity instruments of the Company is recognised as an expense with a corresponding credit to equity .
2.13 Leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated income statement 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current accounts with banks less margin deposits, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the balance sheet.
2.15 Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the repayment value is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group capitalises general and specific borrowing costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing 
costs are recognised in consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan. The fee is capitalised and amortised over 
the period of the facility to which it relates. 
2.16 Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s consolidated and parent company financial statements in the period  
in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker .  
The chief operating decision-maker , who is responsible for allocating resources and accessing performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the Executive Directors that make strategic decisions.

2.18 Current and deferred income tax 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity . In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively . 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date  
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes 
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However , deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which  
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax liability 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.19 Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables. Currently, 
the Group does not have any available-for-sale and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which 
the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category 
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in 
the consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented  
in the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’ in the period in which they arise.
(b) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified  
as non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade receivables (Note 2.9), other receivables (excluding prepayments), receivables  
from a related party and cash and cash equivalents (Note 2.14) in the consolidated balance sheet and amounts due from related parties 
(Note 24), other receivables and cash at bank (Note 22) in the Company balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost less provision 
for impairment. The amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method. 
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the counterparty have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership.
(c) Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective 
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that 
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be 
reliably estimated. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial statements 88
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.20 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their 
fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument 
and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur , the cumulative gain or loss that was reported 
in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 28. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset  
or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement 
within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the item affects profit or loss (for example, when  
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated  
income statement within ‘other gains/(losses) – net’. However , when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition  
of a non-financial asset (for example, contracts work-in-progress or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity  
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately 
recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of contracts work in progress or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
2.21 Assets (or disposal groups) held for sale 
Assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
2.22 Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to amortisation and 
are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and 
its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment  
at each reporting date. Any material impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement and separately disclosed.
2.23 Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The excess of proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs over the par 
value of the shares is credited to the share premium.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares 
are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
3. Financial risk management 
3.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis to assess and manage critical exposures.  
The Group’s liquidity and market risks are managed as part of the Group’s treasury activities. Treasury operations are conducted within  
a framework of established policies and procedures. 
(a) Market risk – foreign exchange risk 
The Group has foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to balances in Euro and Saudi Riyal with certain suppliers. During the year 
ended 31 December 2015, if foreign exchange rates on foreign balances had been 10% higher/lower , the exchange difference would  
have been higher/lower by USD 139,602 (2014: USD 122,918).
NOTES TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Financial statements 89
3 Financial risk management continued
3.1 Financial risk factors continued
(b) Market risk – cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group holds its surplus funds in short-term bank deposits. During the year ended 31 December 2015, if interest rates on deposits had 
been 0.5% higher/lower , the interest income would have been higher/lower by USD 1,395,304 (2014: USD 1,358,744).
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate 
risk which is covered by the Group by taking fixed interest rate swaps against the variable rates. Under these swaps, the Group agrees with 
other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (mainly quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts. During the year ended 31 December 2015, if interest rates  
on borrowings had been 0.5% higher/lower , the interest expense would have been higher/lower by USD 462,028 (2014: USD 543,411).
(c) Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is detailed in Notes 15, 21, 22 and 28. The Group has a policy for dealing with customers with an 
appropriate credit history . The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, financial assets carried 
at fair value through profit or loss, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. The Group has a formal procedure of 
monitoring and follow up of customers for outstanding receivables. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties 
with a minimum rating of ‘B’ are accepted. The Group assesses internally the credit quality of each customer , taking into account its 
financial position, past experience and other factors.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had a significant concentration of credit risk with nine of its largest customer balances accounting 
for 88% (2014: 57%) of trade receivables outstanding at that date. Management believes that this concentration of credit risk is 
mitigated as the Group conducts credit checks internally and through expert third party providers for new counterparties or in support 
of major contracts, payment terms under contract are carefully managed and protection against non-payment is built into contractual 
documentation to ensure the Group has a right to remedy in the event of delayed/non-payment.

3.2 Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, or issue new 
shares to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and bank 
balances. Total capital is calculated as “equity” as shown in the balance sheet plus net debt. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has no net debt and was therefore un-geared.
3.3 Fair value estimation 
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
(a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
(b) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices)  
or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
(c) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
There are no assets at 31 December 2015 measured at fair value. The following table presents the Group’s assets that are measured

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all 
significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant 
inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
(a) Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
(b) Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are  
as follows:
Revenue recognition 
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the percentage-of-completion method 
requires the Group to estimate the stage of completion of the contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be performed  
in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.2. As a result, the Group is required to estimate the total cost to completion of 
all outstanding projects at each period end. The application of a 10% sensitivity to management estimates of the total costs to completion 
of all outstanding projects at the year-end would result in the revenue and profit increasing by USD 30.5 million (2014: USD 4.4 million)  
if the total costs to complete are decreased by 10% and the revenue and profit decreasing by USD 28.5 million (2014: USD 4.4 million)  
if the total costs to complete are increased by 10%.
Estimated impairment of goodwill 
The Group tests goodwill (Note 17) for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. Goodwill is monitored by management at the “cash generating unit relating to upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup 
rigs, fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors, including FPSO and other 
offshore and onshore structures, oilfield engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs” (“CGU 1”). This CGU 
also represents the operating segment UAE for the Group (Note 5).
The recoverable amount of CGU 1 is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates  
(Note 17). 
The amount of headroom is USD 311.6 million (2014: USD 290.6 million). 
If the revenue growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction of  
USD 3.9 million (2014: USD 5.7 million) in the headroom if the revenue growth rate was lower or the headroom would be higher  
by USD 3.9 million (2014: USD 5.7 million) if the revenue growth rate was higher . 
If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction in the headroom  
of USD 48.0 million (2014: USD 55.2 million) if the discount rate was to increase or an increase in the headroom by USD 54.2 million 
(2014: USD 63.5 million) if the discount rate was to decrease. 
If the net profit as a percentage of revenue used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be an 
increase of USD 66.4 million (2014: USD 62.1 million) in the headroom if the net profit was to increase or there would be an reduction  
in the headroom of USD 66.4 million (2014: USD 62.1 million) in the headroom if the net profit was to decrease. 
If the terminal value growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, there would be a reduction  
in the headroom of USD 35.5 million (2014: USD 43.4 million) if the terminal value growth rate was lower or an increase in the headroom  
of USD 40.8 million (2014: USD 49.8 million) if the terminal value growth rate was higher . Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Estimated impairment of investment in subsidiaries 
The Company tests investment in subsidiaries (Note 18) for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a potential impairment. The recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiaries is determined based on value-in-use calculations. 
These calculations require the use of estimates. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved 
by management covering a three-year period. 
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated revenue growth rate of 5% (2014: 5%). A discount rate of 
10.39% (2014: 10.46%) is used to discount the pre-tax cash flows projections to the present value. In determining the appropriate discount 
rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration the risk free rate of US treasury 
bonds with the long-term maturity period, UAE inflation rate, equity risk premium on the entities operating from UAE, Group’s beta and cost 
of Group’s debt.
The amount of headroom is USD 354.7 million (2014: USD 381.7 million).
If the revenue growth rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by  
USD 3.9 million (2014: USD 5.8 million) if the revenue growth rate was decreased or the headroom would be higher by USD 3.9 million 
(2014: USD 5.8 million) if the revenue growth rate was increased.
If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by USD 48.2 million 
(2014: USD 56.7 million) if the discount rate was increased or the headroom would be higher by USD 55.1 million (2014: USD 65.4 million)  
if the discount rate was decreased. 
If the net profit as a percentage of revenue was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower 
by USD 67.0 million (2014: USD 63.2 million) if the net profit as a percentage of revenue was lower or the headroom would be higher by 
USD 67.0 million (2014: USD 63.2 million) if the net profit as a percentage of revenue was higher .
If the terminal value growth rate was to differ by 0.5% from management’s estimates, in isolation, the headroom would be lower by  
USD 35.9 million (2014: USD 44.7 million) if the terminal value growth rate was lower or the headroom would be higher by USD 41.3 million 
(2014: USD 51.4 million) if the terminal value growth rate was increased. 
Employees’ end of service benefits 
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment defined benefit obligation should be based on market yields on high quality 
corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds should be used.  
In the UAE, there is no deep market for corporate bonds and no market for government bonds and, therefore, the discount rate has been 
estimated using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy . On this basis, the discount rate applied was 3.5% (2014: 3.5%). If the 
discount rate used was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the employees’ end of the service 
benefits provision at the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 1.0 million (2014: USD 1.5 million) lower or USD 1.4 million (2014: 
USD 1.6 million) higher . If the salary growth rate used was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the 
employees’ end of the service benefits provision at the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 1.4 million (2014: USD 1.5 million) 
higher or USD 1.0 million (2014: USD 1.6 million) lower . 
5 Segment information 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker at 
the reporting date. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Directors who make strategic decisions. 
The Executive Directors review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has 
determined the operating segments based on these reports.
In prior periods, the business reported on the basis of the facility from where the services were rendered. With effect from 1 January 2015, 
the business was reorganised into business units on the basis of services rendered. Segment comparatives are restated to reflect the 
organisational changes that have occurred since the prior reporting period to present a like-for-like view. 
The Executive Directors manage the business on the basis of the business units from which the services are rendered. Management 
considers the performance of the business from New Build Jackup Rigs (“NBJR”), Modules, (“MOD”), Offshore Platforms (“OP”) and  
Oil and Gas Contracting Services (“OGCS”). 
NBJR derives its revenue from assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors; MOD derives 
its revenue from fabricating packaged, pre-assembled and modularised units and constructing accommodation and complex process 
modules for onshore downstream projects; OP derives its revenue from construction of complex living quarters, wellhead decks, topsides, 
jackets and other offshore fixed facilities; and OGCS derives its revenue from rig refurbishment, land rig services, engineering and 
construction and operations and maintenance.
These business units are viewed by the management as three operating segments – United Arab Emirates “UAE”, Qatar “QTR” and 
Kazakhstan “KZK” – based on common pool of resources and ability to execute the projects on an interchangeable basis.

Free share plan 
The Company awarded shares to selected Directors, key management personnel and employees under the free share plan that provides 
an entitlement to receive these shares at no cost. These free shares are conditional on the Directors/key management personnel/employee 
completing a specified period of service (the vesting period). The award does not have any performance conditions and does not entitle 
participants to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is based on the 
share price at the date of the grant, less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

Executive share option plan 
Share options are granted by the Company to certain employees under the executive share option plan. This option plan does not entitle 
the employees to dividends. These options are conditional on the employee completing three years of service (the vesting period) and 
hence the options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date and have a contracted option term of 10 years. The Group has 
no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.

to the consolidated retained earnings. This includes a charge recognised in the income statement of the Company with a corresponding 
credit to retained earnings of USD 130,470 (2014: USD 15,000).
Performance share plan 
The Company granted share awards to Directors, key management personnel and selected employees that give them an entitlement to 
receive a certain number of shares subject to the satisfaction of a performance target and continued employment. The performance target 
related to the growth in the Group’s earnings per share. The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is based on the share 
price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

13 Earnings per share 
(a) Basic 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares 
(Note 25).
(b) Diluted 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the free share awards, options under executive share option plan and performance share plan, 
a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average 
annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share 
awards/options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming 
the exercise of the share awards/options. 
The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profit and numbers of shares:
2015 2014
Profit for the year (USD’000) 64,700 118,057
Weighted average number of shares for basic earnings per share 341,710,302 315,591,024

– Assumed exercise of the free share awards 51,331 3,640
– Assumed vesting of performance share plan 1,683,467 242,361

(Loss)/earnings per share from discontinued operations:

The 340,855 options (2014: 340,855 options) granted on 18 November 2014 are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings  
per share because they are antidilutive for the year ended 31 December 2014 and 2015. These options could potentially dilute basic 
earnings per share in future. Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Trade name represents the expected future economic benefit to be derived from the continued use of the MIS trade name acquired 
through the acquisition of MIS. 
Leasehold rights represent a favourable operating right acquired upon the acquisition of MIS and existing leasehold rights in the books  
of MIS on acquisition of Rig Metals LLC in 2008. The value of the intangible assets has been determined by calculating the present value 
of the expected future economic benefits to arise from the favourable lease terms of eleven to seventeen years. 
During 2014 and 2015, work-in-progress represents the cost incurred towards the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning 
software (“ERP software”). 
The Group amortises intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight line method over the following periods:

Goodwill is monitored by the management at the operating segment level. Goodwill of USD 180.5 million arising due to the acquisition  
of MIS has been allocated to the CGU 1.
The recoverable amount of CGU 1 has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of 
estimates. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on Group budget covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond 
the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term 
average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates. The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflect specific risks to the relevant 
cash generating unit.

1. Revenue growth rate for the first three-year period is based on the Group budget. Beyond this period, the growth rate is determined based upon past performance and management 
expectations of future market development. 
2. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the weighted average cost of capital employed, which takes into consideration the risk free rate of US treasury 
bonds with a long-term maturity period, the UAE inflation rate, an Equity risk premium on the entities operating from the UAE, the Group’s beta and the cost of the Group’s debt.
3. Net profit rate for the first three-year period is based on the Group budget. Beyond this period, the net profit rate is determined based upon management expectations of future 
market development. 
4. Terminal value growth rate is based upon management expectations of future market development.

27 Provision for employees’ end of service benefits 
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations at  
31 December 2015 and 2014, using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service benefits payable under  
the labour laws of the countries in which the Group operates. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an employee’s 
expected service life with the Group and the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. The obligation for end of service 
benefit is not funded. 
The movement in the employees’ end of service benefit liability over the periods is as follows:

The above charge of USD 0.1 million (2014: USD 0.1 million) is included in general and administrative expenses.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
2015 2014
Discount rate 3.50% 3.50%
Future salary increase:
Management and administrative employees 3.00% 3.00%
Yard employees 3.00% 2.50%
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment defined benefit obligation should be based on market yields on high 
quality corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds should be 
used. In the UAE there is no deep market for corporate bonds and no market for government bonds and, therefore, the discount rate has 
been estimated using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy . On this basis, the discount rate applied was 3.5% (2014: 3.5%). 
The rates used for future salary increase are long-term assumptions which take into account inflation, relevant factors in the employment 
market and the Group’s own expectations. Based on these factors, the future salary increase rate for Yard employees has increased from 
2.5% to 3%. 
Due to the nature of the benefit, which is a lump-sum payable on exit for any cause, a combined single decrement rate has been used  
as follows:
Percentage of employees at each 
age exiting the plan per year
2015 2014
Yard employees:
20 – 29 years 16% 16%
30 – 44 years 10% 10%

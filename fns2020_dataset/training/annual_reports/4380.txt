NETWORKS
Voice networking is a market in huge
transition. Voice networks now need
to be flexible, supporting mobile
workforces that need to be connected
to their customers anytime, anyplace,
anywhere. Voice over IP has now
become a mature technology in the
UK telecommunications market,
offering customers this flexibility and
at a reduced cost. 
Daisy’s portfolio is continuously
evolving to reflect this change, and
we provide solutions that enable our
customers to take advantage 
of new technologies whilst
continuing to make the most of
their current investments.
The development of Daisy SIP trunks
has enabled us to complement or
replace traditional voice circuits and
enable customers to benefit from
reliable and feature-rich cloud-based
services at reduced costs. They can
also be integrated with mobile
technologies to offer fixed-mobile
convergence, supporting remote and
flexible working.
As businesses seek to improve
customer satisfaction, Daisy’s
inbound solutions provide customers
with intelligent call-handling services
that enhance the functionality of both
legacy and new systems. Daisy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

DATA
As the business world prepares for
“the internet of everything”, Daisy’s
data footprint and capabilities have
continued to develop and grow.
Ongoing investment has enabled
Daisy to build a strong foundation for
its digital platform. We operate a
modern, high speed, secure network
with interconnects into all major UK
carriers and data centres.
Connectivity options range from
Broadband and Ethernet services to
directly-connected fibre and
wavelength technology.
Daisy’s tier 3 data centres are
geographically spread across the UK
and are directly connected into our
network. These employ high quality
security and environmental
technologies, making them a safe 
and cost-effective alternative for
companies who have identified 
the benefits of hosting and 
cloud technologies.
These data centres host a range of
Daisy solutions, from co-location 
and managed hosting through to
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and
Unified Communications as a 
Service (UCaaS). 
We wrap these offerings in a rich
portfolio of managed services
solutions, supporting packaged
products to service small businesses
and more bespoke offerings for the
enterprise customer, delivered on
premise, in our cloud, the public
cloud or a hybrid of these. Overview

MOBILE
Daisy is one of the UK’s largest
independent mobile service providers
to the business community.
Whether for a growing business or a
large enterprise, we have the ability
to tailor mobile packages to suit any
business requirement.
Daisy offers a range of mobile
connections and devices, working
in conjunction with the major
mobile network operators
and manufacturers.
With the advent of Bring Your Own
Device and the ever-increasing
demands on data security, Daisy has
invested in enabling solutions such as
Mobile Device Management (MDM),
which provide device security and
compliance. These technologies
control and protect the confidentiality
and integrity of both the device and
business data, reducing support costs
and mitigating business risk.
Daisy’s billing platform enables us to
provide customers with a single bill
for both their fixed and mobile
telephony and we are now also
offering customers “one number”
solutions that work across any device. Overview

Daisy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Chairman’s statement
OVERVIEW
This year has seen Daisy Group plc and its subsidiaries
(together “Daisy Group” or “the Group”) further bolster
its position as an industry-leading provider of IT
services and unified communications to the SME and
mid-market business sector in the UK. 
We are proud to have built a long-term, sustainable
business and I would like to thank our staff for their
continued support and hard work in making this
possible. During the year the Group has continued to
develop and enhance its product range through its
corporate acquisition strategy. Revenue has grown by
0.3%, from £351.5 million to £352.7 million and adjusted
EBITDA has been increased from £56.3 million to 
£57.9 million. Basic adjusted earnings per share have
increased by 6.1% from 13.05 pence to 13.85 pence. As a
result of increased exceptional costs associated with
the acquisition and integration activity, operating losses
calculated after charging amortisation of intangible
assets, depreciation, exceptional items and taking into
account share-based payment costs/(credits) have
increased to £17.9 million from £16.8 million. Basic loss
per share has reduced from 6.38 pence to 6.06 pence.
Whilst lower than in the previous year, cash generation
continues to be robust and representative of the 
strength of the Group’s business model. Cash generated
from operations in the year was £44.2 million (2013: 
£47.6 million) as a result of investment in working capital
associated with large managed service contracts and also
higher exceptional costs associated with acquisitions,
integration activity and property rationalisation. 
ACQUISITIONS
During the year the Group acquired Daisy Data Centre
Solutions Limited (“DDCS”), MoCo Holdings Limited
(“MoCo”), Indecs Computer Services Limited and Indecs
Computers Limited (together “Indecs”) and ABSE
Limited (“ABSE”). These acquisitions significantly
increase our capabilities and the range of products
available to our customers, whilst reducing reliance on
legacy fixed line business. Of particular note is the
addition of IT support services to the Daisy product
portfolio following the acquisition of Indecs, as well as
the increased data centre capacity now offered following
the acquisition of DDCS. A total of £35.3 million in 
cash has been paid out as consideration for the four
acquisitions completed during the year, with the
potential of a further £4.4 million to be paid over the
next two years dependent upon the trading performance
of the ABSE customers.
Since the year end we have acquired Layer 3 Advanced
Business Solutions Ltd (“Layer 3”), for an initial
consideration of £1.8 million. The acquisition will further
complement Daisy’s existing LAN and WiFi capability and
we look forward to reporting on progress in the future.
FUNDING
We would like to thank our group of six banks for their
continued support throughout the year. Net bank debt at
31 March 2014 was £111.3 million (2013: £81.2 million)
and at the year end the Group had unutilised bank
facilities of £40.0 million (2013: £80.0 million).
OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The Group’s strategic acquisition programme, executed
over the past five years, has substantially broadened the
product range offered to our customers and reduced the
dependence on legacy fixed line network services.
We strive for continuous improvement and make
operational improvements as we integrate businesses
acquired and invest in the development of our
proprietary software platform to provide greater
business efficiency and benefits to customers. We will
continue to invest internally in addition to implementing
further acquisitions where we see strategic
opportunities to enhance value for our shareholders. Daisy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACKS
Consistent with the policy announced last year, the
board is proposing a final dividend of 3.1 pence per
share, taking the full-year dividend to 4.6 pence per
share (2013: 4.0 pence per share). Subject to
shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting on
16 September 2014, the final dividend will be payable on
17 October 2014 to shareholders registered at the close
of business on 26 September 2014. I am pleased to
confirm our intention to grow the dividend at a rate of
15% for the next financial year.
The board will also periodically consider the return of
surplus capital by way of share buybacks. The board’s
aim is to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst
also retaining access to available funds to support
accretive acquisitions. The board will seek a renewal of
the shareholder permission to carry out share buybacks
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
OUTLOOK
We remain focused on our approach of adding long-
term shareholder value through a strategy of both
organic growth and growth by acquisition, whilst taking
advantage of opportunities to provide more services to
our existing customers. Our strategy is delivering
results and we have built a strong business and have a
solid foundation from which to develop even further.

Executive Chairman

“The board is proposing a
final dividend of 3.1 pence
per share, taking the full-
year dividend to 4.6 pence
per share” OVERVIEW
Once again, our performance this year has been robust
and we have made further progress with our strategic
aim of being the provider of choice for IT services 
and unified communications to the UK SME and 
mid-market sector.

Operating loss (17.9) (16.8)
Cash generated from operations 44.2 47.6

Revenue has grown with the contribution from
acquisitions offsetting the well understood market
trends of reducing fixed line revenues and the impact of
regulation on mobile tariffs.
This year we have enhanced our product portfolio and
we have continued to reduce our reliance on our
traditional voice business. New acquisitions have
brought further strengths in data and systems. 
In particular, the acquisition of DDCS has added
significant capacity and capability to the existing 
hosting and managed services operations.
The Group has delivered a solid performance this year
in a difficult economic climate. I would like to thank our
employees across the Group for the effort and
commitment that has made this possible.
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our primary market is the SME and mid-market
business sector within the UK and our aim is to develop
the business through a strategy of organic and
acquisitive growth.
The acquisitions completed during the year are set 
out below.
On 1 May 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued
share capital of DDCS, the data specialist. This
acquisition has added significant breadth to our existing
data business and has added the infrastructure and data
capacity for further growth. DDCS has been integrated
with our existing data business in Daisy Retail.
On 26 June 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued
share capital of MoCo, the distributor and reseller of
business mobile and telecommunications. This business
has been successfully integrated into our Daisy
Distribution division.
On 26 October 2013 the Group completed the acquisition
of Indecs, the market-leading provider of technical
maintenance and support services for business critical,
IT server and cloud storage facilities. This business has
been successfully integrated with our existing partner
services business in the Daisy Wholesale division.
On 16 February 2014, the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of ABSE, the business partner in
the public sector division of the Daisy Retail business,
with a particular specialism in network products.
Following the acquisition, the business has been fully
integrated into the Daisy Retail division.
DIVISIONAL REPORTING
The Group operates three distinct trading divisions:
Daisy Retail, Daisy Wholesale and Daisy Distribution.
The components of each operating segment have been
re-assessed by the chief operating decision-maker and
re-aligned with the current management reporting
structure. Prior period results have been adjusted to
ensure the divisional operating (loss)/profit results are
stated on a comparable basis.

Adjusted EBITDA 45.4
Adjusted EBITDA % 18.6%
Networks margin has increased to 41.4% (2013: 40.4%).
The underlying gross margin from fixed lines and calls
has been improved through improved commercial
terms and pricing arbitrage in respect of lower-cost
voice traffic for mobile-terminated calls. 
In line with our expectations, the market for traditional
fixed line access and calls has continued to decline.
These legacy products have diminishing significance as
we diversify our product range and increasingly provide
new technologies and mobile and data-led solutions to
our customers. Nonetheless, we are working hard to
ensure margins are maintained via continued
enhancement activity such as consolidation of supply,
improved volume discounts and product bundling to
provide improved customer value.
Our data revenue has increased with the acquisition of
DDCS within the year, which has also led to improved
gross margin to 44.8% (2013: 41.1%) as a result of a
higher mix of hosting and managed service products.

DIVISIONAL REPORTING continued
Daisy Retail continued
Investment in our existing data centres and the
acquisition of DDCS has increased available capacity
and improved our facilities, providing a significant
opportunity for further growth in the market. 
Overall revenues in systems have fallen with increased
focus on recurring revenue streams over one-off sales,
with gross margins similar to the prior year at 56.5%
(2013: 56.3%). 
During the year, within our Daisy Surgery Line business
we have developed new system solutions in response to
a change in customer requirements. This has had the
effect of reducing revenues in systems by £2.0 million
and in networks by £3.0 million.
The revenue in mobile has fallen to £33.8 million 
(2013: £40.0 million) whilst gross profit has increased 
to £13.7 million (2013: 13.0 million) reflecting improved
commercial terms with one of the major mobile
networks. As a result of the change in commercial
terms, buying rates have improved but there has 
been a reduction in the overall level of connection
bonuses received.
Our success in Daisy Retail is driven by our ability to
increase the number of products and services taken by
our customer base, retention of the base through
excellent customer service and our ability to drive
further efficiencies and improvements in our processes.
Below is an analysis of the percentage split of the
average number of products per customer for the
directly-owned base within Daisy Retail. Products are
defined as calls, lines, inbound telephony services,
mobile, internet services, hosted solutions

The division has continued to focus on cross-selling

Efficient administrative functions continue to be
important to us and I am pleased to report that at

Our Wholesale data business (principally aggregated
broadband services) continues to enjoy higher gross
margins than those traditionally seen in networks. 
The post-acquisition results of Indecs have been
included within systems.
The main area of growth during the year has been in the
systems product which has benefitted from the full-year
effect of The Net Crowd Limited (“TNC”), acquired in
January 2013, together with the post-acquisition results
of Indecs. This, together with some operating cost
efficiencies, has resulted in a significant improvement in
adjusted EBITDA to £9.7 million (2013: £6.7 million). We
anticipate further progression during the next financial
year as we see the full-year benefit of the acquisition.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER GROWTH
We have a highly skilled executive team capable of
building on the Group’s position as the main
consolidator and the leading independent provider of 
IT services and unified communications to the SME and
mid-market business segment. We will continue to
evaluate and execute acquisitions that help build
strategic advantage and where we can see value for 
our shareholders.
We have invested £2.4 million in software development
this year (2013: £2.1 million). This investment has
ensured that we have the required customer
relationship management and billing systems that will
enable us to service a growing customer base taking
multiple products, over the medium term. In addition,
we have enhanced our network infrastructure and data
centres in preparation for future growth. Property, plant
and equipment additions totalled £4.3 million during the
year (2013: £3.1 million), with the bulk of this
expenditure relating to new network infrastructure
equipment at our various locations.
We will continue to further develop our processes and
systems and we will continue to invest to ensure that 
we have the right infrastructure to support our 
growth strategy.
SUMMARY
The last 12 months have seen Daisy Group make good
progress with both organic and acquisitive growth,
reinforcing the Group’s position in the market place.
We have in place the platform, the systems, the people
and the product set to allow us to grow both organically
and via strategic acquisitions.
Against a difficult economic backdrop, we believe we are
well positioned to make further progress towards our
aim of being the IT services and unified communications
provider of choice to the SME and mid-market sectors.
Matthew Riley 
Chief Executive Officer
16 June 2014 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW
Daisy Group plc (“the Company”) is a holding company.
Daisy Group provides telecommunications and IT
services primarily to the SME and mid-market business
sectors. The Group provides a combined product set
including access, hosting, voice, data, managed services
and mobile telephony.
The directors present a strategic report as required by
section 414(1) to 414(5), of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is set out below together with the contents
of the Chairman’s statement on pages 12 and 13, the
Chief Executive’s review on pages 14 to 19 and the
financial review on pages 23 to 27.
ACQUISITIONS
During the year the Group made four corporate
acquisitions. A further corporate acquisition was made
after the year end. Further analysis of these acquisitions is
provided in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements
and also in the financial review on pages 24 and 25.
Given that the Group has made a number of
acquisitions, certain one-off direct acquisition costs
have been expensed in the income statement as
incurred. These costs are disclosed in note 8 of the
financial statements. Following an acquisition, it is part
of our strategy to integrate the acquired businesses
where possible into the existing Daisy Group business.
This leads to additional costs for integration activity.
These costs are also included in note 8 of the 
financial statements.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
KPIs, which are set at Group level, have been devised to
allow the board and shareholders to monitor the
performance of the Group, as well as the operating
businesses within the Group.
The Group has financial KPIs that it monitors on a
regular basis at board level and where relevant at
divisional management meetings as follows:
• Adjusted EBITDA: £57.9 million (2013: £56.3 million)
• Revenue: £352.7 million (2013: £351.5 million)
• Free cash flow: £34.9 million (2013: £38.6 million)
• Net debt: £114.0 million (2013: £81.2 million)
The Group has non-financial KPIs that it monitors on a
regular basis at board level and where relevant at
divisional management meetings, which are principally
as follows:
• E-billing penetration
• Product penetration
• Direct debit penetration
More detail behind these KPIs is included in the Chief
Executive’s review.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Group is affected by a number of risks and
uncertainties, not all of which are wholly within its
control. Although many of the risks and uncertainties
are macro-economic, and likely to affect the
performance of businesses generally, others are
particular to the Group’s operations.
This section is intended to highlight the principal risks
and uncertainties affecting the Group’s business. 
Some risks may be unknown to the Group and others,
currently regarded as immaterial, could turn out to be
material and therefore this section may not provide an
exhaustive and comprehensive analysis of all risks and
uncertainties affecting the Group or which may have the
potential to adversely impact the Group’s business.
The Group has a risk management process for
identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks.
The Group risk register captures the most significant
risks facing the business. Each risk is assigned 
to a senior management owner responsible for
monitoring and evaluating the risk and the appropriate
mitigation strategies.

Daisy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
continued 
The key operational risk to the Group is any
deterioration of the global and UK economy. The level
of business activity could be impacted by continued
economic uncertainty and could lead to a reduction in
revenue, profitability and cash generation. Should
markets weaken, it may become difficult for the
Group’s operational businesses to maintain volumes
and pass on price increases to customers. Cash
collection could potentially prove more difficult and
bad debts may arise as customers suffer from the
economic environment.
The following risks may impact the performance of 
the Group:
• Contracts with suppliers
The Group resells the products of its suppliers, and
whilst it has the freedom to substitute certain of these
products, management acknowledges that the Group
has a reliance on contracts with its suppliers such as
BT, Cable & Wireless, Vodafone, O2, EE and Verizon. 
The Group closely manages relationships with its main
suppliers and seeks to mitigate the risk created by this
reliance by building strong relationships with such
suppliers throughout the business in order to
understand and respond to their expectations.
• Integration
The significant growth of the Group over the last few
years has been driven by acquisition and the Group’s
strategy includes the acquisition of further businesses
where they are earnings enhancing. Management
recognises that there is a risk of operational
disturbance in the course of integrating acquired
businesses into the Group’s existing operations. This
risk is mitigated by detailed planning and due diligence
by the Group’s senior management team and their
oversight and execution of the integration of acquired
businesses, in each case to safeguard future financial
performance and achieve planned synergies.
• Technological change
The market for the Group’s services is characterised by
technological developments and changes, frequent
introductions of new products and services and evolving
industry standards. There is a risk that the Group may
fail to secure the necessary contracts to supply its
customers with the latest technology. The Group
mitigates this risk by maintaining close relationships
with suppliers, which it believes will keep it at the
forefront of product development on a sustained basis,
and regularly monitors trends in technological
advancement so as to anticipate and plan for 
future changes.
• Key resources
Consistent with groups of a similar size, the Group is
managed by certain key personnel, including executive
directors and senior management who have significant
experience within the Group and the wider IT
communications sectors and who may be difficult to
replace. Furthermore, the Group depends on being able to
recruit and retain sales and marketing employees of an
appropriate calibre to win and service significant
contracts. The Group has sought to mitigate this resource
risk by investing in staff training programmes, competitive
reward and compensation packages, management
incentive schemes and succession planning.
• Regulatory change
The Group recognises that the pricing of products 
and services and the activities of major industry
organisations, such as BT, may be affected by the
actions of regulatory bodies in the UK and the EU. 
Such actions could affect the Group’s profitability either
directly or indirectly. The Group mitigates this risk by
constantly monitoring and assessing the likelihood and
potential impact of regulatory change.
This report was approved by order of the board on
16 June 2014.

Overview
Financial review
The trading results of the Group for the year ended
31 March 2014, comprising the trading results of 
the three operating divisions, Daisy Retail, Daisy
Wholesale and Daisy Distribution, together with
central costs, have been included within 
continuing operations.
ACQUISITIONS
Acquisition of Daisy Data Centre Solutions Limited
(“DDCS”)
On 1 May 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued
share capital of DDCS for a cash consideration of
£7.5 million. DDCS is a data specialist, providing
managed services from two data centres in Reading
and Gateshead.
In the accounts for DDCS for the 7 months to
31 March 2013, which include the trade acquired from
2e2 on 14 February 2013, revenue of £1.2 million was
reported with an adjusted loss before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation of £0.6 million. In the
year DDCS contributed revenue and adjusted EBITDA
of £13.6 million and £1.4 million respectively.
This business has been integrated with our existing
data business in Daisy Retail.
Acquisition of MoCo Holdings Limited (“MoCo”)
On 26 June 2013 the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of MoCo for a cash
consideration of £1.9 million. MoCo is an
independent distributor and reseller of business
mobile and telecommunications and trades through
a network of channel partners. In addition to its
business mobile services, MoCo also offers a range
of fixed line, data and IT solutions to partners and
end-user customers.
In the year MoCo contributed revenue and adjusted
EBITDA of £4.5 million and £0.4 million respectively.
Acquisition of Indecs Computer Services Limited and
Indecs Computers Limited (together “Indecs”)
On 26 October 2013 the Group completed the
acquisition of Indecs for a cash consideration of
£18.0 million. Indecs is a market-leading provider 
of technical maintenance and support services 
for business critical, IT server and cloud 
storage facilities.
In the year Indecs contributed revenue and adjusted
EBITDA of £5.5 million and £1.3 million respectively.
This business has been integrated with our existing
partner services business in the Daisy 
Wholesale division.
Acquisition of ABSE Limited (“ABSE”)
On 16 February 2014, the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of ABSE for an initial cash
consideration of £7.9 million. Prior to its acquisition
ABSE acted as a business partner in the public
sector division of the Daisy Retail division, with a
particular specialism in network products. Following
acquisition, the business has been fully integrated
into the Daisy Retail division.
An earn-out agreement is in place to reward the
vendors based on performance of the acquired
assets which runs to February 2016. The resulting
contingent consideration payment is currently
expected to be up to £4.4 million.
Acquisition of Layer 3 Advanced Business Solutions Ltd
(“Layer 3”)
Subsequent to the year end, on 31 May 2014 the
Group acquired the entire share capital of Layer 3
for an initial cash consideration of £1.8 million. 
An earn-out arrangement is in place which may 
lead to additional consideration becoming payable,
dependent on the performance of the business over
a three-year period post-acquisition.
Layer 3 is a highly skilled technical business,
specialising in delivering networking audits, Local
Area Networks (LAN) and WiFi services.

At 31 March 2014 the Group had £195.0 million of
bank facilities in place with its group of six banks
comprising Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc,
Lloyds Banking Group plc, The Royal Bank of
Scotland plc, Yorkshire Bank and ING Bank N.V. 
Net debt at 31 March 2014 was £114.0 million 
(2013: £81.2 million) reflecting the dividends paid,
the acquisition, integration and change activity
undertaken in the year, offset by free cash flow of
£34.9 million (2013: £38.6 million) and including
finance leases of £2.6 million (2013: £nil).
Since the year end a number of changes have been
made to the bank facilities, the principal change
being the removal of term loan amortisation, which
provides further capacity for acquisitions, and 
the increase in permitted leverage in certain
circumstances to 3.0 x annualised adjusted 
EBITDA. These changes reflect the confidence of
management and the lenders in the cash-generating
capabilities of the business.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Continuing operations for the year ended 31 March
2014 include the results of all businesses that were
owned and designated as continuing at the start of
the financial year (including the Group’s holding
company), together with the post-acquisition results
of businesses acquired during the year.
The Group’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA 
were £352.7 million (2013: £351.5 million) and 
£57.9 million (2013: £56.3 million) respectively. 
Amortisation of intangible assets in the year was
£63.8 million (2013: £66.2 million) and relates
primarily to the customer relationships acquired
during the current and prior periods. These
customer relationships have been valued based on
expected discounted future cash flows and are
amortised over periods from two to seven years.
Depreciation for the year totalled £4.1 million 
(2013: £2.9 million) and consists largely of 
charges for computers, office equipment and 
network infrastructure.
“Since the year end a
number of changes have
been made to the bank
facilities, the principal
change being the removal
of term loan amortisation,
which provides further
capacity for acquisitions”

CONTINUING OPERATIONS CONTINUED
Net exceptional operating costs were £7.1 million
(2013: £4.6 million). These include employee and
other restructuring costs of £6.4 million (2013: 
£5.4 million) and costs directly relating to acquisitions
of £3.0 million (2013: £1.0 million). Exceptional credits
included within net exceptional operating costs
include provision releases of £1.1 million (2013: £nil)
and negative goodwill of £1.4 million (2013: £nil)
following the acquisition of DDCS.
A new Long-Term Incentive Plan was initiated during
the year which, along with the existing SAYE schemes,
resulted in a charge to the income statement of 
£0.8 million (2013: credit of £0.7 million). 
The operating loss from continuing operations was
£17.9 million (2013: £16.8 million).
Net finance costs were £6.5 million (2013: 
£6.8 million) and predominantly consist of finance
costs of £6.1 million (2013: £6.2 million) relating 
to the bank facilities and discounting of provisions 
and contingent consideration of £0.6 million 
(2013: £0.7 million).
The Group reported a net loss before tax from
continuing operations for the year of £24.4 million
(2013: £23.5 million). As noted above, the increase
over the prior year is predominantly due to the
increase in exceptional operating costs due to the
increased acquisition and integration activity.
TAXATION
At the year end the Group has recognised a deferred
tax asset on the balance sheet of £8.6 million (2013:
£9.8 million), which is expected to unwind in future
periods, effectively reducing the cash tax liability on
future profits. During the year net corporation tax of
£4.9 million was paid (2013: £3.0 million). 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing
operations reduced to 6.06 pence in the year (2013:
6.38 pence) principally due to the reduction in
corporation tax charge for the year. Basic adjusted
earnings per share from continuing operations
increased to 13.85 pence (2013: 13.05 pence) mainly
as a result of increased Adjusted EBITDA and
reduced corporation tax charges. Fully diluted
adjusted earnings per share from continuing
operations is 13.53 pence (2013: 12.95 pence).
The adjusted earnings per share calculation
excludes the after-tax effect of amortisation of
acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based
payment costs/(credits), share of profit/(loss) of joint
venture and net exceptional operating costs, and we
believe it is a better representation of the underlying
trading performance of the Group.
BALANCE SHEET
Net assets of the Group were £115.3 million at 31 March
2014, compared to £143.9 million at 31 March 2013.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill reduced to 
£126.8 million (2013: £160.8 million) as a result of
£19.5 million of assets acquired through business
combinations, a further £10.3 million of additions
(including £7.6 million of customer lists and 
£2.4 million spent on computer software), less the
amortisation charge for the year of £63.8 million (2013:
£66.2 million). Goodwill arising on current and prior
year acquisitions totalled £16.7 million, taking the year
end position to £135.2 million (2013: £118.4 million).
The deferred tax asset of £8.6 million (2013: 
£9.8 million) primarily relates to tax losses and fixed
asset timing differences for the former Vialtus
business, which are expected to continue to be
utilised against future profits.

Net current assets were £9.1 million (2013: 
£2.3 million). Total borrowings stood at £155.5 million
(2013: £117.2 million). This balance consists of 
gross bank borrowings of £155.0 million (2013: 
£120.0 million), finance lease liabilities of £2.6 million
(2013: £nil) less deferred finance fees of £2.1 million
(£2.8 million), which will be released over the
remaining period of the bank facilities. Of the total
borrowings, £10.8 million is classed as current (2013:
£4.1 million) and £144.7 million is classed as 
non-current (2013: £113.1 million). As noted earlier,
subsequent to the year end, we have agreed with our
banks to remove the requirement to amortise the
term loan and hence the £10.8 million currently
classed as a current liability will no longer be
required to be settled in the coming year. 
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
Cash generated from operations was robust at 
£44.2 million (2013: £47.6 million).
Net interest paid was £5.1 million (2013: £4.1 million).
The Group made net taxation payments of £4.9
million (2013: £3.0 million). The Group makes tax
payments on account in addition to meeting
obligations of acquired entities.
Net capital expenditure outflows totalled £1.3 million
in the year (2013: £3.0 million) and were largely
attributable to network infrastructure. The cash flows
associated with the acquisition of intangible assets
totalled £9.3 million with £2.6 million relating to
payments to acquire intellectual property and material
customer databases (2013: £6.0 million) and were
largely attributable to customer lists and software.
Pre-exceptional free cash flow for the Group was
£34.9 million (2013: £38.6 million). The reduction on
the previous year is primarily due to investment in
working capital and increased exceptional costs
associated with the acquisitions made in the year.

net bank debt of £111.3 million (2013: £81.2 million).

RISK
Senior management is aware of its responsibility for
managing risks within each business unit. Group risk is
reviewed at board level to ensure that risk management
is being implemented and monitored effectively.
The board’s policy is to ensure that the business units
are operated effectively and appropriately, bearing in
mind prevailing market conditions, the requirements 
for timely decision making and commercial reality.
Insurance policies are regularly reviewed to ensure they
are adequate and appropriate, in line with the nature,
size and complexity of the business. Standard form
contracts are provided for commercial use and to 
assist the varying segments of the business and 
their commercial function to negotiate within 
approved parameters.
See the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section within
the strategic report for details of the Group’s risk
management process.
BUSINESS REVIEW
For a discussion of the Group’s performance in the year
ended 31 March 2014 and future developments, see the
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, 
the strategic report and the financial review on pages 
23 to 27.
GOING CONCERN
The Group had cash balances of £43.7 million (2013:
£38.8 million), net debt of £114.0 million (2013: 
£81.2 million) and unutilised borrowing facilities of
£40.0 million (2013: £80.0 million) at 31 March 2014. 
The current borrowing facilities run to 30 June 2016.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances,
borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the
directors believe that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to continue operations for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
TREASURY POLICY AND LIQUIDITY
The Group maintains borrowing lines estimated to be
sufficient to cover forecast cash requirements. In this
assessment, the Group only takes into account existing
or renewing facilities and new facilities where these
have received credit approval or equivalent.
The Group uses financial instruments to raise finance
and manage risk for its operations. It does not
undertake any speculative trading in derivative 
financial instruments.
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and
policies, including those concerning interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk, are disclosed in note 23 of
the Group financial statements.

EMPLOYEE POLICIES AND DIVERSITY
The Group has an equal opportunities policy which
ensures that people are provided with the same
opportunities for employment, career development,
training and promotion regardless of disability, race,
gender, religion/beliefs or age. The directors are
committed to maintaining and developing
communication and consultation processes with
employees, who in turn are encouraged to develop an
awareness of the issues affecting the Group. We aim to
be recognised as an employer of choice and seek to
maintain strong employee relations in all areas in which
we operate. The directors place considerable emphasis
on employees sharing in the success of the Group.
The Group is committed to open and regular
communications with employees about business
developments and issues of general interest and concern
to them, both on a formal and informal basis. The
performance of the Group is communicated regularly to
all staff. Copies of the annual report together with details
of preliminary and interim announcements of the Group’s
results are available to them. 
Both employment policy and practice in the Group are
based on non-discrimination and equal opportunities.
The Company remains supportive of the employment
and advancement of disabled people and provides
appropriate opportunities for their training, career
development and promotion. Applications for
employment by disabled people are always fully
considered. Where employees have become disabled 
in the service of the Group, every effort is made to
rehabilitate them in their former occupation or in some
suitable alternative.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
The Group’s environmental policy is to meet the
statutory requirements placed upon it and to apply good
environmental practice in its operations whilst
recognising that it is contractually obliged to meet its
customers’ requirements.
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group embraces corporate and social responsibility
and encourages all parts of the business to become
involved in local projects and initiatives on an 
ad-hoc basis, dependent upon employee interest 
and participation.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held on
16 September 2014 at 11.00 am at Cadogan Hall,
5 Sloane Terrace, London SW1X 9DQ.
At the Annual General Meeting, resolutions will be
proposed to receive, approve and adopt the annual 
report and accounts, to declare a final dividend of 
3.1 pence per ordinary share, to re-elect Peter Dubens,
Ian McKenzie, Christina Kennedy and Laurence Blackall. 
Peter Dubens and Ian McKenzie will retire by rotation at
the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the
Company’s articles of association and, being eligible,
offer themselves for re-election. Christina Kennedy and
Laurence Blackall will have served on the board for
more than ten years at the date of the Annual General
Meeting and also offer themselves for re-election.
During the year, the directors considered the
independence of the non-executive directors. The
directors consider that Christina Kennedy remains
independent in character and judgement
notwithstanding the duration of her directorship on the
board. The directors also consider that Ian McKenzie is
independent in character and judgement
notwithstanding that he holds a historical one-off grant
of warrants which is not considered to be material in the
context of assessing Ian’s independence.
Resolutions will also be proposed to re-appoint
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and to
authorise the directors to fix the auditors’ remuneration.
A resolution will also be proposed in relation to political
donations. It is not proposed to alter the Company’s
current policy of not making political donations, but the
resolution is being proposed to ensure that any
charitable donations made by the Company are
compliant with the widely drafted provisions on political
donations in the Companies Act 2006.
In order to maintain flexibility to act in a manner which
promotes the success of the Company for the benefit of
its members, the directors will also seek: (i) authority to
allot shares generally in respect of ordinary shares
having an aggregate nominal value of up to £1,779,783,
representing approximately one third of the issued
share capital of the Company; (ii) additional authority to
allot further shares by way of a fully pre-emptive rights
issue in respect of ordinary shares having an aggregate
nominal value of up to £1,779,783, representing
approximately a further one third of the issued share
capital of the Company; and (iii) a disapplication 
of pre-emption rights in respect of ordinary shares
having an aggregate nominal value of up to £1,067,870,
representing approximately 20% of the issued share
capital of the Company. The directors will also seek
authority to buy back up to 53,393,517 ordinary shares,
representing 20% of the issued share capital of 
the Company.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware. Relevant audit information is defined as
information needed by the Company’s auditors in
connection with preparing their report. Each director
has taken all the steps (such as making enquiries of
other directors and the auditors and any other steps
required by the director’s duty to exercise due care, skill
and diligence) that they ought to have taken in their duty
as a director in order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have
indicated their willingness to continue in office and a
resolution concerning their re-appointment will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This report was approved by order of the board on 
16 June 2014.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The remuneration committee comprises Christina
Kennedy, Laurence Blackall and Ian McKenzie and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy.
The committee meets at least twice a year to determine
all aspects of the remuneration of the executive
directors and certain other senior managers. The fees
of the non-executive directors are determined by the
board as a whole. No director or employee has a role in
determining their own remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The committee determines the overall policy for
executive remuneration. Details of the directors’
remuneration can be found in note 9. The committee
sets levels of remuneration to attract, retain and
motivate executive directors and other senior managers
and, in doing so, takes into account the level of
remuneration throughout the telecommunications
industry. Employees throughout the Group have
performance reviews annually.
The main components of the executive directors’ and
senior managers’ remuneration are:
• a competitive base salary
• an annual performance bonus
• pension provision
• benefits in kind
• share option awards
The Group operates a discretionary bonus scheme. 
The scheme applies to directors, senior managers and
certain other employees. Individual payments made
under the scheme are generally dependent on the
Company achieving its financial targets and the
attainment of individual objectives.
The Group makes contributions to money purchase
personal pension schemes on behalf of certain
executive directors and senior managers.
Other customary benefits, such as car allowances,
permanent health insurance and life assurance, are
made available as appropriate.
The Group operated two share option schemes, the
“Daisy Group plc Executive Share Plan” and the “Daisy
Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme”, which have
now both expired. Details of awards made under these
schemes are given in note 10 to the Group financial
statements. The Group adopted a new Long-Term
Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at a
general meeting held on 1 May 2013.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts of executive directors remain in
force until age 65 and continue until terminated by
either party giving to the other not less than 12 months’
written notice (or as otherwise terminated in
accordance with their other terms).
The service contracts of non-executive directors remain
in force for an initial term of 12 months, unless
terminated by either party giving to the other not less
than three months’ written notice, save that the service
contract of Christina Kennedy remains in force until
terminated by either party giving to the other not less
than 12 months’ written notice. Details of directors’
remuneration and emoluments can be found in note 9 of
the Group financial statements.

•Corporate governance
The board is responsible to shareholders for effective
direction and control of the Group and this report
describes the framework for corporate governance and
internal control that the directors have established to
enable them to carry out this responsibility. Although,
as an AIM listed company, the Company is not required
to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code (“the Code”) and this is not a
statement of compliance as required by the Code, the
board of directors recognises the importance of, and is
committed to, ensuring that effective corporate
governance procedures are in place, appropriate for a
public company of its size, nature and complexity.
THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES
Board
The board is responsible for the overall strategy and
financial performance of the Group and has a formal
schedule of matters reserved for its approval. Each
board meeting is preceded by a clear agenda and any
relevant information is provided to directors in advance
of the meeting. The Company has established properly
constituted audit, remuneration and nomination
committees of the board with formally delegated duties
and responsibilities. Terms of reference for each of
these committees can be found on the Company’s
website (www.daisygroupplc.com).
During the year, the board comprised three executive
directors, Peter Dubens, Matthew Riley and Steve Smith
and three non-executive directors, Christina Kennedy,
Ian McKenzie and Laurence Blackall.
Christina was considered to be an independent non-
executive director during the year, as defined 
under the Code. The directors consider that Christina
remains independent in character and judgement
notwithstanding the duration of her directorship on the
board. The directors also consider that Ian is
independent, notwithstanding that he holds a historical
one-off grant of warrants which are not considered 
to be material in the context of assessing 
Ian’s independence.
An evaluation of board performance is required under
the Code. An evaluation has taken place in relation to
the year in question by way of a detailed questionnaire
and discussion at board level.
The board met on four occasions during the year to
discuss operational business. All directors were in
attendance. The board also holds regular telephone calls
to update the members on operational and other business.
An agreed procedure exists for directors in the
furtherance of their duties to take independent
professional advice. Newly appointed directors are
made aware of their responsibilities through the
company secretary. The Company provides training to
directors where required.
No individual or group of directors dominates the
board’s decision making. Collectively, the non-executive
directors bring a valuable range of expertise in assisting
the Group to achieve its strategic aims.
Since September 2003, the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer have been separate. The chairman is
responsible for the effective running of the board and
the chief executive is ultimately responsible for all
operational matters and the financial performance of
the Group.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee’s principal responsibility
is to determine the framework or broad policy for the
remuneration of the chairman and the executive
directors, to consider and determine all elements of the
remuneration of those directors and to review board
performance. No director takes part in any discussion
concerning his own position.
The remuneration committee comprises Christina
Kennedy, Ian McKenzie and Laurence Blackall and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy. The remuneration report
on page 37 contains a description of the Group’s
remuneration policy. The committee met on seven
occasions during the year. All members were in
attendance on each occasion.

THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES continued
Nomination committee
The nomination committee comprises Christina
Kennedy, Laurence Blackall and Ian McKenzie and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy. The nomination
committee considers the appointment of all directors
and is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and
composition (including skills, knowledge and
experience) of the board and makes recommendations
with regard to any changes. The articles of association
of the Company require directors to retire from office at
the first Annual General Meeting following appointment
(at which point they are eligible for re-appointment) and
then every three years by rotation, but in accordance
with good practice, one third of the directors are
submitted for re-election each year. The nomination
committee has had one meeting during the year in
relation to the re-election of directors, by both rotation
and due to length of service, at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting. This meeting took place without the
relevant directors voting in relation to their own
appointment. The Committee members and the board
believe that the directors put forward for re-election at
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting continue to be
effective and demonstrate commitment to their role.
The nomination committee and board unanimously
recommend the election and appointment of all board
members offering themselves for re-election 
or re-appointment.
Audit committee
The audit committee is responsible for the independent
monitoring of the effectiveness of the system of internal
control, compliance, accounting policies and published
financial statements on behalf of the board. It receives
and reviews reports from the Company’s management
and auditors relating to the interim and annual financial
statements and the accounting and internal control
systems in use throughout the Group. Any significant
findings or identified risks are examined so that
appropriate action may be taken.
The audit committee comprises Laurence Blackall
(chairman), Christina Kennedy and Ian McKenzie.
Christina Kennedy is considered by the board to have
relevant financial experience. The committee operates
under written terms of reference and is scheduled to
meet at least twice a year with the Company’s external
auditors, and with the executive directors present by
invitation only. The committee met twice during the
year. All members were in attendance. The committee
meets with the external auditors without the executive
directors present as it considers appropriate.
Conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures for the disclosure and
review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest
which the directors may have and for the authorisation
of such conflict matters by the board. In deciding
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict, the
directors must have regard to their general duties
under the Companies Act 2006. The authorisation of a
conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, may be
reviewed at any time by the board. The board considers
that these procedures are operating effectively.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company encourages the participation of both
institutional and private investors. Communication with
private individuals is maintained through the Annual
General Meeting and the Company’s annual and interim
reports. The chairmen of the Company’s audit,
remuneration and nomination committees are made
available to answer questions at the Company’s Annual
General Meetings.
In addition, further details on the strategy and
performance of the Company can be found at its website
(www.daisygroupplc.com), which includes copies of the
Company’s press releases. Regular updates are
provided to the board on meetings with shareholders
and analysts, and broker’s opinions are made available
to the board. As provided by the UK Corporate
Governance Code, non-executive directors are available
to meet major shareholders, if required. The Company’s
share registrars provide a helpdesk, which members
may contact with enquiries regarding their
shareholdings. The helpdesk telephone number is 
0871 664 0300* (or +44 20 8639 3399 for overseas
callers) and the helpdesk’s e-mail address is
shareholderenquiries@capita.co.uk.
*  calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras 
(lines are open Mon – Fri 9.00 am – 5.30 pm).
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board maintains full control and direction over
appropriate strategic, financial, organisational and
compliance issues. The Group has an organisational
structure with clearly defined lines of authority,
responsibility and accountability, which is reviewed
regularly. The annual budget and forecasts are
reviewed by the board prior to approval being given. 
This includes the identification and assessment of the
business risks inherent in the Group and the
telecommunications sector as a whole along with
associated financial risks.

INTERNAL CONTROL continued
The board has overall responsibility for the Group’s
systems of internal control and for monitoring their
effectiveness. Although no system of internal control
can provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are designed
to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that
issues are identified on a timely basis and dealt with
appropriately.
The Group’s key internal financial control procedures
include:
• a budgeting programme with an annual budget
approved by the board
• a review by the board of actual results compared
with budget and forecasts
• reviews by the board of year end forecasts
• the establishment of procedures for acquisitions,
capital expenditure and expenditure incurred in the
ordinary course of business
• the appraisal and approval of proposed acquisitions
by the board
• the detailed budgeting and monitoring of costs
incurred on the development of new products
• the reporting to, and review by, the board of changes
in legislation and practices within the sector and
accounting and legal developments pertinent to 
the Company
• the appointing of experienced and suitably qualified
staff to take responsibility for key business functions
to ensure maintenance of high standards of
performance
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion
on the financial statements. They discuss with
management the reporting of operational results and
the financial condition of the Group, to the extent
necessary to express their audit opinion.
The board has considered the need for an internal audit
function but resolved that, due to the size of the Group,
this could not be justified on the grounds of cost
effectiveness.
AUDIT AND AUDITORS’ INDEPENDENCE
An additional responsibility of the audit committee is to
keep under review the scope and cost effectiveness of
the external audit. This includes recommending to the
board the appointment of the external auditors and for
reviewing the scope of the audit, approving the audit fee
and, on an annual basis, the committee being satisfied
that the auditors are independent.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are retained to perform
audit and audit-related work on the Group, the Company
and the majority of Group companies.
The committee monitors the nature and extent of non-
audit work undertaken by the auditors. It is satisfied that
there are adequate controls in place to ensure auditors’
independence and objectivity. The matter is kept under
review and is a standing item on the agenda for the
audit committee. The audit committee monitors the cost
of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors. The audit
committee considers that it is in a position to take action
if at any time it believes that there is a risk of the
auditors’ independence being undermined through the
award of this work.
Details of audit and non-audit fees for the period 
under review are disclosed in note 12 of the Group
financial statements.
GOING CONCERN
As set out more fully in the directors’ report, the
directors have formed the conclusion that the Company
and Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The
financial statements have, therefore, been prepared on
the going concern basis.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the remuneration report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent Company financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the loss of the Company and Group
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company financial
statements respectively;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and
the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the remuneration report comply with the
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess a company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors section of this document on
pages 29 to 31 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group; and
• the directors’ report and strategic report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
This statement was approved by order of the board on 16 June 2014.

•Independent auditors’ report
TO THE MEMBERS OF DAISY GROUP PLC
for the Group financial statements
OUR OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of its loss and cash flows for the
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by
the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The Group financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by Daisy Group plc, comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2014;
• the consolidated income statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for
example in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and
considered future events.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK &
Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.

WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES  continued
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual
Report”) to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that
is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we
consider the implications for our report.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Daisy Group plc (“the Company”) is a holding company. The Company and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”)
provide telecommunication and managed services to SME and mid-market businesses. The Company is a public
limited company which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange and is
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is Daisy House, Lindred Road Business Park,
Nelson, Lancashire BB9 5SR.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC)
interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historic cost
convention. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to use certain critical accounting
estimates and are required to exercise judgement in the application of accounting policies. The principal accounting
policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
In all cases references to “EBITDA” relate to the operating result from continuing operations before amortisation, and
depreciation. References to “adjusted EBITDA” also exclude share-based payment costs/credits and net exceptional
operating costs.
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on
or after 1 April 2013 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The following standards have been published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2014 but have not been early adopted by the Group:
• IFRS 10,‘Consolidated financial statements’. The objective of IFRS 10 is to establish principles for the presentation
and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities to present
consolidated financial statements. It defines the principle of control, and establishes controls as the basis for
consolidation. It sets out how to apply the principle of control to identify whether an investor controls an investee
and therefore must consolidate the investee. It also sets out the accounting requirements for the preparation of
consolidated financial statements.
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’. IFRS 11 is a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights
and obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. There are two types of joint
arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator has rights to the
assets and obligations relating to the arrangement and therefore accounts for its share of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint venture has rights to the net assets of the arrangement
and therefore equity accounts for its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures is no longer allowed.
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’. IFRS 12 includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance
sheet vehicles.
• IAS 28 (revised 2011), ‘Associates and joint ventures’. IAS 28 (revised 2011) includes the requirements for
associates and joint ventures that have to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11.
• Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, on asset and liability offsetting. These amendments
are to the application guidance in IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, and clarify some of the
requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
2.1 Basis of preparation continued
The following standards have been published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2015 but have not been early adopted by the Group:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’. IFRS 9 is the first standard issued as part of a wider project to replace IAS 39. 
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes two primary measurement categories
for financial assets: amortised cost and fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business
model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. The guidance in IAS 39 on impairment 
of financial assets and hedge accounting continues to apply.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material
impact on the Group. 
2.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Daisy Group plc (“the Company”) and
enterprises controlled by the Company (its “subsidiaries”). The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition
below the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (“negative goodwill”) is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or
assumed at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded in the income statement.
Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially
measured at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with
those used by other members of the Group.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the
subsidiary and that subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated
on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of
the asset transferred.
Joint ventures
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which is jointly
controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 31, ‘Investments in associates and
joint ventures’. The net investment in the joint venture is a single line in the balance sheet, and the profit or loss
appears in a single line in the income statement. Where the joint venture is loss-making, a liability is recognised in the
balance sheet within other payables.
2.3 Foreign currency translation
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling. All Group companies have a functional currency of sterling which is
consistent with the presentation currency of the Group’s financial statements. Transactions in currencies other than
sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses
arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the year.

2.4 Segment reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group board of directors.
The Group’s segments comprise Daisy Retail, Daisy Wholesale, Daisy Distribution and central costs, which are those
businesses reported in the Group’s management accounts used by the board of directors as the primary means for
analysing trading performance.
Segmental revenue represents the total revenue of each business within a reporting segment and includes inter-
segment revenue. Segmental profit is the measure used to assess performance internally and is calculated as
adjusted EBITDA.
2.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the
ordinary course of the Group’s activities. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably
measured and it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the entity and
when specific criteria have been achieved. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts
and after eliminating sales between Group companies.
To the extent that invoices are raised to a different pattern than the revenue recognition described below, appropriate
adjustments are made through deferred and accrued income to account for revenue when the underlying service has
been performed or goods have transferred to the customer.
Revenue recognition for each of the Group’s main areas of revenue is described below.
Arrangements with multiple deliverables
Where goods and/or services are sold in one bundled transaction, the Group allocates the total arrangement’s
consideration to the different individual elements based on their relative fair values. Management determines 
the fair values of individual components based on actual amounts charged by the Group on a stand-alone basis, 
or alternatively based on comparable pricing arrangements observable in the market.
Gross or net income presentation
When deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenue, both the legal form and substance of the
agreement between the Group and its business partners are reviewed to determine each party’s respective role in the
transaction. The Group is considered to be principal in the arrangement when it provides the goods or services to the
end user, has freedom to determine the price charged to the end user and bears inventory and credit risk from 
the arrangement.
Where the Group’s role in a transaction is that of principal, revenue is recognised on a gross basis. This requires
revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related
expenditure charged as an operating cost.
Where the Group’s role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenue is recognised on a net basis with revenue
representing the margin earned.
Sale of services
Service income is recognised at fair value, evenly over the period to which the service relates. Usage charges are
recognised in the period when the service is received by the customer.
The Group provides certain maintenance services. Fees charged to customers for the provision of maintenance and
support services are recognised at fair value, on a straight-line basis over the period of the related agreement.

2.5 Revenue recognition continued
Sale of goods, licences and installation
Revenue from the sale, and/or installation of hardware and associated licences is recognised at fair value in the
income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, usually on 
delivery or installation.
External costs associated with the installation are recorded as work-in-progress until the revenue has been recognised.
Revenue in respect of licences is only recognised where there are no on-going obligations. Where on-going obligations
exist, revenue is deferred and recognised in line with the on-going obligations as appropriate.
Where hardware and associated licences are leased to customers under a finance lease arrangement, lease income is
recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of
return. Where assets are leased out under an operating lease arrangement, lease income is recognised over the term
of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Commissions
Commissions are received from mobile network operators when the Group connects or retains end users to their
network. The commissions are recognised as income by the Group over the period of service required by the
commission agreement. When the Group assesses that there is an on-going obligation beyond connection,
commission is recognised evenly over the period of the obligation. When the Group assesses that there is not an 
on-going obligation beyond connection, commission is recognised upon connection.
In some instances commission income is subject to adjustment by the mobile network operator. Where this is the
case, the Group assesses the likelihood of adjustment by reference to historical experience and adjusts commission
income accordingly.
Intermediaries are given commissions by the Group on provision of new customers and retaining existing customers.
Such commissions are recognised as an expense over the period of service required by the commission agreement,
except where they meet the criteria for capitalisation as an intangible asset, to the extent that they are supported by
expected future cash inflows, in which case they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
customer life and the contractual period.
2.6 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that in management’s judgement should be disclosed separately in order to determine the
underlying profitability of the business, in the absence of acquisition and integration activity and one-off items. Items
that are material, either individually or in aggregate and non-operating or non-recurring in nature are presented as
exceptional items in the income statement, within the relevant account heading. Items that may give rise to
classification as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, significant Group restructuring and rationalisation
programmes, asset impairments, provision releases, negative goodwill, acquisition-related costs and 
re-measurement of contingent consideration.
2.7 Finance income and expense
Interest payable on borrowings, the interest expense component of finance lease payments and interest income is
recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
2.8 Business combinations
Under the requirements of IFRS 3 (revised), all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method
(“acquisition accounting”). The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of
exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer. The cost of a
business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that date. The acquisition date is the
date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. An intangible asset, such as customer or
supplier relationships, computer software and licences, is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset in
IAS 38, ‘Intangible Assets’ and its fair value can be measured reliably. Any acquisition-related costs directly
attributable to the business combination are expensed as incurred.

2.9 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled
entity at the date of acquisition.
Upon the acquisition of subsidiaries, goodwill is separately disclosed. Goodwill on acquisition of associates and jointly
controlled entities is included in investment in associates and jointly controlled entities.
At each balance sheet date, goodwill is reviewed for impairment using a discounted cash flow method applied to
business forecasts. If this review demonstrates that impairment has occurred, this is expensed to the income
statement immediately and is not subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the
purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash generating units or groups of cash generating
units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified according to
operating segment.
Negative goodwill arises when the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities is greater than the cost of acquisition. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment or more
frequently if there are indications that it may be impaired.
2.10 Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. The fair value attributable
to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Group. The residual
values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:
Customer lists: life of the customer contract between 2 and 7 years
Supplier relationships: life of the supplier relationship between 2 and 3 years
Computer software: 2 to 3 years
Telecommunication licences: 2 to 5 years
Intellectual property: 10 years
The following are the main categories of intangible assets:
Contract related intangible assets (customer and supplier relationships)
Customer and supplier portfolios acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value and
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair value
of acquired intangible assets and include management’s estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by the
acquired businesses. Separate values are not attributed to internally generated customer and supplier relationships.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use
the specific software and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that
are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that
will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct
costs include the software development, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Computer software development costs including directly-attributable internal costs are recognised as assets and
amortised over their estimated useful lives.

2.10 Other intangible assets continued
Telecommunication licences
Licences paid to regulatory bodies, which permit telecommunication activities to be operated for defined periods, are
initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period.
Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs (included within customer lists and relationships) comprise the direct third-party costs of
recruiting and retaining customers, net of incentives from network operators and provision for in-contract churn.
These costs are expensed as incurred, unless they meet the criteria for capitalisation as an intangible asset, to the
extent that they are supported by expected future cash inflows, in which case they are amortised on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the customer life and the contractual period.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property includes patents, utility models, trademarks, trade or business names, domain names, websites
and contents thereof, copyright, moral rights, rights to prevent passing off or unfair competition, database rights and
rights in designs. 
2.11 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are included in the balance sheet at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and
any impairment losses. Historical cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to
bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Included within the cost for network infrastructure and
equipment are direct labour, contractors’ charges, materials and directly attributable overheads.
On disposal of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the
date of disposal is recorded in the income statement.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available
for use, so as to write-off the asset’s cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any expected residual
value. Freehold land is not subject to depreciation.
The lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:
Leasehold improvements: shorter of unexpired portion of lease or 10 years
Freehold buildings: 50 years
Network infrastructure: 2 to 10 years
Computer equipment: 3 to 4 years
Office equipment: 3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles: 3 to 5 years
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate.
2.12 Impairment of non-current assets excluding goodwill
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement if the recoverable amount (being the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use) of an asset or cash generating unit falls below its carrying value in the
balance sheet.
Such impairment losses may be reversed in subsequent periods if there is an indication that the impairment loss
recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.

2.13 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be
principally recovered through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
2.14 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at
inception date; whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the
arrangement conveys the right to use the asset.
Group as a lessee
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership
are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at inception at the lower of the fair
value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised leased assets are
subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s useful life.
Obligations related to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate
under current or non-current borrowings. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease payments made under operating leases are charged to the
income statement as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Group as a lessor
Assets leased to a customer under arrangements that meet the relevant criteria of IAS 17 are classified as finance
leases. The fair values of the assets provided to the end customer are recognised as a receivable.
There are no guaranteed residual values available to the Group at the end of any finance leases, and as unguaranteed
residual values are not considered to be material to the Group, they are not included in the net investment in the
finance lease.
Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant
periodic rate of return.
Any gain or loss on early termination of leases, calculated as the total net sums recovered and the book value of net
investments in finance leases, is recognised in the income statement when such terminations arise.
2.15 Inventories
Inventories mainly comprise items of equipment held for sale or rental and consumable items. Equipment held 
and consumable items are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for
obsolescence. Cost is based on the price of purchase and is calculated on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realisable
value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal.
2.16 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Onerous lease provisions have been measured at the lower of the cost to fulfil the contract or the cost of terminating
the contract.

2.17 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit,
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in jointly controlled entities, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2.18 Employee benefits
Share-based payments
The Group operates a share option programme which allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The
fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes method which takes
into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Non-market vesting conditions are included in
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. 
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Where non-market vesting conditions are not met, the associated charge is reversed in the income statement.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made
to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit
plan. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future
payments is available.

2.18 Employee benefits continued
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits
when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to
encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are
discounted to present value.
Holiday pay
Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits
are earned. An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not yet taken.
2.19 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at
every reporting date.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired.
All financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, except for
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading and are held at fair value.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they
are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised
in the income statement within ‘operating costs’.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank deposits repayable on demand. For the purposes of the cash
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised a fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading and are held at fair value. Financial
liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals, onerous lease provisions, deferred consideration
and borrowings.

2.19 Financial instruments continued
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less
(or in the normal operating cycles of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount, and subsequently
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the value of the amount received, net of
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised
cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period
of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from
financing activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. Given the conditions applicable to the specific derivative instrument the Group
holds, it is not deemed to meet the criteria as required by IAS 39 to permit hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, i.e. cost. Subsequent to initial recognition,
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in the income statement as a component of financing income or costs.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to
terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current
creditworthiness of the instrument counterparties (refer to note 23).
2.20 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction
costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.21 Employee benefit trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) have been included in the Group financial statements.
Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the assets vest unconditionally in
identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT are shown as a deduction against equity.
The proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity. Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a
gain or loss being recognised in the Group income statement.
2.22 Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are declared and approved by the Company’s
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.

Directors  and  governance Overview Contents Further  information Financials 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. Management continually evaluates the estimates, assumptions and
judgements based on available information and experience. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below.
Revenue recognition and presentation of arrangements with multiple deliverables
In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the deliverables are assigned to one or more separate
components of revenue and the arrangement consideration is allocated to each component based on its relative 
fair value.
Determining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates due to the nature of the goods and services
provided. The Group generally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is
regularly sold on a standalone basis or based on comparable pricing arrangements observable in the market.
Recognition of connection commission in respect of revenue-share arrangements
Based on there being no substantive performance obligations post-connection and a well-established, robust track
record of revenue-share income, the Group recognises revenue-share receivable from the networks in full on
connection based on the average in-bundle spend per connection. Adjustments are made for the churn of customers
based on empirical evidence. The Group continues to monitor this in order to ensure that the track record is reviewed
in detail and the key assumptions used remain appropriate. 
Receivables
Debts are recognised to the extent that they are judged to be recoverable. Management reviews are performed to
estimate the level of provision required for irrecoverable debt. Provisions are made specifically against invoices and
finance lease receivables to appropriately reflect any uncertainty as to ultimate collection.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable
taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or
tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. Historical differences between forecast and actual
taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment as at the transition date and thereafter for all
non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such
indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from 
the asset or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those
cash flows.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in customer relationships, supplier relationships, licences and computer software being
recognised. These are valued using discounted cash flow methods which require the application of certain key
judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of discount rates, customer churn and future 
cash flows.

include, but are not limited to, significant Group restructuring and rationalisation programmes, asset impairments,
negative goodwill, transaction fees and re-measurement of contingent consideration. The directors are of the 
opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying
business performance.

Share-based payments are valued by reference to the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The inputs to which include
dividend yield, expected volatility, time to maturity and the risk free interest rate. Refer to note 10 for further details.

inter-segment revenue. Segmental profit is the measure used to assess performance internally and is calculated as
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share-based payment costs/credits and net exceptional
operating costs (“adjusted EBITDA”), excluding central costs recharged from the Company.
The Group has opted to disclose additional information on revenue and gross profit in respect of the product
categories described above.
All businesses are based in the UK. Inter-segmental transactions are carried out on an arm’s length basis. The Group
does not have any customers who contribute more than 10% of total revenue.

goodwill as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase consideration. The associated negative
goodwill generated from the acquisition of DDCS has been recognised in net exceptional operating costs in accordance

Items that are material in size, individually or in aggregate, and non-operating or non-recurring in nature are
presented as exceptional items in the income statement, within the relevant account heading. The directors are of the
opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying
business performance. Net exceptional operating costs are summarised below:

Negative goodwill (vi) 5a (1,357) —
Costs directly relating to acquisitions (vii) 3,036 990
7,136 4,640
The net exceptional operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2014 generated an aggregate income tax benefit of
£1.7 million (2013: £1.5 million).
(i) Employee-related restructuring costs principally relate to redundancy costs. The balance also includes 
£0.9 million of integration bonuses payable to certain directors (2013: £nil of integration bonuses). 
(ii) Other restructuring costs include £2.9 million of costs relating to operating leases for sites in Harbour Exchange
and Prudhoe that are largely unoccupied and where there are no plans to use the space before the expiration of
the leases. Also included within this category are IT integration costs of £1.4 million and £0.4 million of costs
relating to aborted projects.
(iii) During the year the contingent consideration in respect of WWG was revalued in light of the final settlement to be
made to the vendors, based on the performance of the business relative to the earn-out target. This resulted in a
charge to the income statement of £0.1 million.
(iv) Following the acquisition of DDCS, a site rationalisation process was undertaken, leading to staff being relocated
from Gateshead to parts of our Prudhoe site which were previously unoccupied. This has resulted in a release of
the onerous property provision of £1.1 million in the year.
(v) There were no asset impairment charges in the year. The leasehold improvement assets in our Stockley Park site
were fully impaired during the prior year as the site became unoccupied during the prior year.
(vi) Negative goodwill of £1.4 million associated with the acquisition of DDCS has been written off to the income
statement in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised). Refer to note 5 for further details.
(vii) Costs directly relating to acquisitions include £2.6 million of acquisition bonuses payable to directors and senior
members of staff, including associated national insurance costs, as approved by the remuneration committee
(2013: £0.6 million). Refer to note 9 for further details. Stamp duty costs and legal and professional fees in the
year amounted to £0.4 million.

The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of
the share options granted. The estimate of fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes
option pricing model.
The volatility input to the Black-Scholes model is based on the expected future volatility over the life of the award. 
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free interest rate is the yield on zero-coupon UK
government bonds of a term equal to the expected life of the warrants or share option awards. Assumptions have been
made to incorporate dividend yield and the effects of forfeiture using anticipated leaver rates. The calculations assume
that the performance criteria attaching to the options will be met in full.
The assumptions applied to options and warrants granted since 1 January 2009 are set out below:
(iv),(vi) (viii) (ix) (xiii) (xiv) (xv) (xvi)
Fair value per share 23.4p 101.0p 33.1p 26.4p 99.5p 130.0p 38.9p

11. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Group makes payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans that are charged as an expense as they
fall due. Payments are made on the basis of a percentage of qualifying salary for certain employees to personal
pension schemes.
The total charge to the income statement for the period is detailed in note 9. There were no overdue contributions
payable at the balance sheet date (2013: £nil).

Adjusted earnings per share represents the adjusted profit after taxation for the year attributable to our shareholders
divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. As it excludes the impact of net exceptional operating
costs it provides an important measure of our underlying financial performance in a consistent manner.
The adjusted earnings per share figures for the year ended 31 March 2013 have been restated to reflect a more
comparable effective tax rate, after having adjusted for the impact of the change in deferred tax rates and prior year
adjustments. In addition, profits/(losses) from joint ventures have been excluded from the calculation.

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment or more
frequently if there are indications that it may be impaired. In accordance with IFRS 3 (revised), during the year,
negative goodwill associated with the acquisition of DDCS of £1.4 million was written off.

£’000 £’000
Daisy Retail 95,280 93,337
Daisy Wholesale 32,977 18,382

135,189 118,445
Daisy Retail includes the acquisition of DDCS and ABSE, Daisy Wholesale includes the acquisition of Indecs and 
Daisy Distribution includes the acquisition of MoCo.
The carrying value of the Group’s goodwill is not subject to annual amortisation and was tested for impairment at
31 March 2014. The recoverable amount has been determined on a value-in-use basis on each cash-generating unit
using the management approved 12-month forecasts for each cash-generating unit. The base 12-month projection is
held constant with no growth to year 3 and then kept constant thereafter to perpetuity. These cash flows are then
discounted at the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.4%. 
Based on the results of the current period impairment review, no impairment charges have been recognised by the
Group in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £nil). Management have considered various sensitivity analyses in order
to appropriately evaluate the carrying value of goodwill. Having assessed the anticipated future cash flows the
directors do not consider there to be any reasonably possible changes in assumptions that would lead to such an
impairment charge in the year ended 31 March 2014.

At 31 March 2014 there were unrelieved tax losses in the Group of £48.3 million (2013: £49.8 million). The Group had a
potential deferred tax asset in relation to unrelieved losses, fixed asset timing differences and other short-term timing
differences of £14.6 million (2013: £17.3 million). A deferred tax asset has been recognised where, in the opinion of the
directors, the Group is expected to make sufficient profits against which these tax assets can be set-off in the future.
This means that there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset at 31 March 2014 of £6.3 million (2013: £7.5 million). 
The majority of the recognised deferred tax asset that relates to carry forward tax losses is expected to be utilised
over the next five years.

Directors  and  governance Overview Contents Further  information Financials 23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
23.1 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents and borrowings. 
Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, net investments in finance leases and trade and other
payables, arise directly from the Group’s operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair
value of these financial instruments is not material.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:
a) Floating rate borrowings
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates
where repayments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
b) Fixed rate borrowings
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings, namely the finance lease and the hire purchase obligations, are estimated by
discounting the future contracted cash flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value.
c) Trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash
For these items with a remaining life of less than one year, the book value reflects the amount that is expected to 
be recovered.
23.2 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal as the Group’s borrowings at variable and fixed rates were denominated
in sterling. No foreign exchange contracts were entered into in the current year as the Group has no direct material
foreign exchange exposure.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet its foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to these risks and, where appropriate, will take action to minimise the
impact of these risks on the business. The directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk
management to a sub-committee of the board. The Group’s finance department implements the policies set by the
board, with clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. Such instruments are only used on occasion to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets
or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and
also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. Whilst floating rate borrowings are not
exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash flow risk as costs increase if market rates rise.
To manage this risk, the Group enters into interest rate cap agreements with other parties to generate the desired
interest profile, in which the Group will be compensated if interest rates rise above an agreed rate calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal. 
The Group holds cash balances which are subject to floating rates of interest. Whilst the rates of interest inherent in
net investments in finance lease receivables are variable dependent on the credit worthiness of the end customer,
once contracts are entered into the rate is fixed and there is no further exposure to interest rate changes.
At 31 March 2014 it is estimated that a movement of a 0.5 percentage point in interest rates, which represents
management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, with all other variables remaining constant, would
impact the Group’s loss before tax by approximately £0.7 million (2013: £0.6 million).

23.2 Financial risk management continued
b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk on
financial assets such as cash balances, net investments in finance leases and trade and other receivables. The
Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are
net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior
experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Appropriate credit checks are undertaken on
all potential customers before new contracts are accepted. Individual exposures are monitored with customers
subject to credit limits to ensure the Group’s exposure to bad debts is minimised. The Group’s customers are spread
across a wide range of industry and service sectors and consequently the Group is not exposed to material
concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and funding to purchase leased vehicles is managed by transacting with
financial institutions with high quality credit ratings. Accordingly, the Group’s associated credit risk is deemed to be
limited. All institutions utilised by the Group require the advance approval of the board.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date. See note
25 for further information on trade receivables and net investment in finance leases.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group actively forecasts, manages and reports its working capital
requirements on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient funds for its operations. Significant items of capital
expenditure require prior approval by the board.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts
disclosed in the table are the gross contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The contingent consideration balances are recorded at fair value and, as the inputs for the valuation of the liabilities
are not based on observable market data, they are classified as level three financial liabilities.
d) Capital risk management
The Group’s capital structure consists of net debt and total equity. The Group is subject to the risk that its capital
structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group’s objectives when managing capital
are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. There were
no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The banking facilities have a requirement for the Group to comply with certain covenant ratios including net debt 
to adjusted EBITDA and interest cover. The Group monitors these covenants regularly and has met all covenant 
tests to date.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the use of share option schemes. 
Full details are provided in note 10.
Consistent with industry practice, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated
as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as current and non-current borrowings (excluding
unamortised fees) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as disclosed in the consolidated
balance sheet plus net debt as defined above. The gearing ratios were as follows:

finance for further acquisitions. Interest on the facilities is being charged at floating rates of interest of 2.0%-3.0%
above LIBOR as that rate fluctuates.
Covenants based on net debt to adjusted EBITDA and interest cover are tested on a quarterly basis. The Group has
passed all covenant tests to date.

a) Bank facilities continued
The Group has entered into derivative transactions in the form of interest rate cap arrangements. The purpose of this
is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. Further details of
the interest rate cap can be found in note 23.
The Group had £40.0 million of unutilised bank borrowing facilities at 31 March 2014 (2013: £80.0 million). 
At the balance sheet date, the Group had no overdraft facility (2013: £nil).
Since the year end, a number of changes have been made to the bank facilities, the principal change being the removal
of term loan amortisation. As such, the £10.8 million currently classed as a current liability will no longer be required
to be settled in the coming year.
b) Finance lease liabilities
Amounts due under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are payable as follows:

Notes to the Company financial statements
C1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
C1.1 Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, are in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and comply with
the Companies Act 2006. Unless otherwise stated, all policies have been applied consistently throughout the current
and comparative years.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the
Company profit and loss account. The loss for the Company for the year was £5.9 million (2013: £70.6 million profit). 
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement, on the basis that the cash flow of the Company is included
within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Daisy Group.
The directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future
and therefore the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
C1.2 Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. 
In the opinion of the directors the values of such investments are not less than shown at the balance sheet date.
C1.3 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated
at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as non-current liabilities.
C1.4 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange at the
balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
C1.5 Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the taxable
profits/(losses) and results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax
assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Notes to the Company financial statements C1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
C1.6 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s
equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
C1.7 Share-based payments
The Company operates certain equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding
shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account equivalent to the fair
value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value of options over the Company’s shares awarded to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as a
capital contribution, resulting in an increase in investments. The fair value of the options granted is measured using
the Black-Scholes method which takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The charge is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet
date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision
to the original estimates is reflected in the profit and loss account with a corresponding adjustment to reserves
immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value)
and share premium when the options are exercised.
C1.8 Employee Benefit Trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) have been included in the Group financial statements.
Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the assets vest unconditionally in
identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT are shown as a deduction against equity.
The proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity. Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a
gain or loss being recognised in the profit and loss account.
C1.9 Financial instruments and risk management
The Company and Group’s policy in respect of financial instruments and risk management are disclosed in note 23 of
the consolidated financial statements. Disclosures have been made on financial instruments as required by the
Companies Act 2006.
C2. EMPLOYEES’ AND DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
For more information on pension commitments, see the directors’ remuneration report and note 11 of the
consolidated financial statements.
Net share-based payments for the financial year were £0.8 million (2013: £0.7 million credit) and have been
recognised in the profit and loss account. Share options relating to the board are disclosed in the directors’
remuneration report and detailed share-based payment disclosures are shown in note 10 of the consolidated 
financial statements. There is no significant difference between IFRS 2 and its UK GAAP equivalent FRS 20.
C3. AUDITORS’ REMUNERATION
Auditors’ remuneration is detailed in note 12 of the Group financial statements.

Independent auditors’ report
TO THE MEMBERS OF DAISY GROUP PLC
for the parent Company financial statements
OUR OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of its loss and cash flows for the
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by
the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The Group financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by Daisy Group plc, comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2014;
• the consolidated income statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for
example in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and
considered future events.
•Independent auditors’ report WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual
Report”) to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Daisy Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2014.

1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the Annual
General Meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a member of the
Company. A Form of Proxy which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this Notice. If you do
not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact Capita Asset Services
on 0871 664 0300*. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy the Form of Proxy. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and
number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which in aggregate should not exceed the number of
shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and
should be returned together in the same envelope.
2. To be valid, any Form of Proxy or other instrument appointing a proxy and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is
signed, or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or authority, must be received by post or (during normal business hours only)
by hand at Capita Asset Services, PXS, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU by no later than 11.00 am on 
14 September 2014.
3. The return of a completed Form of Proxy, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in paragraph 8 below) 
will not prevent a member attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General
Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they may cast), a member must be registered in the
register of members of the Company at 6.00 pm on 14 September 2014 (or, in the event of any adjournment, 6.00 pm on the date which is
two days before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to the register of members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded
in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
5. Any member attending the Annual General Meeting is entitled pursuant to section 319A of the Companies Act 2006 to ask any question
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting. The Company will answer any such questions unless (i) to do so would interfere
unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; or (ii) the answer has already been
given on a website in the form of any answer to a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of
the meeting that the question be answered.
6. As at 13 June 2014 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital consisted 
of 266,967,587 ordinary shares of which none were held as treasury shares. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 
13 June 2014 were 266,967,587.
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members
who have appointed a service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to take the
appropriate action on their behalf.
8. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications, and must contain the information
required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a
proxy or is an amendment to an instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be
received by the issuer’s agent ID (RA10) by 11.00 am on 14 September 2014. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the
time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
9. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a
CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting
service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred,
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
10. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001.
11. There will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) from the date of this Notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the
Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting, copies of the following documents:
• the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment; and
• the executive directors’ service agreements.
* Calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras (lines are open from Monday to Friday between 9.00am and 5.30pm).

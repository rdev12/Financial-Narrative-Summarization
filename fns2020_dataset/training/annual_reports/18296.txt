Performance
After the payment of £5.9 million by way of dividends, shareholders’ funds 
increased by £13.6 million to £320.3 million from £306.7 million as at 
28th February 2013. Net assets per share ended the year at 262 pence  
per share compared to 251 pence per share at 28th February 2013.
Our level of net debt, excluding our share of debt within joint ventures, 
remained low at 48.0 per cent compared with 47.9 per cent at 28th 
February 2013. Given the strength and stability of our Balance Sheet and 
our prudent business model, the Board has recommended the payment of  
a final dividend for the year of 3.2 pence per share, payable on 22nd August 
2014 to shareholders on the register on 25th July 2014. This payment will 
bring the total dividend for the year to 5.6 pence per share, an increase of 
16.7 per cent on the previous year.
The year was characterised by a high level of activity across our 
business as we continued to progress our strategy of creating value through 
regeneration. Within our development and trading portfolio, we generated 
further strong gains, with profits of £27.0 million realised in the year ended 
28th February 2014 (28th February 2013: £28.1 million). It was also 
pleasing to note that our investment portfolio including our share of joint 
ventures increased in value by £4.8 million as compared to the fall of 
£12.8 million in the previous year, and we expect this performance to 
improve further. In addition, we have made good progress within our major 
developments programme, with notable activity on the edge of Central 
London. 12 Hammersmith Grove, Algarve House in Southwark and a further 
site in Central London on which we have exchanged conditional contracts, 
all present significant opportunities that build on our track record in 
delivering high quality commercial-led, mixed-use developments. 
Outlook
If the present track of the UK economy proves to be sustainable, we would 
expect to see an increased level of development activity in the market place 
as vacancy rates fall further and business confidence grows to ensure that 
real estate retains its attraction to available UK and global liquidity. The 
future delivery from our project pipeline is playing into the momentum of a 
recovery in the UK economy. Against this backdrop, your Company will 
continue to search out regeneration opportunities in markets where we see 
both current and emerging demand and where we have development 
expertise and a position of strength. In addition, we will continue to search 
out further opportunities from within the financial sector, as banks further 
reduce their exposure to real estate. 
Property development and investment is a complex process that 
requires high levels of professionalism and expertise. My colleagues, the 
management team and staff at Development Securities have continued to 
work hard and I would like to thank them for their efforts, especially as our 
level of activity intensifies. As ever, we will continue to manage our activities 
with the appropriate level of caution and risk management. We are 
well-positioned to capitalise on further opportunities as the cycle continues 
to turn in our favour.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Creating value through  
real estate regeneration
Legacy assets
Like most other real estate businesses, we had some legacy assets that 
were caught off-balance in the downturn of 2008. Our strategy to resolve 
them was to seek new or improved planning consents suitable to a more 
subdued economic environment and changing nature of demand. During 
the year, we made further good progress on two of our three significant, 
non-income earning legacy assets. At Broughton, planning consent was 
received in July 2013 for 232 residential units on 19 acres of land which 
was subsequently sold at book value for £1 1.4 million. At 399 Edgware 
Road, we obtained a revised planning consent for a foodstore-led 
mixed-use scheme. We are now under offer with a funding partner to 
finance the development of the 80,000 sq. ft. food store, pre-let to 
Morrisons, which will unlock £12.5 million of positive cash flow. The other 
components of this scheme, with a similar end development value, will also 
be resolved in the near-term. The third significant legacy asset is at Curzon 
Street in the centre of Birmingham where our ten-acre site is directly 
impacted by the proposed HS2 rail project and it will be some considerable 
time before we will be able to monetise this asset. 
Development and trading portfolio
Our current development and trading portfolio has seen a high level of 
activity and this part of the business continues to perform at or above 
expectations, with a strong pipeline of further disposals established. In April 
2014, we completed the disposal of assets within the Rock portfolio and 
additionally have now realised all of the underlying assets within the Chrome 
portfolio. Both of these portfolios were acquired from financial institutions 
and we continue to seek further such loan portfolio acquisitions.
We were also pleased to secure institutional funding on several of our 
projects since the year end, allowing us to implement their delivery and 
monetise our position. We secured £14.8 million of funding to finance the 
development of The Square in Hale Barns near Manchester, £38.1 million 
of funding for the development of the Sainsbury’s food store at Cross 
Quarter, Abbey Wood and £44.1 million for the first phase of development 
at Shepherd’s Bush Market. These projects were acquired by us in a state  
of obsolescence or dereliction and benefitted from subsequent planning 
permission to facilitate the delivery of these mixed-use regeneration schemes.
Our market
A year can be a long time in the fortunes of the UK economy. Twelve months 
ago, the outlook was uncertain as the economy struggled to generate any 
meaningful growth. Then, catching most people by surprise, the UK 
economy began to show signs of life in the second half of 2013, building 
investor and occupier confidence and reinforcing the upwards shift in 
market dynamics. This firmer growth trend, allied with a restricted supply  
of new development product, creates a positive outlook for the successful 
delivery of our existing pipeline of projects, and improves our prospects  
for new opportunities to be secured. It still remains to be seen how firmly 
and rapidly the regional investment and occupational markets continue  
to recover.
Our focus
We have now established a pipeline of some 40 development projects 
where our strategy is to create value through regeneration. The diversity 
and breadth of our portfolio assists us in restricting our exposure in any one 
project to levels proportionate to our Balance Sheet and also provides good 
visibility on a steady flow of future gains. Our work is presently concentrated 
in London and the South East, with an emphasis on residential and 
foodstore-led mixed-use projects where planning change of use is the  
key driver to value growth. 
For the past few years, office development activity outside Central 
London has been limited. However, as upward rental pressure obliges  
some occupiers to seek more cost effective solutions to their requirements, 
office-led development activity on the edges of Central London is becoming 
increasingly relevant to us. 
Progress in the year 
The main drivers for the growth of £13.6 million in shareholders’ funds  
were the excellent performance from our development and trading portfolio 
which generated gains of £27.0 million during the year (28th February 
2013: £28.1 million), as well as a £4.8 million increase in the value of  
our investment portfolio including our share of joint venture assets.  
We anticipate that this performance will continue and indeed strengthen 
over the coming years.   7 Annual Report 2014
Well poised to capitalise on our  
Balance Sheet strength and

Michael Marx, Chief Executive 
The planning process remains the key enabler to successfully repositioning 
projects in order to realise value. It is pleasing to note that we have secured 
16 planning wins in the period since 1st March 2013. 
We also made a number of acquisitions during the year with a 
continued focus on regeneration projects. Three of these acquisitions were  
in or close to Greater London: a £5.5 million office building in Sevenoaks;  
a £17.5 million portfolio of five office buildings in North London; and an 
£8.3 million town centre mixed-use development opportunity in Romford. 
The residential element of these mixed-use projects is increasingly 
significant to us and, where appropriate, we are seeking planning change  
of use to create more residential development opportunities within our 
portfolio. In October 2013, we acquired our first project in Dublin, a market 
which we perceive to offer further opportunity for development and 
investment. In April 2014, we contributed £8.5 million to the restructuring  
of Deeley Freed, a Bristol-based property developer with an excellent 
reputation for high quality projects who required assistance in reshaping  
its liability portfolio.  
Investment portfolio
As anticipated, our regionally-biased property investment portfolio has now 
begun to show some positive value growth. Yields have started to compress 
as investor appetite for quality assets outside London has increased. This 
improved sentiment has resulted in a valuation uplift of £3.1 million in our 
directly held investment portfolio as at 28th February 2014 (28th February 
2013: £16.4 million decline). Including the investment properties held within 
our various joint ventures, this upward revaluation increases to £4.8 million. 
We are hopeful that these market conditions will further strengthen through 
the coming year. It is pleasing to note that vacancy rates have reduced to 
6.3 per cent as at 28th February 2014 (28th February 2013: 9.7 per cent). 
Our investment portfolio generated £15.0 million in rental income which 
contributes significantly to the stable cash flows of our business.
With increased liquidity and competition within the markets in which 
we operate, we have commenced our programme of disposals of those 
assets where our business plan is now complete. In October 2013, we 
sold The Phones 4u Arena in Manchester for £82.1 million. The value that 
we added to this arena during our period of ownership with our joint venture 
partner was considerable, with returns far exceeding our original expectations. 
Additionally, we sold our Waitrose-anchored scheme in Winchester for 
£23.3 million in March 2014, £1.3 million in excess of book value as at 28th 
February 2013. In April 2014, we sold £21.0 million of assets from within our 
investment portfolio at book value. We intend to recycle the equity released 
from these disposals back into the investment market in the near-term. 
Major developments
In July 2013, we completed 10 Hammersmith Grove, our first large-scale 
office project of the current cycle, and in February this year completed the 
first letting of two floors to UKTV. Work has now commenced on the second 
and final phase of this development, 12 Hammersmith Grove, a 167,000 sq. ft. 
prime office building. In October 2013, we secured an option to acquire 
Algarve House, a vacant, derelict office building in Southwark, another 
strengthening market on the fringe of the Central London core. Here we are 
progressing the masterplan for a mixed-use regeneration scheme of some 
200,000 sq. ft. In April 2014, in joint venture with a financial partner, we 
exchanged conditional contracts to acquire an income-generating office 
building for more than £75.0 million in a Central London location.
In August 2013, we received a compensation payment of £7.1 million 
for releasing our interest in the remaining two phases at PaddingtonCentral, 
the 1.2 million sq. ft. office-led mixed-use regeneration project in which we 
had been engaged for some 15 years. 
Outside London, in March 2014 in a joint venture with Prorsus, we 
were appointed as the private sector partner at Harwell Oxford. Here, we 
will manage and further develop this internationally renowned science 
Campus on a 700-acre site in partnership with the Science and Technology 
Facilities Council and the UK Atomic Energy Authority, two 
Government-backed agencies. 
Outlook
We remain positive about the outlook for all aspects of our business. We are 
well poised to capitalise on our Balance Sheet strength and development 
expertise, which are traditionally much in demand at this point in the cycle.
Michael Marx
Chief Executive
30th April 2014 8 Development Securities PLC 
Our portfolio is purposefully diverse, allowing us to develop and invest across 
different markets and sectors at different stages of the property cycle. Rather 
than relying solely on market momentum to drive value, we have applied our 
development and planning expertise to take functionally obsolete sites from 
acquisition, through the planning process and to ultimate disposal, capitalising 
on the value gain and positive change therein.
Underpinning our diverse activity is a consistent approach to risk management 
and focus that allows us to mitigate the effects of major market fluctuations and 
remain financially robust even during the most severe market conditions. 
 
Strategy

Our focus is to create value through regeneration 
across a diversified portfolio and throughout 
changing property and economic cycles
Business principle Strategy Application in the year ended 28th February 2014 More
We operate a  
low risk financial  
and funding 
structure
The Group seeks to maintain a modest 
level of gearing at 50–60 per cent.
  We maintained a low level of gearing at 48.0 per cent
  Our diverse portfolio keeps our exposure to any one project at 
low levels, mitigating specific risk within an individual project
Page 43
We undertake major 
developments  
in partnership  
with long-term 
institutional 
investors
We do not undertake our major 
developments on our own Balance 
Sheet but limit development risk largely 
through forward-funding, pre-leasing or 
pre-sales.
  Since 1st March 2013 to date, we have secured over 
£189 million of funding from investment partners including  
SWIP Property Trust, Pramerica and Canada Life, allowing  
us to secure the delivery of our projects whilst de-risking  
our involvement 
Page 36
We focus on 
commercial  
and mixed-use 
property
We have a strong track record of 
securing planning consents and 
developing commercial property, 
predominantly mixed-use regeneration 
projects, food-anchored retail schemes 
and prime office developments.
  Our core expertise lies in commercial and mixed-use 
development and from there we have diversified into  
sectors where demand is evident. This includes selected 
residential-led schemes, foodstore-anchored retail schemes, 
student accommodation and hotels
  Where appropriate, we have partnered with specialist operators 
in these sectors in order to augment our own expertise
Page 30
We maintain  
an investment 
portfolio to 
generate a steady 
income stream
Our investment portfolio accounts for  
a significant element of our invested 
equity. We focus mainly on assets with 
core defensive income and opportunities 
to increase value through enhancement 
or redevelopment. This provides a 
steady and predictable flow of income 
which supports our central overheads 
and mitigates the more uneven profits 
and cash flow arising from our 
development activities.
  Our investment portfolio produced £15.0 million of rental  
income during the year, significantly contributing to our  
cash flow and central overheads
  We proactively manage our portfolio to improve income and capital 
values. Since 1st March 2013 we have achieved sales of £32.7 
million in addition to the disposal of a £21.0 million portfolio of 
assets where we had concluded our individual asset business 
plans. We acquired £9.5 million and have exchanged on a further 
£7.4 million of new investment assets
  For the assets reported under IPD, our portfolio growth of 3.3 
per cent compared against a 3.2 per cent annual growth in the 
IPD monthly index excluding Central London

We invest 
predominantly  
in the UK
Nearly all of our development and 
investment activity is conducted within 
the United Kingdom.
  During the year we made our first acquisition in Dublin,  
a market where we see considerable opportunity for further 
development and investment

prime or near-prime market.
How
  Identify strong buying opportunities in 
markets where demand is evident
  Maximise value and growth through 
planning gains, proactive asset 
management and development
  Target project life cycles of three to four 
years and IRRs in excess of 20 per cent
Major developments

product is limited and occupier demand  
is strong
  Apply development and planning 
expertise to take sites from land 
assembly and acquisition to scheme 
completion and full occupancy
  Mitigate development risk through 
institutional forward-funding, pre-sales 
and pre-lets
Investment  
portfolio
Why
To grow a stable income stream from 
higher yielding investment assets with 
enhancement potential. Our investment 
portfolio significantly contributes to our 
central overheads and supports our 
development activities.
How
  Target assets in sectors and locations 
where occupier demand is robust
  Drive income growth through proactive 
asset management and enhancement
We apply our strategy 
across our three 
portfolios as follows:
Real estate loan portfolios 
Why
To realise gains through the acquisition  
of property loan portfolios from banks/
financial institutions.
How
  Acquire real estate loan portfolios with 
opportunities for value enhancement  
e.g. through repositioning of underlying 
real estate assets
  Dispose of the underlying assets as 
rapidly as markets  
will allow to appropriate end users

Strengthening economy
UK GDP growth re-emerged in the second half of 2013, largely as a  
result of a rise in house prices and consumer-led spending together with 
London’s further economic growth. Yield compression is now in evidence  
in markets outside Central London as investors are persuaded up the risk 
curve by the unattractive yields available in Central London and improving 
market fundamentals. The opportunities for developers and investors  
have expanded (see figure 1).
Rental growth/supply and demand
Apart from London, UK property rents overall have yet to make any 
meaningful rise from the low points reached after the 2008 crash. In 
London, constrained supply enabled rents to rise even ahead of the 
economic upturn. Rental growth outside London must await the ripple 
effect to spread from the capital city and for a sustained UK recovery  
(see figure 2).
Prime and secondary markets
The gap in pricing of prime and secondary property remains at historically 
high levels but this yield differential has started to narrow. On one hand,  
this differential has enabled us to acquire assets cost effectively and 
capture value uplift by repositioning them towards prime markets. On the 
other hand, in recent years, it has impacted negatively on our investment 
portfolio performance. With non-prime yields now falling, we would expect 
an improved performance within our investment portfolio and further 
opportunity to acquire secondary real estate where regeneration can  
add further value (see figure 3).
Retail landscape changing
The retail sector is undergoing structural change and the traditional high 
street retailer base continues to be undermined by reduced consumer 
disposable income, the rising dominance of major urban shopping  
centres/supermarkets, and the increasing importance of internet  
shopping. Consumer footfall in foodstore-anchored shopping centres 
remains largely protected. 
Real estate lending less constricted
Banks have cut their exposure to real estate from twelve per cent of  
their commercial loan book to just under nine per cent. Nonetheless,  
there is some evidence that gross lending volumes are now increasing. 
Meanwhile, non-traditional lenders have emerged into the market. 
Additionally, the weight of global liquidity in a near zero interest rate 
environment has encouraged investors into real estate without the need  
for associated leverage. It appears that there is additional capacity in the 
institutional lending market and growing appetite to lend against real  
estate (see figure 4).

Where we operate
—
A diversified portfolio of real estate  
in locations where demand  
is in evidence 
We apply our development and investment skills across a number of 
locations, identifying real estate opportunities that offer potential for value 
enhancement. This allows us to shift our focus according to the challenges 
and opportunities presented by changing property and economic cycles. 
Our portfolio is diverse, allowing us to spread risk across different locations 
and sectors in which value can be generated. 
 A geographic analysis of our portfolio reveals a weighting towards 
London and the South East, both in our investment portfolio and our 
development and trading portfolio. Of particular weighting are suburban 
London locations which will benefit from Crossrail.

Market Risk 
The real estate market is closely 
linked with the health of the local  
and national economies. Lack of 
economic growth or recessionary 
conditions will translate into  
negative sentiment towards and 
performance of real estate.
 • Higher occupier risk in existing 
investment properties leading  
to significantly reduced values.
 • Lack of occupier demand  
leading to functional  
obsolescence in properties.
 • Lack of liquidity available to 
prospective purchasers of 
completed projects may delay 
ability to realise planned  
disposals or reduce prices,  
leading to significantly  
reduced cash inflows.
 • Risk averse property development 
strategy whereby projects are 
pre-funded, pre-let, or pre-sold. 
Long maturities of debt  
finance facilities.
 • Moderate level of gearing.
 • Regular meeting with economic 
forecasters to gauge  
economic trends.
General economic conditions 
have improved during the year 
leading to either stabilisation  
or increase in values across 
most sectors.
Scarcity of investment and  
development opportunities 
The Group’s business is  
predominantly transactional and 
requires a flow of opportunities for 
either development/regeneration  
or to acquire for long term income  
and capital appreciation. The risk  
is that the flow of suitably priced 
opportunities either reduces  
or stops.
 • Inability to source new deals 
leads to decline in trading  
and development profits in  
future years.
 • Higher pricing of acquisition 
opportunities leads to reduced 
ability to add value.
 • Flexible approach to market 
opportunities, seeking out  
sectors where value can be 
generated and seeking  
funding partners with different 
return requirements.
 • Stringent deal underwriting 
procedures with minimum  
return hurdles.
 • Maintaining broad industry 
contacts for acquisitions rather 
than being dependent upon a 
single source of opportunity.
Opportunities continue  
to be sourced for both 
development and investment 
which satisfy Group 
underwriting criteria.
Risks 
—
The Group’s business model is defined by the 
nature and extent of the risks which the 
Directors consider are material to the Group’s 
strategy, size and capabilities
The Group’s risk profile is maintained under continual review by its Risk 
Committee, which meets quarterly, and also by the Board.
The Group categorises risks according to the likelihood of occurrence 
and the potential impact on the Group. The Directors consider the following 
to be the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
These risks have been grouped as either:
 • External risks – whose occurrence is beyond the control of the Group; or
 • Business risks – which the Directors choose to manage as part of the 
Group’s operations

on pages 63 and 64.  13 Annual Report 2014
External Risks continued
Risk Impact Mitigation
Risk exposure change
year on year
People Risk 
The Group’s success depends  
on the ability and experience of  
its Directors and key staff.
 • Failure to retain key individuals  
or the failure to attract and  
retain new talent can result in  
the loss of core competences, 
industry knowledge and  
networks resulting in a reduction 
in the number and scale of 
profitable opportunities.
 • The Group aims to motivate and 
reward its team appropriately  
and competitively, as described  
in the Remuneration Policy.
 • The Board keeps the strength  
and depth of the team under 
continual review.
Bank Funding Risk 
The pressure on a large number  
of traditional real estate lending  
banks to reduce their exposure to  
real estate reduces the capacity and 
liquidity within the lending market.
 • Inability to secure funding for  
new opportunities.
 • Inability to refinance existing 
facilities leading to disposals at  
the wrong time in business plans 
and failing to maximise profits.
 • Unpredictability in cash flows.
 • The Group maintains relationships 
with a wide range of both bank  
and non-bank lenders, reducing 
overreliance on any one partner.
 • The Group is constantly seeking to 
widen its range of funding sources 
and liaising with new entrants into 
the real estate lending market.
The lending market continues 
to see new entrants. 
Competitive pressures  
have led to a reduction in 
margins and an increase  
in maturities available.
Counterparty Risk 
Transaction counterparties, be they 
joint venture partners, purchasers 
under sale contacts or banks in 
respect of cash deposits or derivative 
arrangements may either suffer or  
fail financially.
 • Failure of sales transaction 
counterparties may lead to  
an inability to produce  
trading profits.
 • Failure of financial counterparties 
may impact on effectiveness  
of hedging or recoverability of 
deposits.
 • Proof of funding required prior  
to agreeing sales contracts.
 • The Board regularly assesses  
the credit worthiness of financial 
counterparties prior to placing 
deposits and hedging transactions.
Business Risks
Risk Impact Mitigation
Risk exposure change
year on year
Planning Risk 
Procuring an appropriate and valuable 
planning consent is often a key 
element of the creation of value 
through property development.
Securing planning permission in a 
changing regulatory environment is  
a complex and uncertain process,  
with applications subject to objection 
from a wide range of potential 
stakeholders, and hence is prone  
to delay, modification and rejection.
 • Failure to secure planning  
consent can render a project 
unviable/unprofitable and  
lead to the write off of 
considerable costs.
 • The Group retains a team with 
extensive experience of achieving 
planning consents and local 
knowledge supplemented by 
advisors and sector specialist 
partners to maximise the chance 
of success and reduce the risks 
and costs of failure.
 • An alternative exit strategy is 
always considered in case of 
planning failure.
Construction Risk 
Real estate construction is subject  
to the risk of cost overruns, delay  
and the financial failure of an 
appointed contractor.
 • Reduced profitability or potential 
loss on individual projects.
 • Construction work ceasing  
whilst a suitable replacement 
contractor is found.
 • The Group deploys its own 
experienced project managers 
throughout the life of individual 
projects to ensure that costs are 
appropriately budgeted, timetables 
are adhered to and hence the 
impact of these risks is minimised.
 • The Group performs appropriate 
pre-contract due diligence on the 
capabilities and financial security 
of its material contractors.
          Next year it is expected  
growing confidence will lead  
to increases in orders placed, 
putting upwards pressure  
on prices.  P LAY 
THE OLD  
VINYL  
FACTORY, 
HAYES  15 Annual Report 2014
ON 
There are many places that could call themselves the home  
of pop music. Manchester, the nexus for Madchester and  
Britpop, is one. So is Abbey Road, where the Beatles and  
Pink Floyd honed their sound.
 Hayes trumps them all. This unassuming town in West London 
grew up around the headquarters of the Gramophone and 
Typewriter Company – later to be known as EMI. EMI started 
pressing records here, under the legendary His Master’s Voice 
label, in 1907. They didn’t stop for sixty years.
 Every Beatles record was pressed here. In its heyday, over 
22,000 people worked on the site, making records by Deep 
Purple, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones. Records that would 
change the world. (When asked to press Sex Pistols’ God Save 
The Queen, many of those workers refused, nearly delaying the 
record’s release.)
 Today, the Old Vinyl Factory is largely vacant. The beautiful Art 
Deco buildings – designed by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners – are 
slowly decaying. All that remains of the Factory’s incredible legacy 
is the EMI Archive Trust, a little charity that still operates today. 
Preface
Thirty years after EMI moved 
out, The Old Vinyl Factory is 
ready for its encore, thanks to 
an ambitious £250 million joint 
venture between Development 
Securities and Cathedral Group. 16 Development Securities PLC 
A TASTE  
OF THINGS  
TO COME
The lyric picked 
out in huge 
letters on the 
wall could be a 
mantra for the 
entire scheme: 
‘We built this city 
on rock ’n’ roll’.
Martyn Evans  
Cathedral Group
Why would a developer be interested 
in a cluster of derelict factories in  
a distant corner of West London?
 Most weren’t. “All the agents  
told us to run a mile,” explains  
Martyn Evans, Cathedral Group’s 
Creative Director. “So naturally, we 
were interested.”
 The site has a few things going  
for it. Hayes is a stone’s throw from 
Heathrow, which is useful for 
businesses. And, when Crossrail 
arrives in 2018, it’s likely to be more 
attractive to commuters. But there 
are many other towns in the same 
position. How is the Old Vinyl  
Factory going to stand out?
 The answer can be found in the 
Shipping Building – the place where 
EMI used to pack Britain’s finest pop 
tunes before sending them around 
the world. Today, the building hosts 
the Vinyl Canteen, which serves the 
500 people working on-site, as well 
as curious visitors.
 The Canteen was conceived as  
a preview of the Factory’s future. 
Inside, it’s beautiful: bold Art Deco 
patterns are picked out in glazed  
tiles on the counter; the high ceiling 
is hung with cheery, yolk-yellow 
awnings. The food is cooked by 
Greenwich Cooperative Development 
Agency, a cooperative that promotes 
urban growing, local food, and 
sustainability. The Starship lyric 
picked out in huge letters on the  
wall could be a mantra for the  
entire scheme: “We built this city  
on rock ’n’ roll”.
 “You have to create a compelling 
story,” explains Evans. “You need  
to convince people it’s going to  
be great.”   17 Annual Report 2014
THE  
CREATIVE  
HUB
The Old Vinyl Factory is a mixed  
use scheme. The public spaces  
and housing will be built around  
the so-called ‘Central Research 
Laboratory’: a state-of-the-art 
incubator for British startups in 
engineering, manufacturing and 
retail; a place where freewheeling 
creatives and business heads will  
be able to cross-pollinate.
 “We want to turn innovators  
into entrepreneurs,” says Evans.
 This sentiment is echoed by Kit 
Malthouse, the Mayor’s business  
and enterprise deputy, who 
describes the Old Vinyl Factory  
as “planting acorns”. The GLA has 
confirmed its intention to invest  
£7.7 million in the scheme. The 
ambition is to revive high-tech 
manufacturing in West London.
 If successful, it would be a fitting 
tribute to the Factory’s history. In the 
Sixties, EMI did more than just press 
vinyl at Hayes. The site was also 
home to the company’s research 
laboratories. It was here that Sir 
Godfrey Hounsfield developed the 
CAT scanner – work that would 
eventually earn him a Nobel Prize,  
not to mention save countless lives 
around the world.
 After forty years of decline, the 
Old Vinyl Factory promises to return 
Hayes to the forefront of British 
ingenuity. The little town that really 
was built on rock ’n’ roll will soon be 
rocking again.  A Vibrant Future
Shepherd’s Bush Market, London  19 Annual Report 2014
Preface On the west side of London, only  
just beyond gleaming Westfield, lies 
another, very different retail destination.
 Shepherd’s Bush Market is hard to 
categorise. It does not sell any one 
thing. The market has a strong history  
in fabrics, but you can buy groceries, 
garments, electrical goods and 
kitchenware there too.
 The traders are as diverse as the 
goods they are trading. Over the years, 
Shepherd’s Bush has welcomed East 
End barrow-boys and Jewish fabric 
merchants, West Indians and Pakistanis. 
More recently, traders from the Middle 
East and Eastern Europe have added  
to the mix.
 New faces join every year – but 
plenty of the old ones remain. Near  
the middle of the market, for example,  
E. Mills & Son still sells carpets – just  
as it did in 1918. The market’s identity  
is its diversity.  
This summer, Shepherd’s Bush  
Market will celebrate its 100th  
birthday. The market has seen 
many changes over the years –  
but its £150 million revitalisation 
could be the biggest yet.  20 Development Securities PLC 
Widening  
appeal 
What you need  
to do is listen  
to everyone’s  
point of view
Guy Rose 
Market Manager
”
So why does it need to change? 
Walking through the market on a 
Tuesday morning, the answer seems 
clear: it’s quiet.  No retailer has found 
the last few years easy, but markets 
have tended to benefit from our passion 
for localism. What’s different about 
Shepherd’s Bush?
 Robin Partington is the architect 
working on the project. He cites a 
fundamental disconnect with the  
local area.
 “It’s never been part of the community. 
There’s nowhere for people to chat. 
If I was an old person, I wouldn’t want 
people barging past me all the time.”
 Shepherd’s Bush is a linear market. 
It stretches for 300 metres between 
the Uxbridge and Goldhawk Roads. 
When the market is busy, walking along 
it is claustrophobic. The new plans will 
widen the central thoroughfare, and 
create breathing spaces along the way.
 Some of the traders are worried this 
will change the feel of the market. 
Others think that that’s precisely  
the point.
“Markets are full of individuals,”  
explains Guy Rose, who manages 
Shepherd’s Bush on behalf of 
Wellington Markets, the specialist 
operator brought on board by 
Development Securities and Orion. 
“What you need to do is listen to 
everyone’s point of view.”
 Wellington Markets’ portfolio 
includes Old Spitalfields Market –  
a big success story in market 
regeneration. When Spitalfields was 
vacated in 1991, the future looked 
bleak. But new investment has made 
the market vibrant again.
 The ambition is to do the same 
for Shepherd’s Bush. The market’s 
historical strength in fabrics will be 
built upon, new public spaces and its 
diverse offer will encourage visitors 
to spend time there, rather than just 
pass through, and 200 new homes will 
ensure the market’s life extends beyond 
trading hours.    21 Annual Report 2014
Any urban regeneration project is 
challenging. At Shepherd’s Bush, there  
is a dizzying array of people involved:  
the Mayor, the GLA, the borough, TfL,  
the traders, local residents, customers.  
One thing they all agree on is that the 
market has “character”, and that this 
character must be preserved.
 What do they mean? Mailk and Raja 
own a grocery shop in one of the railway 
arches on the west side of the market. 
How long have they been here? “Not 
long,” says Malik. “32 years.” He grins.
 Malik and Raja are generous with  
their time. They make jokes. They pose 
for photographs. It’s an experience you 
couldn’t imagine having on many  
British high streets.
 This is the character the 
redevelopment hopes to crystallise. 
“Traders don’t want to lose the chemistry,” 
says Robin. “That’s natural. What we’re 
doing is trying to capture to spirit of the 
market, and help it better engage with  
the public. We want to give it a future.”  
Staying in

CROSS QUARTER, ABBEY WOOD, LONDON  23 Annual Report 2014
How do you regenerate a community? There’s no one answer  
to that question, of course. Every community is different. Each  
has its own needs and aspirations. But the recipe would usually 
involve one or more of the following: new jobs, new housing,  
new community facilities and new transport infrastructure.
 Abbey Wood, in South East London, grew up in the Fifties.  
The Second World War devastated London’s East End, creating  
an urgent need for housing in and around London. London  
County Council’s solution was to build a series of large,  
out-of-town developments in places like Abbey Wood. 
 At a stroke, the Abbey Estate created 3,000 new homes. 
The area suddenly had a lot more residents, and the community 
facilities were found wanting. There were few pubs and shops. 
Many of the residents, used to busy lives in East London, felt 
stranded among Greenwich’s misty marshes. That lassitude  
has continued, in some degree, to this day.
 Now, Development Securities and Berkshire Investment  
Capital are planning a new mixed scheme for the town.  
Cross Quarter will create up to 220 homes in the heart of  
Abbey Wood – as well as new community facilities that will  
benefit the whole town.  
Preface 
Much of Abbey Wood was built 
in the Fifties, to accommodate 
people displaced from London’s 
East End. Our £85 million 
regeneration will bring new  
jobs, housing and community 
facilities – just in time for the 
arrival of Crossrail 24 Development Securities PLC 
All Aboard
Regeneration isn’t just  
about the development  
itself. It’s about forging  
a stronger community. 
 
Laurence Martin  
Development Securities PLC
”
In 2018, Crossrail will connect Abbey 
Wood directly to central London. Up to 
12 trains will depart for the city centre 
every hour. You’ll be able to get to 
Canary Wharf in eleven minutes, the 
West End in just over 20, and Heathrow 
in under an hour.
 The likely consequences are obvious. 
Abbey Wood, like every town on the 
Crossrail route, will become newly 
attractive to London’s ever-expanding 
workforce. Affluent commuters will 
pour into the area. Terry Morgan, the 
Chairman of Crossrail, cites Abbey 
Wood as one of the communities that 
will benefit most from the new network.
 New transport infrastructure may not 
be sexy, but it’s hard to overstate the 
effect it can have. In the first six months 
of 2013, 48% of planning applications 
made in London cited Crossrail as a key 
investment rationale. Crossrail’s tunnels 
are deep, but their influence is clear  
at street level: new buildings spring  
up along the route like buttercups.    25 Annual Report 2014
Investing  
in the 
Community
Even so, fast trains on their own do 
nothing. In the Fifties, thousands  
flocked to Abbey Wood despite its 
remoteness because they lacked  
other options. Now they have plenty.
 So what will make Cross Quarter 
distinctive? At the centre of the new 
development will be an 81,000 sq. ft. 
Sainsbury’s superstore with an attractive 
steel and glass façade. The outline plans 
also include consent for 220 new flats,  
a 100-room hotel, commercial space,  
a nursery and a new public square.
 In other words, this is a mixed-use 
scheme. The emphasis is on commercial, 
retail and public space as well as new 
homes. Laurence Martin, who leads the 
project at Development Securities, makes 
a point of the fact that Cross Quarter  
isn’t just about building shiny new  
homes for commuters.
 “It will be a great place to live.  
But it will also be a great place to shop,  
to work, to stay – or just to pass through. 
“Regeneration isn’t just about the 
development itself. It’s about forging  
a stronger community. That’s what  
we’re trying to do in Abbey Wood.”
 It’s tempting to think of the 
regeneration of towns like Abbey Wood 
as a simple product of new investment. 
But if the Fifties and Sixties taught 
us anything, it’s that poorly planned 
developments, however modern, often  
fail to live up to their potential. To  
suceed, they must be sensitive to the 
needs and aspirations of both current  
and future residents and visitors.
 This is the ambition behind Cross 
Quarter: not just to create a great 
scheme, but to create a greater  
Abbey Wood.  
The ambition is  
not just to create  
a great scheme, but 
to create a greater 
Abbey Wood.

” Preface 
Harwell Oxford has long been  
at the forefront of British science.  
Now, a multimillion pound investment 
by Development Securities and 
Harwell Oxford Partners is turning  
it into Europe’s Stanford.
Map Data: Google, Bluesky  27 Annual Report 2014
The quiet countryside of south Oxfordshire 
might not be where you’d go looking for the 
future. But here, spread across 700 rolling 
acres lies one of Europe’s leading centres 
of discovery: the Harwell Science and 
Innovation Campus.
 The Campus started life as an RAF  
base in 1937. It was from here that many  
of the Airspeed Horsa gliders involved in 
the D-Day landings flew. In fact, the first 
D-Day troops to land in Normandy came 
from Harwell.
 After the War, the site was inherited 
by the UK Atomic Energy Research 
Establishment, tasked with developing 
nuclear fission for both military and domestic 
use. A decade later, the AERE was joined 
by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, 
a national centre for space science and 
particle physics research.
 These two institutions established Harwell 
Oxford as one of the world’s leading centres 
for ‘Big Science’. But, as the Cold War 
wound down, the AERE moved out, and 
research budgets were cut. For a period the 
site languished before its relatively recent 
and now accelerating reinvigoration.

Julian Barwick

”
The challenge with ‘Big Science’ is just how 
big it can be. Nuclear reactors and particle 
accelerators don’t come cheap. Fusion has 
the potential to solve all our energy needs, 
but the billions governments have invested 
into it have yet to solve all of the scientific 
challenges.
 In 2006, Harwell Oxford was rebooted as 
the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, 
with millions in new investment – including 
the £350 million Diamond Light Source,  
one of the world’s biggest synchrotrons.  
The idea was that new facilities would attract 
new, dynamic businesses in engineering, 
manufacturing and technology, and turn 
Harwell Oxford into a global research hub.
 So far, that bet is paying off. High-tech 
organisations based in Harwell Oxford range 
from the European Space Agency to Element 
Six, a De Beers subsidiary that manufactures 
superhard materials. In total, there are now 
170 organisations on-site, employing  
5,000 people.
 But with just 30 per cent of the 700-acre 
site in use, Harwell Oxford has room to grow. 
That’s why Development Securities and 
Harwell Oxford Partners have purchased 
a 50 per cent stake in the Campus, joining 
existing public sector stakeholders the UK 
Atomic Energy Authority (the successor to 
AERE) and the Science and Technology 
Facilities Council.
 The new joint venture will expand the 
commercial R&D space on-site, and introduce 
housing and other amenities. The ambition 
is to turn Harwell Oxford into the European 
equivalent to Mission Bay or Stanford: a 
thriving research community for both the 
public and private sectors.

A synchrotron is a particle accelerator, 
which in the case of Diamond Light 
Source accelerates electron particles,  
to near light speed, thereby generating 
light ten billion times brighter than the 
sun. This light is then used to examine 
the structure of materials. Harwell 
Oxford’s Diamond Light Source is one  
of the best in the world and its sister 
facility, Isis, also on site conducts similar 
analysis using a different source.

 Diamond and Isis are just two of  
Harwell Oxford’s major facilities. The 
Campus is also home to the world’s most 
powerful laser, Vulcan, and a satellite  
array that will soon receive signals from  
the Copernicus satellites, giving detailed, 
real-time data on earth from above – 
invaluable to a new breed of ‘Big Data’

smaller powerful electron microscopes, 
lasers, and other high-tech testing centres. 
Each has hundreds of commercial and 
intellectual applications. 
 “Harwell Oxford is a classic example 
of how organisations cluster in order 
to succeed,” says Julian Barwick, 
Development Securities. “The bigger  
the cluster the stronger the pull. It’s just  
as well we have 500 acres to build out.”
 Thanks to the joint venture’s new

Development and trading  
portfolio
— 
This has been a year of intense activity 
across all aspects of our development  
and trading portfolio 
Our markets
We have continued to progress the business plans for those assets 
acquired by us over the past three to four years, whilst also growing our 
pipeline of projects. During the year, we generated gains of £27.0 million 
from further asset realisations within our portfolio and with a diversified 
pipeline of projects now established, we expect to maintain this level of 
activity over the coming years. We continue to focus on structural over 
cyclical growth, delivering performance by the implementation of specific 
asset activity.
 Our development and trading activity falls broadly into two categories. 
First, regeneration projects whereby we are able to acquire assets or land  
in a state of obsolescence or distress and, through redevelopment, create 
institutional quality assets for which demand is strong. With the yield gap 
between secondary and prime markets still at historically high levels, albeit 
starting to narrow, we see continued opportunity to generate value through 
this process. Our second area of focus is the acquisition of assets or 
portfolios from financial institutions or banks. We have now completed 
more than ten such transactions and we expect further activity as banks 
continue to seek to reduce their exposure to real estate. In both of these 
areas of activity, it is our ability to apply our development and asset 
management expertise that drives significant value, with planning change 
being a key catalyst for positive growth. 
 The last twelve months have seen a vast improvement in the prospects 
for the UK economy, with a positive impact on a number of the markets in 
which we operate. Investor appetite for residential land and developments 
has continued to increase as demand continues to outstrip supply. London 
dominates in this positive value growth but the ripple effect is starting to 
spread beyond central areas. We have a good pipeline of residential land 
and development projects and, where appropriate, we are targeting further 
residential-led real estate opportunities in order to increase our presence 
within this market. 
 A number of retail sub-sectors saw a decline during the year, mainly in 
peripheral UK locations. Outside London, retail remains a patchy sector that 
is trailing the recovery. The challenges that face the sector increasingly 
appear to be structural and less responsive to cyclical improvements in the 
wider economy. Within the foodstore sector, the ‘race for space’ amongst 
the biggest UK supermarket brands has halted as consumer shopping 
habits have continued to evolve and the big discount brands have increased 
their market share. All supermarkets are still looking to expand their stores 
in aggregate, however, the bias is now towards convenience retailing rather 
than large-format superstores. We are adjusting our focus accordingly and 
seeking further opportunities in the convenience retail sector. 
 During the year, we acquired our first property in Dublin, a market 
where transactional activity is increasing and in which we see further 
opportunities for investment and development.

Acquisitions
We made five acquisitions during the year within our development and  
trading portfolio, the full details of which are provided in the property  
matrix on pages 32 to 35. Four of these acquisitions offer residential-led 
development opportunities: Romford in East London; Tubs Hill House in 
Sevenoaks; a portfolio of five properties in zones one and two of North 
London, and Percy Place in Dublin. In April 2014, we partnered with Deeley 
Freed, a Bristol-based property company, providing it with £8.5 million to 
restructure its facilities and assist in the delivery of seven of its existing 
projects. The company has a solid track record for delivery and an established  
regional presence. The majority of its projects are in provincial cities in  
the South West with a mix of commercial, mixed-use and foodstore-led 
development opportunities which will be delivered over the next three years. 
Disposals
Our strategy was further validated during the year as we secured our exit 
from a number of projects. At The MVMNT, Greenwich, a 350,000 sq. ft. 
mixed-use project, Willmott Dixon and McLaren are both on site with the 
residential and student accommodation elements of the scheme. We also 
secured funding for the 106-bed hotel, pre-let to Travelodge, which is also 
now under construction. In late 2014, we will take delivery of the retail and 
leisure space on the ground floor of the residential blocks to complete the 
final phase of this regeneration project and early marketing has 
commenced.
 At Rembrandt House, Watford, we completed the £5.6 million sale of 
part of the site to a local housebuilder with planning consent having been 
achieved for a 107-unit residential scheme. A 40,000 sq. ft. office building 
remains on the residual part of the site for which we are exploring 
development options. 
In July 2013, we sold a site at The Old Vinyl Factory to Willmott Dixon for 
the development of a 132-unit residential development. In April 2014, we 
entered the final sign-off stage for £7.7 million of loan funding from the 
GLA’s ‘Growing Places Fund’ for the development of the ‘Central Research 
Laboratory’, an innovation hub for start-ups and SMEs which will help to 
further establish this significant regeneration scheme. In April 2014, we 
also disposed of the final assets within the Rock portfolio and concluded 
the sales of underlying assets within the Chrome portfolio. Both of these 
portfolios were acquired from banks and we have overseen their 
profitable disposal.
 We were also pleased to secure institutional funding on three projects 
within our development and trading portfolio during the year, at Cross 
Quarter in Abbey Wood, Shepherd’s Bush Market and at The Square, 
Hale Barns. 
Planning success
Securing new or improved planning consents for the projects within our 
portfolio remains the key driver to growth and positive change. In this 
regard, we continued to make good progress, securing 16 new planning 
consents, a 100 per cent success rate. These include outline planning for  
a significant urban extension project at a 207-acre site north of Norwich, 
comprising 3,500 homes within a new mixed-use community. At Shepherd’s 
Bush, we secured detailed planning consent for our regeneration project 
which will include 21 1 homes, 14,000 sq. ft. of retail space and a revitalised 
market at the heart of the development. Planning consents were also 
achieved at projects in Launceston, Barnstaple, Cross Quarter in Abbey 
Wood, 399 Edgware Road, Marsh Mills in Plymouth and at Atlantic Park 
in Devon.  32 Development Securities PLC

The modest size of our Balance Sheet and our risk averse approach to 
specific development exposures has largely precluded us from involvement 
in major projects in the Central London core. Instead, we have focused on 
locations on the edge of Central London where supply of high quality offices 
has been constrained, demand is credible and location fundamentals are 
strong. In these markets, where aggregate demand may indeed be reducing 
and where occupiers are more price sensitive, we are required to be 
discerning with regard to the product that we deliver and the specific sites 
we select. We are pleased to report that the delivery of premium quality 
office developments in these markets has proven to be a valid proposition. 
 In summer 2013, we completed 10 Hammersmith Grove, a 1 10,000  
sq. ft. Grade A office building, on time and within budget. The two 
restaurants are let to Byron Burger and Bill’s Produce and our first office 
letting to UKTV, who will take two floors of the building, was signed in 
February 2014. Our discussions with other tenants are advancing well and 
80 per cent of the office space is now let or in solicitors’ hands with just a 
floor and a half available. Average rents agreed are 15 per cent above the 
pro forma rent of £40 per sq. ft. In March 2014, we agreed terms with SWIP 
Property Trust, the institutional funder of 10 Hammersmith Grove, to 
forward-fund the next and final phase of this development for £92.0 million. 
12 Hammersmith Grove will provide 167,000 sq. ft. of prime office space 
with new restaurant space and additional public realm. Construction will 
start imminently with completion anticipated in Q1 2016. The supply of 
competing office space of this quality in Hammersmith remains very limited. 
 Since 1st March 2013, we have secured two other major development 
opportunities in London. In October 2013, we secured an agreement to 
acquire Algarve House, a derelict office building adjacent to Southwark 
underground station. Our masterplan for the redevelopment of the site  
is advanced and we anticipate starting the public consultation process  
in summer 2014. In April 2014, in conjunction with a financial partner we 
exchanged conditional contracts to acquire an income-producing office 
building at a cost in excess of £75.0 million in Central London, with  
potential for redevelopment on site.

In April 2014, we were selected, alongside our operating partner Prorsus,  
by two Government agencies, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority 
and the Science and Technology Facilities Council as their private sector 
partner at Harwell Oxford. The site comprises 700 acres in total, of which 
approximately 30 per cent is already developed as a science Campus of 
international standing. Our role is to bring forward future phases of 
development for commercial science and research companies for whom 
the proximity of the Government’s various large-scale facilities confer 
competitive advantage.   37 Annual Report 2014
Top: 10 and 12 Hammersmith Grove.

At Cambourne Business Park, we are confident that the activity levels of 
Cambridge city centre will now ripple towards this location. There is a case 
for speculative development, and we shall be embarking on a number of 
discussions with partners this year. 
 At Cambridge Science Park, we are Trinity Hall’s development 
managers for three office and laboratory buildings totalling 133,000 sq. ft. 
We were delighted to start on the first laboratory and office building in 
January 2014, which is pre-let to the UK subsidiary of a leading Japanese 
pharmaceutical company. 
 Harwell Oxford, Cambourne and Cambridge Science Park are all 
located in important knowledge clusters, where the strength of occupier 
demand is driven by proximity to a highly educated and specialist workforce. 
These ‘innovation’ clusters are one of the success stories in office real 
estate markets outside London. 
  Slough has been slightly slower to recover as a significant office 
location than we had hoped, but the tide is undoubtedly on the turn and our 
scheme at Brunel Place of 350,000 sq. ft. of offices is looking increasingly 
good value when compared with Central and West London. 
 It was of course with some sadness that we gave up our role as 
developers of PaddingtonCentral as Aviva, our partner of some 15 years, 
exercised their right to sell the estate which we had jointly created, to British 
Land. Having delivered a regeneration project of some 1.2 million sq. ft.  
of commercial-led mixed-use regeneration, we were compensated by a 
payment of £7.1 million. 38 Development Securities PLC 
Investment portfolio
— 
Values increase as regional  
investment market rebounds
Overview and performance 
During the year, the value of our investment portfolio including our share  
of joint venture assets increased by £4.8 million as the regional investment 
market recovered from the decline of the previous few years. As anticipated, 
we are seeing a marked increase in investor appetite for the types of 
regional retail assets that our portfolio comprises and, as such, liquidity  
and competitive tension is returning to these markets. The resultant yield 
compression has largely accounted for the positive change in our portfolio. 
In addition, we continued to drive value across our portfolio through 
proactive asset management and enhancement, with resultant vacancy 
rates falling to 6.3 per cent from 9.7 per cent as at 28th February 2013.  
We completed £0.4 million of new lettings during the year. 
 With investor demand increasing, we have accelerated the disposal  
of a number of assets where our business plan is now complete. In October, 
we sold the Phones 4u Arena in joint venture with Patron Capital for  
£82.1 million. We also secured the sale of our office and retail scheme in 
Chorlton-cum-Hardy near Manchester for £10.1 million, generating gains  
of £1.2 million. In March 2014, we sold Weeke Shopping Centre in 
Winchester to an institutional fund for £23.3 million. In April 2014, we sold 
at book value a portfolio of investment assets comprising retail assets in 
Bexleyheath, Carmarthen, Crewe and Port Talbot for £21.0 million. 
 In February 2014, we acquired the Royal York Buildings, a former hotel 
in Brighton, for £4.5 million which we simultaneously let to the Youth Hostel 
Association on a 100-year lease, who will convert the property into a 
180-bed youth hostel. The property offers further asset enhancement 
potential and currently generates an income return of 7.3 per cent. In April 
2014, we exchanged contracts to acquire a foodstore-anchored retail 
centre in Armagh, Northern Ireland, for £7.4 million, a 9.1 per cent net initial 
yield. The shopping centre offers opportunities for asset management and 
enhancement, with some scope for redevelopment on site. 
Outlook
We continue to focus on foodstore-anchored retail investment assets  
in strong provincial markets, where we can add value through asset 
management and enhancement. With the UK economy strengthening and 
consumer confidence building, we anticipate further growth in our portfolio 
in the near-term. Where appropriate, we will seek to dispose of non-core 
assets in order to rationalise our portfolio and recycle our equity into further 
investment assets which offer stable, long-term income prospects and 
opportunities for value growth through asset enhancement.

Financial Review
Review of the year
— 
Review of the Year
The last year has seen an improvement in the UK economy, both in terms  
of GDP growth and also business sentiment as the recovery from the 
downturn continues. At the same time, we have seen a continued trend  
of overseas capital focusing on UK markets for investment and the flow of 
capital into the regions and more secondary assets has started to increase.
 Conditions have continued to ease in the debt markets for real estate, 
with pressure beginning to reduce margins as banks compete for new 
business and also contemplate longer duration loans than has been 
possible for the last three years, albeit there is still a focus on higher quality 
sponsors and projects. To that end, it is pleasing to report that we have 
continued to source funding from our existing long-term banking partners 
for the acquisition of the Romford property in July 2013 and also the North 
London office portfolio of five office buildings in February 2014. We have 
also utilised debt from one of the newer debt fund entrants into the market 
with the £44.1 million facility for our joint venture at Shepherd’s Bush, which 
has already been partially utilised to acquire the Shepherd’s Bush Market in 
February 2014.
 We have been able to acquire these exciting new opportunities to add 
value, whilst at the same time realising a number of projects where we have 
either completed our business plan or believe that we cannot achieve 
further significant added value going forward.
 Notable disposals during the year have included the Phones 4u Arena 
in Manchester where, in conjunction with our joint venture partner Patron 
Capital, we were able to achieve a sale at £82.1 million for an asset 
originally acquired for £62.2 million in June 2010. This year also saw 
the conclusion of our 15-year involvement in the redevelopment of 
PaddingtonCentral, where we received a final compensation payment  
of £7.1 million when our partners disposed of their holding. We have also 
now successfully completed the disposal programme of the Chrome 
portfolio where all of the underlying assets have now been realised.
We have continued our process of improving the efficiency of our Balance 
Sheet by seeking to monetise legacy, non-income earning positions.  
The most significant element of this was the disposal of 19 acres of land  
at Broughton for £1 1.4 million. Good progress has also been made at 399 
Edgware Road where detailed planning consent for the Morrisons food 
store was achieved. We have also managed to renegotiate the structure  
of our long dated €47 million loan notes and associated hedging 
arrangements, which was concluded in March 2014. The effect of this  
has been to release £9.7 million of non-income generating cash collateral 
back to the Group for investment whilst also reducing the annual finance 
cost to the Group going forward by £0.8 million through to the revised  
seven year maturity.
 As at 28th February 2014, our weighted average debt maturity was  
6.8 years (6.4 years including share of joint ventures), compared with 8.3 
years as at 28th February 2013 (7.1 years including share of joint ventures).
 As at 28th February 2014, net debt, including share of joint ventures, 
stood at £181.9 million, a decrease from £196.1 million at 28th February 
2013. This represents gearing of 56.8 per cent, comfortably within our 
normal target level of 50-60 per cent, which is as expected given the 
number of realisations during the year. As at 30th April 2014, net debt  
had fallen to £193.2 million, representing gearing of 39.3 per cent.
 If joint ventures are excluded, the Group’s gearing was 48.0 per cent as  
at 28th February 2014, compared with 47.9 per cent a year earlier. The 
Group’s overall loan-to-value ratio, calculated as net debt divided by total 
property assets, was 44.7 per cent (28th February 2013: 38.0 per cent).  43 Annual Report 2014
Capital structure and liquidity management
The Group’s strategy for capital structure and liquidity management is to 
maintain a conservative balance between equity and debt appropriate to  
the nature and profile of our asset portfolio, achieving both certainty and 
flexibility. This takes into consideration our operational strategy and our 
intention for each asset, together with our expectations for the availability 
and cost of alternative sources of finance. 
In particular we operate within a structure which limits the level of our 
equity exposure to any particular asset and also the level of external debt 
which can be applied.
Our cash resources and overall liquidity are managed at Group level, 
with each asset or project monitored according to its own specific risk profile.
All development and trading assets have business plans which include 
timetables for realisation. The Group always retains a cash buffer to ensure 
that delays in planned asset realisations do not impact upon the normal 
operation of the business.
Where we enter into debt facilities, secured against assets, we do so  
in a way that matches debt profile against asset profile.
We have long-term fixed rate debt facilities which are used to fund 
long-term investment assets. In respect of shorter-term trading assets,  
we fund these with asset specific debt which is structured to support the 
individual asset business plan.
Within our debt portfolio we maintain a mix of fixed and variable interest 
rates, with a preference for fixing of both larger and longer-term borrowings so 
as to significantly mitigate our interest rate risk. For shorter maturity facilities 
our preference is to cap our interest rates exposure rather than to fix it.
The Group does not usually take development risk on large scale major 
development projects. This risk is mitigated in several ways, including the 
completed forward sale of the land and project assets through to the 
contracted sale of the completed development with appropriate guarantees 
of completion. Where direct development is undertaken on more modest 
schemes, this is funded by way of Group equity and medium-term bank 
facilities, providing the necessary flexibility of funding for both site assembly 
and construction.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are funded directly with 
equity. Any gearing is deployed within the ventures themselves.
Responsibility for the management of cash and liquidity risk rests with 
the Board. The executive team has systems in place for the monitoring and 
management of this key area of our business. Daily review of this area is 
delegated to the Finance Director. The executive team consider this on a 
weekly basis and the Board formally reviews the position at its meetings, 
which occur at least eight times per year.
The principal tools utilised for the management of cash and liquidity are:
 • 15-month risk-analysed cash flow forecast
 • Schedule of all debt facilities and amounts drawn against them
 • Summary of net debt, including derivative instruments
 • Summary of current cash deposits including liquidity thereof
 • Formal commentary on the above by the Finance Director prepared for 
each Board meeting.
Short-term liquidity requirements are fairly predictable and are managed out 
of existing cash resources. Cash requirements are monitored on a weekly and 
monthly basis. Cash buffers are retained to ease cash flow management.
Medium-term liquidity is provided through a mix of the Group’s equity 
and its debt facilities. The Group has strong long-term relationships with a 
diversified range of major lenders and as such has not been restricted in its 
ability to raise new debt for investment, trading or development projects.
Longer-term liquidity and the Group’s capital structure are reviewed on 
a regular basis by the Directors, taking account of relevant factors including 
the real estate cycle, changes in the nature and liquidity of the Group’s 
asset portfolio, forthcoming risks and opportunities and the markets for 
debt and equity finance. This is formally considered at least twice a year  
by the Group’s Risk Committee, which reports to the Board, as a part of  
the annual strategy review and also as appropriate at each Board meeting.
As at 28th February 2014, restricted cash balances were £27.3 million 
(28th February 2013: £1 1.5 million). The increase is as a result of 
investment property disposals. Since the year end £9.7 million collateral  
has been released following the renegotiation of the €47.0 million loan 
notes and £7.8 million on substitution of an asset into a charged facility.
Cash management
Group cash resources are managed in accordance with our policy, which 
prioritises security, liquidity and counterparty risk ahead of absolute returns, 
with limits set by the Board in respect of minimum credit ratings for and 
maximum exposures to individual counterparties.
Cash may be invested across a range of instruments including instant 
access and term deposits, money market funds and commercial paper.  
As at 28th February 2014, the Group had £67.3 million of cash held with 
ten different counterparties.
Current bank facilities and borrowings
The Group’s bank facilities are set out in the following table. As at 28th 
February 2014, the Group had borrowings of £221.1 million (28th February 
2013: £206.0 million). Cash balances were £67.3 million (28th February 
2013: £59.2 million), including amounts of £27.3 million held as restricted 
deposits, giving net debt of £153.8 million and gearing of 48.0 per cent 
(28th February 2013: £146.8 million and gearing of 47.9 per cent).
The Group’s share of net debt in joint ventures was £28.1 million (28th 
February 2013: £49.3 million); if this is aggregated with Group balances 
then net debt rises to £181.9 million and gearing to 56.8 per cent (28th 
February 2013: £196.1 million and 63.9 per cent).
During the year, the Group, together with its joint ventures, has drawn 
new borrowings of £50.0 million. Included within this have been new 
facilities as follows:
 • £8.0 million purchase and redevelopment of Romford
 • £10.5 million acquisition of North London office portfolio
 • £16.2 million acquisition of Shepherd’s Bush Market
 • £14.0 million refinancing of Wick Lane Wharf
The Group has also repaid £78.2 million of borrowings as individual assets 
have been disposed of, including:
 • £43.5 million disposal of Phones 4u Arena in Manchester
 • £31.6 million disposal of Chrome portfolio assets 44 Development Securities PLC

1  Interest cover ratios are specific to the loan and the relevant property. Minimum net worth refers to the net asset value of the Group per its latest Balance Sheet (28th February or 31st August).
2  These unsecured, variable rate loan notes are denominated in Euros, with a nominal value of €47 million. The Group has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap, such that interest rates 
are fixed and the Group will repay a fixed Sterling amount. The minimum net worth covenant applies to the hedge rather than the loan notes. The hedge was cancelled in March 2014 when the loan 
notes were refinanced.
3  Loans relating to Joint Ventures represent the total loan facility and not the Group’s share.
4  This facility has since been refinanced. The new facility is £6.9 million and is repayable on 30th March 2015.
5  This facility has now expired and has not been extended.
6  This facility has been repaid since 28th February 2014.
~ Represents the amount of the Group’s liability in Sterling taking account of the hedging instrument. This facility has since been refinanced.  45 Annual Report 2014
Gross committed facilities as at 30th April 2014 total £193.2 million with  
a weighted average term of 6.4 years, the earliest maturity arises in June 
2014. Unutilised facilities are £2.1 million.
Since 28th February 2014, the Group has successfully renegotiated 
the terms of its €47 million Loan Notes. The duration of the notes has been 
reduced, margins and hedging have been renegotiated and collateral has 
been released.
The Directors keep bank covenants (typically loan to value and interest 
cover ratios) under review, and are content with the current position. The 
aim is to agree loan to value covenants at comfortably tolerable levels with 
sufficient headroom for foreseeable changes in either the general market 
or specific assets. We also incorporate cure mechanisms into facility 
agreements such that we have an appropriate opportunity to restore 
covenant compliance by making cash deposits or repayment as required.
Interest rate risk and hedging
As at 28th February 2014, the summary of the Group’s interest rate 
exposure was as follows:
Excluding share of 
joint ventures
%
Including share of 
joint ventures
%
Fixed rate 43.5 41.1
Floating rate, swapped into fixed 39.7 35.9
Floating rate with cap 2.5 6.5
Floating rate 14.3 16.5
The weighted average interest rate payable was 5.8 per cent, 5.7 per cent 
including joint ventures (28th February 2013: 5.9 per cent and 5.5 per cent 
respectively).
Facilities with variable rates of interest, in particular longer-term 
facilities, expose the Group to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. This risk 
is constantly reviewed by the Directors who regularly consider the 
possibility and likely cost of extending interest rate hedging.
Currently a mix of fixed and variable rates is maintained in order to 
provide a degree of certainty, whilst at the same time benefiting from 
historically low absolute levels of rates. Longer-term facilities tend to be 
structured with fixed rates.
A key element in all hedging arrangements is counterparty risk, i.e. the 
potential failure of the counterparty to the transaction. The Group mitigates 
this risk by only transacting with major banks and institutions. There is 
currently no indication that any of the Group’s hedge counterparties may  
be unable to settle its obligations.
Interest rate derivatives are marked to market in the Balance Sheet, 
giving rise to the risk of fair value movements in the instrument and a 
consequent impact on net asset value. At 28th February 2014, the Group 
held a cross-currency interest rate swap, which was designated as a cash 
flow hedge. Movements in the foreign currency leg of this swap provided a 
hedge against movements in the retranslation of the €47 million loan notes. 
Movements in the interest rate leg have been taken to reserves. The effects 
of these fair value adjustments in the year ended 28th February 2014 are 
set out in note 18. In March 2014, the terms of the €47 million loan notes 
have been substantially renegotiated and as a consequence the cross–
currency interest rate swap has been terminated and alternative hedging 
arrangements put in place.
Development and trading portfolio
The principal financial instrument risks in these assets are the credit risk  
of transaction counterparties. Given the nature of these assets the amounts 
owed to the Group can be significant. These arrangements are monitored 
very closely both before contracts are exchanged as part of our due 
diligence procedures and throughout the execution period.
As at 28th February 2014 the Group had no material, unsecured 
debtors in respect of the sales of development and trading assets.
In respect of certain transactions, the Group contracts to provide 
funding for the development of either individual phases or whole schemes. 
The Directors are satisfied that the combination of the Group’s risk averse 
approach to development funding, its rigorous selection of development 
partners and its focused and active management of each project provide 
appropriate comfort over the risks of these financial exposures.
Investment portfolio
The principal financial instrument risk in the investment portfolio is the 
credit risk implicit in potential tenant failure which, in light of economic 
conditions, is heightened in all sectors, and most notably amongst retail 
tenants. The Group maintains the portfolio under continual review. The 
portfolio is managed by local agents, with active involvement by the Group’s 
investment team. The Board receives at each of its meetings, analyses of 
tenant profile (including the concentration of credit risk, both by sector and 
by entity), existing and anticipated voids, overdue rents, and future and 
outstanding rent reviews, as well as a formal commentary by the investment 
team. The current profile of the portfolio and comments on performance in 
the year are set out in the Operating Review on pages 30 to 41.
Projects in partnership
The Group conducts a number of projects in partnership with others, where 
the Group brings both development expertise and funding. These interests 
are carried in a number of balance sheet categories, and are summarised  
in note 27 to the Group financial statements.
The financial instrument risks in respect of projects in partnership  
are the credit risk implicit in the financial strength and integrity of the 
operating partner, the contractual risk in the partnership arrangements  
and the operating success of the venture. The Group manages these risks 
by securing appropriate rights in each case over the use of the Group’s 
invested capital and by active participation in the joint strategic and 
operating control of the ventures.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are described in note 24 to the Group financial 
statements. The Directors ensure that these risks are appropriately 
documented and monitored, and that the risk of actual liabilities arising  
is restricted so far as is possible. 46 Development Securities PLC 
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s operations are conducted predominantly in the UK. The 
Group’s principal exposure to foreign currency movements is in the €47 
million Euro-denominated loan notes and the corresponding €6.9 million 
security deposit. The loan notes are fully hedged to provide an effective 
Sterling liability. In March 2014, the Group renegotiated the €47.0 million 
loan notes and terminated the cross-currency interest rate swap.  
Alternative hedging arrangements have since been put in place.
The details of the Group’s sensitivity to exchange rate movements  
are set out in note 18(d) to the Group financial statements.
Outside of the UK, the Group has now commenced business in  
Dublin and as such is exposed to foreign currency risk on its 
Euro-denominated property investments. At 28th February 2014, the  
Group had Euro-denominated investments of £3.2 million. The Directors 
actively monitor the overall Group exposure to Euro-denominated assets 
and liabilities and the associated currency risk.
Maximum credit risk exposure
The Directors consider that the maximum credit risk exposure in each class of 
financial asset is represented by the carrying value as at 28th February 2014.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out on pages 8 and 
1 1, in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6 and 7 and in the 
Operating Review on pages 30 to 41. The financial position of the Group,  
its cash flows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities and financial instrument 
risks are described in the Financial Review on pages 42 to 48, which also 
covers the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk. Note 18 to the financial statements gives further information 
about the Group’s financial instruments and hedging activities.
The Group has considerable financial resources. The Directors 
maintain a risk-averse capital structure, with gearing typically in the range 
of 50-60 per cent and long average debt maturities, with borrowings spread 
across a number of lenders. The Group continues to enjoy access to bank 
finance, as demonstrated by loans arranged during the year. Banking 
covenants are regularly monitored and appropriate cure mechanisms  
are incorporated in facility documents.
The Directors are alert to potential liquidity risk in the Group’s cash 
flow forecasts. The Directors keep both short- and medium-term cash  
flows under continual review, and moderate outflows according to the level 
of this uncertainty. The model preserves a cash liquidity buffer at all times, 
to protect against delays in asset realisations.
The Group’s rental income is also subject to risk of delay or 
non-payment. This risk is mitigated by proactive asset management, which 
includes close monitoring of tenant resilience, and a strong focus on actual 
and potential voids.
As a consequence of the above, the Directors believe that the Group is 
well-placed to manage its business risks successfully. In addition, by closely 
monitoring the Group’s forecasts and projections, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Result for the year and movement in net asset value
Total comprehensive income for the year ended 28th February 2014 was  
a profit of £19.5 million (28th February 2013: £2.2 million). After dividend 
payments of £5.9 million, net asset value increased by £13.6 million to 
£320.3 million (28th February 2013: £306.7 million), representing an 
increase of eleven pence per share to 262 pence per share (28th February 
2013: 251 pence per share).
The movement in net asset value may be analysed as follows, excluding 
revaluation movements, profit before interest and taxation for the year 
ended 28th February 2014 was £25.7 million (year ended 28th February 
2013: £23.8 million. Net interest costs (excluding interest rate swap 
movements) for the year were £1 1.9 million (year ended 28th February 
2013: £9.3 million) aggregating to a realised profit for the year of 
£13.8 million contrasting with the realised profit for the year to 28th 
February 2013 of £14.5 million.
Investment property valuation gains for the year, including our share  
of joint ventures, totalled £4.8 million (year ended 28th February 2013: 
£12.8 million write down). This has been a reflection of the gradual 
improvement in secondary yields as detailed below and discussed in more 
detail in the Operating Review on pages 30 to 41.
Net rental income
Gross rental income from the investment portfolio for the year ended 28th 
February 2014 was £15.0 million. After direct costs of £2.6 million, the net 
rental income for the year was £12.4 million, which is a 2.5 per cent increase 
when compared to the £12.1 million for the previous year on a like for like 
basis.
The Group also earned net rental income of £2.8 million from the 
development and trading portfolio, an increase from the £1.7 million earned 
in the year ended 28th February 2013.
Development and trading profits
During the year under review, across its direct and joint venture holdings, 
the Group made development and trading profits of £27.0 million (28th 
February 2013: £28.1 million) including the £2.9 million performance fee 
from the successful realisation of the Phones 4u Arena, which is shown 
within our investment segment.

Operating costs
Operating costs of £14.0 million for the year were seven per cent ahead  
of the equivalent figure of £13.0 million for the previous year.
Net finance costs
Finance costs for the year were £13.5 million, slightly higher compared  
to the £12.2 million for the previous year. This reflects a lower amount of 
interest being capitalised during the last year on development and  
trading properties.
Investment portfolio
During the course of the year, the investment property portfolio has 
decreased to £202.1 million from £220.1 million at 28th February 2013, 
mainly due to asset disposals.
At 28th February 2014, the valuation of the investment property 
portfolio increased by £4.8 million (28th February 2013: write down of 
£12.8 million), including our investment properties held under joint venture.
Further details of acquisitions, disposals and valuation movements are 
set out in note 10 to the financial statements, and further analyses of the 
performance and management of the portfolio are given in the Operating 
Review on pages 38 to 41.
Inventory – development and trading properties
After allowing for continued investment in and development of the portfolio 
of £69.3 million, the portfolio stood at £192.5 million at 28th February 2014 
(28th February 2013: £153.4 million). Further details are contained within 
the Operating Review on pages 14 to 41.
Associates and joint ventures
Reflecting our strategy of working with partners and other equity sources, 
investments in associates and joint ventures has continued during the year. 
The Group’s interests in projects in partnerships are structured in a number 
of different accounting categorisations. Note 27 to the financial statements 
summarises the position.
The current carrying values of associates and joint ventures are 
analysed in note 14. Notable additions to our joint venture portfolio are the 
acquisition of a 50 per cent share in the Shepherd’s Bush Market 
regeneration project and Harwell Oxford.
Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are analysed in note 18 to the 
Group’s financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s Euro-denominated loan notes and the related cross-currency 
hedge are carried as separate instruments in the Balance Sheet. During the 
year, Sterling strengthened against the Euro, decreasing the Sterling liability 
of the loan by £1.7 million to £38.7 million. 
Other financial assets
Other financial assets include loans to a number of joint operations and 
associate companies which reflects the way in which the Group invests  
in these activities.
The largest loan is to Northpoint Developments Limited (formerly CTP 
Securities Limited) which, together with accrued interest at 28th February 
2014, totals £17.0 million (28th February 2013: £15.9 million). A further  
£1.1 million was funded in respect of Morden Wharf, Greenwich, our joint 
operation with Cathedral Group.
Cash and borrowings
Details of the Group’s borrowings and cash management are set out in  
note 18(b) and (d) to the financial statements and in the Financial Review  
on pages 43 to 45.

Subordinated Loan Note facility, stated in Sterling at the current value of 
£38.7 million (28th February 2013: £40.5 million) and ignoring the hedging 
instrument. If these long-term loan notes are removed from borrowings, 
gearing falls to 39.2 per cent. This is calculated by deducting from net  
debt the current retranslated value of £38.7 million (28th February 2013: 
£40.5 million) and adding back relevant restricted cash balances of 
£9.7 million (28th February 2013: £10.0 million) and transaction costs  
of £0.9 million (28th February 2013: £0.9 million).
Loan to value gearing
Net debt expressed as a proportion of total property assets (including 
shares of properties and net debt in all projects in partnerships) was 
44.7 per cent (28th February 2013: 38.0 per cent). 48 Development Securities PLC 
Taxation
The net current tax charge in the Statement of Comprehensive Income  
was £1.1 million, principally in respect of tax on trading profits in excess  
of group relief. The Group has significant potential deferred tax asset 
balances and the Directors previously restricted recognition to the amount 
of corresponding deferred tax liabilities, as uncertain market conditions did 
not offer sufficient probability of profits in the foreseeable future. This year, 
however, the Group has recognised an additional deferred tax charge of 
£0.2 million on certain profits projected in future accounting periods which 
can be forecast with a high enough degree of certainty. The Group’s 
deferred tax treatment falls within the criteria of IAS 12.
In conjunction with our overall business strategy, the Group pursues a 
tax strategy that is principled, transparent and sustainable in the long-term. 
The Group has established ethics regarding its tax policy which have been 
ratified by the Board; these include the following key points:
 • A commitment to ensure full compliance with all statutory obligations 
including full disclosure to all relevant tax authorities
 • Any tax planning strategy entered into is done after full consideration of 
the risks and those findings are recorded in any relevant structuring 
document
 • The maintenance of good relationships with tax authorities and the 
interaction between tax planning and the Group’s wider corporate 
reputation
 • Management of tax affairs in a manner that seeks to maximise 
shareholder value whilst operating within the parameters of existing  
tax legislation.
The Group has certain operations in jurisdictions that have been dictated to 
us by our majority joint venture partners and under most circumstances the 
Group does not enjoy any fiscal advantage of being in these jurisdictions. 
The Group has also recently undertaken a Transfer Pricing review to ensure 
that all cross-border services provided are conducted at the appropriate 
arm’s length market rate.
The suitability of our tax strategy is kept under constant review  
to ensure compliance with the fiscal needs of the Group and constant 
evolution of tax legislation.
Dividends
The Board will recommend to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 16th July 2014 a final dividend of 3.2 pence per share (28th February 
2013: 2.4 pence per share) to be paid on 22nd August 2014 to 
shareholders on the register on 25th July 2014. This final dividend, 
amounting to £3.9 million, has not been included as a liability at 28th 
February 2014, in accordance with IFRS. The total dividend for the year  
will be 5.6 pence per share (28th February 2013: 4.8 pence per share).
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year represented earnings of 
14.9 pence (28th February 2013: 2.0 pence). After removing the unrealised 
revaluation of the investment portfolio, the gain on the disposal of trading 
properties and impairment of development and trading properties, the 
EPRA adjusted earnings per share was 7.8 pence (28th February 2013: 
10.5 pence).

Corporate and Social Responsibility
Our approach
— 
We recognise the significant impact  
that our large-scale property developments 
can have on a diverse range of groups. 
Our stakeholders include our employees, shareholders and co-investors 
and also our suppliers, our tenants and their employees, their customers 
and the communities surrounding our properties. 
Our approach
We work constructively within the strong framework of regulation which 
exists to balance the interests of all these groups. However, there are many 
situations in which exceeding minimum standards creates economic, social 
and environmental benefits, contributing to the sustainable success of our 
Company, and the enhancement of its reputation.
We continue to work to the same high standards that we have reached 
to date, and we will continue to prioritise those activities with which we 
believe we can make a positive impact for our stakeholders.
Our business strategy continues to evolve and with it the diversity of 
our portfolio. Each segment of our portfolio presents different challenges, 
and provides specific opportunities. We set out, below, our priorities in each 
segment.
Our governance system
At the start of each financial year the Executive Directors set objectives 
considering the material issues relating to each of our stakeholder groups, 
including our corporate social and environmental responsibilities.
Our Head of Delivery, Duncan Trench, sits on both the Investment 
Board and Project Board and is responsible for co-ordinating CSR activity 
and reporting consolidated performance information to the Executive 
Directors. Consolidated health and safety data is reported regularly to the 
Board of Directors. 
Our overall objectives
In all our activities we strive to:
 • Achieve and maintain good practice in all aspects of sustainable  
and responsible development. 
 • Improve the measurement of what we do and see continuous 
improvement in our performance.
Respect for people:
 • Maintain a collegiate atmosphere and safe working environment for  
our employees and encourage and facilitate employee development. 
 • Engage our major suppliers in our sustainable development programmes, 
share our objectives with them and ensure compliance with health and 
safety best practice on all of our sites.
 • Create diverse and balanced developments that reflect the 
socio-economic diversity of the local communities and contribute  
to their enrichment through support for youth programmes, skills 
development, arts projects and environmental projects.
Details of the Group’s policy on gender diversity can be found in the 
Directors’ Report on page 57.
Respect for the environment:
 • Minimise energy and water consumption through considered design, 
construction site best practice and clear advice to occupants.
 • Minimise waste from all our operations, measuring output and setting 
targets early in the construction process.
 • Appoint suitably qualified consultants to advise on all aspects of 
environmental protection and options for sustainable development.
Details of the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions are included in the 
Directors’ Report on page 58.
Respect for our industry:
 • Contribute to the better working of our industry by participating in  
debate and publishing research.
 
Report on progress and highlights of 2013/14
Our people
Our corporate operations employed an average of 79 people during  
the year ended 28th February 2014, in a single office in Central London, 
and also within our subsidiary companies including Henry Davidson 
Developments and Executive Communication Centre. 
We actively encourage and support our employees with personal and 
career development. This year we have financially supported six employees 
in their continued professional development and four employees in their 
study of accountancy, corporate governance and real estate. One employee 
achieved their RICS qualification and one gained their MSc degree in Real 
Estate, both funded by the Group.
Performance highlights – year ended 28th February 2014
 • Excellent assessment of cradle-to-grave carbon emissions at 
10 Hammersmith Grove
 • Published the second influential report on the London property market, 
with Fathom Consulting
 • Driven the value and consistency of CDM reporting and analysis
 • Recognised for excellent performance under the Considerate  
Contractors scheme
 • Sponsored Rational House, exploring solutions to London’s  
housing scarcity
 • Successful post-completion review at 10 Hammersmith Grove,  
with local stakeholders
 • Energy Performance Certificates in place for all our investment  
properties and targets set 50 Development Securities PLC 
Supporting charities
We are active supporters of charitable activity, and not just with money. 
Three of our Executive Directors act as trustees of charities and we have 
committed internal resource to assist with their initiatives.
We contribute to a wide range of charities and social enterprises.  
We particularly focus on those serving the needs of the communities  
in which we work. We continue to support the Ascension Eagles and  
St Andrew’s Boys Club, our two main chosen charities, believing  
they benefit from our long-term commitment. 
During the year we also directly supported five local and national 
charities, and several more through sponsorship of our employees’ efforts  
in events such as the Marathon des Sable and the Cathedral to Coast  
cycle challenge. 
Further financial support has been given to the Canal and River Trust 
and Hammersmith’s Lyric Theatre. We also supported a number of  
fund-raising activities associated with our developments at Hammersmith, 
Hale Barns and Shepherd’s Bush.
Construction health and safety
We monitor all our projects for Construction and Design Management 
(CDM) regulation compliance, and consistent reporting is the basis of  
useful trend analysis. 
We contract independent CDM consultants for monitoring and 
management on all our sites. Our briefing documents are standardised  
and where we are the principal financial partners for project construction, 
our JV partners are encouraged to use the same procedures reporting  
to us on a regular basis.
All reportable incidents are reported to the Board of Directors.  
In the year ended 28th February 2014 there was one reportable incident.  
A worker was scalded while repairing an air conditioning unit. He was  
not using the protective clothing provided to him. The matter was  
reported to the HSE and, after reviewing maintenance procedures,  
no further action was required.
Public consideration
All our contractors report on compliance with environmental legislation and 
all new developments will be registered with the Considerate Contractors 
scheme where available to do so.
We are in a phase in which we are involved in a wide range of planning 
applications. Wherever possible we go beyond the legislative requirements 
in our public consultations. During the year we carried out engaging public 
consultations at Shepherd’s Bush, South Woodham Ferrers, 399 Edgware 
Road, Abbey Wood and Hale Barns.
We continue to be active as a founder member of ‘Proud to be Slough’, 
a campaign aiming to improve perceptions of Slough to the benefit of  
the community.
Supporting our industry
We believe the property development industry must maintain the highest 
standards of professionalism and transparency. We contribute actively to 
industry-wide debate and learning, hosting and participating in many 
debates and workshops.
In July 2013, we published a research report ‘Prime Central London –  
One year on, and even higher’. This was the second report based on our 
influential research into that property market in collaboration with  
Fathom Consulting. 
We also further sponsored the research work of Rational House 
exploring property solutions in London and have chaired debates at 
conferences including the British Council of Office (BCO) in Manchester 
and events at MIPIM and to support the West London Business forum.
We have supported the BCO’s research into the Telecom, Media and 
Technology (TMT) sectors and future office space and aim to continue to 
publish research for the benefit of our industry as a whole.
Protecting the environment
Our principal impacts on the wider environment are in the form of CO
2
 
emissions from construction and use of our properties, and the 
management of waste from construction. All our contractors are required  
to report on compliance with environmental legislation.
We continue to work with architects and contractors to realise best 
practice in design and construction. We are committed to delivering the 
most energy efficient and sustainable buildings possible within the 
constraints established by the brief. 
Major developments
We manage the design and construction of these projects from planning 
application to delivery. At the outset, and throughout the life of each  
project, we consider the issues of sustainability, from carbon footprint  
to sustainable transport and community socio-economic development.  
By doing these things well we will continue to create premium products  
for responsible owners.
When planning and bidding for development and investment 
opportunities, the briefing material we give to our consultants outlines  
our CSR policies and detailed aspirations. Through early consideration  
in the design process, safety, sustainability, environmental and social 
considerations become embedded in the project.
Progress at 10 Hammersmith Grove, and 399 Edgware Road  
confirms our ambition to deliver BREEAM ‘Excellent’ schemes while  
also minimising construction waste and CO
2
 emissions from the design  
and construction process.
Report on progress and  
highlights for the year ended  
28th February 2014  51 Annual Report 2014
During the year, we commissioned a comprehensive lifecycle study of the 
carbon footprint of 10 Hammersmith Grove over a 60-year lifecycle; from 
raw materials to end of life recycling. The principle aim was to quantify the 
total carbon achieved relative to the RICS embodied carbon benchmark  
for office buildings, and also relative to an equivalent recent Development 
Securities building at 2 Kingdom Street, PaddingtonCentral, completed 
in 2012.
The conclusion of this study was that the design and construction  
of 10 Hammersmith Grove had resulted in six per cent less embedded 
carbon than the RICS benchmark and 18 per cent less operational carbon. 
This significant reduction in operational carbon results principally from the 
design of the building and its triple glazing, which allows maximum use of 
natural light.
A reduction in total carbon footprint of six per cent was also found 
versus 2 Kingdom Street, indicating that our design and construction 
methods continue to develop in the right direction. Here, for example,  
it was found that we had achieved a 36 per cent reduction in emissions 
from onsite activities during construction due to the use of prefabricated 
components, and the fact that 99 per cent of the waste generated on  
site was diverted from landfill.
This study gives us valuable insights into how we can further improve 
the efficiency of future buildings. The key points we intend to pursue in 
future design processes are to:
 • Explore options for further lifecycle carbon reduction through the 
recycling of glass, steel and concrete, the principal construction  
materials, particularly in the design and construction of structural frames
 • Carry out similar analysis on our future projects, aiming at continuously 
developing our knowledge and understanding
 • Further explore the use of prefabrication to reduce on site emissions
 • Brief designers to use standard dimensions where possible to reduce  
the bespoke elements of construction
 • Continue to focus on water and waste efficiency through design 
throughout construction phase
 • Ensure that ‘sustainable and renewable’ factors are thoroughly explored 
throughout the design process, and that cost/benefit analyses are 
rigorously performed
 • Continue to hold post-completion reviews with local stakeholders at all 
our major developments to obtain feedback within a year of completion. 
In these ways we will continue to provide best advice and use best  
practice within the constraints of every client-centred design brief.
Investment portfolio
During 2012, we completed a comprehensive survey of key properties in  
our investment portfolio. Since then our focus has been on developing  
and communicating policies for the long-term sustainability of our estate,  
raising awareness among our site management and tenants, monitoring 
energy use and reducing and recycling waste.
We have appointed a single lead managing agent for all our principal 
sites, enabling us to introduce estate-wide minimum standards and 
definitions of best practice as well as to consistently communicate our  
CSR policy to site managers and tenants.
We have made progress in the year on energy use in our properties. 
Every property now has an Energy Performance Certificate. In terms of 
reducing energy use, the focus has initially been on landlord common areas. 
Many of our sites have specific actions planned to reduce energy 
consumption, with several sites having already installed new, low-energy 
lighting systems. Energy contracts have been centralised and all the energy 
we are responsible for comes from renewable sources. As refurbishment 
and development work is undertaken, reducing energy consumption will be 
a significant consideration with, for example, planned insulation upgrades. 
A single waste contractor is now used throughout our portfolio, 
allowing us to standardise and improve the quality of recycling as well  
as monitoring and reporting.
For each site in our first survey, we have a detailed set of actions 
covering energy, waste, water and transport as well as tenant and public 
engagement. We expect to see many more initiatives completed in the  
near future.
The survey has given us very valuable insights into the management of 
those investment properties it covered and, as a result, we aim to complete 
a similar survey of all our remaining sites in the next twelve months. 
Development and trading portfolio
A significant number of these properties are owned and developed in 
conjunction with third party partners. Our focus is therefore to ensure that 
all our JV partners are aware of our CSR policies and commitment to 
responsible development.
This not only helps the spread of good practice across our  
industry but it also provides an important aspect of risk management  
for our Company.
We encourage our partners to align their reporting to ours.  
We routinely request that our partners appoint our preferred CDM 
consultants and that their CDM reporting is aligned with ours. In this  
way we will be able to readily consolidate key information, and analyse 
trends, regarding CDM compliance and environmental issues. 
 Some of our partners are advanced in aspects of CSR and we 
continue to learn from them to improve our own performance. 52 Development Securities PLC

dividend payment of 5.6 pence per Ordinary share for the financial year, 
increased from the previous year.
Group structure
Details of the Group’s principal subsidiary undertakings are disclosed  
on page 1 10.
Share capital
The Company’s issued share capital at 28th February 2014 consisted of 
122,229,107 Ordinary shares of 50 pence each and 123,397 shares held in 
treasury which do not have a dividend or voting entitlement. On 21st March 
2014, the Company transferred 4,605 shares from treasury in connection 
with the exercise of options under the Company’s Save As You Earn 
Scheme. Following this transfer of shares out of treasury, the Company 
holds a total of 1 18,792 of its Ordinary shares in treasury. The total  
number of Ordinary shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury) is 
122,233,712. The Company’s share capital represents a single class of 
shares, with all shares ranking equally and fully paid. Details of the share 
capital are set out in note 20 on pages 125 and 126.
The rights and obligations attaching to the shares are specified in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, or alternatively may be governed by 
statute. There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company 
other than those specified by law or regulation. There are no restrictions on 
voting rights other than as specified by the Articles of Association.
Three resolutions relating to share capital will be proposed as Special 
Business at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The full text of the 
resolutions can be found in the enclosed Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Change of control
The Company has entered into significant agreements with its commercial 
partners, which contain change of control clauses and which may give rise 
to termination or renegotiation in that event. If enforced, the Company may 
be deprived of potential future earning capacity from such schemes.  
The Company is party to a number of committed bank facilities, which,  
upon a change of control, are terminable at the banks’ discretion. In addition, 
under such circumstances, the Company’s share option schemes would 
normally vest or become exercisable subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions.
Corporate Governance
The Company’s statement on corporate governance can be found in  
the Corporate Governance Report on pages 59 to 65 of the financial 
statements. The Corporate Governance Report forms part of this Report 
and is incorporated into it by cross-reference.
Share option schemes
There were no grants under the Save As You Earn Option Plan 2005. 
Further details of the share option schemes are contained on pages 125  
to 126 and in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83. 54 Development Securities PLC

As required by the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors will be 
retiring at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, will offer 
themselves for re-election. The Directors are voluntarily offering themselves 
for re-election as a matter of best practice in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Following the performance evaluation of the 
Board, all Directors were judged to have made a significant contribution to 
the Board’s deliberations, reflecting their commitment to the role. The rules 
that the Company has governing the appointment and replacement of 
Directors are contained in its Articles of Association.
Conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006, a Director must avoid a situation where he 
or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Directors are required to 
submit any potential or actual conflicts of interest they may have with the 
Company to the Board for approval. No conflicts of this sort have arisen 
during the year under review. 
Directors’ service contracts and interests in the Company’s shares
The details of Directors’ service contracts and the interests in the shares of 
the Company of the Directors who were in office as at 28th February 2014 
are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83.
None of the Directors had any material interest in any contract that was 
significant in relation to the Group’s business at any time during the year, 
other than a service contract, and as disclosed in the Remuneration Report.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
Article 153 of the Company’s Articles of Association provides, among other 
things, that, insofar as permitted by law, every Director shall be indemnified 
by the Company against all costs, charges, expenses, losses or liabilities 
incurred in the execution and discharge of the Directors’ duties, power or 
office. The Company maintains, at its expense, a Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance policy at an adequate level which is reviewed annually. 
This insurance policy does not provide cover where a Director or Officer is 
proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
This third party indemnity insurance was in force during the financial year 
and also at the date of approval of the financial statements.
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution of  
the shareholders.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 16th July 2014 at 12.00 noon 
on the 14th Floor, Portland House, Bressenden Place, London SW1E 5DS.
At the Annual General Meeting, the following resolutions will be proposed:
Ordinary Resolution 1 – Report and Accounts
The Directors will present the financial statements and Reports of the 
Directors and Auditors for the financial year ended 28th February 2014.
Ordinary Resolutions 2 and 3 – To approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report
In accordance with the new directors’ remuneration reporting regime as set 
out in Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), the Company’s 
2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report comprises the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement, the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (the Annual Remuneration Report) and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (the Policy).
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Annual Remuneration 
Report. This is set out on pages 76 to 83 of the Directors’ Report and 
financial statements and sets out details on how our Directors were paid in 
the financial year ended 28th February 2014 and how their pay will be 
structured in the financial year ended 28th February 2015. The Annual 
Remuneration Report will be prepared on an annual basis and is subject to 
an advisory shareholder vote.
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval for the Policy as set out on pages 
67 to 75, this is a binding vote.  The Policy, if approved, will take effect from 
1st March 2015 and will apply until replaced by a new or amended Policy.  
The Policy will be subject to a shareholder vote at least once every three 
years. Once the Policy is effective, the Company will not be able to make 
remuneration or loss of office payments to a current or past Director, unless 
the payment is consistent with the approved Policy or has been otherwise 
approved by shareholders.  55 Annual Report 2014
Ordinary Resolutions 4 to 10 – Re-election of Directors
The Directors seek to maintain the highest standards of corporate 
governance and, in accordance with the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all of the Directors will voluntarily retire  
and those wishing to serve again shall submit themselves for re-election  
by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman is 
satisfied that, following individual formal performance evaluations, the 
performance of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be 
effective and demonstrates commitment to the role. The Nomination 
Committee has considered each of the Non-executive Directors seeking 
re-election and concluded that their collective background, skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company enables the 
Board and Committees to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. The workings of the Board and Committees  
are more particularly detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 59 to 65. Biographical details of all the Directors appear on page 52 
of the Directors’ Report and financial statements. 
Ordinary Resolution 11 – Declaration of a dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after the shareholders at a general 
meeting have approved it. A final dividend of 3.2 pence per Ordinary share 
is recommended by the Directors for payment to shareholders who are on 
the register at the close of business on 25th July 2014.
Ordinary Resolutions 12 and 13 – Re-appointment and remuneration 
of auditor
Resolutions 12 and 13 propose the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Auditor of the Company and authorise 
the Directors to set their remuneration.
Special Resolution 14 – Authority to purchase own shares
The Company is seeking authority to purchase up to 10.0 per cent of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital at, or between, the minimum and 
maximum prices specified in this Resolution. This power would only be used 
after careful consideration by the Directors, having taken into account 
market conditions prevailing at that time, the investment needs of the 
Company, its opportunity for expansion and its overall financial position. 
The Directors have no present intention of making any market purchases  
of the Company’s shares, but if they believed such action to be in the best 
interests of shareholders and would enhance net assets or earnings per 
share, they would consider exercising their authority. As at 29th April 2014 
(being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of 
Annual General Meeting), the Company has an unexpired authority to 
repurchase 12,222,910 Ordinary shares of which 12,222,910 Ordinary 
shares remain outstanding.
As at 29th April 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication 
of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting), the total number of options  
to subscribe for shares in the capital of the Company was 152,590 
(approximately 0.12 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital and 
approximately 0.14 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital if the  
full authority proposed by Resolution 14 was used).
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company is allowed to hold its own 
shares in treasury following a buyback, instead of cancelling them. Such 
shares may be resold for cash or used for the purpose of employee share 
schemes, but all rights attaching to them, including voting rights and any 
right to receive dividends, are suspended whilst they are held in treasury. 
Accordingly, if the Directors exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 
14, the Company will have the option of holding these shares in treasury, 
rather than cancelling them. The authority sought at the Annual General 
Meeting will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting  
of the Company or on 1st September 2015 (being the latest date by which 
the Company must hold an Annual General Meeting in 2015). The Company 
currently holds 1 18,792 shares in treasury.
Ordinary Resolution 15 – Allotment of shares
The Directors may only allot Ordinary shares or grant rights over Ordinary 
shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. The authority granted to the 
Directors at the Company’s previous Annual General Meeting in 2013 to 
allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any securities into 
shares is due to expire at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General 
Meeting. Accordingly, the Directors will be seeking new authority under 
Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot shares (including treasury 
shares) or grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into 
shares, which will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company or on 1st September 2015 (being the latest date 
by which the Company must hold an Annual General Meeting in 2015).
If passed, paragraph (a) of Resolution 15 would give the Directors authority 
to allot Ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any 
security into, Ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£20,372,285 representing approximately one third (33.33 per cent) of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in treasury) 
and calculated as at 29th April 2014 (being the last practicable date prior  
to publication of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting). In accordance 
with the latest institutional guidelines issued by the Association of British 
Insurers (ABI), paragraph (b) of Resolution 15, if passed, would give the 
Directors authority to allot further shares in connection with a fully 
pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue to shareholders up to a further 
aggregate nominal amount of £20,372,285, representing approximately 
one third (33.33 per cent) of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding shares held in treasury) and calculated as at 29th April 2014 
(being the last practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of the 
Annual General Meeting). As at 29th April 2014 (being the last practicable 
date prior to publication of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting), the 
Company held 1 18,792 shares in treasury which represent approximately 
0.10 per cent of the total ordinary share capital of the Company in issue 
(excluding shares held in treasury). 
The Directors are currently giving consideration to the possible exercise of this 
authority. The Directors consider it desirable to have the maximum flexibility 
permitted by corporate governance guidelines to respond to market developments 
and to enable allotments to take place to finance business opportunities as 
they arise. Accordingly, the Directors intend to renew this authority annually. 56 Development Securities PLC 
Special Resolution 16 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Under Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006, if the Directors wish to 
allot any shares and other relevant securities, grant rights over shares, or 
sell treasury shares for cash (other than in connection with an employee 
share scheme), they must in the first instance offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their holdings. The Directors seek authority to 
renew the disapplication of shareholders’ pre-emptive rights. The purpose 
of paragraph (i) of Resolution 16 is to authorise the Directors to allot any 
shares pursuant to the authority given by paragraph (a) of Resolution 15 for 
cash either (a) in connection with a pre-emptive offer or rights issue or (b) 
otherwise up to an aggregate nominal value of £3,058,812 (being 
equivalent to 5.0 per cent of the total issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 29th April 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting)) and which 
includes the sale on a non pre-emptive basis of any shares held in treasury, 
in each case without the shares first being offered to existing members in 
proportion to their existing holdings.
The purpose of paragraph (ii) of Resolution 16 is to authorise the Directors 
to allot any shares pursuant to the authority given by paragraph (b) of 
Resolution 15 for cash in connection with a rights issue without the shares 
first being offered to existing members in proportion to their existing 
holdings. This is in line with corporate governance guidelines issued by  
the Pre-emption Group. The Board considers the authority sought to be 
appropriate in order to allow the Company flexibility to finance business 
opportunities or to conduct a pre-emptive offer or rights issue without the 
need to comply with the strict requirements of the statutory pre-emption 
provisions. The Board intends to adhere to the provisions in the Pre-emption 
Group’s Statement of Principles not to allot shares on a non pre-emptive 
basis (other than pursuant to a rights issue or pre-emptive offer) in excess 
of an amount equal to 7.5 per cent of the total issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company within a rolling three-year period without prior consultation 
with shareholders.
Special Resolution 17 – Notice period for general meetings
The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 increased  
the notice period for general meetings of a company to 21 clear days  
unless shareholders approve a shorter period, which cannot be less than  
14 clear days.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 28th August 2013, 
shareholders authorised the calling of general meetings, other than an 
annual general meeting, on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. Resolution 
17 seeks the approval of shareholders to renew the authority to be able to 
call general meetings (other than an annual general meeting) on 14 clear 
days’ notice.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for 
general meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the business  
of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as  
a whole. If the proposals at a given meeting are not time sensitive, the 
Company will not normally use the shorter notice period. The approval will 
be effective until the Company’s next annual general meeting, when it is 
expected that a similar resolution will be proposed. It should also be noted 
that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able 
to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company 
must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for  
that meeting.
Ordinary Resolution 18 – Political donations
Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006, amongst other things, prohibits the 
Company and its subsidiaries from making political donations or from 
incurring political expenditure in respect of a political party or other political 
organisation or an independent election candidate unless authorised by the 
Company’s shareholders. Aggregate donations made by the Group of 
£5,000 or less in any twelve-month period will not be caught.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any intention of  
making any political donation or incurring any political expenditure. 
However, the Companies Act 2006 defines ‘political organisation’, ‘political 
party’, ‘political donation’ and ‘political expenditure’ widely. Accordingly, the 
Company wishes to ensure that neither it nor its subsidiaries inadvertently 
commits any breaches of the Companies Act 2006 through the undertaking 
of routine activities, which would not normally be considered to result in the 
making of political donations and political expenditure being incurred.
The Resolution authorises the Company and its subsidiaries to:
 • make political donations to political parties or independent election 
candidates, not exceeding £10,000 in total;
 • make political donations to political organisations, other than political 
parties, not exceeding £10,000 in total; and
 • incur political expenditure, not exceeding £10,000 in total, provided that 
the aggregate amount of any such donations and expenditure shall not 
exceed £10,000 during the period beginning with the date of the passing 
of the Resolution and ending on the date of the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting.
Ordinary Resolution 19 – New Long-Term Incentive Plan
Following a review of the Company’s long-term incentive schemes and 
discussions with shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has decided 
to replace those plans with a new share-based long-term incentive plan  
(the LTIP) which is to be put to shareholders for approval. The key terms  
of the LTIP are set out in the Appendix to the enclosed Notice of Annual 
General Meeting. 
It is intended that the LTIP will replace the cash-based Development Profit 
Plan with effect from 1st March 2015 and no payouts will be made to 
Directors under the latter after 1st March 2018. Subject to shareholder 
approval, it is intended that the first grants will be made under the LTIP after 
1st March 2015. Details of how the LTIP will be operated for Directors are 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in the Annual Report.  57 Annual Report 2014
Ordinary Resolution 20 – Renewal of the SAYE Plan
The Save As You Earn Option Plan 2005 (the SAYE Plan) is an all 
employee share option plan which was approved by shareholders in 2005. 
Since then it has been a successful and popular part of the Company’s 
remuneration arrangements. It expires in 2015 and so shareholder approval 
is being sought to renew it for a further ten years from the date of the 2014 
Annual General Meeting. The key terms of the SAYE Plan are set out in the 
Appendix to the enclosed Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Full details of all the resolutions can be found in the enclosed Notice of 
Annual General Meeting, which is also displayed on the Company’s website 
at www.developmentsecurities.com.
The Directors believe that all the proposals to be considered at the  
Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of both the Company  
and its shareholders. The Directors unanimously recommend that you  
vote in favour of the proposed resolutions as they intend to do in respect  
of their own holdings.

Disclosures in respect of financial risk management objectives and 
exposures are set out in note 18(d) to the financial statements on pages 
121 to 123.
Financial instruments 
Details of the financial instruments used by the Group and the Company  
are set out in note 18 to the accounts on pages 1 16 to 123.

£76,075). The Group supported a number of charities serving the 
community in which the Group operates. These included national and local 
charitable organisations and covered a wide range of causes including 
education, public services, community support schemes and events 
organised on behalf of major charities.
No political donations were made during the year (28th February 2013: 
£9,500).

Post balance sheet events
Details of events which have occurred since 28th February 2014 and  
up to the date of this report are disclosed in note 28 to the financial  
statements on page 130.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
The Company has reported greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with 
the requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report  
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. The Company’s GHG emissions 
are reported based on an operational control boundary for sources of 
emissions falling within the Group’s Consolidated financial statements.  
The reporting period for GHG emissions is 1st March 2013 to 28th 
February 2014, which aligns with the financial reporting year covered  
by the Directors’ Report.
The Company has used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition), and Defra GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2014 for the financial year ending 28th February 
2014 to calculate its GHG emissions.

on the limited information available. A process will be established to enable fugitive emissions 
data to be collated for the financial year ending 28th February 2015.
c   Scope 2 covers emissions from electricity purchased for own use. There were no purchases 
of heat, steam and cooling for own use in the reporting period. 
d   Where gas/electricity consumption data was not available to cover all months of the reporting 
period, an estimation of the emissions has been calculated using an average of gas/electricity 
consumption from the available data of the property concerned. This method of estimation 
was applied to approximately three quarters of the properties within the reporting scope. 
  For Company owned vehicles, an estimation of the emissions has been calculated from an 
average mileage level across the vehicle fleet. This method of estimation was applied to a 
single vehicle within the reporting scope. 
 
An intensity ratio of GHG emissions per square foot of investment property 
managed and property occupied by the Company is reported.

Governance
Corporate Governance
— 
As Chairman, I am responsible for ensuring that the Board operates 
efficiently and effectively and that it continues to uphold the high standard of 
corporate governance that underpins the ethos of the Company. The Board 
is accountable to the shareholders for good governance and is committed 
to discharging its duties in their best interests. The principal corporate 
governance rules which applied to the Company in the year under review 
were the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
The Code contains a number of additional requirements applicable to FTSE 
350 companies. At the date of this Report, the Company is not a member  
of the FTSE 350 indices, however, to further demonstrate its support of  
the principles of good corporate governance and as we act in shareholders’ 
interests it is right that shareholders have the opportunity to vote on the 
re-election of every Director on an annual basis. The Board has therefore 
voluntarily implemented provision B.7.1 of the Code requiring all Directors  
to seek re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.
The Company has built on the 2013 Report with the aim of providing  
clear and transparent information to our stakeholders. The Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 59 to 65 sets out in more detail how the 
Company has applied the main provisions of the Code.

The Board
Development Securities PLC Ordinary shares are listed on the Official List 
of the UK Listing Authority and, as such, the Company is required to state 
whether it has complied with the provisions for corporate governance 
contained within the Code.
The Board confirms that in its view the Company has applied the main 
principles and has complied with all of the provisions set out in the Code 
during the financial year under review with the exception of Code provision 
B.2.1 regarding the composition of the Nomination Committee; further 
details are provided below. The full Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.
The interaction between the Board, its Committees and the management  
of the Company is detailed in the chart above.
Stakeholders
Constructive dialogue has continued to be built up over the year between 
the Company and its stakeholders and has contributed to investor 
confidence. The Company’s governance principles have been, and will 
continue to be, kept under review as the Directors believe that a sound 
corporate governance framework is key to achieving the Company’s 
objectives and discharging its legal and regulatory responsibilities. The 
Company continues to maximise shareholder value creation whilst at the 
same time still appropriately managing risks.
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is a high priority for the Board. The 
Executive Directors have regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, 
where a wide range of issues are discussed within the constraints of  
the information already known to the market. The Company’s annual  
results are also presented to institutional shareholders and analysts.   60 Development Securities PLC 
A copy of the presentation is available on the Company’s website,  
www.developmentsecurities.com.
Copies of key sell-side broker analysts’ notes on the Company are 
circulated to all Directors, as are summaries of non-attributable shareholder 
comment collated by the Company’s joint brokers, financial PR advisors and 
other corporate advisory providers, which assist the Board in developing 
their understanding of the views of major shareholders. Additional feedback 
is regularly sought by financial PR advisors. From time to time the Company 
arranges for key shareholders to visit a number of development sites, 
accompanied by Executive Directors. The Board also ensures that investors 
are provided with regular announcements of the Group’s significant 
transactions to enhance shareholder understanding of the Company’s 
execution of its business strategy.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee held discussions with a 
number of key institutional shareholders in relation to the design of the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan and consulted with a broader range of 
shareholders and their representative bodies on the Company’s draft 
remuneration policy, ahead of the presentation at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting. This is discussed more fully on pages 66 to 83.
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Non-executive Directors 
are available at any time to meet with shareholders. No shareholder sought 
a meeting with the Senior Independent Director during the year. The role of 
Senior Independent Director continues to be performed by S C Bates.
The Company’s Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity to respond 
to shareholders’ appropriate questions, and the information necessary for 
informed participation is made available with as much notice as possible. 
Directors are introduced to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, 
including the identification of Non-executives and Committee Chairs.  
The Company’s website is updated at the same time as the Regulated 
Information Service, to provide additional information dissemination for 
shareholders. Shareholders are also invited to free subscription of the 
Company’s e-mail news alert service on the Company’s website.
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the long term success of the 
Company and in this capacity has put in place a formal schedule of reserved 
matters which require its approval that include, but are not limited to:
 • strategy;
 • executive performance and retention;
 • remuneration and succession;
 • financial performance;
 • the issue of any securities;
 • significant borrowing facilities;
 • development opportunities;
 • dividend policy;
 • authorisation of significant transactions over a certain threshold;
 • investment portfolio acquisitions and disposals;
 • corporate reputation and communication; and
 • internal control and risk management and the Board’s own effectiveness.
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Board takes into account the size and 
complexity of the Group, and internal control measures employed, to 
determine those formal matters reserved to the Board and those delegated 
to its various Committees or the Executive Directors.
The Board met formally 13 times during the year, six of which were 
scheduled meetings. The other seven meetings were called at short notice 
and did not necessarily require full attendance. The Board also met on an 
ad hoc basis as required by the on-going business of the Company.  
Where a Director is unable to participate in a meeting either in person  
or remotely, the Chairman will solicit their views on key items of business 
ahead of time, in order that these can be presented at the meeting and can 
influence the debate. The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors met 
on one occasion during the year with no Executive Directors in attendance.
Board composition
During the financial year under review, the Board consisted of four 
Executive Directors, a Non-executive Chairman and two independent 
Non-executive Directors.
The independence of each Non-executive Director has been assessed 
during the year, in line with the independence criteria contained within 
provision B.1.1 of the Code. The Company considers all the Non-executive 
Directors to be independent. The Chairman was considered independent on 
appointment. The current ratio of Executive and independent Non-executive 
Directors is permissible for a smaller company under Code provision B.1.2. 
S C Bates continued to be the Senior Independent Director for the financial 
year and is available as a point of contact for shareholders where normal 
channels of communication have failed, or are not appropriate. The Senior 
Independent Director acts as a sounding board for the Chairman and serves 
as an intermediary for other Directors where necessary.
The Non-executive Directors provide a valued role by challenging aspects 
of executive decisions to produce a considered and independent outcome 
to Board deliberations, ensuring that no one individual has unfettered 
decision-making powers. There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman, D S Jenkins, who is responsible for the running  
of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness, and the Chief Executive,  
M H Marx, who is responsible for the running of the Company’s business. 
The Chairman and Chief Executive are in regular contact to discuss current 
material matters. The roles and remit of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are set out in writing and agreed by the Board. There were  
no significant changes to the Chairman’s other commitments.
Biographical information for the Directors in office at the date of this  
Report is on page 52.  61 Annual Report 2014
Board effectiveness
As in previous years, the Board has undertaken a formal performance 
evaluation of the Board as a whole and its Committees, to ensure they 
continue to be effective, and that individual Directors demonstrate 
commitment to his or her respective role and has sufficient time to meet  
his or her commitment to the Company. The Board believes that annual 
evaluations are helpful and provide a valuable opportunity for continuous 
improvement. Consideration was given to whether the evaluation should be 
externally facilitated. The Board maintained that the current arrangements 
were appropriate, but will keep this area under review. S C Bates chaired a 
meeting of the Non-executive Directors without the Chairman or Executive 
Directors present, at which, inter alia, the performance of the Chairman was 
reviewed on behalf of the Board. The outcome, which was completely 
satisfactory, was then discussed between the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director. The evaluation was conducted by means of a 
questionnaire, which was co-ordinated and collated by the Company 
Secretary. The evaluation focused on the Board as a whole, its composition 
and working, the Committees and individual Directors. The responses were 
considered by the Chairman (or the Senior Independent Director in relation 
to the Chairman’s performance). Suggestions for improvements were 
discussed by the Board at a meeting on 26th February 2014 and, where 
considered relevant, have been implemented. The review helped identify the 
potential benefit of an additional independent Non-executive Director. 
All Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and 
may seek independent professional advice as necessary, at the Company’s 
expense, and subject to the consent of the Chairman. Upon election, or 
re-election, Non-executives are invited to serve for three-year fixed terms, 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders. All Non-executive Directors 
have confirmed that they have sufficient time to dedicate to their role. Their 
terms of appointment are available from the Company Secretary and details 
of the Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are detailed in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83.
Directors undergo a formal induction process on joining the Company and 
receive appropriate training whilst in office. The Chairman agrees with each 
Director their training and development needs as and when required.
Board Committees
The Board delegates responsibility for certain matters to Standing 
Committees, which report back to the Board. These Committees operate 
within defined terms of reference, as determined by the Board. Details are 
available upon request from the Company Secretary and are also published 
on the Company’s website, www.developmentsecurities.com. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to each of the Committees.

Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the following Directors:
Director
S C Bates Chair
D S Jenkins
N H Thomlinson
Audit Committee composition
The Committee consists of the two independent Non-executive Directors, 
and the Company’s Chairman D S Jenkins, who was considered 
independent on appointment. The Board has determined that D S Jenkins, 
as a qualified accountant with considerable experience, has significant 
‘recent and relevant financial experience’ for the purposes of the Code.  
The Company’s Chief Executive, Finance Director and Financial Controller, 
attend the Audit Committee meetings by invitation. To help the Committee 
review and challenge the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, 
representatives from the external and internal auditors attend appropriate 
parts of the meetings.
The Committee’s principal role as set out in its Terms of Reference includes:
 • monitoring the integrity of the Company’s financial statements;
 • reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls;
 • reviewing the internal control and risk management systems;
 • assessing the performance and independence of the external auditors;
 • selecting the external auditor and making appropriate recommendations 
through the Board to permit shareholder consideration at the Annual 
General Meeting;
 • assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process;
 • acting as a conduit between the Board and the external and internal 
auditors;
 • reporting to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities; and
 • monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function. 62 Development Securities PLC 
The non-audit services policy as adopted by the Committee during the last 
financial year was adhered to throughout the year, providing additional 
control measures around the instruction of the auditors to undertake 
non-audit work. The policy requires that all non-audit fee work be reported 
to the Audit Committee and that all non-audit fee work falling into certain 
categories and above certain thresholds be reported prior to the work being 
undertaken as detailed below:
 • up to £25,000 approval required by the Finance Director, or Chief 
Executive in his absence;
 • in excess of £25,000 and up to £100,000 approval required by the 
Finance Director and Chair of the Audit Committee; and
 • in excess of £100,000 approval required from the full Audit Committee.
In addition, the policy prohibits the auditors from being considered for 
providing the following services: internal audit; bookkeeping services; and 
design and implementation of financial information systems.
An analysis of the non-audit fees can be found in note 4 to the financial 
statements. The Committee scrutinises these payments, but recognises that 
the nature of the business and complexity of deals dictates that shareholders’ 
interests can often be furthered best by the existing knowledge of auditors in 
non-audit work. The total value paid during the year for tax advice and 
planning services amounted to £247,000.
It is within the Committee’s remit to recommend the appointment of the 
external auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Additional scrutiny was 
placed on the independence and objectivity of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP. In accordance with professional and regulatory standards, the lead 
audit partner is rotated at least every five years in order to protect audit 
independence and objectivity. The Audit Committee welcomed Julian 
Jenkins to the role of lead audit partner for the financial year under review. 
The Audit Committee was satisfied as to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s 
independence and effectiveness and, following a review of their tenure, 
quality and fees, accordingly recommended their re-appointment as 
auditors. This was subsequently ratified by the Board and accordingly  
the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors  
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been the independent auditor of 
Development Securities PLC since 2008, which is the last time the  
audit went out to tender.
Internal control
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ 
investments and protect the Company’s assets. The Directors acknowledge 
that they are responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
significant risks the Company is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The operational, financial and compliance risk controls are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has conducted  
a thorough risk assessment of the business, identifying risks, their potential 
impact, likelihood of occurrence, controls and mitigating actions, together with 
Annual activities of the Audit Committee
The Committee met four times during the year. Three of the scheduled 
meetings were organised around the Group’s shareholder reporting 
requirements. A meeting was held to agree the terms of engagement, 
proposed approach and the fees of the annual audit. As is standard each 
year, two of the meetings take place prior to the issue of the preliminary 
full-year and interim results in order to consider any significant issues 
arising from the audit and review processes. The fourth meeting of the  
Audit Committee was convened specifically to deal with internal control 
reporting, prior to the Board’s review, details of which are set out below.
Significant judgements 
Before recommending the half-year and annual financial statements to the 
Board for approval, the Committee reviewed, amongst other things, the 
following matters and significant judgements: 
Direct property investments, the development and trading portfolios and the 
valuation of the investment properties. The Committee challenged 
Executive management at each reporting date in respect of both 
independent external valuations and Directors’ valuations across our entire 
property portfolio. In addition, the Committee actively challenged the 
external auditors in respect of the work they have conducted in connection 
with the internal and external valuations. The Committee was satisfied that 
there were no significant areas of contention and that the valuation 
procedures and methodologies used and the valuations themselves were 
appropriate. In respect of impairment charges recognised, the Committee 
was satisfied that the written down values reflected the assets’ net 
realisable value.
Indirect property investments, accounting for investments in property 
secured loans, accounting for joint ventures and associates and 
recoverability of financial assets. The Committee again challenged 
Executive management as to the valuation and recoverability of these 
assets along with the external auditors as to the work they had conducted. 
As a result, the Committee concluded that the assets were appropriately 
recognised in the Group’s financial statements.
Other reporting matters: Internal controls environment, management 
oversight of indirect property investments and accounting and regulatory 
developments. 
One of the significant requirements of the Code is that the Board confirms 
that the Annual Report presents a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.  
The task of assessing this has been delegated to the Audit Committee. 
With this in mind, the Committee considered management’s analysis and 
were content to confirm and recommend this to the Board. The Board’s 
statement to this effect is set out below in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibility on page 65.
The Committee also met without Executive Directors present and S C 
Bates, as Chair of the Committee, met separately with the auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and internal auditors, HW Fisher & Company.  63 Annual Report 2014
early warning systems and further actions which need to be implemented.
Detailed below is a description of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management used in the process of preparing the Consolidated financial 
statements. The key features of the system of internal control include:
 • a comprehensive system of financial reporting and business planning with 
appropriate sensitivity analysis;
 • a detailed authorisation process which ensures that no material 
commitments are entered into without competent and extensive approval;
 • a defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board and clear defined 
roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive;
 • an organisational structure with clearly defined levels of authority;
 • formal documentation procedures;
 • the close involvement of the Executive Directors in all aspects of the day 
to day operations, including regular meetings with senior management to 
review all operational aspects of the business and risk management systems;
 • a review of the Group strategy and progress on developments at each 
scheduled Board meeting;
 • a comprehensive insurance programme; and 
 • a formal whistleblowing policy; updated and approved during the year 
following a change in legislation.
Internal auditors
HW Fisher & Company was appointed as the Company’s internal auditors  
in 2010. The Committee reviews the internal auditors’ plan for the year and 
makes amendments as required. In this capacity, HW Fisher & Company 
report to the Audit Committee. They attend meetings of the Risk 
Committee, and from these meetings, and discussions with management, 
they identify areas of potential weakness or possible improvement in the 
Group’s financial controls. They propose an agenda of work to the Audit 
Committee, at least annually, and devise and implement appropriate work 
programmes, independently of management.
During the year, internal audits were carried out on a number of business 
processes, including:
 • Subsidiary governance;
 • High level review of the existing bonus schemes;
 • Disaster recovery;
 • Gifts and entertaining; and 
 • Treasury payments and cycles.
These reviews and implementations of the recommendations arising from 
them are overseen by the Audit Committee. 
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control for the year ended 28th February 2014 and to the date of 
this Report, and considers that there is a sound system of internal control 
which accords with the Turnbull Report, Internal Control: Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code. The Board is satisfied that there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
significant risks including financial, operational and compliance controls  
and that it is regularly reviewed.
Going concern 
The Directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position  
of the Group, making reasonable assumptions about future trading 
performance. As part of the review, the Directors considered the Group’s 
cash balances, its debt maturity profile and guarantees and indemnities 
given. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the forseeable future. Accordingly they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
The Company’s going concern statement can be found in the Financial 
Review on pages 42 to 48 and is incorporated here by reference.
Risk Committee
Risk Committee composition
The regular process of identifying, evaluating and managing significant 
corporate risks has been delegated by the Board to a Risk Committee.  
The Committee comprises the following Directors and Senior Managers 
with usually one Non-executive Director in attendance:
M H Marx Chair
M O Shepherd
C J Barwick
M S Weiner
R C McCubbine Senior Manager
D A K Trench Senior Manager
S Whittle In house Legal Counsel
Role of the Risk Committee
The Committee’s principal role as set out in its Terms of Reference 
includes:
 • advising the Board on the Company’s risk appetite, tolerance and 
strategy, taking into account the current and prospective macroeconomic 
and financial environment;
 • reviewing the Company’s risk register, including identification of new risks, 
continuous assessment, and identification of early warning factors and 
mitigating actions and controls;
 • reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial controls, 
internal controls and risk management systems; and
 • reviewing the Company’s procedures for detecting fraud and prevention 
of bribery.
Annual activities of the Risk Committee
The Committee meets quarterly during the year to ensure that the Group’s 
risk management procedures are comprehensive and appropriate for the 
current economic climate, regulatory requirements and business operations.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the risk register and agreed that 
cyber security should have an increased focus. Consequently, the Company 
employed a cyber security professional to review the current arrangements 
and implement enhanced controls. The Company is also promoting staff 
awareness to further assist in mitigating this risk. 64 Development Securities PLC 
The Committee’s remit includes all of the Group’s subsidiaries and those 
joint ventures and associates which are administered by the Company. 
Risks arising from externally managed joint ventures are managed at the 
boards of the joint venture companies. The minutes of the Committee’s 
deliberations are reviewed by the Board. In addition to the activities of the 
Risk Committee, a risk evaluation on each significant prospective 
development, investment or joint venture opportunity is evaluated by the 
Board, and for development opportunities, the risks are evaluated by an 
internal independent Project Review Committee. The Executive Directors 
regularly evaluate the Group’s risk-weighted development exposure, which 
is then considered by the Board. All necessary actions have been or are 
being taken to remedy any weaknesses acknowledged from the quarterly 
reviews. No significant failings were identified over the year.
Nomination Committee
Nomination Committee composition
The Nomination Committee comprises the following Directors:
Director
D S Jenkins Chair
M H Marx
S C Bates
The Company acknowledges that the composition of the Committee  
does not comply with the requirements of the Code provision B.2.1 as  
the Committee does not have a majority of independent Non-executive 
Directors. The Company continues to believe that, particularly in light of the 
overall size of the Board, the Chairman, Senior Independent Director and 
Chief Executive are best placed to make decisions concerning nominations 
to the Board. The Board believes that the Committee has an appropriate 
composition to discharge its duties effectively. This will continue to be  
kept under review.
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee’s principal role as set out in its Terms of Reference  
includes:
 • evaluating the structure, size and composition of the Board as a whole;
 • succession planning for Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors  
and the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive;
 • considering the balance of skills, knowledge, experience, time 
commitment required and gender on the Board;
 • recommending suitable candidates for the role of Senior  
Independent Director;
 • devising descriptions of the role and capabilities required for  
a particular appointment; and
 • providing recommendations on the composition of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees, in consultation with the Chairs of  
those Committees.
The Committee devises and implements succession plans for 
appointments to the Board, which are fulfilled through an effective search, 
interview and evaluation process based upon objective criteria.
Annual activities of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee meets as necessary. The Committee met  
once after the end of the financial year under review and discussed the 
re-election of all Directors and recommended to the Board that, each 
Director, being eligible, should opt for annual election. The Board approved 
this recommendation and each Director shall retire and seek re-election at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in line with provision B.7.1 of the 
Code. The Company believes that sufficient biographical details and other 
relevant information of the Directors seeking annual re-election is provided 
in this Annual Report to enable shareholders to make an informed decision.
The Committee gave consideration to the important debate of gender 
diversity  and implemented a policy in this area. The policy reflects the 
commitment to objectively assess, recruit and reward based on merit.  
The Company’s policy on diversity is detailed in the Directors’ Report  
on pages 53 to 58.
The Committee gave consideration to succession planning for Executive 
Directors. It was also agreed that an additional Non-executive Director 
would be of potential benefit to the Board.
The Nomination Committee has reviewed the size, structure and 
composition of the Board and concluded that it is appropriate.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the following Directors:
Director
N H Thomlinson Chair
D S Jenkins
S C Bates
The Committee also seeks advice from remuneration consultants Deloitte 
LLP, and legal support from Linklaters LLP. Representatives of Deloitte 
LLP attended two meetings of the Committee by invitation. More 
information on their appointment can be found on page 81 of the 
Remuneration Report. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee and remuneration policy
The Committee is authorised to determine remuneration policy, details of 
which can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83, along 
with a detailed description of the work of the Remuneration Committee.
Approvals Committee
The Approvals Committee comprises any two Executive Directors and  
a minimum of two Non-executive Directors.
Its remit is to permit the approval of transactions between £2.0 million and 
£5.0 million, which are then reported to the Board. Transactions below 
£2.0 million are delegated to the relevant Executive Directors responsible 
and those above £5.0 million fall under the remit of the Board.  65 Annual Report 2014
Investment and Development Boards
The Investment Board and Development Board comprise the Executive 
Directors and Senior Managers and are chaired by M H Marx and  
C J Barwick respectively. The Boards meet on a regular basis during the 
year to discuss, review and approve property transactions. These include 
any proposed sale and purchase transactions and proposed capital 
expenditure. These decisions are then ratified by the Board if expenditure 
is above a defined limit. The Non-executive Directors are invited to attend 
the Investment and Development Boards to enable them to meet with  
the broader management team.
Takeover Directive 
Details of the required disclosure under the Takeover Directive can be 
found in the Directors’ Report on pages 53 to 58 and the Remuneration 
Report on pages 66 to 83 and are incorporated herein by cross reference.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
and Parent financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the 
Parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 • state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the Group financial statements; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Directors consider that 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 52 of 
the Directors’ Report, confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge 
and belief:
 • the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group, and Company; and
 • the Strategic Report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website, www.developmentsecurities.com. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board
H M Ratsey
Company Secretary
30th April 2014
  66 Development Securities PLC 
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the new remuneration 
reporting regulations:
 • The Policy report sets out details of our directors’ remuneration policy  
and will be subject to a binding vote at our 2014 Annual General Meeting.
 • The Annual Remuneration Report provides details on how our Directors 
were paid in respect of the year ended 28th February 2014 and how we 
intend to apply our remuneration policy for Directors in the financial year 
ending 28th February 2015.
Summary of remuneration out-turns
For the financial year commencing 1st March 2014 we are making no 
increase to Executive Directors’ base salaries.
The Executive Directors who are focused on development activities have 
received payouts under the Development Profit Plan during the year.  
These relate to awards granted in previous years and reflect the successful 
realisation of profits for the Company (above a return on equity threshold) 
from these projects.  There were no payouts under the Strategic Profit Plan 
or the Investment Growth Plan.
Annual bonus payments were made in respect of the financial year ended 
28th February 2014 taking into account the Committee’s assessment of 
performance against the bonus criteria.
An assessment of the performance condition for the award made under  
the Performance Share Plan on 22nd March 201 1 resulted in a nil vesting.
Remuneration review – new incentive structure
Ahead of the new remuneration reporting regime we undertook a 
comprehensive review of our executive remuneration framework.
The overarching objectives of the review were to design a simple 
remuneration policy that would enable us to attract and retain key 
individuals necessary for the successful execution of our strategy and  
to link remuneration payments directly to the value those individuals  
add to the Company. 
For many years, we have operated a remuneration policy that has been 
focused on a number of profit plans. In the context of the key principles 
above, we are proposing to replace the Performance Share Plan, the 
Development Profit Plan, the Investment Growth Plan and the Strategic 
Profit Plan with one simplified long-term share plan that is directly linked  
to long-term shareholder value creation.
We are not proposing to make any changes to the operation of the 
annual bonus.
The key features of the new plan are:
 • Awards of shares subject to performance conditions;
 • Shares vest to the extent that company performance targets are satisfied;
 • Performance measured 50 per cent at year three and 50 per cent at 
year four;
 • A portion of vested awards will be subject to an additional holding period 
of either one or two years. This will result in a combined performance and 
holding period of no less than five years; and
 • Awards of up to a maximum of three times salary per annum.
The new plan represents a very significant departure from our historic 
approach which has been focused on cash-based profit plans operating  
on a project-by-project basis. The Committee has undertaken extensive 
consultation and we have been pleased with the response from our 
shareholders.
Transitional arrangements
It is intended that our new Remuneration Policy as set out on pages 67  
to 75 of this Report will apply from 1st March 2015.
Our transitional arrangements are intended to balance fairness to 
participants and shareholders as well as reflect legacy contractual 
entitlements. The transitional arrangements are as follows:
 • The Performance Share Plan (PSP) will be discontinued from 1st March 
2015 and no further awards will be made to Executive Directors. A final 
award will be made to the Chief Executive and Finance Director during 
the financial year ending 28th February 2015. Subsisting PSP awards will 
continue to run and will be performance tested at the end of the relevant 
performance period;
 • The Development Profit Plan (DPP) will be discontinued for Directors and 
no further awards will be made after the implementation of our new Policy 
on 1st March 2015. Further awards may be made in respect of 
development projects until that time. DPP payments for awards made 
prior to 1st March 2015 will be made (to the extent that profits are

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Development Securities PLC
Annual statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
— 
I am pleased to present the  
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
28th February 2014.  67 Annual Report 2014
The key objectives of the Company’s Remuneration Policy are as follows:
 • to ensure that Executive Directors and senior managers are rewarded in a way that attracts, retains, motivates and rewards management of the highest 
quality;
 • to operate incentive plans designed to encourage Executive Directors and senior managers to align their long-term career aspirations with the long-term 
interests of the Company and shareholders’ expectations;
 • to promote the attainment of both individual and corporate achievements, measured against performance criteria required to deliver long-term growth 
and sustainability of the business; and
 • to encourage sustained performance over the medium- and long-term without taking undue risk.
The total pay framework is based on a mixture of fixed and variable elements considered on a meritocratic basis at individual and Group level, taking into 
account the remuneration awarded to employees in the Group. The balance between fixed and variable pay is considered appropriate, given that the 
various incentive plans/schemes ensure a significant proportion of a key individual’s remuneration package is performance related, thereby correlating  
with the strategic aims of the business and the performance of the Company.
Remuneration Policy Report
The Remuneration Policy (the Policy) will apply from 1st March 2015 subject to shareholder approval. For simplicity, we have aligned the Policy effective 
date with the year of the first award under the new Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is also subject to approval at our 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
However, in the interests of transparency the legacy policy which will apply up to 28th February 2015 is also set out in this Report.

Salary 
Core element of 
remuneration set at a 
level to attract and retain 
individuals of the calibre 
required to shape and 
execute the Company’s 
strategy.
Contractual fixed cash amount paid monthly.
Typically, salary levels are reviewed on an annual 
basis. The Committee takes into account a 
number of factors when setting base salary, 
including:
 • Size and scope of the role;
 • Skills and experience of the individual;
 • Performance of the Company and individual;
 • Appropriate market data; and
 • Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company.
Salary increases may be applied 
taking into account the factors 
outlined in this table. 
During review, consideration will also 
be given to increases applied to the 
wider employee population. In certain 
circumstances such as an increase in 
the size and scope of the role or 
increased experience where an 
individual has been hired on a lower 
salary initially, higher increases may be 
given.
There is no maximum salary 
opportunity.
The salaries for the financial year 
commencing 1st March 2014 for  
the current Executive Directors are  
as follows:
 • M H Marx £400,000
 • M O Shepherd £325,000
 • M S Weiner £340,000
 • C J Barwick £325,000

Benefits
To provide Executive 
Directors with market 
competitive benefits 
consistent with the role.
Executive Directors currently receive  
the following benefits:
 • Cash in lieu of company car;
 • Private medical insurance;
 • Income protection insurance; and
 • Life assurance.
Other benefits that are consistent with the role 
may be provided if the Committee considers it 
appropriate. Payments may be made to 
Executive Directors in lieu of any unutilised 
holiday allowance. The Committee may permit 
additional holiday in lieu of remuneration.
Relocation and expatriate benefits may also be 
provided, if an existing or new Executive Director 
is required to relocate.
The Executive Directors may participate in any 
all employee share plans adopted by the 
Company on the same basis as other employees.
The cost of benefits may vary from 
year to year depending on an 
individual’s circumstances and the 
varying cost of benefits premiums. 
There is no maximum benefits value.
None.
Retirement benefits
To provide Executive 
Directors with retirement 
benefits consistent with 
the role.
Defined contribution pension arrangements are 
provided.
Pension benefits are provided through a Group 
Personal Pension Plan, non-pensionable cash 
supplement or contribution to a Personal Pension 
arrangement.
17.5 per cent of salary per annum. None.
Annual bonus
Incentivises and rewards 
Executive Directors for  
the successful delivery  
of strategic objectives  
on an annual basis.
Payments are based on performance in the 
relevant financial year.
Payments up to 50 per cent of the maximum 
opportunity (‘Target’ performance) are made in 
cash.
Any bonus above 50 per cent of the maximum 
opportunity will be paid in shares which the 
Director is expected to hold for at least two years.
150 per cent of salary per annum.
Executive Directors, excluding the  
Chief Executive, will have a lower 
maximum opportunity than the 
percentage stated above. For the 
financial year ending 28th February 
2015, this will be 75 per cent of salary.
The annual bonus is determined 
principally with reference to the four 
main drivers of the creation of 
shareholder value in our business: 
 • Accurate reading of the economic 
and market cycles in which  
we operate;
 • Pipeline of future development 
projects;
 • Active management of the 
investment portfolio; and
 • Maintenance of the standards of 
excellence that are embedded 
within the Company’s culture.
The Committee reviews the basis of 
performance measurement under the 
annual bonus from time to time and 
may review and amend the measures 
as it considers appropriate.
50 per cent of the maximum bonus 
opportunity will be payable for 
‘Target’ performance.  69 Annual Report 2014

Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
Incentivises and rewards 
Executive Directors for 
delivery of the Company’s 
strategic plan of building 
shareholder value.
Awards of nil-cost options or conditional shares.
The awards vest subject to the achievement of 
performance targets set by the Committee.  
50 per cent of the award is based on performance 
measured over three years, with the remaining  
50 per cent based on performance measured  
over four years.
Following vesting, the awards will normally be 
subject to an additional holding period, for at least 
two thirds of the award, of up to two years such that 
the combined performance and holding period will, 
for this portion, not be less than five years in total.
Dividend equivalents may be paid on awards. 
Awards may be subject to malus and therefore  
may be reduced or forfeited at the discretion of  
the Committee if an exceptional event occurs 
which has a material adverse impact on the Group 
including, but not limited to, reputational damage or 
a material failure of risk management. In addition, 
awards may be reduced or forfeited if results 
announced for any period have been restated  
or subsequently appeared materially financially 
inaccurate or misleading.
Three times base salary per annum. The primary performance measure 
will be net asset value per share 
growth (including dividends).   
No less than 50 per cent of an 
award will be based on this 
measure. The Committee retains 
the flexibility to introduce  
additional measures.
For threshold levels of performance, 
no more than 25 per cent of the 
award vests with 100 per cent  
of the award vesting for  
maximum performance. 
Shareholding  
guidelines

Directors with the 
shareholder experience.

Legacy arrangements and transition
The Committee undertook a review of incentive arrangements in the financial year ended 28th February 2014. Following this review the new Long-Term 
Incentive Plan will replace a number of plans. The following table sets out plans under which no further awards will be made or where awards will be made 
for a short period as part of the transitional arrangements. Any subsisting awards for legacy plans will continue in accordance with the relevant plan rules.

Development Profit 
Plan (DPP)
Incentivises and rewards 
Executive Directors for 
the performance of their 
portfolio of projects.
Awards are made in respect of each 
development project. 
No awards will be made to Executive Directors 
for projects which commence following  
1st March 2015.
Awards may pay out once a project makes a 
realised profit. No payments will be made  
after 1st March 2018. 
50 per cent of the payment is made in cash  
or shares at the time profit is realised.
The remaining 50 per cent is deferred until  
the end of the financial year and paid in cash  
or shares at this point. 
The maximum 
aggregate pool 
available for 
distribution to 
Executive Directors 
and the wider team is 
10 per cent of the 
realised profit above 
a hurdle for each 
development project.
Payments are only made under this plan once 
profit has been realised on a development above 
a threshold return (a notional cost of equity).
Losses attributable to other projects in which a 
Director has been made an award are also taken 
into account when calculating payments to 
ensure that participants are incentivised to 
mitigate losses while maximising project profits. 
This calculation is at the Committee’s discretion 
and will not apply in respect of certain legacy 
awards and projects. Where unrealised losses 
are deducted in the calculation but a profit is 
subsequently recognised a balancing payment 
may be made.
Additional profit plans
Designed to incentivise 
all Executive Directors in 
the principal activities of 
the Group, namely 
development and the 
investment portfolio.
There are no subsisting awards under either the Strategic Profit Plan or the Investment Growth Plan. No further awards will 
be made under these two plans.
Performance Share 
Plan (PSP)
Incentivises and rewards 
Executive Directors for 
the sustainable creation 
of shareholder value over 
the longer term.
An award of nil-cost options or contingent 
shares made on an annual basis. No awards 
will be made to Executive Directors under the 
Performance Share Plan from 1st March 2015.
The awards vest subject to the achievement  
of performance targets over a three year 
performance period. 
Dividend equivalents may be paid on awards  
up to the point of vesting.
200 per cent of base 
salary as set out in the 
plan rules.
In practice, awards of 
75 per cent of salary 
and 50 per cent of 
salary have been 
made to the Chief 
Executive and other 
Executive Directors 
respectively.
Awards vest based on relative TSR performance 
and NAV per share growth over the performance 
period. The performance measures are equally 
weighted for all outstanding awards.
The Committee may change or waive a 
performance condition in accordance with its 
terms or if anything happens which causes the 
Committee reasonably to consider it appropriate 
to do so.
For threshold levels of performance, 25 per cent 
of the award vests with 100 per cent of the 
award vesting for maximum performance.   71 Annual Report 2014
Notes to the policy table
Application of Policy
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and 
payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to 
it in connection with such payments) that are not in line with the Policy set 
out above where the terms of the payment were (i) agreed before the Policy 
came into effect; or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a 
director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the 
Company. For these purposes, ‘payments’ includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award of shares or cash 
is ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
Discretion
The Committee will operate the LTIP, PSP and DPP in accordance with the 
relevant plan rules. In particular, the Committee retains discretion on the 
operation and administration of these plans as follows:
 • Dividend equivalents may be paid on awards up to the point of vesting 
including on a reinvested basis;
 • While LTIP and PSP awards will normally be delivered in shares, the 
Committee may settle an award in cash; and
 • In the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital, a demerger, 
special dividend or distribution or any other corporate event which, in the 
Committee’s opinion might affect the current or future value of awards, 
the Committee may adjust the number of shares, the exercise price and 
the performance condition.
Awards may be amended in accordance with the rules approved by 
shareholders.
Payment in shares
Where a payment under the Development Profit Plan exceeds £1.0m in  
one financial year, two-thirds of the payments above £1.0m will be made  
in shares which the Director is expected to hold for at least two years.  
This will apply if the Director’s shareholdings are less than two times salary.
The Committee may increase the level of share deferral for incentives  
at any time.
Takeover or other corporate event
For outstanding LTIP and PSP awards, on a takeover or other corporate 
event, generally the performance period will end on the date of the event. 
The Committee will determine vesting having regard to the extent to which 
performance conditions have been achieved at this point taking into 
account any other factors they consider relevant. Awards will generally vest 
on a time pro-rata basis taking into account the shortened performance 
period, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Awards subject to a 
holding period will be released as part of the transaction. 
Alternatively, outstanding LTIP and PSP awards may be subject to rollover, 
with the agreement of the acquiring company.
Other corporate events may include (but are not limited to) a demerger, 
delisting, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend), reverse takeover  
and merger by way of dual listing.
Under the DPP, on a takeover, the Committee can bring forward award 
payments. The amount of the payments will not exceed the bonus pool  
and, subject to that, are determined by the Committee on the basis of 
estimated profits.
Minor changes
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out in this 
Report (for example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for the amendment.
Performance measures and target setting
Annual bonus
The Committee has always taken a somewhat different approach to the 
annual bonus compared to our competitors, in that the annual bonus has 
never been formulaically driven by the annual financial results but reflects a 
measure of annual performance in the context of the length of the property 
cycle. The annual bonus is designed to reward Executive Directors for the 
successful execution of the four main drivers of shareholder value creation. 
Long-term incentive plan
The Company’s overarching objective is to build shareholder value over the 
long-term. Following a review of our incentive arrangements, for awards 
made in 2015, the Long-Term Incentive Plan will measure the Company’s 
NAV per share growth over three and four years. This will ensure that 
Directors are closely aligned to the shareholder experience as our NAV  
per share growth performance is a key indicator of the performance of  
the business and is closely related to share price performance.
Targets are positioned at a level which the Committee considers to be 
stretching but which do not incentivise a change in our risk approach. 72 Development Securities PLC

Award levels reflect a 300 per cent of salary award for M S Weiner and a 
75 per cent of salary award for other Executive Directors.
Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
compared with other employees
As for our Executive Directors, a sizeable proportion of employee pay is 
dependent on Company, team and individual performance. All employees 
participate in the annual bonus, with the weighting of individual and 
corporate measures dependent on an individual’s role and their ability  
to directly influence the Company’s results.
Individuals below the Board who are involved in the management of 
our development projects may be invited to participate in the DPP as 
appropriate. While this plan is to be discontinued for Executive Directors 
with effect from 1st March 2015, it is intended that it will continue to 
operate below the Board to ensure that individuals at this level are  
rewarded for profit realisation from development projects.
Policy table for Non-executive Directors
Component The Company’s approach
Chairman fees • Comprises an all-inclusive fee for all Board and 
Committee responsibilities.
 • Determined by the Remuneration Committee and 
approved by the Board.
Non-executive 
Director fees
 • Comprises a basic fee in respect of their Board duties. 
 • Further fees may be paid in respect of additional Board 
or Committee duties.
 • Recommended by the Chairman and Chief Executive 
and approved by the Board.
Expenses incurred in the performance of Non-executive Directors’ duties 
may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company, including any tax 
due on those expenses.
No Director plays a role in determining their own remuneration. Fees for all 
Non-executive Directors are set at a level sufficient to attract and retain 
individuals with the required skills, experience and knowledge to allow the 
Board to carry out its duties. The fees set out above are the sole element of 
Non-executive Director remuneration. They are not eligible for participation 
in the Company’s incentive or pension plans. 
The fees are set within the aggregate limits set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association and approved by shareholders.  74 Development Securities PLC 
Approach to remuneration on recruitment
The Committee will apply the following principles on the recruitment of a 
new Executive Director:
 • Although the Company operates in a highly competitive market for talent 
the Committee is mindful of the need to avoid paying more than is 
necessary on recruitment;
 • The package of a new Executive Director would, so far as practical,  
be aligned with the Policy set out in the table on pages 67 to 75;
 • Salaries would reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and may 
be set at a level to allow future salary progression to reflect performance 
in the role. For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather 
than salary (for example a Non-executive Director taking on an executive 
function on a short-term basis);
 • It would be expected that the structure and quantum of the variable pay 
elements would reflect those set out in the policy table on pages 67 to 
69. However, at recruitment, the Committee may flex the balance 
between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to 
assess performance; and
 • Variable pay on recruitment (excluding buy-outs) would be subject to the 
maximums in line with the on-going incentive policy maximums set out in 
the policy table on pages 67 to 69 being 150 per cent of salary for annual 
bonus and 300 per cent of salary for the LTIP.
In the event that an individual is internally promoted to the Board (including 
if an Executive Director is appointed following an acquisition or merger), the 
Company would normally honour all legacy arrangements in line with their 
original terms.
Buy-outs 
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make compensatory payments 
and/or awards for any remuneration arrangements subject to forfeit on 
leaving a previous employer. Any buy-out would take into consideration the 
terms of the arrangement being forfeited and would take into account all 
relevant factors such as the form, expected value, performance conditions, 
anticipated vesting and timing of the forfeited remuneration. There is no 
limit on the value of such awards, but the Committee’s intention is that the 
value awarded would be no more than the commercial value forfeited.
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive Director, 
remuneration arrangements will be consistent with the Policy set out  
in this Report.
Service contracts – Executive Directors
The dates of the current contracts in place for the Executive Directors  
are as follows:
Executive Director Date of contract
M H Marx 24th June 1994
M O Shepherd 8th October 2012
C J Barwick 12th May 1998
M S Weiner 17th March 2004
The Executive Directors’ service contracts do not specify an expiry date 
and may be terminated upon twelve months’ notice by either the Director or 
the Company.  For the initial period of 18 months M O Shepherd’s notice 
period is 18 months, following the initial period this reduces to twelve 
months in line with the other Executive Directors.
In the event of early termination, a payment in lieu of notice may be made 
which may include salary, pension and benefits. 
The Company’s policy on termination payments is to consider the 
circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant 
contractual provisions, the circumstances of termination and any applicable 
duty to mitigate.
An Executive Director may be hired on a contract that has a longer notice 
period (up to 18 months) during an initial pre-determined period.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment 
rather than service contracts.  Details of the dates of appointment are set 
out below:
Non-executive Director Date of appointment
D S Jenkins 10th January 2007
S C Bates 5th January 2010
N H Thomlinson 3rd January 2012
The Non-executive Directors’ appointments are terminable at the will of  
the parties but are envisaged to establish an initial term of three years,  
after which they will be reviewed annually.
The notice periods are currently 12 months in the case of the Chairman  
and six months for other Non-executive Directors.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non-executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment are available at the Company’s registered 
office from the Company Secretary. 
Policy on payment for loss of office
Where an Executive Director leaves employment, the Committee’s 
approach to determining any payment for loss of office will normally be 
based on the following principles:
 • The Committee’s objective is to find an outcome which is in the best 
interests of both the Company and its shareholders while taking into 
account the specific circumstances of cessation of employment;
 • The Company may make a contribution towards an Executive Director’s 
legal fees in connection with advice on the terms of their departure;
 • The Committee may make an annual bonus payment for the year of 
cessation depending on the reason for leaving. Typically, the Committee 
will take into consideration the period served during the year and the 
individual and the Company’s performance up to cessation. Any such 
payment is at the discretion of the Committee;  75 Annual Report 2014
 • The treatment of outstanding share awards will be governed by the 
relevant plan rules as set out in the table below. For the purposes of this 
table, good leaver reasons include (but are not limited to) cessation due  
to ill-health, redundancy, retirement, death and any other reason at the 
discretion of the Committee; and
 • If awards are made on recruitment (such as buy-outs) the treatment on 
leaving would be determined, at that time.
On-going plans
Plan Treatment on cessation of employment
Long-term 
incentive 
plan
 • Unvested awards will normally lapse in full unless a 
participant is a good leaver.
 • If the Committee determines that a participant is a 
good leaver, they will determine the proportion of the 
award that vests to the extent that any performance 
condition is satisfied on the vesting date and they will 
take into account the time elapsed between the start of 
the performance period and cessation of employment, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise.
 • The vesting date for such awards will normally be the 
original vesting date, although the Committee has the 
flexibility to determine that awards can vest early upon 
cessation of employment or at a later date. In the event 
of death awards vest on cessation.
 • Where options are granted, vested options will typically 
remain exercisable for twelve months from the date of 
vesting. In the event of death awards remain 
exercisable for 24 months.
 • Where an individual leaves during the holding period of 
an award, the award will usually be released at the 
normal time, except in the case of death or if the 
Committee dis-applies the holding period. In the event 
of an individual’s dismissal for misconduct during the 
holding period, all awards will lapse.
Legacy plans

 • Awards will normally lapse in full unless a participant is

 • If a participant is treated as a good leaver and ceases 
employment before the bonus is paid, the Committee 
may decide that some, or all, of the participant’s bonus 
is paid to him at the same time as they are paid to other 
participants.

Share Plan
 • Awards will normally lapse in full unless a participant is

 • If the Committee determines that a participant is a 
good leaver, they will determine the proportion of the 
award that vests, normally taking into account the 
achievement of the relevant performance conditions at 
the vesting date and the time elapsed between the date 
of grant and cessation of employment.
 • The vesting date for such awards will normally be the 
original vesting date, although the Committee has the 
flexibility to determine that awards can vest upon 
cessation of employment.
 • Where options are granted, vested options will typically 
remain exercisable for twelve months from the date of 
vesting.
 • On death, an award will vest in full on the date of death. 
HMRC 
approved  
all employee 
share plans
 • In line with the HMRC approved plan rules.
The Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations agreed with the 
Executive Director. This is dependent on the contractual obligations from 
1st March 2015 (i) not being in contradiction with the Policy set out in this 
Report, or (ii) if so, not having been entered into on a date later than 27th 
June 2012 , in accordance with the relevant legislation.
Consideration of pay and employment conditions elsewhere in  
the Company
The Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere  
in the Company when developing policies for Executive Directors.  
The Committee does not view formal comparison metrics when considering 
policy. However the Committee is kept updated and has input into the 
remuneration decisions for the wider employee population. For example  
the Committee will typically review the annual bonuses for all employees.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on 
remuneration. The Remuneration Policy presented to shareholders has 
been shaped by dialogue with our shareholders who universally requested 
that we simplify arrangements and align them more closely with overall 
Company results. We consulted with many of our major shareholders during 
2013, and in 2014 we undertook a significant consultation exercise prior to 
implementing our new Long-Term Incentive Plan. The proposed structure of 
our policy is as a result of that process. 76 Development Securities PLC

for the financial year commencing 1st March 2014 and how it was applied 
during the financial year ended 28th February 2014.
Implementation of remuneration policy in the financial year ending 
28th February 2015
The Policy for which we are seeking shareholder approval will be effective 
from 1st March 2015. The financial year, beginning on 1st March 2014, is 
therefore a transitional year. The components of remuneration for this 
financial year will be determined according to whether a Director is actively 
involved in securing new developments or whether they play a broader 
oversight role.
The tables below provide an overview of the components of the  
Executive Directors’ remuneration framework for the financial year  
ending 28th February 2015.

Retirement benefits
The existing money purchase pension scheme is now closed to future 
contributions and new joiners and pension is provided via a Group Personal 
Pension Plan. The contribution structure for Executive Directors remains 
unchanged at 17.5 per cent of salary for the financial year ending  
28th February 2015. 
Annual bonus 
The non-pensionable annual bonus is based on the performance of the 
Company during the year, team achievements and the specific contribution 
of individuals concerned. With the exception of M H Marx, Executive 
Directors are set a Target bonus of 37.5 per cent of salary and a maximum 
of 75.0 per cent of salary. The bonus potential for M H Marx is 75.0 per cent 
at Target and 150.0 per cent at maximum performance.
Annual Remuneration Report
There will be no change to the operation of the annual bonus for the 
financial year ending 28th February 2015 as outlined on page 78.
Development Profit Plan
As set out on page 66 of this Report, we have recently undertaken an 
extensive review of our remuneration policy which has resulted in us seeking 
approval for a new LTIP to be operated from 1st March 2015 onwards.
As part of the transition arrangements, the financial year ending 28th 
February 2015 will be the last in which new awards will be made under the 
DPP to reward and incentivise Directors that have brought successful 
development opportunities to the Company. The Chief Executive and 
Finance Director do not participate in this plan.
As in previous years, awards are based on a percentage of the bonus pool 
which becomes payable once the development has achieved realised 
profits. The maximum bonus pool available for distribution to Executive 
Directors and the wider team is 10.0 per cent of the realised profit for each 
development.  This is calculated once a notional cost of equity of 12.5 per 
cent is deducted, so that the pool generated only relates to profits over and 
above a threshold return.
In 2013, the concept of netting off was introduced in respect of transitional 
projects since August 2009 such that any realised and unrealised losses in 
respect of an Executive Directors’ portfolio will be taken into account when  
a profit is realised on a project. Projects prior to 2009 and certain other 
legacy projects are excluded. 
Payments in respect of awards made under this plan may be made up to  
1st March 2018. No further awards will be made in respect of projects 
following 1st March 2015.  
Performance Share Plan 
Awards will be made under the current PSP to the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director during the financial year ending 28th February 2015 of 
75.0 per cent of salary and 50.0 per cent of salary respectively. No awards 
will be made to any other Directors under this plan. Following the financial 
year ending 28th February 2015 this plan will be discontinued for Executive 
Directors.
Awards made in the financial year ending 28th February 2015 will be 
subject to two, equally weighted, performance conditions over a three year 
performance period:
Performance measure
Threshold vesting 
(25% of award)
Maximum vesting 
(100% of award)
Relative TSR against the constituents of 
the FTSE Real Estate Investment Trust 
Index and the FTSE Real Estate 
Investment Services Index
Median 85th percentile
NAV per share growth RPI + 3% p.a. RPI + 10% p.a.
Pro-rating vesting will apply between these points.  77 Annual Report 2014
There are two underpins that must be satisfied for awards to vest.   
Firstly, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained 
improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance over the 
performance period (typically by considering the change in net asset value).  
In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that performance has not been 
achieved as a result of inappropriate financial risk (for example very high 
levels of gearing) and that the level of financial and business risk is in line 
with the Company’s stated strategy.
Strategic Profit Plan and Investment Growth Plan
The Strategic Profit Plan and the Investment Growth Plan have now  
been discontinued.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
Fees for the financial year ending 28th February 2015 are set out in

Incentive out-turns
Annual bonus
The Committee has always taken a somewhat different approach to the 
annual bonus compared to our competitors, in that the annual bonus has 
never been formulaically driven by the annual financial results but reflects  
a true measure of annual performance in the context of the length of the 
property cycle.
The annual bonus in respect of the Executive Directors is determined 
principally by the four main drivers for the creation of shareholder value in 
our business: namely, accurate reading of the economic and market cycles 
in which we operate; the pipeline of future development projects; active 
management of the investment portfolio; and the maintenance of the 
standards of excellence that are embedded within the Company’s culture.
The annual bonus payments made to Executive Directors in respect of the 
financial year ended 28th February 2014 reflect the strategic progress 
made by the Group across our portfolio. This included:
 • Development of the pipeline of future development projects to create 
value through regeneration;
 • Progress on legacy assets; and
 • Performance in the management and on-going strategy for the 
investment portfolio.
When determining annual bonuses and awards under the DPP there is no 
‘double-counting’. The contribution of any team or individual performance 
which leads to awards under the DPP is disregarded for the purposes of  
the annual bonus.
The Committee decided that the following annual bonuses would be paid  
in respect of the year ended 28th February 2014.

Development Profit Plan
Under the rules of the Development Profit Plan the following projects realised 
a profit during the financial year and so payments were made as follows.  
Each project was subject to a 12.5 per cent notional cost of equity 
threshold.

1.  Awards subject to netting off, half of the award will be assessed following the completion of 
the Group audit.
2.  From 1st March 2012, the Company operated an additional shareholding requirement, which 
will operate where significant success is achieved and rewarded via the Company’s focused 
profit plans. Where payments under the Development Profit Plan, Investment Growth Plan and 
Strategic Profit Plan, in aggregate, exceed £1.0 million in one financial year, two-thirds of the 
payment above £1.0 million will be made in shares. In receiving the above awards M S Weiner 
reached this threshold resulting in £52,636 of the award being made in shares which must be 
retained for two years. 
An amount of £1,098,000 has been provided for in these financial 
statements in respect of bonus payments awarded to M S Weiner under the 
Development Profit Plan that will be paid during the following financial year. 
This award relates to the Chrome portfolio.
Performance Share Plan
Awards were made under the PSP in 201 1 subject to the Company’s relative 
TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE Real Estate 
Investment Trust Index and the FTSE Real Estate Investment Services Index 
over the period 1st January 201 1 to 31st December 2013. The Company’s 
TSR performance was below the median of the comparator group over the 
performance period and so the award lapsed in full.
Share option schemes
The outstanding awards under the 2005 Executive Share Option Scheme 
were tested during the year and failed to meet the performance conditions.  
There are currently no outstanding awards under the scheme.

**   The performance measures and targets for these awards are the same that apply to the 2014 awards described above on page 76.  In addition, the financial performance and risk underpins will  
also apply to these awards.
Executive Directors’ shareholdings (audited)
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement of one half of basic salary within two years of appointment, rising to an amount equivalent  
to one times basic salary after four years. M H Marx, C J Barwick and M S Weiner have all met the amount equivalent to basic salary.
From 1st March 2012, the Company has operated an additional shareholding requirement, which will operate where significant success is achieved and 
rewarded via the Company’s focused profit plans. Where payments under the Development Profit Plan, Investment Growth Plan and Strategic Profit Plan,  
in aggregate, exceed £1.0 million in one financial year, two thirds of the payment above £1.0 million will be made in shares.  This will apply if the Director’s 
shareholdings are less than two times salary. The amount paid in shares will be subject to a two-year retention period.
The interests of all the Directors (together with interests held by his or her connected persons), all of which were beneficial, in the share capital of the Company, are:

Historical Total Shareholder Return performance
The graphs below demonstrate the Company’s TSR performance over five 
financial periods as represented by share price growth plus reinvested 
dividends, against both the FTSE Real Estate Investment Trust Index and 
the FTSE Real Estate Investment Services Index. The FTSE All Share Real 
Estate Index used in previous years has ceased to be published and, having 
reviewed the constituents of the previous index, it is considered that the 
constituents of these two indices are the most appropriate for comparison 
of the Company’s business performance against that of its competitors.  
The Company is a constituent of the FTSE Real Estate Investment Services 
Index, but a number of constituents of the FTSE Real Estate Investment 
Trust Index are also considered as within the Company’s peer group.

Role and constitution of the Committee
The Committee’s full terms of reference are set out on the Company’s 
website www.developmentsecurities.com and are available on request  
from the Company Secretary. Its principal role is to determine the total 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and to ensure that senior 
management remuneration is consistent with corporate policy.  81 Annual Report 2014
Advisers 
The Committee sought professional advice from external remuneration 
consultants Deloitte LLP (who are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operate under the code of 
conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting).  The Committee 
is satisfied that the advice it receives is objective and independent.   
Deloitte LLP’s fees for providing advice to the Remuneration Committee 
amounted to £83,600. Representatives of Deloitte LLP attended two 
meetings of the Committee by invitation. Deloitte LLP undertook the audit 
of the Development Securities Retirement Benefit Scheme of which the 
Company is Trustee, but otherwise undertakes no other work for the 
Company. In addition, legal support was provided by Linklaters LLP. 
M H Marx, the Chief Executive provided advice in respect of the 
remuneration of the other Executive Directors but was not in attendance 
when his own remuneration was discussed. H M Ratsey, Company 
Secretary, acts as secretary to the Committee.

Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members 
of Development Securities PLC
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 28th 
February 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder  
of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements (the ‘financial statements’), which are 
prepared by Development Securities PLC, comprise:
• the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year  
then ended;
• the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 28th February 2014;
• the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year  
then ended;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
 Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have 
been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to 
the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the  
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
2014 Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a 
whole.
 Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the 
Group financial statements as a whole to be £4.4 million. This represents 
approximately 0.75 per cent of total assets. We set specific materiality of 
£1.0 million for certain balances impacting gross profit and profits from  
joint ventures and associates. 
 We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £220,000 as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting  
for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of the audit
The Group is structured under 204 statutory entities and joint ventures  
in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and Luxembourg.  
These statutory entities and joint ventures represent the reporting units 
which are consolidated in the Group financial statements.
 The preparation of the Group financial statements is managed on a 
consolidated basis, so the whole business was subject to the same audit 
scope. In establishing the overall approach to our audit, we assessed the  
risk of material misstatement, taking into account the nature, likelihood or 
potential magnitude of any misstatement. Following this assessment, we 
applied professional judgement to determine the extent of testing required 
over each balance in the financial statements.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made a number of 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events 
that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas 
by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements.
 In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
 We considered the following areas to be those that required particular 
focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of 
focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the 
Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered to be 
significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on 
page 62.
  Annual Report 2014 85
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, 
set out on page 63, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review.
 As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that 
it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern 
basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it  
to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of  
the going concern basis is appropriate.
 However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the  
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Parent company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(‘the Code’). We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue recognition 
because of the pressure management may feel to achieve the planned results. 
We focused on the recognition of revenue from one-off transactions and its 
classification in the income statement.
(Refer also to note 1(h) to the financial statements.)
We tested material property sales to ensure revenue is recognised appropriately 
and in line with IFRS.
 Our testing focused on understanding whether a sale had actually occurred, 
through agreeing cash receipts and reading extracts of related contracts – for 
example a property sale completion statement.
 We also tested a sample of manual adjustments to revenue .
Valuation of properties
We focused on this area because the investment and trading and development 
properties represent the majority of assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 Property valuations are subject to a high level of judgement as they are 
calculated from a number of different assumptions specific to each individual 
property or development site.
 A relatively small percentage change in valuations of individual properties,  
in aggregate, could result in a material impact to the financial statements.
 (Refer also to notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements.)
We performed testing to ensure that the information supplied to the external 
valuers appointed by the Directors was consistent with the underlying property 
records held by the Group and tested during our audit.
 We met with the external valuers to understand and consider the 
appropriateness of the key assumptions underpinning the valuations.
 We discussed the valuation of development and internally valued investment 
properties with the Directors and developed an independent view of the 
underlying valuation appraisals and the assumptions within these.
Recoverability of financial assets 
The Group holds a number of loans with partners that must be assessed for 
recoverability at each period end.
 We focused on this area as recoverability is assessed through cash flow 
models, which can be complex with a number of different inputs and  
judgement involved.
 (Refer also to note 18 to the financial statements.)
We evaluated and tested management’s assessment of recoverability by auditing 
the detailed cash flow projections and assumptions which underpin these.
Risk of management override of internal controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group and examined the 
significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the financial 
statements for evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud. We also tested a sample of manual 
adjustments and journal entries, with a particular focus on those impacting the 
reported profits.

Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Development Securities PLC continued
On page 65 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code Provision C.1.1, 
the Directors state that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to 
be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and 
strategy. On page 62, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee 
has set out the significant issues that it considered in relation to the financial 
statements, and how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• the statement given by the Directors is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us 
to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors

  Annual Report 2014 91
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 28th February 2014
1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies
a)
(i) General information
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 28th 
February 2014 comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiaries and 
were authorised by the Board for issue on 30th April 2014.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its 
registered office is Portland House, Bressenden Place, London, SW1E 5DS.
(ii) Going concern
The Group adopts the going concern basis in preparing its Consolidated 
financial statements as discussed in the Financial Review on pages 42 to 48.
b) Basis of preparation
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations 
as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements 
of the Group for the year ended 28th February 2014 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies which follow set out those 
policies which were applied consistently in preparing the financial statements 
for the year ended 28th February 2014 and 28th February 2013. 
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the 
revaluation of investment property, operating property, available-for-sale 
financial assets and derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
c) Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires 
management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that  
affect the application of accounting policies and amounts reported in  
the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Balance Sheet. Such 
decisions are made at the time the financial statements are prepared and 
adopted based on the best information available. Actual outcomes may be 
different from initial estimates and are reflected in the financial statements 
as soon as they become apparent.
Judgements other than estimates
1.1 Classification of directly owned property assets
The Group earns revenue from property development, trading and 
investment, and from operating serviced offices.
Property development includes the entire development process from 
identification of an opportunity through to construction, letting and sale  
of a completed scheme. This activity is undertaken both on the Group’s  
own Balance Sheet and in partnership with institutional investors, usually  
via a pre-sale of the completed development. 
Property trading refers to participation in the development process, where 
the Group acquires an interest in land and enhances the potential 
development, for instance by procuring or changing planning permission, 
before selling on to a third party to complete the development. 
Property investment represents the acquisition of income-generating real 
estate which is held for the purposes of income and capital gain, through 
active asset management. 
In most cases the property interest is held directly by the Group and is 
classified either as investment property (see note 10) or as inventory for 
development and trading properties (see note 15). 
The varied nature of the Group’s properties is such that a number exhibit 
characteristics consistent with more than one classification; also, the 
Directors’ strategy for an asset may change during its ownership. The 
Directors determine the status of each asset according to their intention  
on acquisition. A change in classification is made only in exceptional 
circumstances, where the strategy has demonstrably changed for a period of 
over one year. One asset has been reclassified from development to trading 
assets during the year following the completion of the development works.
1.2 Classification of projects in partnership
In addition to its directly owned and managed activities, the Group 
participates in similar activities in partnership with others, typically to access 
expertise in different locations or market sectors. The Group’s financial 
participation may be by way of equity investment or loan. In each case a 
judgement is required as to the status of the Group’s interest, as an 
associate, a joint venture, joint operation or a financial asset, typically 
focusing on the extent of control exercised by the Group. 
The Group’s share of control is governed and achieved by a mixture of  
rights set out in agreements and participation in the management of each 
business. The exercise of control in practice does not always follow the legal 
structure. The Directors have considered the position in respect of each 
venture, taking account of the operation in practice, and have determined  
the status of each accordingly. 
These investments are reported under the relevant balance sheet headings, 
with a summary in note 27.
The IASB has issued IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and IFRS 
11 ‘ Joint Arrangements’, which will amend and clarify the guidance in this 
area, and is likely to result in some changes to the current classification. The 
Directors are conducting a detailed review of the new standards and their 
application to the Group’s arrangements. Any changes in accounting policies 
or classifications will be adopted in accordance with the standard in the year 
commencing 1st March 2014.
1.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries
The Group sometimes acquires properties through the purchase of entities 
which own real estate. At the time of acquisition the Group considers 
whether the transaction represents the acquisition of a business. In cases 
where the entity is capable of being operated as a business, or an integrated 
set of activities is acquired in addition to the property, the Group accounts  
for the acquisition as a business combination. When the acquisition does  
not represent a business, it is accounted for as the purchase of a group of 
assets and liabilities. In making this distinction, the Group considers the 
number of items of land and buildings owned by the entity, the extent of 
ancillary services provided by the entity, and whether the entity has its own 
staff to manage the property (over and above the maintenance and security 
of the premises).

1.4 Accounting for pre-sold development assets
Where development is undertaken on the Group’s Balance Sheet under a 
contract for a pre-sale, a judgement is required as to whether this represents 
a sale of property or a contract for construction as described in note 1(h)(vi). 
The development at Lawley has been classified as a construction contract 
(under IAS 11), whereby revenue is reported in line with construction 
progress. The amounts concerned are set out in note 3.
Estimates
1.5 Valuation of property assets
The key source of estimation uncertainty rests in the values of property 
assets, which affects several categories of asset in the Balance Sheet. 
The investment property portfolio (and the operating property) are stated  
at fair value, which requires a number of judgements and estimates in 
assessing the qualities of the Group’s assets relative to market transactions. 
The approach to this valuation and the amounts affected are set out in notes 
1(i), 1(j), 10 and 11. In determining fair value, the capitalisation of net income 
method and the discounted cash flow method have been used, which are 
based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated 
maintenance costs and appropriate discount rate, and make reference  
to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
The same uncertainties affect the determination of fair value of certain 
available-for-sale financial instruments, described in note 18, with the  
further complexity that the value of these assets requires estimates of  
future construction costs, tenant demand and market yields.
The Group’s development and trading properties are carried at the lower  
of cost and net realisable value. The determination of net realisable value 
relies upon similar estimates, with the added challenge, in some cases,  
of judgements about uncertain planning outcomes. These amounts are 
disclosed in note 15.
1.6 Impairment reviews
The Group’s Curzon Park Limited joint venture owns a development site in 
Birmingham known as Curzon Street. The current proposal for the High 
Speed Train Link between London and Birmingham (HS2) indicates that  
the planned route of HS2 passes through the site, including provision for 
part of the prospective station. In view of this, the ultimate value of the site  
is uncertain. The early indications are that the impact of HS2 may restrict 
future development on the 10.5-acre site by approximately two thirds of its 
original potential. The Group has (jointly) guaranteed the liabilities of the joint 
venture to the bank, and hence should the value of the site (together with 
any compensation received) be insufficient to repay the amortising bank 
loan, the Group may incur further charges in respect of its obligations to the 
joint venture and the bank. The Directors believe that the site will recover at 
least its carrying value in the books of the joint venture, although the interim 
and ultimate uses of the site and timing of its development remain unclear. 
The site is discussed in the Chief Executive’s Statement on page 6 and in 
notes 18(a) and 24.
In view of operating losses at Executive Communication Centres (ECC),  
the Group’s serviced office subsidiary, the Group has conducted an 
impairment review of its investment in the business. The review required 
significant judgements and estimates concerning future customer demand 
and competitor behaviour, as well as discount rates. The review determined  
that no further impairment arose during the year.
The Group, through its subsidiaries and a joint venture, has participated in 
the acquisition of loan portfolios which are secured against underlying 
property investment or development assets. The loan portfolios are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at the lower of amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method and are reviewed for 
impairment at each reporting date. In assessing the effective interest  
rate applied and the recoverable amount, the Group applies significant 
judgements in considering the realisable value of the underlying assets 
which secure those loans and timing of the loan repayment. This review 
determined that no provision for impairment is required.
1.7 Derivative instruments
The Group is party to a number of interest rate swap and foreign currency 
agreements which are accounted for as derivatives and measured at fair 
value. The estimation of this figure is based upon market assumptions about 
future movements in interest and exchange rates. The estimated fair values 
and the movements in the year are set out in note 18.
d) New accounting standards
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time 
for the financial year beginning on 1st March 2013 and have a material 
impact on the Group. 
• IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, regarding other 
comprehensive income. The main change resulting from these 
amendments is for entities to group items presented in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) on the basis that they could potentially be 
recycled through profit and loss at a future point in time (for example, 
upon derecognition or settlement).
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’, aims to improve consistency and 
reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a 
single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  
for use across IFRSs. 
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective 
for annual periods beginning after 1st March 2013 and have not been 
applied in preparing these Consolidated financial statements. None of these 
are expected to have a significant impact on Group’s operations.
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement 
and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and replaces 
parts of IAS 39. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two 
measurement categories: those measured at fair value and those 
measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial 
recognition and will depend on characteristics of the instrument. For 
financial liabilities, the main change from IAS 39 is where the fair value 
option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of the fair value change 
due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in Other Comprehensive 
Income rather than the Income Statement, unless it creates an accounting 
mismatch. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9.
  Annual Report 2014 93
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, builds on the existing 
principles by identifying the concept of control to determine whether an 
entity should be included within the Consolidated financial statements  
of the Group. IFRS 10 will provide guidance to assist management in the 
determination of control where it is difficult to assess. The Group has 
been assessing the impact on the Consolidated financial statements  
and will adopt the standard for the accounting period commencing  
1st March 2014.
• IFRS 1 1, ‘Joint arrangements’ focuses on the rights and obligations of  
the parties to the arrangement rather than the legal form. There are  
two types of joint arrangement: joint ventures and joint operations.  
Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets  
and obligations of the joint arrangements and therefore the operator  
will account for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
Joint ventures arise when the investors have rights to the net assets of 
the arrangement and are accounted for under the method. The Group 
has been assessing the impact on the Consolidated financial statements 
and will adopt the standard for the accounting period commencing 
1st March 2014.
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’, includes the disclosure 
requirements for an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, 
associates, special purpose vehicles and other off Balance Sheet 
vehicles. The Group has been assessing the impact on the Consolidated 
financial statements and will adopt the standard for the accounting 
period commencing 1st March 2014.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective 
that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Summary of significant accounting policies
e) Basis of consolidation 
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group include the  
financial statements of Development Securities PLC (‘the Company’)  
and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which 
the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying the shareholding of more than half of the voting 
rights. The Group deems control where it does not have more than 50 per 
cent of the voting power but is able to govern the financial and operating 
policies by virtue of de-facto control, taking account of how the entity 
operates in practice.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included from the 
effective date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains 
control. They are deconsolidated on the date that control ceases. 
Where property is acquired, via corporate acquisition or otherwise, 
management considers the substance of the assets and activities of  
the acquired entity in determining whether the acquisition represents  
the acquisition of a business. The basis of the judgement is set out in  
note 1(c), 1.3. 
Where such acquisitions are not judged to be an acquisition of a business, 
they are not treated as business combinations. Rather, the cost to acquire 
the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities 
of the entity based on their relative fair values at the acquisition date. 
Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred taxation arises.  
Otherwise, acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations.
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.  
Any excess of the purchase price of the business combination over the  
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised  
as goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date 
carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree is 
re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising 
from re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair 
values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity 
interests issued by the Group. This fair value includes any contingent 
consideration. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from 
intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated 
financial statements. Where necessary, adjustments have been made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring 
the accounting policies used and accounting periods into line with those of 
the Group. 
f) Associates and joint ventures 
An associated company is defined as an undertaking other than a subsidiary 
or joint venture over which the Group has significant influence but not 
control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 per 
cent of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted using the 
equity method of accounting. The Group’s investment in associates includes 
goodwill identified on acquisition.
A joint venture is defined as an undertaking other than a subsidiary or 
associated undertaking where the Group has joint control with two or more 
venturers under a contractual arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted  
for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method, the interest in associates or joint ventures is 
carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received 
and less any impairment in value of individual investments. The Statement  
of Comprehensive Income reflects the Group’s share of the associate’s or 
joint venture’s result after tax. When the Group’s share of losses in an 
associate or joint venture equals or exceeds the Group’s interest, including 
any unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses 
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
associate or joint venture. The Group does not recognise net losses unless  
it has incurred constructive or legal obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate or joint venture.

g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries 
is included in Intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses 
on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of 
impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected 
to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, 
identified according to operating segment.
(ii) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not 
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that 
are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-
use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). 
Prior impairment of non-financial assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed 
for possible reversal at each reporting date.
h) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of the revenue 
can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the entity; and when the specific criteria have been met for each 
of the Group’s activities as described below.
(i)  Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of  
the lease. Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are 
spread evenly over the lease term, even if payments are not made on 
such a basis. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease 
together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to 
continue the lease, where, at inception of the lease, the Directors are 
reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option. Lease 
incentives are usually in the form of rent-free periods or capital 
contributions. Assets held within both the investment and development 
and trading segments earn rental income. 
(ii)  Lease surrender payments from tenants are recognised in income when 
they are contractually agreed.
(iii)  Sales of property classified as Inventory are recognised when the risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser, which 
is normally on unconditional exchange of contracts. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised only when all of the significant 
conditions are satisfied.
(iv)  Licence fee income from serviced offices is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the licence. Other income from serviced offices is 
recognised when the service is provided. The income is classified within 
the operating segment. 
(v)  Project management fee income is recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the contract term for which project management services are provided.
(vi)  Development revenue and profits are recognised in accordance with IAS 
11, ‘Construction contracts’ or IAS 18, ‘Revenue’ depending on whether 
all development risks, apart from the construction risk, have passed to 
the purchaser under the terms of the development agreement.  
Where only the construction risk remains, the revenue and profit on  
the development is recognised under IAS 11, so as to match the 
proportion of development work completed on a percentage completion 
basis as determined by consultant monitoring surveyors or using a 
suitable method particular to the contract concerned. Profits are only 
recognised where the outcome can be determined with reasonable 
certainty. Full provision is made for losses as soon as such losses are 
foreseen. Where revenue and profit is recognised under IAS 18, 
disposals are recognised where the risks and rewards of ownership  
are considered to have been transferred to the purchaser.  
Profits are recognised within the development and trading segment. 
(vii)  Income from investment in property secured loans relates to gains from 
recovery of the loan in excess of its acquisition amount where, under the 
terms of the loan agreement, the Group has the power to instruct the 
sale of the underlying property assets, retaining the disposal proceeds  
to repay the loan. The income is recognised as Other property income  
by reference to the loan principal outstanding using the effective  
interest method. 
(viii)  Finance income is recognised by reference to the principal outstanding 
using the effective interest method and is included in Finance income in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(ix)  Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Group’s right 
to receive income has been established. 
i)  Investment properties 
(i)  Investment properties are those properties, including land holdings, that 
are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both. 
Investment properties may be freehold or leasehold properties. For 
leasehold properties that are classified as investment properties, the 
associated leasehold obligations are accounted for as finance lease 
obligations if they qualify to be treated as such.
(ii)  Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including directly 
attributable transaction costs, and thereafter are stated at fair value. 
Surpluses and deficits arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment properties are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the year in which they arise.
(iii)  Completed investment properties are valued, at each reporting date, by 
independent valuers on the basis of market value in accordance with the 
Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors. Fair value is assessed as the estimated amount for which a 
property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing 
buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper 
marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently 
and without compulsion. A deduction is made to reflect purchaser’s 
acquisition costs. In determining the fair value, the capitalisation of net 
income method and the discounting of future cash flows to their present 
value have been used, which are based upon assumptions including 
future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs and appropriate 
discount rate, and make reference to market evidence of transaction 
prices for similar properties.
  Annual Report 2014 95
(iv)  Investment properties under construction are valued by the Directors on 
the basis of the expected value of the property when complete, less 
deductions for the costs required to complete the project and 
appropriate adjustments for risk and finance costs. In preparing these 
valuations the Directors consult with agents and other advisors to derive 
appropriate assumptions specific to each asset.
(v)  Gains or losses on disposal of investment properties are calculated by 
reference to carrying value and recognised when the risks and rewards 
of ownership are considered to have passed to the purchaser, which is 
normally on unconditional exchange of contracts. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised only when all of the significant 
conditions are satisfied. Gains and losses are recognised within Gains or 
losses on disposal of investment properties in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
(vi)  Investment properties held for sale are held at fair value and classified 
separately within current assets in the Balance Sheet. They are stated at 
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
j) Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Operating properties – serviced offices
Operating properties are held for business purposes rather than for 
investment, generating revenue by way of licence fees and ancillary services. 
These properties are recognised initially at cost, which includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use. Thereafter the asset is carried at 
valuation less depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the date 
of revaluation. A revaluation surplus is credited to Other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity under the heading of Property revaluation 
reserve, unless it reverses a revaluation decrease on the same asset 
previously recognised as an expense, where it is first credited to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income to that extent.
Operating properties are valued at each reporting date by independent, 
professional valuers on the basis of Existing Use Value. Surpluses and 
deficits in the period are included in the Property revaluation reserve within 
equity, except where carrying value is below depreciated cost, in which case 
surpluses and deficits are included in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the value of the 
properties, excluding land, over their expected useful lives, usually 25 years. 
(ii) Other plant and equipment 
Other plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Depreciation is provided so as to 
write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets over their 
expected useful lives on a straight-line method. The principal annual rates 
used for this purpose are as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings and computer equipment – 10% to 33% 
Motor vehicles – 20% 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if 
appropriate at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount 
is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within Other gains 
and losses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
k)  Operating leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership 
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rents payable 
under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are 
charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. 
l) Inventory – development and trading properties 
Property and development interests acquired or being constructed for sale in 
the ordinary course of business, rather than to be held for rental or capital 
appreciation, are held as inventory and are measured at the lower of cost 
and estimated net realisable value. 
Cost includes directly attributable expenditure and interest. No element of 
overhead is included in cost, since it is not practical to identify overhead 
amounts in respect of particular assets. Where the Directors consider that 
the costs are not recoverable from the sale or development of the asset, the 
project or site is written down to its net realisable value, with the write-down 
taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated selling price of the project 
or site, based upon the current plans, less all further costs to be incurred in 
making the sale. 
m) Current and deferred income tax 
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in Other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in Other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with 
any adjustment in respect of previous years, in the jurisdiction where the 
Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. 
Appropriate provisions are made based on the amounts expected to be 
paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on all temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date, with 
the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the parent, 
venture or investor respectively, and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued
m) Current and deferred income tax continued
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates  
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
n) Financial assets and financial liabilities 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual terms of 
the instrument. 
(i)  Financial assets
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired as follows: 
• Loans and other receivables with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not quoted on an active market. The Group’s loans and receivables 
are included within Trade and other receivables, Cash and cash 
equivalents, Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits and  
Other financial assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. This represents 
interest and currency swaps which are categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. 
• Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are 
designated as such or are not classified in any other category. After initial 
recognition at cost, available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value, 
with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity 
until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined 
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Equity instrument financial assets are held at cost in the event 
that the fair value of the instruments is not reliably measurable.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original 
invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is 
material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. Provision is made when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover 
balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery  
is assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the appropriate cost line in the Statement  
of Comprehensive Income.
Loans and receivables include bank loans acquired which are secured 
against underlying investment or development assets. The loans acquired 
are recognised and carried at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. 
Amounts receivable are reviewed for impairment and a provision is made 
where there is evidence that the Group will not be able to recover the loan in 
full. Any gains or losses are recognised in a separate component within the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amounts due from customers for contract work are included in Trade and 
other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of payments 
on account received. 
Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits represent cash held by  
the Group in accounts with conditions that restrict the use of these monies 
by the Group and, as such, does not meet the definition of Cash and cash 
equivalents as defined in IAS 7, ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits held at call with banks and 
other short-term highly liquid investments with no significant risk of changes 
in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a financial 
liability. For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash 
and cash equivalents are stated net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Financial assets are included within current assets except for assets 
maturing after one year, which will be classified as non-current.
Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date. Assets 
are impaired where there is evidence that as a result of events that occurred 
after initial recognition, the estimated future cash flows from the assets have 
been adversely affected. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment decreases, 
the reversal of the previously recognised impairment is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised  
cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising on the 
repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised 
respectively in Finance income and Finance costs.
Other financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost and are 
classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.  
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Amounts due to customers for contract work is included within Trade and 
other payables and represents payments received in advance from 
customers.
(iii) Derivatives
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate 
swaps, caps and collars and cross-currency swaps, to manage its exposure 
to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value 
at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss immediately unless the derivative is designated as an effective hedging 
instrument, in which case the fair value is taken through Other 
Comprehensive Income.
(iv)  Hedging
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or  
a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is 
more than twelve months and as a current asset or a current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than twelve months.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the 
  Annual Report 2014 97
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its 
risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will 
be measured throughout its duration. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
The Group has designated derivatives as cash flow hedges, in which case 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is 
recognised in Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to an 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. Amounts taken to equity are recycled to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the periods when the hedged item 
is recognised in profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging 
relationship or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
o) Borrowing costs
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on investment properties 
and inventories under development are capitalised. The interest capitalised is 
calculated using the rate of interest on the loan to fund the expenditure, or 
the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings where appropriate, over 
the period from commencement of the development work until substantially 
all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended 
use or sale are complete. The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if 
there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted. 
Capitalised interest is written off to direct costs on disposal of inventory or  
to operating profit on disposal of investment properties.
Other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which 
they are incurred.
Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities are capitalised as a prepayment 
for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it 
relates. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred.
p) Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated.
Onerous lease provisions are created for properties that are unoccupied, 
sublet at below the rent payable on the head lease or for operating sites where 
the projected future trading revenue is insufficient to cover the value in use.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected  
to be required to settle the obligation. The amortisation in the discount is 
recognised as an interest expense. 
q) Employee benefits
(i) Pensions 
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme whereby the Group  
pays fixed contributions into a pension fund. The Group has no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold 
sufficient assets to pay all employees relating to employee service in the 
current or prior periods. The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in the year represents the actual amount payable to the scheme in the 
year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. 
(ii) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and expense for bonus and profit-sharing  
in accordance with the bonus plans outlined in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 66 to 83. The Group recognises a liability when contractually obliged.
r) Foreign currencies 
The Consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in UK 
Sterling, the Company’s functional and presentation currency. Transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange 
movements are dealt with in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with 
exchange differences on borrowings taken to Finance income or Finance 
costs, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and 
qualifying net investment hedges.
s) Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM).  
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board.
t) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new Ordinary shares  
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where a Group company purchases its own share capital out of distributable 
reserves the shares can be held as Treasury shares. The shares are carried 
at the consideration paid including any directly attributable costs of acquiring 
the shares. The value of the shares is deducted from the equity attributable 
to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.  
If the shares are subsequently reissued, their value is reattributed to the 
Company’s equity holders.

u) Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans, the 
majority of which are cash-settled, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for cash-settled instruments of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
the option is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The Group has used a Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine 
the fair value of share options granted. An equal probability model has been 
used to determine the fair value of share awards under the Performance 
Share Plan. The cost of cash-settled transactions with employees and 
Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they 
are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which 
ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except  
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are 
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is 
calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions and of the number of cash-settled share-based 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject 
to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.  
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet  
date is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a 
corresponding entry in accruals.
v) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a 
liability in the Group’s financial statements in the year in which the dividends 
are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
w) Definitions 
Operating profit: stated after gain on disposal of investment properties and 
the revaluation of the Investment property portfolio and before the results  
of associates, jointly controlled entities and finance income and costs. 
IPD Index and T otal Portfolio Return: total return from the completed 
investment property portfolio, comprising net rental income or expenditure, 
capital gains or losses from disposals and revaluation surpluses or deficits, 
divided by the average capital employed during the financial year, as defined 
and measured by Investment Property Databank Limited, a company that 
produces independent benchmarks of property returns. 
T otal Shareholder Return: movement in share price over the year plus 
dividends paid as a percentage of the opening share price. 
Gearing: expressed as a percentage, is measured as net debt divided  
by total shareholders’ funds.
Adjusted gearing: expressed as a percentage, is calculated by deducting 
from net debt the current fair value of the subordinated loan notes and 
adding back relevant restricted cash balances and transaction costs.
Loan to value gearing: expressed as a percentage of net debt as a 
proportion of total property assets, including shares of properties and  
net debt in all projects in partnership.
Net debt: total debt less cash and short-term deposits, including cash held  
in restricted accounts.

2 Segmental analysis
The segmental information presented consistently follows the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM) and reflects the three 
sectors in which the Group operates. The CODM, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has 
been identified as the Board. The three operating divisions are:
• Investment – management of the Group’s investment property portfolio, generating rental income and valuation surpluses from property management; 
• Development and trading – managing the Group’s development and trading projects. Revenue is received from project management fees, development 
profits and the disposal of inventory; and 
• Operating – serviced office operations. Revenue is principally received from short-term licence fee income. 
Unallocated assets and liabilities comprise amounts that cannot be specifically allocated to operating segments; an analysis is provided below.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information. All operations occur and all assets are located in the United 
Kingdom, except assets of £3.2 million which are located in the Republic of Ireland. All revenue arises from continuing operations.

  Annual Report 2014 105
9 Earnings/(loss) per share and net assets per share 
Basic earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit/(loss) for the year attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares purchased by the Parent and held as treasury shares. 
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted average number 
of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the 
dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares. 
Basic net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the balance sheet date excluding 
shares purchased by the Parent and held as treasury shares.
Diluted net assets per share amounts are calculated by dividing net assets by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the balance sheet date plus the 
number of Ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.
Management has chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate (EPRA) adjusted net assets per share and earnings per share from continuing 
activities in order to provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance and to assist comparison between European property companies. 
EPRA earnings is the profit/(loss) after taxation excluding investment property revaluations (including valuations of joint venture investment properties), 
gains on disposals of investment and trading properties, impairment of development and trading properties and mark-to-market movements of derivative 
financial instruments (including those of joint ventures) and intangible asset movements and their related taxation.
EPRA net assets (EPRA NAV) are the Balance Sheet net assets excluding mark-to-market adjustment on effective cash flow hedges and related debt 
adjustments and deferred taxation on revaluations and diluting for the effect of those shares potentially issuable under employee share schemes.
EPRA NAV per share is EPRA NAV divided by the number of Ordinary shares in issue at the balance sheet date. 
EPRA triple net assets is EPRA NAV adjusted to reflect the fair value of debt and derivatives and to include deferred taxation on revaluations.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share and EPRA profit/(loss) per share is based on the following data:

At 28th February and 31st August each year, the Group engages external, independent and qualified valuers to determine the fair value of the Group’s 
Investment property assets in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. As at 28th February 
2014 and at 28th February 2013, completed Investment properties have been valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered Surveyors, Savills 
Commercial Limited, Chartered Surveyors, GVA Grimley Limited, Commercial Property Advisers or Ryden LLP, Commercial Property Consultants at  
a value of £132,969,000 (28th February 2013: £190,764,000). The current value equates to the highest and best use of the asset.
As at 28th February 2013, £14,625,000 of land held as investment property was valued by Colliers CRE, Chartered Surveyors.
The valuers have consented to the use of their names in the financial statements.
Valuation methodology
The key driver of our investment portfolio valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the date of valuation. The lease information will determine the cash 
flow profile of the property in the future, forming the basis of the valuation. The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental streams to current market 
rent at the time of the next rent review, (leases generally allow for upward only rent reviews) and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.  
The current market level of rent is based on evidence from recent, comparable leasing transactions and negotiations. This is based on evidence available  
at the date of the valuation and does not assume any future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as voids and 
landlords costs, generates the market value of the property. The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to similar market transactions and 
takes into account any risks associated with rent uplift assumptions. For multi-let property assets, different nominal yields will be applied to each tenant to 
arrive at an overall nominal yield and valuation for the asset. For example a foodstore anchor tenant with a strong covenant may attract a yield of 4.9 per cent 
whereas a local sole trader will be valued off a yield of 9.0 per cent. Vacant units will also be allocated a yield based on the likelihood of re-letting the space. 
The average nominal yield applied to the investment portfolio was 7.7 per cent for the year ended 28th February 2014 (28th February 2013: 7.9 per cent).
Assets totalling £9,452,000 were acquired in February 2014 and are carried at cost.
£42,410,000 of assets had been contracted for sale as at 28th February 2014 and have therefore been valued at their sales price less costs to sell.  
These assets have been reclassified as current assets held for sale as at 28th February 2014.
Also included within Investment properties are freehold land and buildings representing investment properties under development, amounting to 
£17,272,000 (28th February 2013: £14,685,000), which have been valued by the Directors. These properties comprise buildings and landholdings for 
current or future development as investment properties. This approach has been taken because the value of these properties is dependent on a  
detailed knowledge of the planning status, the competitive position of these assets and a range of complex project development appraisals. 
Investment properties under development include £7,190,000 (28th February 2013: £7,678,000) of landholdings adjacent to retail properties within the Group’s 
portfolio, acquired for the purpose of extending the existing shopping centres. The fair value of these properties rests in the planned extensions, and is difficult to 
estimate pending confirmation of designs and planning permission, and hence has been estimated by the Directors at cost as an approximation to fair value.
£187,590,000 (28th February 2013: £198,170,000) of total Investment properties are charged as security against the Group’s borrowings. 
The following table analyses the non-financial assets carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
(i)   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This may be the agreed sales price of an asset where exchange has 
occurred after the year end date (level 1). Assets held for sale of £42,410,000 are defined as level 1 assets.
(ii)   Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly  
(that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
(iii)  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). These assets are valued by external valuers 
and Directors (level 3). An analysis of level 3 assets is provided below.

Further information relating to the Group’s Investment portfolio is set out in the Operating Review on pages 38 to 41.
The Group engages external, independent and qualified valuers to determine the fair value of Level 3 assets. The valuers liaise with the Investment T eam 
every six months, reviewing tenant information relating to covenant strength, lease period and rental terms. Valuers will also review comparable transactions 
in the market. The fair value of Level 3 assets is also determined by reviewing local sales data or, where the assets are held for the purpose of extending an 
existing retail asset, by reviewing appraisals relating to the proposed scheme.
Assets have been transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 where sales prices have been agreed prior to the year end and the sale has subsequently exchanged 
after 28th February 2014. Independent valuations have not been obtained for these assets.

Depreciation expense of £65,000 (28th February 2013: £65,000) is included within operating costs.
The surplus on revaluation of long leasehold property for the year ended 28th February 2014 is £5,000 (28th February 2013: £95,000 deficit) and has 
been credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. If the Operating property was measured using the cost model, the carrying value would be 
£856,000 (28th February 2013: £921,000). 
The Group’s Operating property has been valued at market value as at 28th February 2014 by independent professional valuers DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, 
Chartered Surveyors, on the basis of Existing Use Value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors and without any special assumptions. The values disclosed above are as stated by the valuer in its valuation report to the Directors.

Goodwill charged to profit and loss on disposal of development asset (1,030)
At 28th February 2013 and 28th February 2014 238
On 29th March 2010, the Group acquired 100.0 per cent of the issued shares in Henry Davidson Developments Limited (HDD), a property development 
company specialising in neighbourhood retail schemes. Goodwill of £1,268,000 arose as a result of HDD’s expected future profits from two specific 
developments acquired. During the year ended 28th February 2013, goodwill of £1,030,000 was charged to profit and loss following the sale of one of  
the development sites.
The remaining balance of goodwill has been tested for impairment at the reporting date. The current project appraisals are reviewed at each reporting date, 
assessing the timing of the cash flows and expected future profit associated with the project. 
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) identified according to the operating segment. The recoverable amount of all CGUs  
has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved  
by management covering a period up to the completion of each project (or less than five years). The pre-tax discount rate used was 11.0 per cent.  
No provision for impairment was considered necessary. No reasonable change in any assumption would give rise to a material impairment.

Development loans to joint operations include a number of working capital and project-specific loans of £8,115,000 (28th February 2013: £7,121,000) to 
Northpoint Developments Limited (formerly CTP Securities Limited). The loans attract fixed coupon rates of between 5.0 and 13.0 per cent. Included in the 
above amount is an interest-free loan of £208,000 (28th February 2013: £208,000).
In 2010, the Group provided a £5,000,000 loan to the Curzon Park Limited joint venture in order to repay a share of its bank debt. The joint venture partner 
provided the equivalent amount. In October 2012, the Group, along with our joint venture partner, agreed a three-year repayment schedule in respect of the 
loan facility secured against the 10.5 acre site in Birmingham. £6,900,000 of the loan has been repaid at the balance sheet date of which the Group’s share 
is 50.0 per cent. T o date, £2,300,000 of instalments paid by the Group has been included as an expense in the results of the joint venture. A further 
instalment of £1,150,000 was paid in November 2013. Following further review, the Group considers that this amount will be recovered from Curzon Park 
Limited, either through the compulsory sale of land or on development of the residual land retained. As at 28th February 2014, the development loan to 
Curzon Park is £6,150,000 (28th February 2013: £5,000,000). The Directors will review the position at each debt repayment date to determine whether the 
instalments are recoverable from Curzon Park Limited in the future or whether they should be expensed in the period in which they are paid. 
  Annual Report 2014 117
The Group has two funding agreements totalling £5,262,000 (28th February 2013: £7,042,000), in respect of projects in partnership. The loans attract

Interest rate swaps, caps and collars (451) (1,404)
Derivative financial instruments (2,195) (3,221)
At 28th February 2014, the Group held one cross-currency interest rate swap designated as a hedge of expected future cash flows arising from 
€47,000,000 variable rate loan notes issued in September 2007. The cross-currency swap is used to hedge the EURIBOR interest rate exposure to a fixed 
rate of 7.97 per cent and Euro currency exposure from the loan notes fixed at a rate of €1.43:£1. The terms of the derivative have been negotiated to match 
the terms of the loan notes.
The cash flow hedge of the expected future loan note cash flows was assessed to be 100.0 per cent effective. The mark-to-market movement in the foreign 
currency leg of the swap of £1,725,000 gain (28th February 2013: £1,133,000 loss) has been recycled through profit or loss to offset the re-translation of 
the €47,000,000 loan. The mark-to-market movement on the interest leg of this swap of £1,798,000 gain (28th February 2013: £1,024,000 loss) is 
included within the net unrealised gain/(loss) reserve in equity. This cash flow hedge was cancelled in March 2014 following the renegotiation of the loan 
notes.
At 28th February 2014, the Group held interest rate swaps, caps and collars designated as economic hedges and not qualifying as effective hedges under 
IAS 39. The derivatives are used to mitigate the Group’s interest rate exposure to variable rate loans of £59,230,000 (28th February 2013: £51,983,000). 
The fair value of the derivatives amounting to £451,000 is recorded as a financial liability at 28th February 2014 (28th February 2013: £1,404,000 liability) 
with the fair value loss taken to finance costs.
Fair value estimation
From 1st January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value,  
which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(i)  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
(ii)   Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly  
(that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
(iii)  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). Discounted cash flows are used  
to determine fair values of these instruments.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:

d) Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and foreign 
currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The nature and extent of the Group’s financial risks, and the Directors’ approach to managing those risks, are described in the Financial Review on pages 42 
to 48 and below. This note provides further detailed information on these risks.
The Group defines capital as total equity and monitors this on the basis of gearing.

Interest on financial instruments classified as variable rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed 
rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group that are not included above are non-interest 
bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not undertake significant trade overseas, however during the year the Group acquired two assets denominated in Euros. The Board reviews 
the exposure to foreign exchange risk and does not consider the value of these assets to be material to the Group. 
As at 28th February 2014, the Group was exposed to foreign currency risk from €47,000,000 (28th February 2013: €47,000,000) loan notes issued during 
2007 that were denominated in Euros. A cash collateral deposit of €6,939,000 (28th February 2013: €6,939,000) was held as security against the loan notes.
The Group entered into a currency and interest rate swap with a banking institution to minimise the potential risk. The swap was cash collateralised and 
qualified to be accounted for as a cash flow hedge as detailed below. The fair value of this instrument at 28th February 2014 was a liability of £1,744,000 
(28th February 2013: £1,817,000 liability).
The Group maintained a security deposit of £4,000,000 (28th February 2013: £4,000,000) throughout the loan note term. The security deposit was 
required to cash collateralise the risk for the swap counterparty.
On 31st March 2014, the Group renegotiated the loan notes, cancelled the cross-currency interest rate swap and the cash collateral was released. On the 
same date £47,000,000 of new loan notes were issued and the Group has entered into a new cross-currency arrangement. No cash collateral is required 
under the terms of the new loan notes.

During the year to 28th February 2014, the movement of Sterling against the Euro was approximately 5.7 per cent. Management, however, consider 
8.0 per cent to be a prudent measure of sensitivity on this basis.

The Group does not undertake significant foreign exchange trading activity; consequently, a detailed foreign exchange sensitivity analysis is not presented. 
Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity in respect of variable rate debt obligations to a change in interest rates, with other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s profit before income tax. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed-rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost as well as variable rate financial instruments. 
Fair value interest rate hedging instruments that are part of a hedging relationship have been excluded. Variable rate non-derivative financial instruments 
where the associated interest has been capitalised have also been excluded.
As at 28th February 2014, a movement of 50 basis points higher or lower, with all other variables held constant, would have the following effect on profit 
before tax. Management consider a movement of 50 basis points to be a reasonable guide to sensitivity in the current interest rate environment.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Except as detailed below, in respect of fixed rate debenture and loan facilities, the Directors consider the carrying amount to be either fair value or a 
reasonable approximation of fair value apart from equity instruments classified as available-for-sale assets under IAS 39, where fair value cannot be 
reliably measured.
Fixed rate debt
A valuation was carried out as at 28th February 2014 by J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to calculate the market value of the Group’s fixed rate debt on 
a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between fixed interest rates for the Group’s borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest 
rate of appropriate debt instruments. Whilst the replacement basis provides a consistent method for valuation of fixed rate debt, such financing facilities are 
in place to provide continuing funding for the Group’s activities. The valuation is therefore only an indication of a notional effect on the net asset value of the 
Group as at 28th February 2014, and may be subject to daily fluctuations in line with money market movements. 
J C Rathbone Associates Limited have consented to the use of their name in the financial statements.
The fair value compared to the carrying amounts of the Group’s fixed rate financial liabilities as at 28th February 2014 and 28th February 2013 is 
analysed below:

The fair value difference of £11,049,000 at 28th February 2014 (28th February 2013: £17,525,000) represents approximately 11.7 per cent of gross, 
fixed rate borrowings (28th February 2013: 18.2 per cent). The effect on net assets per share after tax of this adjustment would be a decrease of 6.9 pence 
after tax (28th February 2013: 10.9 pence decrease).

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances 
net. Deferred income tax assets arising from the Group’s trading and capital losses are recognised on the basis that there will be sufficient profits in the 
foreseeable future to utilise such losses. The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets of £5,047,000 (28th February 2013: £5,968,000) in 
respect of losses amounting to £25,223,000 (28th February 2013: £25,950,000) that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances) are shown above.

20 Share capital continued
The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main 
assumptions of the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows:
Grant date 24.10.1 1
Exercise price (pence) 152.0
Term (years) 3
Expected volatility 41%
Expected dividend yield p.a. 3.2%
Risk-free rate 0.9%
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Development Securities PLC share price over multiple time periods. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan
The terms of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83.
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the Performance Share Plan are valued at their fair value on the date of the award, using an Equal Probability 
Model, which takes into account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total shareholder return 
ranking as determined under the performance condition.
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:

  Annual Report 2014 131
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members  
of Development Securities PLC
Report on the Parent company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent company’s affairs as  
at 28th February 2014;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder  
of this report.
What we have audited
The Parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’),  
which are prepared by Development Securities PLC, comprise:
• the Company Balance Sheet as at 28th February 2014; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
 In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have made  
a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made 
assumptions and considered future events.
 Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have 
been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes  
to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations 
received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out 
on page 65, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
 Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
 This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Development Securities PLC for the year ended 28th February 2014.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 28th February 2014
29 Accounting policies 
a) Basis of accounting 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable laws, United Kingdom accounting standards, on a going concern 
basis and under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies 
adopted are consistent with the previous year and are set out below. 
The Company has not presented its own Profit and Loss account, as 
permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the 
year was £19,927,000 (28th February 2013: £10,756,000 loss). 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a  
Cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph  
2D of FRS 29, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and has not disclosed 
information required by that standard, as the Group’s Consolidated financial 
statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures 
for the Group under IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
The financial statements were approved by the Directors for issue on 
30th April 2014. 
b) Investments 
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 
are accounted for in the financial statements at cost less any provision 
for impairment. 
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
c) Operating leases 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis 
to the profit and loss account over the lease term even if the payments are 
not made on such a basis. 
d) Tangible assets 
T angible assets are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the 
asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the 
cost less estimated residual value of such assets over their expected useful 
lives on a straight-line basis. The principal annual rates used for this purpose 
are as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings and computer equipment – 10% to 33%
Motor vehicles  – 20% 
e) Trading property
Trading property is carried as inventory and stated at the lower of cost  
and estimated net realisable value. Cost also includes directly attributable 
expenditure. No element of overhead is included in cost, since it is not 
practical to identify overhead amounts in respect of particular assets.  
Where Directors consider that the costs are not recoverable from the 
proposed scheme, the project or site is written down to its net realisable 
value, with the write-down taken to the profit and loss account. Net 
realisable value is calculated as the estimated realisable value of the project 
or site, based upon our current plans, less all further costs to be incurred in 
making the sale.
f) Provisions for liabilities 
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount 
can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected  
to be required to settle the obligation. The accretion in the discount is 
recognised as an interest expense. 
g) Taxation 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any 
adjustment in respect of previous periods. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of 
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences or unutilised tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to  
items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the 
profit and loss account. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

h) Pension schemes 
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme on behalf of the 
Development Securities PLC Group. The charge to the profit and loss in  
the year represents the actual amount payable to the scheme in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. 
i) Foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into UK 
Sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated at the rates ruling at that date. Exchange movements are dealt 
with in the Profit and Loss account. 
j) Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of share-based compensation plans,  
the majority of which are cash-settled, under which the entity receives 
services from employees as consideration for cash-settled instruments  
of the Company. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the option is recognised as an expense. 
The Company has used a Black-Scholes option valuation model to 
determine the fair value of share options granted. An equal probability  
model has been used to determine the fair value of share awards under  
the Performance Share Plan. The cost of cash-settled transactions with 
employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the 
vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award. In valuing cash-settled transactions, no 
account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to 
the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except  
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which  
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition  
is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is 
calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions and of the number of cash-settled share-based 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument  
subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.  
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet  
date is recognised in the Profit and Loss account, with a corresponding  
entry in accruals.

  Annual Report 2014 139
The fair value of grants is measured at the grant date using a Black-Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. The main 
assumptions of the Black-Scholes pricing model are as follows:
Grant date 24.10.1 1
Exercise price (pence) 152.0
Term (years) 3
Expected volatility 41%
Expected dividend yield p.a. 3.2%
Risk-free rate 0.9%
Expected forfeiture p.a. Nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Development Securities PLC share price over multiple time periods. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
Conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan
The terms of the Performance Share Plan are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 83.
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded under the Performance Share Plan are valued at their fair value on the date of the award, using an Equal Probability 
Model, which takes into account the probability of the Ordinary shares vesting based on an equal probability of achieving appropriate total shareholder return 
ranking as determined under the performance condition.
The principal assumptions for calculating the fair value of the Ordinary shares conditionally awarded are:
28th February 
2014
28th February 
2013
Ordinary shares conditionally awarded (no. of shares) 870,143 1,235,161
Date of award 29th May 2013 29th May 2012
Share price (pence) 192.0 132.0
Percentage probability applied for fair value 51.00% 52.00%
Vesting period (months) 32 32
The expense recognised for equity-settled share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year is £12,000 credit 
(28th February 2013: £21,000 charge). 
The charge recognised for cash-settled share-based payments during the year is £nil (28th February 2013: £nil).

ABOUT ARROW GLOBAL
A regulated business
We are a regulated business, operating to 
the highest standards with a commitment 
to treat customers fairly. 
We are regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) in the UK and by the Dutch 
Authority for the Financial Market (AFM) in 
the Netherlands, and the Financial Services 
and Markets Authority (FSMA) in Belgium. 
In Portugal, the Portuguese Securities Market 
Commission (Comissão do Mercado  
de Vualores Mobiliários (CMVM)) oversees 
our business.
We are also registered with the Lending 
Standards Board in the UK, which works with 
firms to promote fair lending practices and 
sets the benchmark for good lending practice.
A larger and diversified business 
delivering strong financial returns 
We are now a financially strong, European 
regulated business operating in six different 
geographies, with over 1,500 colleagues* and 
over 9 million customer accounts, delivering 
strong financial returns.
 *Including contractors.
Debt is a more prominent and open concern 
in both society and the wider economy 
than in previous times. Customers and clients 
are now more empowered and expect a 
personalised and bespoke debt management 
service. Companies operating in the sector 
must be more customer focused by being 
more transparent, and delivering increasingly 
innovative solutions using technology  
and data.
We are committed to making our service 
more individualised and customer focused. 
We are a data driven business and we use our 
insight from over 35 million customer 
records across six countries to offer affordable 
and manageable solutions for consumers 
to reduce their debt in a fair, transparent and 
structured way. 
We also play an active role in helping financial 
institutions deleverage and recapitalise in 
order to increase mainstream lending. By 
purchasing and managing non-performing 
loans and other core assets, we provide 
valuable capital and expertise to a growing 
European market.
By investing in our people, expertise  
and market intelligence, we gain a better 
understanding of our customers as 
individuals and we continually improve the 
service we offer, helping them to build 
better financial futures. 
In 2016, we helped approximately 
600,000 people clear their Arrow Global 
accounts and we aim to improve on this 
each year.
Established in 2005, Arrow Global specialises in the 
purchase, collection and servicing of non-performing loans. 
We identify, acquire and manage secured and unsecured 
defaulted loan portfolios from financial institutions, such 
as banks and credit card companies, as well as retail 
chains, student loans, motor credit, telecommunication 
firms and utility companies.
2013 – 2015: 
>  In January 2013, we successfully raised  
£220 million via our debut public  
bond offering
>  In October 2013, we listed on the London 
Stock Exchange

in-house collections capabilities. The 
acquisition was funded via a €225 million 
public bond offering
Our history 
In the 11 years since our founding,  
we have achieved strong and  
sustained growth. 
In 2013, we successfully completed  
an initial public offering and began 
trading on the London Stock Exchange. 
This created the platform to expand  
the Group and since then, we have  
grown considerably through a series of 
carefully considered acquisitions and 
portfolio purchases.

first investment in the French market, taking

OUR PURPOSE, AIM, 
STRATEGY AND VALUES
Purpose – building better 
financial futures
We are proud of the role Arrow Global plays 
in building better financial futures for our 
stakeholders – colleagues, customers, clients, 
shareholders and the communities in  
which we work.
Our people play a key role: our people 
provide the essential talent and energy to 
fulfil our purpose and aim. We rely on our 
people to consistently ‘do the right thing’ 
in order to drive great customer service 
and deliver the most appropriate  
customer outcomes.
Our staff share in the Company’s success 
through share options/purchase schemes, 
while our pay and rewards are linked strongly 
to the Company’s performance as well as 
the quality of the service they deliver to our 
customers and clients, meaning their 
financial futures are aligned to ours and 
that of our other stakeholders.
Our customers benefit from this: we know 
that our future is aligned with the prospects 
and rehabilitation of our customers. We are 
acutely aware that we need to work in 
partnership with those struggling with debt, 
helping them repay their debts in a timely 
and affordable way. 
We are constantly looking for ways to 
improve what we do and how we do it. This 
benefits not only those customers who have 
a real desire to reach an agreement to repay 
what they owe, but for us as a business, as 
timely and affordable repayments provide 
us with long-term income. 
In doing the right thing for these 
customers, we can give them confidence and 
control over their finances, allowing them 
to build a better financial future.
Building better financial 
futures for our stakeholders
Our clients put their trust in us: by passing 
the debt on to us, our clients are able to 
focus on their core activity of mainstream 
lending, safe in the knowledge their 
customers are in good hands.
In doing so, they reduce their risk 
exposure, release provisions, and 
strengthen their capital ratios, which helps 
them to build a better financial future for 
their stakeholders.
Our shareholders share in our success: 
we aim to deliver strong returns to our 
shareholders over the medium-term. The 
financial performance we produce is  
built on carefully planned growth that is 
consistent and underpinned with strong, 
stable funding.
We invest in the communities where  
we work: we believe in working with our 
communities at all times, playing our part  
as a positive influence by supporting local 
charities and initiatives.
We have a clear strategy to support 
charities that focuses on financial 
education and financial support, and we 
work closely with the Citizens Advice 
Bureau (CAB) and a range of debt charities, 
including StepChange.
In the UK, we undertook a major 
research project – Debt Britain – to further 
enhance our knowledge of customers in 
unmanageable debt. This helps shape our 
understanding and desire to use this 
information to help build better financial 
futures, giving customers more confidence 
and clarity around their finances. You can 
read more about Debt Britain on page 48.

Arrow Global values 
Underpinning all we do is the desire to live 
and deliver the our values.
Although our European markets  
have different cultural, and regulatory and 
economic environments, we believe 
passionately in operating as one team.  
That is why we have introduced a common 
set of values. This allows us to actively  
seek and share best practice and draw on 
the expertise across our business. 
The values guide our behaviours  
and how we do business. They provide  
a framework for colleagues to work  
to, ensuring we always do the right thing.
We succeed together – taking ownership 
and ensuring a positive outcome for both 
our customers and our business. We do  
this by being collaborative and supporting 
each other, wherever we work or reside. 
We do the right thing – we keep our 
promises. We help customers repay their 
debts in a timely and affordable way. We  
do this by empathising with our customers 
and treating them fairly. 
We’re trusted and valued – we earn trust 
from our customers by treating them as 
individuals. We learn and change based on 
what our customers tell us. We take our 
corporate responsibilities seriously, and act 
as an example to all in our industry. 
We’re brave and creative – we thrive on 
positivity, flexibility and challenge. We share 
ideas and have the courage to lead – we  
are not afraid to do things differently. We use 
our insight to lead change and innovation. 
Only by collectively doing things the ‘ Arrow 
Group Way’ will we focus on doing the right 
thing for our customers, which, in turn, will 
help us build a sustainable, profitable and 
customer-focused business. 
Our five strategic  
priorities are:
To be a leading player in our chosen 
markets: we work with both primary 
financial institutions and leading credit funds 
to expand and grow our business.
To build a diversified risk weighted 
investment portfolio: we are transforming 
our business by broadening our activities 
across different geographies, asset classes 
and businesses. By diversifying our activities 
and risk, we will deliver dependable financial 
results and pay regular dividends.
To transform the customer journey 
within our industry: we want to meet our 
customers’ needs by offering fair and reliable 
solutions to help them repay their debts  
by delivering great customer outcomes.
To be the best operator in our markets:
we have made a number of acquisitions and 
continued to strengthen our loan portfolios 
through carefully considered purchases. 
Each of these deals highlights our desire to 
do business with the best operators, and 
working with the best people, technology 
and data.
To attract and retain the best talent:
we attract and retain talented and 
committed people, who in turn win our 
customers’ trust through the service  
they provide.
Our aim – to be Europe’s 
leading purchaser  
and manager of debt 
We believe that by putting the interests of 
our customers at the heart of our business, 
we can also best serve the interests of our 
clients, our own business and people, our 
shareholders and society at large. 
We do this by ensuring our strategic 
priorities are firmly aligned to delivering 
against our aim. In October 2016, we 
updated our strategic thinking to reflect the 
size of Arrow Global and the markets we 
operate in.
 “With a long standing 
relationship with Arrow 
Global, we have observed 
(and evidenced) a strong 
data and analytical focus 
dovetailed with a robust 
conduct framework to  
help deliver appropriate 
customer outcomes. ”

 “We have transformed the business on 
multiple fronts; driven our strategic 
priorities to grow our European presence 
and our asset management business;

every market in which we operate.”
Jonathan Bloomer
Chairman
2 March 2017 Overview
Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 11
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
As I reflect on 2016, I am 
pleased by the progress  
that Arrow Global has made. 
The Group continues to 
maintain a focused  
strategy, designed to help 
achieve our aim of being 
Europe’s leading purchaser 
and manager of debt.  
The result has been another 
excellent year. We have 
delivered a strong financial 
performance, increased  
our dividend and enhanced 
shareholder value.
Evolving our strategy
We continue to implement our strategy of 
building leading positions in our chosen 
European markets, but have evolved this to 
include the growth of our asset management 
business and operating platforms. We  
place significant emphasis on operational 
excellence through having outstanding 
people, technology and data, improving the 
customer journey and ensuring we attract 
and retain the best talent, all underpinned 
with a balanced capital structure. You  
can read more about how we are delivering 
against our strategy on page 24.
A transformative year
In 2016, we further diversified our business by 
geography, asset class and revenue stream. 
The balance of our investments reflects our 
expanded geographical group. During the 
year, 28% of our investment in purchased 
loan portfolios and loan notes was in the 
UK, 43% in Portugal and 29% in Benelux. 
We also completed the acquisitions of 
InVesting B.V. (‘Vesting’) in the Netherlands 
and Belgium and agreed the proposed 
acquisition of Zenith Service S.p.A. (‘Zenith’) 
in Italy. These transactions, coupled with the 
acquisition of the servicing capabilities and 
co-investment in the RNHB Hypotheekbank 
loan book, have seen us enhance our 
European mainland capabilities significantly. 
We continue to demonstrate our proven 
track record of securing long-term funding 
from a diverse investor base. Between  
July and September, we made significant 
progress against our debt funding objectives 
to ensure we have a strong financial base  
to grow our business. We secured a material 
reduction in our cost of debt, whilst also 
extending the average term of our debt 
facilities through the successful refinancing 
of our £220 million bond and our  
£180 million revolving credit facility.
In August, we received authorisation 
from the UK Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). This was an important milestone 
following the transfer of our industry 
regulation from the Office of Fair Trading  
to the FCA. It confirms our commitment  
to high operating standards and treating 
customers fairly. 
In July, we were registered with the 
Lending Standards Board (LSB). The LSB 
works with registered firms to promote fair 
lending practices and sets the benchmark 
for good lending practice in the UK.  Overview
Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 12
Lee Rochford and Tom Drury
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
Group governance
From 2017, the Group will operate on a 
country basis with country chief executive 
officers and local leadership teams 
responsible for profit and loss, with central 
Group functions responsible for setting 
strategy, origination, capital allocation and 
treasury, maintaining the risk framework, 
monitoring performance and facilitating 
best practice.
This structure better suits a European 
group operating in multiple geographies 
with different regulatory regimes and a mix 
of international and local clients.
The board
2016 saw a significant change following 
Tom Drury’s decision to step down as Group 
chief executive officer after five extremely 
successful years with Arrow.
Tom has made an outstanding 
contribution to Arrow since he joined the 
Group as chief executive officer in 2011.  
He led the successful IPO in 2013 and has 
overseen a series of strategic acquisitions, 
which have seen Arrow grow to become  
one of Europe’s leading purchasers and 
managers of debt, alongside driving a 
significant increase in shareholder value. 
On behalf of the board, I would like to 
thank Tom for his contribution to Arrow 
and wish him well for the future. 
Lee Rochford, formerly chief financial 
officer of Virgin Money, replaced Tom as 
Group chief executive officer and executive 
director from 3 January 2017 . Lee brings a 
tremendous breadth and depth of experience 
across all of our asset classes and an 
extensive track record in financial services. 
I am confident that he is the right person  
to lead the Group through the next stage  
of its growth. 
A number of other changes also took place: 
We welcomed Maria Luís Albuquerque 
as non-executive director in March and have 
benefitted from her European banking  
and Portuguese experience. 
In October, Robin Phipps stepped down 
from the board having completed a 
three-year term and leaves with the board’s 
gratitude for his contribution to the success 
of the Company.
To replace Robin, we welcomed  
Andrew Fisher as a non-executive director 
in December 2016. Andrew is currently  
the finance director of FTSE 100 Provident 
Financial Plc and his broad international 
financial services experience will complement 
the existing skills and competencies on  
the board and be invaluable to the Group. 
I believe the board has the calibre,  
skills and judgment to support the Group 
in its strategic ambitions. Overview
Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 13
A progressive dividend policy
The solid foundations we have laid for the 
Group have seen us prosper and as such,  
we have proposed a final dividend of 6.4p, 
bringing the full-year dividend to 9.1p 
(2015: 7.1p), which is a significant uplift of 
28.7% on 2015. 
Looking forward
We are pleased with the growth we  
have achieved and the progress made in 
transforming the Group in 2016. 
We are well positioned for 2017. Our 
business model, strategy and strong financial 
profile give us the flexibility to continue  
to deliver for shareholders in the face of the 
changing economic and competitive 
environment. As a board, we have assessed 
the viability of the business over a three-
year period. Based on this assessment, we 
believe we are very well placed to make  
the most of the opportunities that exist and 
we can look to the future with confidence.
I would like to thank my fellow board 
members, the senior leadership team and 
all colleagues for their contribution to 
everything we have achieved together  
in 2016.
Embedding the behaviours that  
underpin our culture
In 2016, we developed an important 
programme defining the set of values that 
underpins our culture. We are embedding 
these values and behaviours in each of the 
countries we operate. Although our 
European markets have different cultural, 
regulatory and economic conditions,  
we believe passionately in operating as one 
team. We have more to do, but it is a great 
example of the collaborative and inclusive 
leadership of our senior team as they 
embrace this challenge. 
As the Group has expanded, we have 
refreshed our thinking on our purpose and 
the role we play in building better financial 
futures for our stakeholders. We are acutely 
aware that at the heart of our business is 
the need to work in partnership with those 
struggling with debt, helping them repay 
their debts in a timely and affordable way. 
Only by focusing on doing the right thing 
for all our stakeholders can we build a 
sustainable, profitable and customer-focused 
business (you can read more about

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER REVIEW
I am delighted to have  
been appointed as Group 
chief executive officer. 
In every part of the  
Group, I have been 
impressed and inspired  
by my colleagues and  
the work that they  
do for our customers  
and clients. I would  
like to thank them for  
their contribution  
to the delivery of an  
outstanding year.
I am excited by the 
prospect of leading the 
next phase of Arrow’s 
growth, building on the 
Group’s momentum,  
high growth prospects,  
our operational and 
financial excellence and  
the strong financial  
returns we can deliver  
as we continue to expand  
in our chosen markets.
2016 review
We have expanded our European footprint 
and client offering across attractive markets 
where the Group is targeting leadership 
positions. This coupled with a high quality 
and diversified investment portfolio  
has enabled us to deliver another strong 
financial performance. 
A strong financial performance
Total revenue grew 42.6% to £235.9 million 
driven by core collections 30.9% higher  
at £286.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA was up 
36.7% to £209.2 million. We continue to  
see an increase in the income from asset 
management, with revenues now constituting 
20% of total revenues. The growth of these 
results was partially as a result of the Vesting 
acquisition in May 2016.
Our diversification across geographies 
and asset classes enabled us to deliver a 
strong increase in underlying profit after tax, 
up 28.7% to £45.6 million (2015: £35.4 million), 
and underlying return on equity (ROE)  
now stands at 29.1%. Due to post tax 
non-recurring items of £19.3 million, arising 
from restructuring the Group’s long-term 
financing and acquisition costs, profit after 
tax decreased to £26.3 million (2015:  
£31.7 million).
Our underlying basic EPS has increased 
28.5% to 26.1p (2015: 20.3p). The strong cash 
result for the year is pleasing and allows us  
to continue to deliver good returns to our 
shareholders while allowing for future 
investment and growth. As such, the full-year 
dividend for 2016, including the proposed 
final dividend of 6.4p, will increase to 9 .1p, up 
28.7% and represents a 35% payout ratio. 
A more detailed commentary can be 
found in the Group chief financial officer’s 
review on pages 34 to 39, including 
reconciliations between IFRS, cash metrics 
and underlying results. Definitions of 
frequently used terms can be found in  
the glossary.
A landmark year for the Group
2016 was a year of many important 
milestones for the Group. 
We made a number of acquisitions  
and continued to add to our loan portfolios 
through carefully considered purchases. 
Building from our strong UK base, we have 
made material progress in expanding  
our capabilities and the range of services we 
offer to financial institutions in all of our 
markets. In addition to the UK, we now have 
leading positions in the Netherlands and 
Portugal, with a presence in France, and 
from 2017 , on completion of the Zenith 
acquisition, we will enter the Italian market. Overview
Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 16
Acquisitions in the Netherlands and Italy
During 2016, we acquired a market leading 
business in the Netherlands.
In May, we completed the acquisition  
of Vesting, which has operations in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. Our relationship 
with Vesting commenced in 2015, when 
they started servicing portfolios on our 
behalf. As we got to know the management 
team and came to respect their collections 
capabilities, including the benefits of 
access to the Focum credit bureau, it was  
a natural progression to purchase the 
business outright. 
In September, we strengthened our 
Dutch offering with a transformative deal. 
We acquired the servicing capabilities  
of RNHB Hypotheekbank and co-invested, 
alongside a credit fund, in loan portfolios 
with a face value of approximately €1.7 billion; 
resulting in an investment in loan notes of 
£21.3 million. The loan book comprises 9 ,300 
high quality real estate loans, with an 
average loan-to-value of 66%. It builds on 
the secured asset expertise and real estate 
capabilities of our Portuguese business, and 
offers an attractive model for future deals. 
For some time we have been evaluating 
the Italian market, which has the highest 
non-performing loan volumes in Europe 
along with a strong securitisation and 
structured finance market. We were 
delighted to mark our entry into Italy by 
agreeing terms to acquire Zenith, a leading 
master servicing business that has an 
excellent reputation for securitisation and 
structuring services. The transaction is 
subject to regulatory approval by the Bank 
of Italy, and we expect this to complete  
in the first half of 2017 . On completion, it will 
offer us a strong and established client  
base of leading Italian and international 
banks and funds, increase the weighting of 
asset management revenues across the 
Group, and provide a valuable insight into 
the Italian market and the performance  
and administration of credit portfolios. We 
consider Zenith to be a low-risk business, 
with stable revenues, and is a sensible entry 
into the Italian market.
Record year for investment and 
strengthened funding
2016 was a record year for investment.  
We acquired purchased loan portfolios and 
loan notes with a face value of £2.2 billion 
for a purchase price of £258.4 million. Of this, 
£223 million related to the purchase of 
organic portfolios and £35.4 million for the 
Vesting back book. Of the purchase price 
invested, 52% related to secured portfolios.
During the year, we also took the 
opportunity to strengthen and secure our 
long-term funding. In July, we refinanced 
our revolving credit facility reducing the cost 
by 100bp and extending its term to July 2021. 
In September, we successfully refinanced 
our £220 million bond, securing a coupon 
reduction of 275bp. Our average debt facility 
term is now just under six years and our 
average cost of debt is now less than 5%.
Reshaping our earnings
Our market entry strategy has been to target 
leading operating platforms in countries 
that meet our criteria. 
Our increased diversification, by both 
geography and asset class, provides a good 
platform to diversify our earnings as we 
balance our strength in debt purchase with 
that of asset management. 
Asset management is attractive as it is 
capital-light and helps us grow both earnings 
and return on equity (ROE) through 
long-term contracted revenues. Our ability 
to provide servicing on behalf of third parties 
has strengthened our partnership with 
credit funds, which has become a key part 
of our origination strategy.
Over time, we want to increase the 
percentage of our Group revenues derived 
from asset management. We made good 
progress in 2016, ending the year with asset 
management constituting 20% of total 
revenues, and we expect this to strengthen 
further in 2017 to approximately 25%.
Arrow now services 9.3 million customer 
accounts. The access we have to historic 
credit performance data in the markets in 
which we operate, provides us with 
significant insight into customer behaviours. 
This, in addition to a number of Group-
wide initiatives, such as a new servicing 
platform in the Netherlands and our  
UK digital portal, will enable us to improve 
customer engagement.
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER REVIEW Overview
Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 17
Our people
As Arrow has expanded, we have welcomed 
new colleagues. Our philosophy is to attract 
and retain the best talent. In 2016, we added 
considerably to our expertise across the 
Group. We now have over 1,500 colleagues, 
and it is their hard work, combined with a 
strong Group culture, that will continue to 
drive our success. 
As a result of our continued expansion we 
introduced a new management structure 
during the year. In addition to creating a small 
Group function that will have oversight for 
the whole Group, we appointed new country 
chief executive officers. Phil Marsland was 
appointed in the UK, Joost van Rens in the 
Netherlands and Belgium and John Calvão  
in Portugal. John will take responsibility for 
Italy on completion of the Zenith 
acquisition and will be replaced in Portugal 
by João Bugalho, who is currently the CEO 
of Whitestar in Portugal. 
From 2017 , responsibility for each country 
profit or loss will sit with each country  
chief executive officer and their senior 
management teams, which will ensure that 
we maintain strong local ownership and 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
Outlook
Economic and market conditions
With stricter capital adequacy requirements 
and continued regulatory and government 
requirements, European banks have a 
continuing need to divest non-performing 
and non-core credit portfolios. In doing  
so, banks can lower their costs, release 
capital and focus on their core business. 
This generates opportunities for Arrow to 
purchase and manage portfolios and 
increase our asset management business. 
This will be a strong driver for growth 
across the markets in which we operate.
Looking ahead, consensus forecasts  
are for UK and European interest rates to 
remain low with a continuation of low,  
but steady economic growth in European 
economies. As such, whilst we are by no 
means complacent, it is reasonable to expect 
a small improvement in consumer and 
business confidence with a corresponding 
increase in lending. 
Regulation and compliance
We think the regulatory oversight in our 
European markets will continue to evolve. 
In the UK, FCA regulation has required 
investment across the industry in improved 
risk, governance and compliance 
frameworks. We believe that this will favour 
businesses such as Arrow that have scale, 
strong funding and a focus on the right 
customer outcomes. Arrow received its full 
FCA authorisation in August 2016. 
We are constantly evaluating and evolving 
risk and compliance activities across the 
entire Group, regardless of geography, and 
wherever possible, share best practice. 
Our clients are increasingly looking for 
respected partners, who meet all regulatory 
requirements and who have a strong track 
record of doing the right thing for customers. 
Our status as a regulated business in all  
of our markets and our strong purpose and 
social responsibility, means that we are well 
positioned to continue to take advantage of 
the opportunities that this presents.
Hilversum, Netherlands Overview
Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 18
Pricing and competition
We maintain a positive outlook in each of 
our markets where supply has grown in 
recent years and all the indicators suggest 
that this trend will continue, especially in 
financial services. 
While competition is evident across  
all markets, our ability to secure off-market 
purchases coupled with a disciplined 
approach to investment, and in particular, 
to diversification, by both asset class and 
geography, means we are well placed to 
continue to grow our business profitably.
We have begun to see portfolios coming 
to market earlier in the cycle and we expect 
this trend to continue as financial institutions 
continue to adopt changes arising from 
new accountancy standards, such as IFRS 9.
UK economy and Brexit
In the UK, we have used our deep insight 
into customer payment behaviour under 
macro-economic stress to simulate  
the potential impacts of any downturn in 
macro-economic factors, due to Brexit  
or otherwise. 
During the year, we asked Jaywing 
Consulting to review and challenge our 
analysis. The analysis considered the impact 
on our forecast Estimated Remaining 
Collections (ERC) of the following drivers:
>  Breakage rates: the proportion of  
customers paying over time
>  Payment values: the proportional growth  
in arrangement value 
>  Cumulative settlement rate: the  
cumulative proportion of customers 
making a one-off settlement
>  Settlement liquidation rate: the  
proportion of current balances made as  
a settlement 
The analysis showed that, whilst increases  
in payment values observed in non-
recessionary times are suppressed, the other 
three metrics did not exhibit significant 
shocks within the last recession.
The UK’s EU referendum on 23 June 2016 
created additional concerns for part of  
the UK financial services industry. However, 
these are not expected to impact our  
ability to operate and purchase portfolios in 
Europe, since we are licensed in our own 
right in each of our chosen markets and, as 
such, are not reliant on the UK’s continuing 
membership of the EU.
Summary
We will continue to enhance our position as 
a leading partner to primary lenders and 
credit funds, where our relationships support 
both additional portfolio purchases and  
the growth in asset management revenues.
We start 2017 with a strong origination 
pipeline. We expect to complete the 
purchase of Zenith in the first half of the year, 
following which, we intend gradually to 
expand our Italian operations further. 
We are a well-funded business with a 
strong financial profile, which will support 
our growth opportunities.
We are confident in maintaining portfolio 
investments at approximately twice our 
average annual replacement rate. This, 
combined with the value we can add from 
our expanded Group, supports continued 
earnings growth in 2017 .
We are improving our Group capabilities 
to support the added complexity of a  
more diversified business and to continue 
to support its growth in a disciplined and 
safe way. This includes embedding our Group 
risk framework, investing in improving 
systems and processes across the Group and 
developing our capital allocation and 
portfolio management capabilities. In the 
short-term, this will lead to some additional 
cost, but will help drive sustainable earnings 
growth into the future.
We remain confident of our ability  
to deliver a medium-term underlying ROE 
percentage in the mid-twenties, high-teen 
EPS growth and a progressive dividend policy.

Market overview
The UK has one of the most mature debt 
purchase and collection markets in Europe, 
characterised by a relatively high propensity 
of financial institutions to sell non-performing 
debt. This is driven by a large and well 
established consumer finance sector that 
continues to grow due to healthy volumes  
of new lending. Total unsecured consumer 
non-performing loans of approximately  
£32 billion are still estimated to be held by 
financial institutions. 
The regulatory environment has 
continued to tighten and a number of banks 
have sought to rationalise their panels, 
both for debt purchase and debt placement. 
Increasing compliance costs for servicers, 
together with decreasing funding costs, 
data driven benefits and efficiencies derived 
from investment in operational excellence 
have all favoured larger established players 
such as Arrow Global. Brand, reputation 
and track record are all critical considerations 
for financial institutions considering an 
outright sale of a portfolio or the choice of 
a servicing partner, given reputational risk  
is to an extent retained.
Outlook
We expect the supply of debt sale volumes 
across unsecured and secured markets  
to remain strong. The secured retail debt 
sale market has grown significantly in  
recent years, driven primarily by asset  
sales by a number of large financial 
institutions. This asset class is forecast to 
remain strong and offers an opportunity  
for further diversification and growth to the 
UK business.
Whilst the competitive environment  
will remain challenging, we have a healthy 
pipeline entering into 2017 . Through the 
operational improvements, we continue to 
implement, and through the strength of 
our client relationships, we believe that we 
can be competitive in both on and off 
market opportunities.

Market overview
The Portuguese banking system continues 
to deleverage in a challenging operating 
environment. Banks remain liquid, but 
cost-cutting measures have not offset the 
drag on profitability from low interest 
margins and weak asset quality. The 
deleveraging has helped banks to reduce 
risk-weighted assets and associated  
capital requirements, but repairing their 
financial position remains incomplete.  
The stock of legacy assets continues to 
weigh on the banking system, with 
provisions being insufficient to fully cover 
non-performing loans. 
At the end of 2016, Portugal’s private sector 
continues to be heavily indebted both  
in household and corporate debt, which as  
a percentage of GDP stands at around 
78% and 143% respectively.
This market context remains favourable 
for our business. The European Banking 
Authority estimates that as at Q2 2016 
non-performing loans in Portugal totalled 
around €40 billion.
Outlook
In line with other European markets, the 
Bank of Portugal is maintaining pressure  
on banks to reduce the volume of non-
performing loans and non-core assets, 
while the Portuguese Government is also 
implementing reforms in order to force 
banks to resolve non-performing loans. 
In 2017 , we expect the continuation of 
significant debt portfolio sales as the banks 
look to further delever. We are well placed 
to support these divestments given our 
structuring, due diligence and servicing skills 
combined with strong relationships with 
financial institutions and credit funds. 
We expect an increase in the number  
of transactions of SME/corporate portfolios, 
alongside a steady flow of individual 
residential and unsecured books.

Market overview
Dutch financial institutions hold 
approximately €26 billion of non-performing 
loans outstanding, which generates  
in the region of €2.7 billion of sales value 
each year.
The largest five banks hold up to 90%  
of non-performing loans and we believe that 
the book value of these stands at 57%  
of gross value. Financial services dominate 
non-performing loans, but telecoms, 
utilities and consumer loans are also being 
sold in the Dutch market.
While non-performing loans sales 
historically have been less common than  
in other geographies, this is increasing  
and the Group is well placed to acquire  
these due to our long-standing banking 
relationships and the Vesting platform. 
Outlook
As with most European markets, the 
pressure on structural reform from both 
government and regulators is increasing  
and Dutch banks will need to deleverage.
We expect compliance requirements for 
those who participate in the market to 
increase. In the UK, we have seen panel sizes 
reduce as a result of this. This provides an 
opportunity for well run and highly compliant 
businesses such as Arrow Global to take 
advantage of this as the non-performing loan 
market continues to accelerate from its 
current take-off phase.

The Italian banking market continues 
to experience challenges surrounding 
asset quality, capital adequacy and 
profitability. In July 2016, the European 
Banking Authority stress test results 
highlighted Italy’s banking problems and 
recent events have confirmed the overall 
fragility of the system.
The Italian servicing market is continuing to 
experience solid growth, which is attributable 
to portfolio sales as well as an increasing 
number of financial institutions outsourcing 
their bad loans management. 
According to PwC its expectation for 
2017 is that there are around €50 billion  
of transactions that may come to market 
via securitisations.
In December, we agreed terms to  
purchase Zenith, a master servicer, focused 
on the Italian structured finance market. 
The acquisition is expected to complete  
in the first half of 2017 .
Zenith has developed a reputation for 
quality and service in a complex, regulated 
market with €14.9 billion assets under 
management across multiple asset classes. 
It has a strong and established client base  
of leading Italian and international banks and

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
We use the same core 
competences to generate 
value in our business in  
one of two ways:
1.  We buy debt at a discount from its face value and use  
our expertise in data, analytics, collections, and asset 
resolution (where relevant) to help establish affordable 
repayment plans and settlements with our customers.  
We expect to collect approximately twice our investment  
over a period of 10 years.
2.  We advise on and manage debt portfolios on behalf of  
others and charge a fee for this service.

Market potential
PwC predicts that European banks need to 
divest €2.3 trillion of non-performing loans 
and non-core assets. Within the markets 
where we operate, we estimate there is more 
than €50 billion face value of debt sales 
each year.
European banks are heavily reliant on 
deposit funding across Europe, where its 
banks utilise around €45 trillion in deposits 
compared to around €16 trillion USA banks 
fund in a similar way. Against this backdrop 
and the 2008 financial crisis, with increased 
regulation and associated capital adequacy 
requirements, such as the Asset Quality 
Review (AQR), and accounting changes, such 
as IFRS 9, European banks are being asked 
to increase equity. 
With European bank return on capital (ROE) 
at relatively low levels, this creates structural 
challenges for financial institutions, as it is 
difficult to raise new equity from investors. 
As a result, European banks are choosing  
to restructure or, in some instances through 
regulatory and government pressure, being 
forced to restructure. 
Generally, the favoured option is to 
deleverage by releasing large pools of 
non-core and non-performing assets to be 
sold, creating long-term opportunities for 
Arrow Global.
Looking ahead, we see  
four distinct areas where 
our business model and 
how we operate provides  
a compelling competitive 
position. These are:
1. High growth
2. Operational excellence 
3. Financial excellence
4. Strong returns Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 29
Strategic report
We have consistently increased the annual 
level of organic portfolio investment, with 
£223 million deployed in 2016. Given the size 
of the market potential, we feel confident  
in deploying around twice our replacement 
rate annually over the medium-term.
Arrow’s strong origination franchise 
provides long-term opportunities
With circa 110 client relationships, we are  
a leading partner to support financial 
institutions to move assets to a mix of credit 
funds, securitisations, and our own 
statement of financial position.
In the geographies where we operate, 
we have market leading platforms, which 
underpin our ability to offer tailored solutions, 
such as debt purchase, asset management 
and consortium structures. This makes Arrow 
Global relevant in helping the banks divest 
across asset classes and transaction types.
For larger transactions, we typically 
participate in consortium structures where 
we will work with credit funds, co-invest  
in the portfolio, and asset manage the full 
portfolio on behalf of the consortium.  
This helps improve our returns from the 
portfolio purchase. Given the long lifespan 
of the assets, we will often purchase the tail 
of the asset from the credit fund as a 
secondary purchase. In 2016, we deployed 
£223 million plus Vesting back book portfolio 
purchase of £35.4 million resulting in  
total purchases of £258.4 million in organic 
portfolio purchases, 39 .2% was in consortium 
transactions, with a further £483.7 million 
deployed by our partners.
The assets that we acquire have a long 
life, providing significant visibility of future 
servicing opportunities, buying 
opportunities, cash flows and pipeline.
We have key relationships in all the 
countries we operate, offering opportunities 
to secure ‘off-market’ trades, as well as 
competing strongly in competitive auctions.

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION 
CREATES VALUE
This strengthening of our market position 
provides greater opportunities for the 
Group to evaluate transactions, enabling  
us to deploy increasing levels of capital 
whilst maintaining investment discipline. 
This ensures investments continue to 
achieve target returns. The table above 
shows we are evaluating more transactions, 
but choosing to bid a lower percentage, 
whilst maintaining a broadly consistent  
win ratio.
As part of our origination strategy, we have 
been growing our asset management 
capability. This re-balances our income from 
purely debt purchases to include more 
capital-light servicing and asset management 
revenue. We have grown asset management 
revenues from 9% in 2015 to 20% of Group 
revenue in 2016. In 2017 , we expect to grow 
the revenues from servicing and asset 
management to approximately 25% of the 
Group’s total revenue. 
This provides us with the flexibility of 
where we deploy our investment capital, 
and gives us the option to partner with 
credit funds, which in turn, helps us spread 
and diversify risk and drive profit.
An attractive mix of business and 
diversification improves earnings
We operate across an increasing and 
diversified range of geographies and are 
not tied to the fortunes of any one  
country. We hold portfolios in multiple 
asset classes, but within each country  
we invest in different asset classes that  
are suited to the local market. In some 
markets, we will focus on unsecured debt, 
while in others we have invested in  
secured real estate and securitised assets.

Operational excellence
Expertise in data and analytics
From our creation in 2005, we constructed 
our own proprietary data repository which 
now has tens of millions of records. The 
richness of the data assets we hold informs 
our investment decisions, our collections 
strategies and also the best treatment for 
our customers. 
As we have expanded our business, we 
have acquired additional historic data on 
credit performance in different European 
markets. The intelligent analysis of this 
combined data means we have significant 
insights into customer behaviours, which 
help us deliver better customer outcomes.
We continue to evolve our data assets 
and models to improve our understanding 
of our customers’ individual circumstances. 
This, combined with an efficient operation, 
allows us to pay a fair price for a portfolio 
whilst still maintaining good returns.
In the UK, the number of records in  
our Proprietary Collection Bureau (PCB),  
our unique data matching tool designed in 
conjunction with Experian, has grown to 
23.8 million (2015: 22.5 million). For a typical 
UK financial services portfolio, we are able 
to match approximately 44% of records. We 
therefore know or already have a relationship 
with this proportion of the portfolio.
PCB now works alongside other elements 
of a wider data warehouse developed after 
our acquisition of Capquest. All of this feeds 
into our operational IT platform.
In the Netherlands, in addition to the 
historic performance data acquired with the 
Vesting back book, we now own Focum, a 
credit bureau that holds more than 10.5 million 
records. We see further potential to leverage 
these data sets across our operation.
Track record of underwriting discipline
We operate a well-defined underwriting 
and investment process and have a robust 
governance structure in place, helping  
to ensure that we acquire portfolios in line 
with our target returns and risk 
management framework.
We have developed a number of 
proprietary underwriting models that 
leverage our data assets. These models 
forecast cash flow at an individual account 
level based upon certain attributes. Due  
to the significant portfolio assets we hold, 
and the data systems at our disposal,  
when we assess a portfolio through statistical 
modelling, we are able to identify and 
match a large percentage of its customers. 
This allows us to price more accurately  
and supports us in treating customers fairly 
when we look to collect on the portfolio.
Cumulatively we have collected 103% of 
our pre-purchase underwriting forecast (2015: 
102%), demonstrating our overall accuracy.
Following the acquisition of a portfolio, 
we monitor performance to ensure that 
deviations in performance are understood. 
Models are developed or updated to 
ensure we continually learn from under  
or over performance.
Continual improvement in  
the customer journey
We work with our customers, leading debt 
charities, industry bodies and third party 
research agencies to help us understand our 
customers’ needs. We aim to establish 
long-term affordable repayment plans, which 
help our customers’ rehabilitate their credit 
listing and gain access to more affordable 
mainstream financial products. 
Through our data models, we are able  
to build consolidated customer profiles  
that reflect customers’ current circumstances 
and invest in leading customer service 
platforms to ensure that all our customers 
get the best service. In the UK, our 
collections colleagues are rewarded based 
on the customer outcomes they achieve, 
rather than the amount they collect. 
2016 saw further development of our 
digital capability. Following the launch of our 
UK digital customer portal in October, there 
was a significant increase in the number of 
customers choosing to interact online and 
we saw a 60% increase in online payments.
In the UK, our new fully integrated 
customer service platform gives us greater 
flexibility to work across multiple asset 
classes, performing and non-performing 
loans. This allows us to develop a true 
single customer view and assist in making 
more informed collections decisions. Every 
collections colleague receives specialist 
training in handling vulnerable customers 
and all collection staff regularly undertake 
refresher courses.  Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 32

 F i nan c i al e x c e l l e n c e
Estimated remaining collections (ERC) 
provides long-term cash flow visibility
We quote 84-month and 120-month ERC 
forecasts as key metrics for the business, 
however our cash flow analysis extends 
beyond 10 years. As at 31 December 2016, the 
84-month ERC increased to £1.3 billion  
and 120-month ERC to £1.5 billion. The 
statement of financial position carrying value 
for purchased loan portfolios and loan 
notes is supported by the rolling 84-month 
ERC, which we consider to be prudent. Each 
year we roll the ERC forward to include the 
additional year of collections, as our expected 
cash flows extend beyond 84-months.
The ERC is forecast at an individual 
account level and is updated twice a year  
to reflect actual and expected collections 
performance. The Portfolio Review 
Committee (PRC) meets regularly to review 
and challenge the latest forecast and 
judgments. The PRC reports to the audit 
committee twice a year.
The ERC is underpinned by approximately 
600,000 customer accounts that have paid 
the Group in the last three months. These 
accounts have a current face value of  
£1.7 billion, meaning the Group has 1.3 times 
coverage of the ERC from existing customers.
The ERC provides significant cash flow 
visibility. For example, 75% of collections  
in 2016 came from portfolios we owned on 
1 January 2016.
In order to maintain our ERC we need to 
invest at our replacement rate (maintenance 
capex). We consider this when we evaluate 
our cash result for the year, see page 39.
Asset management creates  
capital-light revenues
By developing our servicing and asset 
management proposition as part of our 
origination strategy, we have increased  
the level of capital-light revenues and cash 
flows (see illustrative economics on  
page 26).
Our asset management contracts are 
long-term in nature, averaging approximately 
five years in term. The revenues we generate 
are typically fee income, based upon 
collections performance of similar assets to 
those that we own in the ERC. These assets, 
therefore, have similar long-term collection 
forecasts that support earnings visibility. 
We have grown asset management 
revenues from 9% in 2015 to 20% of Group 
revenue in 2016. In 2017, we expect to  
grow the revenues from servicing and asset 
management to approximately 25% of the 
Group’s total revenue. 
Balanced capital structure with  
reducing cost of capital
Our statement of financial position is robust, 
and reflects our commitment to maintaining 
a strong financial profile together with the 
increasingly diverse asset base we now hold. 
We are funded largely at a Group level. 
Our debt funding sources are diverse, 
ensuring that we are not overly reliant on 
one funding source and that we will be able 
to support our growing business. 
Our debt funding facilities are a mix of 
listed bonds and bank facilities. Our  
£180 million revolving credit facility provides 
statement of financial position liquidity. 
The bonds are a mix of fixed and floating 
rate with maturity dates ranging from 
November 2021 to September 2024, whilst 
the revolving credit facility matures in July 
2021. The bonds are denominated in a mixture 
of Sterling and Euro and our revolving credit 
facility can be drawn in either currency.
Our financial policy is based upon the 
following metrics:
>  L e v er ag e: Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 
between 3.5-4 times, actual 3.9 times
>  Loan to value: Secured Net debt/84m ERC: 
60%, actual 57 .0%
>  Cash cover: Adjusted EBITDA/Cash interest: 
>4 times, actual 5.2 times
The track record that the business established 
through growth and diversification whilst 
maintaining ratios within our financial policy, 
has supported improvements in our cost  
of capital and our credit rating. During 2016, 
we refinanced our revolving credit facility 
and our sterling bond, reducing the cost of 
these facilities by 100bp and 275bp 
respectively. In addition, the Group’s credit 
rating was upgraded to BB- by Standard and 
Poor’s. In February 2017 , the Group’s credit 
rating was upgraded to Ba3 by Moody’s, and 
the Group’s RCF was increased to £215 million. 
The combination of these diverse 
funding sources results in long-term debt 
facilities with an average maturity of 
around six years, and a total cost of funding 
of just under 5%.  Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 33

Strong returns 
Our leading origination franchise 
operating in growth markets combined 
with the areas of excellence outlined 
above have enabled us to deliver strong 
returns that we believe are sustainable. 
We continue to exceed our key  
financial targets:
>  High teen underlying basic EPS  
growth: 2016: 28.5%
>  Mid twenties underlying ROE: 2016: 29.1%
In addition, the strong cash result (see page 
39) driven by the portfolio returns, increase 
in asset management revenues and a 
reduction of our cost of capital enables the 
business to pay an increasing dividend to 
shareholders alongside investing in growth. 
Our full-year dividend, including the 
proposed final dividend of 6.4p, of 9.1p has 
grown from 7 .1p in 2015 (28.7%).

GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL  
OFFICER REVIEW
I am pleased to present  
a strong set of results for 
2016. They demonstrate  
the excellent progress we 
have made to develop the 
business, deliver strong 
returns, lay the foundation 
for future growth and 
enhance shareholder value. 
Important note:
Both IFRS and cash metrics are important  
to understand the key drivers of the business. 
The reconciliations and commentary on 
the following pages have been prepared to 
aid this understanding, which helps to 
support the commentary of the financial 
review for the year.
Underlying profit after tax increased
Underlying profit after tax for the Group for 
2016 has risen 28.7% to £45.6 million from 
£35.4 million in 2015. The growth in earnings 
has been driven by increasing investment 
in our portfolio asset base with strong 
collections performance from the UK and the 
Netherlands back books. The corporate 
acquisitions made by the Group in Portugal 
and the Netherlands in 2016 have helped 
grow our capital-light asset management 
revenue to 20%, with the aim of increasing 
this to 25% of total revenues in 2017 .
The 2016 profit after tax of £26.3 million 
(2015: £31.7 million) includes £5.0 million of 
acquisition costs and £18.0 million associated 
with restructuring the Group’s long-term 
financing. The saving in interest costs as a 
result of the refinancing will be beneficial to 
the Group’s income statement in future years. 
The refinancing extended the maturity of 
our facilities, ensuring the financial position 
is sufficiently well structured to support 
and fund the continued growth plans for 
the Group.
Strong returns and progressive dividend
The underlying return on equity (ROE)  
for the Group in 2016 is 29.1%, up from 26.5% 
last year, and well above our target of  
 ‘mid-20s underlying ROE’. This metric is a 
key driver of shareholder value. 
Basic EPS for 2016 is 15.1p compared to 
18.2p in 2015, with the reduction largely due 
to the non-recurring items. Underlying 
basic EPS has increased 28.5% to 26.1p (2015: 
20.3p). The Group has established a 
progressive dividend policy. The strong cash 
result for the year, supported by the growth 
in the asset management business, enables 
good returns to be made to our shareholders 
whilst allowing for future investment and 
growth. As such, the full-year dividend, 
including the proposed final dividend of 6.4p, 
for 2016 will increase to 9.1p, up 28.7% and 
represents a 35% payout of underlying profit 
after tax. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 36
Strategic report
Record year for portfolio purchases 
Our purchased loan portfolio asset base 
and loan notes increased by 37.2% to  
£804.1 million (2015: £586.3 million), which 
will help to support the future flow of 
collections and revenue streams. 
This was driven by a record year for 
organic portfolio purchases of £223.0 million, 
up from £176.3 million in 2015, plus the 
portfolios acquired as part of the acquisition 
of Vesting, generated a corresponding 
increase in the ERC. The face value of debt 
portfolios acquired in the year was  
£2,200 million, with an average purchase 
price of 11.7p per £1. For the year to  
31 December 2016, the 120-month expected 
gross money multiple for this vintage is  
1.94 times (84-month: 1.78 times) from the 
date of purchase. This is slightly below our 
2.0 times target given the higher proportion 
of secured portfolios within the vintage.  
Of the purchase price invested 52% related 
to secured portfolios. There was a good 
balance of investment by geography.
In the year, the Group acquired debt 
portfolios (including those through 
acquisitions) significantly in excess of the 
required replacement rate (the amount  
of annual investment required to keep the 
ERC constant). This higher level of acquired 
portfolios will increase future collections. 
This is reflected in the increased value of the 
ERC (84-months) from £1,028.6 million to 
£1,339.1 million, an increase of 30.2%. As 
described on page 38, it is the collections 
performance and size of the ERC which 
drives income recognised on loan portfolios.
All portfolios continue to be monitored 
carefully and where appropriate adjusted for 
in the ERC forecast based upon our detailed 
modelling. Although it has increased in total, 
the ERC has been adjusted down for our 
expectation of credit balances and a historic 
claim on one of the Portuguese portfolios.
Core collections increased
Core collections increased to £286.0 million 
(2015: £218.5 million) coming from over  
7.7 million individual payments (2015:  
7 .5 million), reflecting the increase in our 
portfolio asset base. Collections were ahead 
of our ERC forecast and reflect a higher 
proportion of collections coming from 
recently acquired portfolios and the impact 
of collection strategy initiatives, such as 
litigation, the digital customer portal and 
the increased use of data sources. 
Collections on UK books in particular 
have performed strongly in the year and  
the performance on the acquired Dutch 
portfolios has also been pleasing. Collections 
on our Portuguese portfolios have 
performed behind our expectations, largely 
due to delays in the migration of accounts 
from a third party servicer to in-house, and 
processing delays with the courts. We 
expect performance in Portugal to improve 
in 2017 . 
As at 31 December 2016, we have 
cumulatively collected 103% of our original 
underwriting forecast (2015: 102%), excluding 
foreign exchange impacts, reflecting  
the success of our data driven approach  
to underwriting. 
Revenues and EBITDA increased
Total revenue for the year was £235. 9 million, 
an increase of 42.6% from the 2015 
comparative of £165.5 million. £38. 9 million 
reflected the increase in purchased loan 
portfolios and loan notes and £31.6 million 
was from asset management services.  
The latter was due to a full period of results 
for Whitestar and the acquisition of Vesting 
in May 2016. 
The increase in collections drove an 
increase in Adjusted EBITDA of 36.7% to 
£209.2 million (2015: £153.1 million). The 
reconciliation of IFRS profit after tax to the 
cash result, including a reconciliation to 
Adjusted EBITDA, is provided in the IFRS to 
cash result reconciliations starting on  
page 38. Adjusted EBITDA is a key driver of 
the cash result and allows us to monitor the 
operating performance of the Group.
Total income from asset management  
in 2016 was 20% of total revenue, and  
we expect this to increase to approximately 
25% in 2017 .
Reflective of the enlarged business, 
collection costs increased by 34.3% to  
£70.3 million (2015: £52.3 million). During the 
year, we completed the rationalisation of 
our UK panel and the associated migration 
of the accounts to our in-house operation, 
delivering the full benefit of the Capquest 
acquisition synergies.

Strategic report
Profit after tax
Profit after tax decreased from £31.7 million 
in 2015 to £26.3 million for the year, as we 
saw the impact of the non-recurring items 
offsetting the growth in underlying profit 
after tax. We saw positive results of  
£2.4 million from our 15% economic interest 
in French market leader, MCS. During the 
final quarter of 2016, we received a distribution 
of €8 million (£6.8 million), which will impact 
our share of profits from 2017 onwards.
Non-recurring items of £18.0 million arose 
on refinancing the £220 million fixed rate 
note and the Group’s RCF, and £5.0 million 
arose on the strategic corporate acquisitions 
of Vesting and Redrock that completed  
in the year and the agreed acquisition of 
Zenith. These items are considered due  
to their size and nature to be outside of the 
normal operating activities of the Group. 
These items had a tax impact of £3.8 million. 
The cash impact of the financing and 
operating expenses for these non-recurring 
items in the year was £13.7 million.
The tax charge for 2016 represents an 
effective tax rate of 16.1% (2015: 19 .2%) on 
profit before tax. The movement is mostly 
due to utilisation of historic trading losses 
being recognised and profits from associate 
already net of tax, offset by disallowable 
acquisition costs and a higher level of 
overseas taxable income at higher tax rates.
Net assets, funding and net debt
Net assets increased £22.0 million during 
the period, mostly reflecting the retained  
profit for the period of £26.3 million, 
foreign currency translation of £6.0 million 
and share-based payment movements of  
£3.2 million, offset by the final 2015 approved 
dividend and 2016 interim dividend paid 
totalling £14.1 million. The main driver of the 
translation movements was the significant 
movements in the Euro exchange rate from 
1.35 at 31 December 2015 to 1.17 at  
31 December 2016.
Net debt increased by £227.4 million  
to £816.0 million (2015: £588.6 million),  
driven by the acquisitions of Vesting and 
Redrock, organic portfolio purchases and 
foreign exchange. 
The Group is committed to maintain its 
strong financial profile and aims to maintain 
the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
between 3.5x-4.0x, achieving 3.9x compared 
to 3.8x in 2015. Similarly, cash interest cover 
was 5.2x, comfortably ahead of target at 
greater than 4.0x, and ahead of 2015’s 4.9x.
The ratio of net debt to 84-month  
ERC (LTV) was 60.8% as at 31 December 2016 
(2015: 57 .2%), which is significantly below 
our financial covenant of 75%. The secured 
LTV ratio as at 31 December 2016, was  
57 .0% (2015: 51.8%).
In July 2016, we refinanced our  
£180 million RCF, provided by four banks. 
The new facility has a margin of 275bp,  
a reduction of 100bps from the previous 
facility. The commitment fee has also been 
reduced by 54bps. The new facility has an 
extended maturity of 31 July 2021. 
As a reflection of our ability to continue 
to expand our franchise whilst maintaining 
our key credit ratios, on 1 August 2016 S&P 
upgraded the Group’s credit rating to BB- 
from B+ and the Group’s Notes credit rating 
from BB- to BB.
On 1 September 2016, we refinanced our 
£220 million fixed rate note, reducing the 
cost by 275bps and increasing its term to 
eight years, resulting in a decrease in the 
Group’s overall cost of debt to just under 
5% and an increase in the average debt 
facility maturity to six years.
In February 2017, Moody’s upgraded the 
Group’s credit rating and Notes rating to 
Ba3 from B1. In addition, the Group increased 
its RCF by £35 million to £215 million, adding 
a fifth bank.
Summary
Group performance was strong for the year. 
This was seen through the growth of the 
asset management business, expansion of 
our geographical footprint and a material 
reduction in our cost of capital and 
extended funding maturity.
We have a Group financial control 
framework across all geographies, which 
we will further embed during 2017 to 
ensure a continued consistent approach  
in the application of our accounting 
controls and policies. This is being further 
supported by investment in IT and finance 
systems during 2017 .

IFRS TO CASH RESULT 
RECONCILIATIONS
Introduction
We provide two reconciliations between IFRS 
and cash measures. The first looks at the 
movement in our purchased loan portfolios 
and loan notes compared to the movements 
in the ERC, the gross cash value of the 
portfolio before it is discounted to present 
value for inclusion in the IFRS results. The 
second reconciles the IFRS profit after tax for 
the year to the cash result. For completeness 
we also separate out non-recurring items. 
Our core competence is using data to 
identify, manage and collect non-performing 
purchased loan portfolios and loan notes. 
We use this competence to drive two key 
revenue streams, debt purchase, where we 
acquire the portfolio, and asset management, 
where we manage the portfolio, but do not 
take capital risk. 
Models illustrating the economics of 
debt purchase and asset management can 
be seen on page 26. The way in which  
the business recognises revenue on each of 
these business streams differs substantially.
Debt purchase
For the debt purchase part of the business, 
we acquire portfolios and loan notes and turn 
these into regular, predictable and long-
term cash flows; this involves high volumes 
of low value collections from customers. 
We use analytical models to estimate 
cash flows we expect at an individual 
account level. The output of these account 
level forecasts is aggregated to a portfolio, 
and then into the Group’s total ERC. 
The price paid for the portfolio, 
collections experience and our ERC drive 
portfolio income. 
When we purchase loan portfolios  
and loan notes, we recognise them in the 
statement of financial position at the 
purchase price in accordance with IFRS. In 
terms of the equivalent cash measure we 
add the portfolio ERC to the Group ERC at 
the point of purchase. We quote both 
84-month and 120-month ERC forecasts as 
key performance measures for the business.
We are required to calculate the effective 
interest rate (EIR). This is the discount  
rate which would allow the estimated future 
cash flows to be discounted to the day one 
purchase price of the portfolio. This rate is 
used to calculate the amount of revenue  
we recognise each period. The EIR rate is fixed 
shortly after the point of purchase. The EIR  
is used to allocate the collections received 
between a repayment of our original 
purchase price, this is accounted for as a 
reduction in the loan balance (amortisation) 
and the balance of the collection as interest 
income (which is accounted for as revenue 
from purchased loan portfolios). This is  
akin to the way in which a mortgage would 
pay down.
The ERC extends beyond 15 years; 
however, we only include 84 months of cash 
flow in assessing our purchased loan 
portfolio and loan note assets. As we progress 
through the months of each year, we  
roll forward the ERC forecast, meaning we 
always have 84 months of expected cash 
flow from our portfolios recognised on the 
statement of financial position.
Due to the nature of our business, actual 
collections on portfolios and loan notes  
will not perform exactly as initially forecast, 
and each half year we review performance 
against collections experience and update 
the ERC forecast where appropriate. This 
updated cash flow forecast, discounted at 
the fixed discount rate (EIR) is the period 
end carrying value of the purchased loan 
portfolios and loan notes. This movement  
of the purchased loan portfolios and loan 
notes is reflected in income from loan 
portfolios in the income statement. The size 
of the portfolio asset, associated ERC and 
cash collections in the year are therefore all 
key drivers to the IFRS result we report.
As we collect on our portfolios and loan 
notes, the statement of financial position 
value, ERC and income we receive decreases 
over time. 
The ERC forecast to 84-months or 
120-months from date of purchase divided 
by the purchase price is the Gross Money 
Multiple (GMM) that we expect to achieve 
from that investment. The GMM is an 
important measure to understand the gross 
cash return on our investment. The GMM, 
therefore, is a measure of portfolio asset 
quality and is one of the metrics we evaluate 
when we appraise a portfolio. In 2016,  
we purchased portfolios and loan notes for 
£258.4 million, which with an 84-month 
GMM of 1.78 times added £459.4 million to 
ERC and a 120-month GMM of 1.94 times 
added £501.6 million to ERC. 
Based upon our target returns that we 
expect to invest at, we are able to calculate  
a replacement rate, or maintenance capex, 
being the amount we need to invest to 
replace the reducing portfolios and to keep 
the Group’s total portfolio value constant. 
During a period, if we invest higher than 
the replacement rate at target returns, the 
revenue from debt purchase grows. The 
replacement rate is a key driver to the cash 
result the business generates.
Asset management
As part of our strategy to diversify the 
business, the Group has also strengthened 
its capabilities in servicing and asset 
management to complement the strength 
it has in debt purchase. Asset management 
revenue is driven by commissions  
received, largely based on collections,  
plus fee income. 
Asset management revenue does not 
require significant capital investment and 
therefore the development of this business 
is important to improving both the IFRS  
and cash result for the business. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 39

Portfolios (including loan notes) acquired in the year are added to the statement of financial position carrying value of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes at their initial purchase price. 
The undiscounted forecast of estimated remaining collections is included in the ERC.

Income on purchased loan portfolios and loan notes is calculated with reference to the effective interest rate (EIR) of the portfolio. This income is recognised after taking account of new 
portfolios and loan notes, collections, updated ERC forecast, disposals and any FX impacts. See 6 for more detail on total revenue.

The ERC roll forward and reforecast reflects management’s updated estimation of future collections. It takes account of updated information on specific portfolios and loan notes, the latest 
exchange rate (forecasts) and rolls forward the 84-month forecast collection period.
 5 
Under IFRS, the carrying value of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes includes 84-months of discounted cash flows. We expect to see cash flows beyond this period of time and report a 
120-month ERC also, as is customary for the industry.

Total revenue is largely derived from income from purchased loan portfolios and loan notes as explained in 3, plus income from asset management being commission on collections for 
third parties and fee income received. The non-cash items add back loan portfolio amortisation to get to core collections. Amortisation reflects a reduction in the statement of financial

The sum of these balances is the Adjusted EBITDA for the business of £209,247 ,000, which is a key driver to the cash result. This measure allows us to monitor the operating performance of 
the Group. See the glossary for a detailed reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
Sound risk management  
is at the centre of our 
day-to-day activities.  
It benefits our business by 
ensuring balanced growth 
and stability of earnings 
while also protecting  
the sustainability of our  
future prospects.
Delivering our strategic priorities relies on 
the successful identification, assessment, 
management and reporting of risk. We focus 
on the top risks that impact our business, 
and also monitor emerging risks that might 
affect us in the future. 
We operate an Enterprise-Wide Risk 
Management Framework. The overall 
framework is underpinned by our Risk 
Appetite Statements and a suite of policies. 
Risk is governed by the board, executive 
management and various risk committees. 
The Group has a formal three lines of 
defence model, with internal audit 
performed by a combination of Deloitte LLP 
and our own Internal Audit functions in our 
European subsidiaries.
Our principal risks are categorised as 
strategic, conduct, operational and financial. 
The disclosures should not be regarded  
as a comprehensive list of all the risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group, but rather 
provide a summary of some of the key areas 
that could have the biggest impact.
Strategic risk
The risk to earnings arising from changes 
in the business environment and from 
adverse business decisions, improper 
implementation of decisions or lack  
of responsiveness to changes in the 
business environment.
The Group’s growth strategy is primarily 
based on the future purchase and collection 
of distressed loan portfolios, including as  
a servicer for third parties. 
Changes in the competitive, economic, 
political (including Brexit) or regulatory 
environment in the UK or Eurozone could 
impact our ability to collect from portfolios, 
or competitively purchase and invest in line 
with our company objectives e.g. as a  
result of consolidation within the sector.
Negative attention and news regarding 
the debt collection industry and/or the 
Group’s collections activity may impact our 
reputation and therefore the Group’s  
ability to acquire portfolios and customers’ 
willingness to repay the debt that the 
Group acquires.
Key mitigating actions
Management monitor the economic, 
political and regulatory environments in 
which we operate to influence future 
strategy. In addition, appropriate currency 
liquidity management and scenario 
planning is in place. 
Strong relationships have been 
developed with our creditor client base and 
investment funds in order to mitigate the 
risk of reduced debt purchase opportunities 
in the market. The board regularly carries 
out reviews of the markets and strategy and 
reputational impacts are managed through 
our governance activities and by operating in 
accordance with all regulatory requirements 
and jurisdictional industry best practice. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 41
Strategic report
Financial risk includes
Market risk: the risk of losses in portfolios 
due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
and the level of interest rates.
Funding and liquidity risk: the risk that 
the Group is unable to meet its obligations 
as they fall due.
Credit risk: the risk to earnings or capital 
arising when a customer or counter 
party defaults on its contractual obligations, 
including failure to perform obligations  
in a timely manner.
Tax risk: tax compliance risks arise  
from the complex nature of tax legislation 
and practice.
Investment risk: the risk of returns adverse 
to forecast as a result of inadequate 
portfolio purchase analysis and consequent 
mispricing therefore affecting ERC.
Key mitigating actions
The Group’s overarching financial risk 
management strategy is governed by a 
robust policy framework and is overseen by 
the treasury and tax committee, which is  
a delegated committee from the board and 
executive risk committees. 
The Group aims to mitigate foreign 
exchange risk (a market risk) by matching 
foreign currency assets with foreign currency 
liabilities. The Group manages remaining 
exposures to foreign exchange at a Group 
level principally through the use of forward 
contracts. Interest rate risk is managed 
principally using interest rate swaps.
Funding and liquidity risk is managed 
through matching the maturity of our 
funding facilities with the maturity of our 
assets; forecasting funding requirements 
and applying appropriate stress testing, and 
ensuring that we maintain a balanced 
maturity profile of debt facilities. We are 
highly cash generative and aim to maintain 
a flexible cost base. Portfolio investment  
is largely discretionary and this provides  
us with a large degree of control over  
working capital.
Counterparty credit risk is managed 
through regular monitoring of the quality 
of new and existing counterparties and  
of our exposure to each. Counterparty risk 
with debt sellers is also mitigated through 
warranties. Credit risk is principally taken on 
through the purchase of customer debt 
and overseen on a country basis. 
Tax risk is addressed through the use of  
tax specialists who advise the Group on its 
tax compliance obligations, application  
of tax legislation, and the transactions and 
activities undertaken by the Group.
Investment risk is managed through 
rigorous due diligence and controls to 
consider risks (including operational risks) 
and accurately price new investment 
opportunities. These include executive 
review through an investment ‘gate’ process 
and in certain circumstances board approval 
prior to purchase execution. Portfolio 
performance is regularly monitored by senior 
management and the board.
 “The partnership we have 
developed with Arrow  
over the years is valued 
highly at Vanquis. Arrow’s 
innovative style coupled  
to their deep foundation of 
decision science gives us 
great confidence that our 
customers are supported 
through the most challenging 
period of the debt cycle. ”
James Appleby
Vanquis Bank Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 42
Strategic report
Operational risk
The risk of loss resulting from inadequate 
or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events, including 
those relating to legal issues and IT 
security weaknesses.
Failure to comply with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements through failed 
internal processes could result in the 
suspension or termination of our ability  
to conduct business, and could lead  
to regulatory censure and financial loss. 
The Group relies on IT systems for 
customer and data management and data 
analytics. Should these systems experience 
performance issues or outage through, for 
example, cyber attack, our customers would 
be impacted, and we could experience 
financial loss.
There is also a risk of data quality and 
documentation deficiencies in purchased 
portfolios that require remediation 
post-purchase. The effectiveness of this 
remediation activity potentially affects  
the enforceability of debt, our future 
collections and credit risk or the quality  
of customer outcomes.
We choose in the UK to outsource the 
management of some customer accounts 
to third party partners who collect on our 
behalf. We are also dependent upon third 
party firms with whom customers engage  
to manage their debt or insolvency.  
Should these third parties experience 
sustained business interruption, be subject 
to takeover by an unfriendly competitor  
or fraudulent activity, or fail to maintain 
regulatory authorisation, we could suffer 
financial loss and/or potential detriment  
to customers.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
Key mitigating actions
Operational risk is managed in line with our 
operational risk policy, which sets out the 
framework and processes for managing this 
risk type. 
We have a quarterly Risk and Control 
Self-Assessment (RCSA) process to identify 
and assess key operational and regulatory 
risks. Key risk areas are governed by  
a suite of policies approved by the board  
or executives to ensure standards  
are appropriately set across the Group. 
We employ industry specialists to 
monitor the latest regulations and update 
our internal policies accordingly, and  
where required, we take external specialist 
advice. We also engage in regular training 
and assurance activity to ensure compliance 
with internal policies.
IT systems are regularly tested, backed up 
and managed through a set of quality  
and security policies, supported by disaster 
recovery and business continuity plans.
Due diligence is undertaken on 
prospective investment purchases to identify 
potential data quality and documentation 
weaknesses (see investment risk section 
above). Our Legal team are involved in all 
purchases and external legal advice is taken 
where required, with contractual terms  
and warranties used to provide protection 
against legacy issues.
In the UK, we have ongoing oversight  
of our partner network, including 
consideration of their business continuity 
arrangements. We monitor industry 
consolidation activity and have a diversified 
panel to ensure that we are not reliant on 
any particular third party servicer.
 “Since Capquest has merged 
with Arrow I have seen lots 
of changes for the better 
and it is great to see the 
business go from strength 
to strength. Our decisions 
have an impact on real 
customers and real lives so 
it’s really important that  
we work correctly and take 
the right actions to ensure  
a good customer journey and 
to help them to help improve 
their financial well-being 
where appropriate. ”

Strategic report
Conduct risk
The risk of inappropriate strategy, 
systems, behaviour, or processes  
that leads to poor customer outcomes 
or impacts market integrity.
We operate in a highly regulated 
environment, particularly in the UK, and 
any action that leads to poor customer 
outcomes or customer detriment could 
lead to a breach of regulations, resulting  
in censure, financial loss and reputational 
damage to our brand. 
Poor customer outcomes or customer 
detriment could arise through the debt 
collection activities within our in-house 
operations or the third-party servicer 
network of collection agencies, whether 
we are collecting debt which we have 
acquired or on behalf of clients. We always 
seek to ensure we adhere to all local best 
practice collections approaches.
Key mitigating actions
Conduct risk and Treating Customers Fairly 
(TCF) are at the heart of our business.  
All employees and third parties acting on 
our behalf receive mandatory training, 
including conduct risk, handling vulnerable 
customers and complaints, relevant to the 
local market and our activities. 
We consider customer outcomes when 
developing our strategy, systems, policy and 
processes and ensure that our HR framework 
and Company values support appropriate 
customer outcomes. 
We have a rigorous oversight framework, 
focused on compliance, independent 
assurance, performance, and customer 
outcomes across both our in-house 
operations and in the UK third party ‘partner’ 
network, with a continuous programme  
of reporting and reviews. 
Governance over conduct risk is provided 
by the risk committees, principally through 
the operational risk committee in the UK 
and risk committees in each of our European 
subsidiaries. These committees provide 
oversight of the Group’s processes and 
procedures, monitoring their effectiveness 
in fulfilling regulatory obligations and the 
management of risk that may result in 
non-compliance and/or poor outcomes for 
customers. Conduct risk exposures are  
also managed and monitored against the 
board’s risk appetite.
 “MBNA and Arrow have 
been working together for 
the last 10 years. Arrow 
understand our business 
well – like us, they are 
demonstrably committed 
to putting the customer at 
the centre of everything 
they do in order to improve 
outcomes. ”

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
Supporting debt charities 
We support the activities of a number of 
debt charities. We have a place on the Citizens 
Advice Advisory Group responsible for 
developing their new Debt Management 
Service, with end-to-end free advice and 
debt management plans. We make 
significant Fairshare contributions to both 
StepChange and Payplan.
Helping our local communities
We also support Arrow charities local to 
each of our sites; such as the Christie Charity 
in Manchester, one of Europe’s largest 
cancer treatment centres. The Christie  
has benefitted from various fundraising 
events such as a charity skydive, bake sales, 
as well as colleague volunteering at the 
Salford Triathlon.
In Glasgow, we have helped the Beatson 
West of Scotland Cancer Centre through 
sport based fundraising activities such as 
charity netball to football tournaments and 
in Farnborough we have supported Creating 
Futures, a charity offering children an 
alternative to being on the streets achieved 
through youth clubs and workshops.
We also support colleagues’ contributions 
to the community by matching funds raised 
by them for our chosen charities and we 
encourage our staff to volunteer and assist 
local community organisations, both in and 
out of Company time.
Financial education
According to recent Money Advice Service 
research, fewer than half of children  
aged 7-17 receive any education on financial 
capability. We see this manifest itself through 
the challenges our customers face on a 
daily basis, therefore our role in financial 
capability education is critical to help 
address this imbalance for future generations.
Arrow Global has established a strong 
partnership with the Young Enterprise 
charity which stretches back to 2014. Since 
then we have sponsored a local Manchester 
secondary school, Oakwood Academy, 
supporting them in attaining national 
accreditation as a ‘Centre of Excellence’ for 
the provision of financial education to its 
students. Oakwood is now seen as a beacon 
of financial education and good practice  
in the local education community.
On the back of Oakwood’s resounding 
success, we are now expanding our reach 
to more young people in our local 
communities through delivery of financial 
education. This is being achieved through  
 ‘Money Matters’ designed to educate and 
inspire young people to take ownership  
of their finances.
Arrow Global colleagues delivered our 
first ever financial capability ‘Money Matters’ 
workshop in Q4 this year, a very rewarding 
experience for pupils, teachers and Arrow 
Global volunteers alike.
In Benelux, Vesting Finance is a  
sponsor of Stichting LEF, a foundation that 
strives to reduce debt problems in society 
by increasing financial awareness amongst 
young people. Similar to the ‘Money Matters’ 
workshop in the UK, LEF has developed a  
 ‘Money Management’ programme for young 
people and invite volunteers to teach 
young people in school.
In Portugal, Whitestar sponsors a 
Mozambican school, Ilocone, providing 
financial support to ensure the effective 
delivery of education programmes to 
children aged 3-6.
We plan to further develop our financial 
education programme in 2017 .
Volunteering and mentoring  
with City Year
City Year seek to address the important 
issues of academic under achievement of 
children from deprived backgrounds and the 
risk of ‘no experience, no job’ for young 
people entering the employment market.
Arrow Global began its relationship  
with City Year in 2015 as a founding partner 
to the City Year’s launch in the Greater 
Manchester area, and are a member of the 
charity’s Manchester Advisory Council. 
Arrow provides fundraising, sponsorship and 
employee volunteering support to City Year 
across a wide range of initiatives.
Arrow Global volunteers play a key  
role in the development of the City Year’s 
young people through mentoring, 
leadership development and CV/interview 
skills coaching.
Moving and making a difference
Throughout the year, our colleagues 
participate in a variety of organised charity 
events. Following the launch of our ‘Move 
and Make a Difference’ charity challenge in 
2015, colleagues have been encouraged  
to ‘donate a mile’ to one of the charities we 
support, completing a mile in any way they 
choose. The Company then makes a fixed 
donation on their behalf, or they can gain 
additional sponsorship and we will match 
the funds that they raise. 
The challenge ran throughout 2016 and 
raised £12,000 through a variety of 
activities, such as a team sled pull, rowing, 
running and cycling, and a group skydive 
over a vertical mile.

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
In 2016, we held a number of important 
industry positions:
>  the presidency of the Credit Services 
Association (CSA) for an extended third year, 
promoting better relationships with the 
FCA and Government, the debt advice sector 
and other stakeholders, to ensure they  
are made aware of the processes and high 
standards of Arrow Global and the rest of 
the membership of the CSA
>  the Chair of the Steering Committee on 
Reciprocity (SCOR), which governs the rules 
for credit data sharing in the UK, bringing 
about important new rules and safeguards 
for the use of credit data by debt buyers
>  the vice presidency of the Federation of 
European National Collection Associations 
(FENCA). Consistent FENCA involvement 
over the last four years has resulted in 
considerable lobbying success on the final 
wording of the forthcoming EU General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we 
now have the portfolio of developing 
Codes of Conduct for GDPR as it relates to 
collections, and for pan-European 
collections as a whole. These two codes, 
the first of which will be in place by May 
2018 when GDPR comes into force, will help 
provide a level playing field for the 
European consumer, clarity on the GDPR 
regulation for our industry, and may 
forestall further regulation from Brussels 
which could adversely affect Arrow Global 
and our customers. 
We hold a board position on the influential 
and newly-incorporated Money Advice 
Liaison Group, and a trusteeship of the Fairlife 
Charity, promoting fair treatment of the 
consumer across financial services.
Supporting human rights
All the Group’s current activities are  
carried out in developed countries that 
have strong legislation governing  
human rights, and Arrow Global complies 
with applicable legislation in every country 
where it operates.
Regulatory and industry engagement
During the year, Arrow Global has  
actively contributed to a wide range of 
initiatives across the collections and  
debt advice sectors.
Following the publication of our report  
 ‘Debt Britain 2016: The Big Picture’ we held an 
industry-wide round table in December, 
attended by 50 stakeholders including 
regulators, the debt advice sector, credit 
reference agencies, creditors, trade  
bodies and others. You can read more

Carbon reporting – methodology
We have followed the requirements of the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and the 
Carbon Trust conversion factors to measure 
and report greenhouse gas emissions, as 
well as the disclosure requirements in Part 7 
of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
The financial control method, which 
captures the sources that fall within our 
consolidated financial statements, has been 
used. Although we operate an outsourced 
model working with partners, these partners 
do not work exclusively for the Group and, 
therefore, it is not deemed appropriate  
to include emissions outside of the Group 
consolidated financial statements. The 
reporting period aligns to the financial 
period (i.e. the year to 31 December 2016) 
and the Group’s carbon reporting falls 
under three scopes:
CO
2
 emissions increased to 1,621.8 tonnes 
from 878.5 tonnes in the prior year. The 
increase is due to the acquisition of Vesting 
and the agreed purchase of Zenith. Whilst 
we consider our carbon emissions to still be 
relatively low, with the Group expanding 
globally, the main area we can control is 
business travel and we will continue to make 
employees aware of environmental impacts.
Work will continue on these initiatives in 
2017. We remain fully committed to raising 
standards, promoting fairer practices in  
the collection of debt by Government and 
other sectors we are active in, lobbying  
for a really effective successor to The Money 
Advice Service, and supporting better 
financial futures for children and those adults 
who, as shown by our Debt Britain report, 
are so often in need of our help and support.
Sustainability – caring for the 
environment
Due to the nature of its business activities, 
the Group’s environmental impact is 
considered minimal. An environmental 
policy is in place to increase employee 
awareness of environmental issues and 
complies with all relevant regulatory 
requirements. 
With the acquisition of Whitestar in 
Portugal, Vesting in Benelux, and the agreed 
acquisition of Zenith in Italy, the Group  
now has a truly European structure. This has 
inevitably seen an increase in international 
travel, but to reduce the impact of this and 
other travel on our carbon footprint, we 
actively encourage colleagues to increase 
the use of video and telephone 
conferencing facilities. 
In the UK, we offer colleagues a cycle to 
work scheme and, at appropriate sites, we 
have car shares and group transport schemes 
in place.
Key areas of the policy addressing  
the business’ environmental impact are  
as follows:
>  minimising paper usage and the  
purchase of recycled paper and packaging 
where possible
> energy efficient office products
> recycling office waste
> increased use of video and conference calls
We represented the credit industry on  
a subcommittee of the MOJ Civil Procedure 
Rule Committee responsible for drafting  
the pre-action protocol for debt claims 
(known as PAP). This engagement has 
resulted in significant improvements to  
the final outcome, including usage of the 
standard financial statement, and the 
dropping of the requirement to send an 
original agreement to every customer before 
legal action is commenced. The revised  
PAP is likely to come into effect late 2017.
We have lobbied Ofcom this year on 
their proposed changes to dialler usage. 
Our engagement has brought considerable 
progress for the industry, with the new 
policy statement leaving the regulations 
largely unchanged. We have liaised 
extensively with our clients to reassure them 
that the new Ofcom policy is not intended 
to affect our industry.
We have attended more than 100  
trade body events and conferences during 
2016, and we chair and speak regularly at 
non-performing loan and industry events 
and conferences throughout the year.
As a result of our CSA involvement and 
our own recent authorisation, we have a 
constructive relationship with the FCA, and 
have contributed to projects on due diligence 
for debt purchase, common misconceptions 
in CONC, CCA retained provisions, and  
the ongoing authorisation of fee-charging 
debt management firms.
We have had regular meetings with 
HMT, MAS, The Cabinet Office, MOJ, 
HMRC, DWP, HMCTS and other government 
departments, and are part of working groups 
looking at statutory breathing space, the 
future funding of debt advice, the new 
standard financial statement, and fairness 
in government debt collection. This has 
resulted in TCF and fair pro-rata payments 
from consumers being considered, often 
for the first time, in accordance with our 
belief in fair customer outcomes and 
sustainable solutions for all stakeholders. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 48
Strategic report
DEBT BRITAIN 2016
In July 2016, Arrow Global 
launched a report that 
looked into the state of 
personal indebtedness  
in the UK and of the wider 
consumer debt industry.  
 ‘Debt Britain 2016: The Big 
Picture – The Arrow Global 
Guide to Consumer Debt’ 
explores the role debt plays 
in consumers’ lives and  
the nation’s economy.
Debt is a crucial factor in today’s society. 
On one hand, it plays a vital role as a turbo 
charger of the economy. On the other hand, 
and for a variety of reasons, a proportion  
of our customers will always fall behind on 
their repayments. 
Our research showed that most 
borrowers found themselves in debt for 
unforeseeable reasons, such as illness  
(25%) and loss of job (23%). We carried out 
extensive research and analysis which 
enabled us to better understand the reasons 
why this was, and more importantly, how  
we could help.
Debt Britain 2016 explores and exposes 
the problems that over indebtedness and 
default can create, addressing the broader 
issue of the use of debt and its contribution 
to the UK economy. The report also analysed 
the macroeconomic context for defaults, 
providing a first of its kind forecast of 
consumer debt defaults.
Bringing the industry together
Having commissioned the report and 
considered its findings, we wanted to do 
more than just present it. We were  
keen to generate a wider discussion on  
the impact of debt and develop a more 
consistent approach to customer 
interaction. We also wanted to gain a  
better knowledge and understanding of 
consumers in unmanageable debt, to  
help us provide more relevant customer 
discussions and outcomes. 
In December 2016, a roundtable event  
was organised in association with CCR 
Magazine. Over 60 delegates from the 
consumer debt industry, including credit 
reference agencies, creditors, lenders,  
debt collection agencies and debt charities, 
were invited to discuss the report and how, 
together as an industry and through shared 
ownership, we could move forward. 
Discussions throughout the day ranged 
from working together as an industry, to 
ensuring a fair outcome for customers in a 
potentially difficult macro-economic 
environment, to the practical measures the 
industry could all get behind to improve 
recognition for consumers who are trying 
to secure better financial futures. 
The next steps
Looking forward to 2017, we intend to  
work with the key players across the 
consumer debt industry with the aim of 
improving the customer journey to build 
better financial futures. 
Analysis from the December discussions 
indicated that there is not one solution. 
Education, the use of industry data and 
incentives for those customers making 
regular repayments are only a few of the 
areas which all require improvement and 
investment, and we look forward to working 
with our industry colleagues on this 
important initiative. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 49

Our board
As detailed above, the board has seven 
directors comprising the Chairman, two 
executive directors and four independent 
non-executive directors, one of whom is the 
senior independent director. Biographies 
for each director can be found on pages 54 
to 55. The board regarded Jonathan Bloomer 
as independent upon his appointment. 
On 3 January 2017 , Tom Drury stepped 
down as Group chief executive officer  
and was replaced by Lee Rochford.  
Maria Luís Albuquerque and Andrew Fisher 
joined the board on 7 March and 9 December 
2016 respectively as independent non-
executive directors. Robin Phipps stepped 
down from the board on 27 October 2016 
and Lan Tu replaced Robin as chair of the 
remuneration committee. 
The board is collectively responsible  
for the long-term success of the Company, 
its strategy, values and governance. The 
work of the board in 2016 can be found on 
page 62.
Our board committees
In order to provide effective oversight and 
leadership, the board has established a 
number of board committees with particular 
responsibilities. The work of the board 
committees is discussed in their individual 
reports. The terms of reference of each of 
these committees is referred to on page 65.
Audit and risk committee
The combined audit and risk committee’s 
primary role was monitoring the integrity 
of the Group’s financial reporting and 
reviewing the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems.
The audit and risk committee was formally 
separated with effect from 25 January 2017 . 
The board, supported by the nomination 
committee, considered that, given the 
increased geographic footprint, complex 
regulatory environments and the consequent 
impact on risk exposures, it was now 
appropriate to operate separate audit and 
risk committees, as is the case in many 
other listed financial services companies. 
Chair: Iain Cornish
(throughout 2016 and to 24 January 2017)
Audit committee chair: Andrew Fisher 
(from 25 January 2017)
Risk committee chair: Iain Cornish
(from 25 January 2017)
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is 
responsible for approving remuneration 
policy and reviewing the effectiveness  
of its implementation. The committee also 
considers senior executive remuneration 
and makes recommendations to the board 
on the remuneration of executive directors. 
Chair: Lan Tu
(from 27 October 2016)
Nomination committee
The nomination committee is responsible for 
considering and making recommendations 
to the board in respect of appointments to 
the board, the board committees and  
the chairmanship of the board committees.  
It is also responsible for keeping the 
structure, size and composition of the board 
under regular review, and for making 
recommendations to the board with regard 
to any changes necessary. Furthermore, 
the nomination committee is required to 
manage the process for evaluating the 
performance of the board.
Chair: Jonathan Bloomer MBE
Disclosure committee
The disclosure committee is responsible 
for monitoring, evaluating and enhancing 
disclosure controls and procedures of the 
Group. The disclosure committee is also 
required to assist the Company and the 
Group to make timely and accurate 
disclosure of all information where 
disclosure is required to meet legal and 
regulatory obligations. 
Chair: Iain Cornish
UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year ended 31 December 
2016, the Company has complied with  
all relevant provisions of the 2014 Edition  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code,  
which sets out standards of good practice 
in relation to board leadership and 
effectiveness, remuneration, accountability 
and relations with shareholders.
Lee Rochford
Group chief executive officer
2 March 2017 Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 51
Strategic report
The directors are required 
to make an assessment  
of the Group’s ability to 
continue to trade as a going 
concern for the three-year 
period of assessment used 
to assess the business. The 
directors have given this 
matter due consideration 
through a review of 
forecast cash flow models 
and scenarios and current 
cash availability and have 
concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the 
Group financial statements 
on a going concern basis. 
STATEMENT OF VIABILITY
The main considerations were as follows: 
The Group prepares annually a five-year 
plan as part of its corporate planning 
process, which is aligned to the strategic 
goals approved by the board. The plan is 
predicated on a detailed year one budget, 
and extrapolated forecasts in outer years.  
It is the first three years of the forecast which 
command the greatest focus and have  
the greater certainty over the forecasting 
assumptions used. Hence this is why  
the board has concluded that the viability 
statement should cover a period of  
three years.
The Group is highly cash generative 
receiving weekly cash flows in collections 
from customers and has a low fixed  
cost base. We have a long track record of 
predictable cash flows over many years. 
The directors have reviewed the available 
headroom of the Group, and confirmed 
that the Group has sufficient resources to 
meet future obligations as they fall due. 
The principal covenants of the revolving 
credit facility that the Group currently  
has in place are loan to value (LTV) ratio of 
no more than 75% and a super senior loan  
to value (SSLTV) ratio of no more than 25%, 
both tested quarterly. The directors have 
reviewed the Group’s financial projections 
covering a minimum period of at least  
12 months from the date of signing of these 
financial statements and the projections 
show covenant compliance. Furthermore 
based on the three-year forecast and 
funding plan, the Group will continue to be 
in compliance. 
The directors have considered the Group’s 
viability in detail over a three-year period 
to December 2019. This assessment is in 
accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. It has been 
made taking into account the current 
position of the Group, the corporate planning 
and budget process, and the Group’s 
principal risks as detailed in the strategic 
report on pages 40 to 43. 
As a matter of good practice, a variety  
of stress tests are performed on the plan.  
The tests selected consider the principal 
risks faced by the Group. The principal risk 
modelled within the stress tests is a 
reduction in collections, which would reflect 
the impact of either external macroeconomic 
factors or internal operational issues 
arising. In the UK, we completed a specific 
exercise regarding macroeconomic stress 
to simulate the potential impacts of any 
downturn in macroeconomic factors, due 
to Brexit or otherwise. We asked Jaywing 
Consulting to consider and challenge our 
analysis, details of which can be seen on 
page 18. This has helped inform some of the 
stress testing performed.
The directors have concluded that  
they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall 
due, over the three-year period of their 
detailed assessment. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 52 Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 53

Directors’ and committee reports
The directors present their 
annual report on the affairs 
of the Group, together with 
the financial statements 
and auditor’s report, for the 
year ended 31 December 
2016. The corporate 
governance report set out 
on page 61 forms part of  
this report. The Company’s 
principal subsidiaries are 
listed in note 23.
Results and going concern
The Group’s results are discussed in the 
Chairman’s statement, Group chief executive 
officer’s review, Group chief financial officer’s 
review and strategic report starting on pages 
10, 14, 34 and 20 respectively, which are 
incorporated into this report by reference.
Consideration of going concern can be 
seen on page 51. After making appropriate 
enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group will be able to continue in operational 
existence for the three-year period of 
assessment, owing to the fact that forecasts 
show sufficient resources are available 
throughout the period under review. Thus, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements. 
Fair, balanced and understandable 
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 Edition (the ‘Code’), 
the directors confirm that they consider 
that this annual report and accounts,  
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
The board came to this view following  
a rigorous review process throughout the 
production schedule. The annual report  
is drafted by appropriate members of the 
reporting and leadership teams and is 
managed by the investor relations 
co-ordinator to ensure consistency. A series 
of planned reviews are undertaken by the 
reporting team, leadership team and 
directors in advance of final consideration 
by the board. The annual report is also 
reviewed by the audit committee.
Dividends
The directors recommend the payment of  
a final dividend of 6.4p per ordinary share for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2016 
(2015: 5.4p) to be paid (assuming shareholder 
approval is obtained) on 6 July 2017 to 
ordinary shareholders on the register on  
9 June 2017. This together with the interim 
dividend of 2.7p per share (2015: 1.7p) paid 
on 13 October 2016, brings the total dividend 
declared and proposed for the year to 9 .1p 
per share (2015: 7 .1p).
The Company held £37.5 million 
distributable reserves at 31 December 2016, 
which is sufficient to pay the dividend.
Share capital
As at 31 December 2016, the Company had 
174.4 million ordinary shares in issue, of one 
class, with a nominal value of 1p each. Full 
details of the share capital of the Company 
are set out in note 20 to the Group financial 
statements on page 122. The information  
in note 20 is incorporated by reference and 
forms part of this directors’ report. On a 
show of hands at a general meeting of the 
Company, each member present in person 
or by proxy, and entitled to vote, shall have 
one vote and, on a poll, every member  
shall have one vote for every ordinary share 
held. There are no issued shares in the 
Company with special rights with regard to 
control of the Company.
Purchase of own shares
At the 2016 annual general meeting, 
shareholders authorised the Company to 
make market purchases of up to 17,443,902 
ordinary shares representing 10% of the 
issued share capital at that time, and to allot 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,162,926.84. These authorities expire at the 
2017 annual general meeting. During the 
year to 31 December 2016, no shares were 
allotted or repurchased. Resolutions to 
renew these authorities will be proposed at 
the 2017 annual general meeting.
The Company announced on 16 February 
2017 that 4 million ordinary shares in the 
Company had been admitted to the Official 
List by way of block listing. The shares will 
be allotted from time to time in accordance 
with the vesting of certain employee awards. 
As at 2 March 2017 , none of the block listed 
shares had been allotted by the Company. 
RIS announcements will be made in 
accordance with the Disclosure, Guidance 
and Transparency Rules when an allotment 
has occurred.
The Company operates an independent 
employee benefit trust for future benefit to 
employees of the Group. Bedell Trustees 
Limited was the trustee of the Arrow Global 
Benefit Trust, which was established by a 
Trust Deed dated 14 October 2011 (the 
‘Bedell Trust’). Estera Trust (Jersey) Limited 
is the trustee of the Arrow Global Group 
2016 Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Estera 
Trust’), which was established by the 
Company by a trust instrument on 3 May 
2016. On 17 May 2016, the Bedell Trust 
transferred the assets held by it to the Estera 
Trust. The Bedell Trust was then terminated 
by Deed dated 20 May 2016. During the 
financial year, the Bedell Trust (until 
termination) and the Estera Trust (from 
appointment) transferred shares to the 
trustee of the Arrow Global Share Incentive 
Plan (the ‘SIP’) to satisfy awards of shares to 
participating employees under the SIP.
As at 31 December 2016, the Estera Trust 
held 66,277 ordinary shares (2015: 392,484 
shares) representing 0.04% (2015: 0.2%) of 
the Company’s issued share capital. The 
Trust deed contains a dividend waiver 
provision in relation to these shares. There 
were no purchases of shares by either  
the Bedell Trust or the Estera Trust during 
the year.

DIRECTORS Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 57
Directors’ and committee reports
Transfer of securities
There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
shares, limitations on the holding of shares 
or requirements to obtain prior approval of 
the Company, or of other holders of 
securities in the Company, to a transfer  
of shares.
The board may decline to register a 
transfer of any share which is not fully paid. 
Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances 
set out in the uncertificated securities rules 
(as defined in the articles of association) and 
where, in the case of a transfer to joint 
holders, the number of joint holders to whom 
the uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four.
The board may decline to register a 
transfer of a certificated share unless the 
instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped  
or certified or otherwise shown to the 
satisfaction of the board to be exempt from 
stamp duty and is accompanied by the 
relevant share certificate and such other 
evidence of the right to transfer as the board 
may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect  
of only one class of share; and (iii) if joint 
transferees, is in favour of not more than 
four such transferees.
Further, the board may decline to register  
a transfer of a certificated share where the 
transfer is requested by a person with more 
than a 0.25% interest in the issued share 
capital of the Company (excluding treasury 
shares) if such a person has been served with 
a restriction notice after failure to provide 
the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Companies Act 2006, 
unless the transfer is shown to the board  
to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale  
(as defined in the articles of association).
The articles of association also contain 
certain restrictions on transfers, which are 
designed to ensure that the assets of the 
Company are not deemed to constitute ‘plan 
assets’ within the meaning of the Plan Asset 
Regulations (as defined in the articles of 
association) because the directors have been 
advised that this could result in the Company 
becoming subject to certain onerous 
obligations under US law. Accordingly, the 
articles of association provide that the board 
may refuse to register a transfer of shares, 
or compulsorily require the transfer of shares, 
where a transfer of shares, or continued 
holding of shares, would cause, or is likely 
to cause (i) the assets of the Company to  
be considered ‘plan assets’ under the Plan 
Asset Regulations or (ii) the Company to 
suffer any pecuniary disadvantage, including 
any excise tax, penalties or liabilities, under 
ERISA or the IR Code (each as defined in the 
articles of association).
No shares carry any special rights with 
regard to control of the Company and 
there are no restrictions on voting rights 
except that a shareholder has no right  
to vote in respect of a share unless all sums 
due in respect of that share are fully paid. 
There are no known agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
voting rights and no known arrangements 
under which financial rights are held by a 
person other than the holders of the shares.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2016, the Company had 
been notified under Rule 5 of the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules of the

Directors’ indemnities
During the financial year ended  
31 December 2016 and up to the date of  
this directors’ report, the Company has 
maintained appropriate liability insurance 
for its directors and officers. 
The Company has granted indemnities  
to each of its directors on terms consistent 
with the applicable statutory provisions. 
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the purposes of section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 were accordingly

remain in force at the date of this report.
Interim report
Current regulations permit the Company

interim results will not be sent to 
shareholders. Interim results and other 
information about the Company will  
be available on the Company’s website at 
(www.arrowglobalir.net).
Electronic and website  
communication with shareholders
The Company’s articles of association permit 
electronic communication with shareholders 
as provided in the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company obtained authority from its 
shareholders at the 2014 annual general 
meeting to implement electronic 
communication. It is intended that the 2016 
annual report and notice of annual general 
meeting 2017 will be distributed electronically 
again and via the Company’s website to 
shareholders who have consented, or are 
deemed to have consented. Shareholders 
who have requested shareholder 
information in hard copy form will continue 
to receive this.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on  
the involvement of its employees and uses 
a number of ways to engage with the  
team on matters that impact them and the 
performance of the Group. These include 
regular Company-wide update meetings and 
email communication, use of the colleague 
council, the distribution of a weekly 
newsletter, focus group meetings, annual 
employee surveys and regular Company-
wide business update meetings and 
workshops. Our people managers carry out 
monthly one-to-one meetings with their 
direct reports and the senior management 
team has an open door policy which allows 
all employees to discuss any concerns or 
new initiatives.
Employees are encouraged to be involved 
in the Company’s performance via the  
SIP scheme, the detail of which is set out  
at note 28.
The Group also has a whistleblowing 
policy and employees are made aware of this 
at induction and through regular ongoing 
refresher training.
Disabled persons
The Company adopts a consistent, non-
discriminatory approach to all applicants, 
with due regard to their skills and abilities. 
In the event of an employee becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that 
their employment within the Company 
continues and that appropriate training is 
arranged where necessary. It is the policy  
of the Company that training, career 
development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible,  
be identical to that of other employees. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 59
Directors’ and committee reports
Environmental policy
Due to the nature of its business activities, 
the Group’s environmental impact is 
considered minimal. An environmental 
policy is in place to increase employee 
awareness of environmental issues and 
complies with all relevant regulatory 
requirements. The Group’s environmental 
impacts are through resource use and 
business travel. Key areas of the policy 
addressing the business’ environmental 
impact are as follows:
>  minimising paper usage and the  
purchase of recycled paper and packaging 
where possible
> energy efficient office products
> recycling office waste
> increased use of video and conference calls
>  supporting cycling to work through a cycle 
to work scheme
Carbon reporting – methodology 
We have followed the requirements of  
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
and the Carbon Trust conversion factors  
to measure and report greenhouse gas 
emissions, as well as the disclosure 
requirements in Part 7 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013.
The financial control method, which 
captures the sources that fall within our 
consolidated financial statements, has been 
used. Although we operate an outsourced 
model working with partners, these partners 
do not work exclusively for the Group  
and, therefore, it is not deemed appropriate 
to include emissions outside of the Group 
consolidated financial statements. The 
reporting period aligns to the financial 
period (i.e. the year to 31 December 2016) 
and the Group’s carbon reporting falls 
under three scopes:
CO
2
 omissions have increased during 
the year due to the acquisitions of Vesting  
and Redrock, and the agreed purchase  
of Zenith. Whilst we consider our carbon 
emissions to still be relatively low, with the 
Group expanding globally, the main area 
we can control is business travel and we will 
continue to make employees aware of 
environmental impacts.
Risk management
Please refer to the strategic report, pages  
40 to 43.
Statement of disclosure of  
information to the auditor
Each of the persons who is a director at the 
date of approval of the financial statements 
confirms that:
1.  so far as the director is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
2.  the director has taken all steps he/she 
ought to have taken as a director to  
make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish  
that the Company’s auditor is aware of  
that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
STATEMENT
The directors are 
responsible for preparing 
the annual report and  
the Group and Company 
financial statements in 
accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements 
on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
>  select suitable accounting policies and  
then apply them consistently
>  make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
>  state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU; and
>  prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue  
in business.
We consider the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
This report was approved by the board  
and signed on its behalf by:
Rob Memmott
Group chief financial officer

The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company  
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud  
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing  
a strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ 
remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement that complies with 
that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
>  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
>  the strategic report includes a fair review  
of the development and performance of  
the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 61
Directors’ and committee reports
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE REPORT
Compliance statement
This corporate governance report, 
together with the reports of the audit and 
risk committee, nomination committee, 
disclosure committee and the directors’ 
remuneration report, provide a description 
of how the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published by 
the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’)  
in September 2014 (the ‘Code’), have been 
applied by the Company in 2016. The Code 
is available on the FRC website at  
www.frc.org.uk
During the year, the Company was  
in compliance with the relevant provisions 
of the Code and intends to continue to 
comply with the requirements of the Code, 
which sets out standards of good practice  
in relation to board leadership and 
effectiveness, remuneration, accountability 
and relations with shareholders. 
The FRC introduced certain changes to 
the Code in April 2016, most of which relate 
to the conduct of the audit committee, and, 
although the Company was not formally 
required to adopt the new provisions until 
2017 , the board adopted a large number  
of the changes introduced by the 2016 Code 
during the year. The Company will formally 
report against the 2016 Code in 2017 . 
The board currently comprises seven 
members, including me, as Chairman,  
two executive directors (Lee Rochford and  
Rob Memmott) and four independent 
non-executive directors (Iain Cornish,  
Lan Tu, Maria Luís Albuquerque and 
Andrew Fisher). The board regarded me,  
as Chairman, as independent upon my 
appointment and considers that I continue 
to meet the independence criteria. 
As mentioned in my statement on pages 10 
to 13, we announced in December 2016 
that Tom Drury would be stepping down as 
Group chief executive officer and would  
be replaced by Lee Rochford with effect from 
3 January 2017. Maria Luís Albuquerque  
and Andrew Fisher also joined the board on 
7 March and 9 December 2016 respectively 
as independent non-executive directors. 
Robin Phipps stepped down from the board 
on 27 October 2016. 
Iain Cornish is the Company’s senior 
independent director. The board is satisfied 
that Iain is independent in character and 
judgment and with skills and experience 
that make him well suited to the role. 
Where a company is outside the FTSE 350, 
the Code recommends that the board of 
directors includes at least two ‘independent’ 
non-executive directors. The Company 
(being outside the FTSE 350) currently has 
five independent non-executive directors, 
including me as Chairman, and therefore, 
complies with the recommendation of  
the Code.
On the nomination committee’s 
recommendation and following the board’s 
approval, the audit and risk committee  
was formally separated in January 2017 . 
Andrew Fisher was appointed chair of the 
audit committee with effect from 25 January 
2017 and continues to be a member of the 
risk committee. Iain Cornish continues to 
chair the risk committee and is a member 
of the audit committee. 
Biographical details of all the directors 
are set out on pages 54 and 55. The board 
adopted the provision regarding the annual 
re-election of all directors at the first 
annual general meeting in 2014 and intends 
to continue this at the 2017 annual general 
meeting. Lee Rochford and Andrew Fisher 
will offer themselves for election by the 
shareholders for the first time at the 2017 
annual general meeting.
Shareholder, bondholder and revolving 
credit facility provider engagement
The board considers that active dialogue 
with its shareholders, bondholders and 
revolving credit facility providers to be vital 
to the success of the business. Further 
details regarding these engagements are 
set out on page 65.

Leadership
The board
The board is responsible for the long-term 
success of the Company, its strategy, values 
and governance. The board maintains a 
formal schedule of matters for consideration, 
which include:
>  establishing long-term strategic objectives
>  approving annual operating and  
capital budgets
>  reviewing business performance and 
development
>  overseeing the Company’s risk  
management and internal control systems

Specific key considerations of the board  
in 2016 also included:
>  the acquisition of Vesting in the 
Netherlands and Belgium
> the proposed acquisition of Zenith in Italy
> Sterling bond refinancing
> RCF refinancing
> FCA authorisation application
>  the appointment of Group chief executive 
officer, Lee Rochford

capability and entry into a five-year servicing 
agreement in the Netherlands
> European expansion considerations.
Chairman and Group chief  
executive officer
The positions of the Chairman and Group 
chief executive officer are held by separate 
individuals and the board has clearly 
defined their responsibilities. The Chairman 
is primarily responsible for the effective 
working of the board and ensuring that each 
director, particularly the non-executive 
directors, is able to make an effective 
contribution. The Group chief executive 
officer has responsibility for operational 
matters, which includes the implementation 
of the Group strategy and policies approved 
by the board.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed  
for periods of three years, subject to 
shareholder approval. Terms in excess of  
six years are subject to a more rigorous 
review. The non-executive directors meet 
periodically without the executive  
directors present.
Effectiveness
Time commitment
The individual letters of appointment set 
out the expected time commitment for 
non-executive directors and are available 
for inspection at our registered office. 
Other significant commitments are disclosed 
to the board on each occasion that these 
commitments change.
Undertakings are given that non-
executive directors will have sufficient time 
to meet the requirements of the role. 
Details of the Chairman’s and other directors’ 
commitments can be seen in the director 
biographies on pages 54 and 55.
Board activity
The board discharges its responsibilities 
through an annual programme of board and 
committee meetings which are held at  
the various operational sites of the company. 
The board visited the Capquest offices in 
June 2016 and the Whitestar offices in 
October 2016.
Board attendance
The board held ten scheduled meetings in 
2016. Details of board attendance by all 
directors who held office during the year 
are set out below:
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE REPORT Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 63
Directors’ and committee reports
Ad hoc conference calls and meeting were 
also convened to deal with specific matters 
which required attention between 
scheduled meetings. 
Continued professional development 
undertaken during the year
Training is offered to all new directors as 
necessary. The Chairman, together with the 
Group chief executive officer and company 
secretary, ensure new directors receive a full, 
formal and tailored induction upon joining 
the board, including full briefing packs. 
As part of a tailored induction programme, 
new directors receive a comprehensive 
induction pack which includes background 
information on the Company, material  
on matters relating to the board and its 
committees, and governance related 
information (including the duties and 
responsibilities of directors). New directors 
meet with key advisors and members of  
the executive team. Visits to operational sites 
are arranged as well as meetings with  
the external and internal auditors. Ongoing 
training was provided during the year  
for existing directors. Major shareholders 
are welcome to meet newly appointed 
non-executive directors should they express 
a desire to do so. 
The aforementioned induction process 
was applied following the appointment  
of Maria Luís Albuquerque in March 2016 
and Andrew Fisher in December 2016.  
Lee Rochford undertook a thorough induction 
process leading up to his appointment on  
3 January 2017 and throughout the ’handover’ 
period during January and February 2017 
with Tom Drury. 
Access to independent advice
An approved procedure for all directors  
to take independent professional advice,  
at the Company’s expense, is in place.  
The committees are provided with sufficient 
resources, including the ability to appoint 
external advisors when they deem it 
appropriate to call upon a particular resource. 
All directors have access to the advice  
and services of the company secretary and 
are entitled to rely on the impartial and 
independent nature of such advice and 
services. The company secretary is 
responsible to the board for both the proper 
administration of procedures and 
arrangements established by the board for 
the conduct of its own business, and the 
Company’s compliance with internal and 
external rules and regulations. The board 
receives agendas and supporting papers well 
in advance of board meetings.
Evaluation of the board and committees
The board undertook a process of 
self-evaluation of its performance during 
the year. A questionnaire, including the 
main themes from the 2015 evaluation, was 
issued to board members for review and 
completion and was subsequently submitted 
to the Chairman, who has reviewed the 
responses and reported on the conclusions 
to the nomination committee and to the 
board. A number of areas for further 
improvement were identified and have been 
acted upon, including: the separation  
of the audit and risk committee and the 
development of the board’s training 
programme in light of the enlarged Group 
and asset class diversification. None of  
the areas identified for further improvement 
were considered material, and, overall, 
board members were satisfied with the 
performance of the board during the year. 
An internal evaluation of both the audit  
and risk, nomination and remuneration 
committees took place adopting the same 
procedure. Meetings of the non-executive 
directors led by the Chairman, without the 
executive directors being present, took 
place. Iain Cornish, as senior independent 
director, led the meeting of the non-
executive directors (without the Chairman 
being present) to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance. No actions were considered 
necessary as a result of these evaluations. 
The board has confirmed that its 
performance, as well as the contribution of 
each of the executive and non-executive 
directors continues to be effective, that they 
continue to demonstrate commitment  
to their respective roles and that the board 
members’ respective skills complement 
one another and enhance the overall 
operation of the board. The board, therefore, 
recommends that shareholders approve 
the resolutions to be proposed at the 2017 
annual general meeting in relation to the 
election and re-election of the directors.
Accountability
Adequacy of risk management and 
internal control systems 
The Code requires that the board should 
monitor the company’s risk management 
and internal control systems and, at  
least annually, carry out a review of their 
effectiveness and report on that review  
in the annual report. The board complies 
with this Code provision in line with the 
guidance published by the FRC, ‘Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control  
and Related Financial and Business Reporting 
(September 2014)’. In this context, the 
board is responsible for, and monitors, the 
Group’s systems of internal controls  
(which include financial, operational and 
compliance controls) and risk management 
systems. The risk management framework 
is designed to identify and mitigate risks, 
but it does not eliminate all risks. The board 
has approved an appropriate suite of policies 
on internal control, and seeks regular 
assurance that the systems of internal control 
are effective in managing risks in line with 
its articulated risk appetite. The Group has 
a formal three lines of defence model,  
with the third line provided by Deloitte LLP 
together with in-house internal audit 
functions. During the year, the board carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. These 
are documented on pages 40 to 43 of the 
strategic report. 
The following activities are considered 
to cover the most critical business processes 
and associated risks:
>  A disciplined underwriting process, 
overseen by the board, with delegated 
authority to the executive committee for 
certain transactions. This process ensures 
an objective, rigorous and consistent 
approach to pricing and due diligence. 
Additionally, any transactions greater  
than £20 million in investment value or 
those that represent a new asset class are 
escalated to the board for approval.  
The processes and controls are documented 
in a portfolio acquisition policy Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 64
Directors’ and committee reports
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE REPORT
>  A strong risk and compliance framework 
was embedded via the audit and risk 
committee, executive and management 
teams and supported by the risk 
management framework and maintenance 
of the Group, country and departmental 
risk registers
>  Regular monitoring of portfolio 
performance, overseen by the portfolio 
review committee, which considers  
actual versus forecast results, focusing on 
significant individual portfolio variances, 
re-forecasts cash flows on a six-monthly 
basis, signs off the latest ERC forecast, 
assesses the carrying value of the portfolio 
assets and reviews revenue recognition
>  Internal controls exist over all key processes 
of the Group that have an impact on  
the financial results. Full documentation  
of these processes is well progressed via 
departmental manuals and new processes 
are documented as business need arises.
Comprehensive reporting to the audit and 
risk committee and the board on the above 
activities took place throughout the year. 
The audit and risk committee carried out  
a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. In carrying out this 
review, the committee received a report from 
the Group chief risk officer and the Group 
chief financial officer on the Group’s internal 
controls (including financial, operational 
and compliance controls) and risk 
management systems.
The assessment for 2016 took into 
account a broader assessment of risk 
management across the Group, including, 
the Group’s subsidiaries in Portugal and  
the Benelux countries. For 2017 , there will be 
more oversight of the respective internal 
control systems in Portugal and the  
Benelux countries. 
No new or open high risk observations 
were identified by the external auditor, KPMG, 
during the interim audit for 2016. The risk 
management framework provides assurance 
and evidence that the Group’s risks  
are understood and being appropriately 
managed. The audit and risk committee 
monitored the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems and, following 
a review of their effectiveness, concluded 
that they were adequate. There were no 
material failings or weaknesses identified 
following the committee review, though 
management needed to continue to further 
embed the framework as expected in a 
maturing organisation and further work was 
required to strengthen the internal financial 
controls in Portugal and the Benelux 
countries. Based on the audit and risk 
committee’s recommendation, the board 
concluded that, overall, the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
were adequately effective. 
Non-audit services provided  
by the auditor 
The provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor is monitored throughout 
the year. Non-audit services were performed 
by the auditors, namely mandatory work 
performed in relation to the issuance of the 
€230 million seven-year floating rate  
notes and the £220 million senior secured 
notes due 2024. Additionally, the auditors 
performed a controls report for Vesting in 
its capacity as a service organisation. The 
level of non-audit fees and audit related 
assurance services, provided by the external 
auditor, for the year can be seen in note 9  
on page 114. A revised non-audit services 
policy, which complies with best practice, 
has been adopted by the audit committee.
The committee has concluded that  
the provision of non-audit services to date 
has not compromised external auditor 
independence and objectivity. See pages 87 
and 92 for more details of the non-audit 
services policy and the future changes in 
this area introduced by legislation. 
Internal audit function
The audit and risk committee was 
responsible for monitoring and reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal audit activities 
in 2016, however, following the formal 
separation of the audit and risk committee 
with effect from 25 January 2017, this 
responsibility will now fall under the remit 
of the audit committee. The audit and risk 
committee approved the appointment of an 
outsourced internal audit provider, Deloitte, 
in October 2015, which has a Group-wide 
remit. There are also in-house internal audit 
teams at Whitestar and Vesting.
Conflicts of interests
Company policy requires that if a director 
becomes aware that they have a direct or 
indirect interest in an existing or proposed 
transaction with the Company, they should 
notify the board at the next board meeting 
or by providing a written declaration. 
Directors have a continuing duty to update 
any changes in such interests. See also the 
related party transactions note 22.
Approving significant transactions  
and investment decisions
The business acquires non-performing  
and non-core loan portfolios as part of  
its ordinary course of business. The Group 
applies a multi-stage approach to its 
underwriting and pricing process, with the 
aim of achieving attractive risk-adjusted 
returns, based on the Group’s underwriting 
models, analytical processes and  
servicing strategies.
The origination team reviews 
approximately 125 transactions per year, 
with approximately 23 completed 
transactions. Transactions range from repeat 
transactions with creditors and asset classes 
familiar to the Group, through to more 
complex consortium trades with special 
purpose vehicle structures.
An authority matrix sets out the delegated 
authority to the investment committee  
and executive committee. The board retains 
authority for any new asset classes or 
geography, complex deals over £10 million 
and any transaction over £20 million.  
Based upon recent performance, the board 
will be asked to consider circa four to five 
transactions per annum. In 2016, the board 
approved, amongst others, the acquisition 
of Vesting and the proposed acquisition of 
Zenith in Italy, together with the acquisition 
of a specialist servicing capability, the entry 
into a five-year servicing arrangement  
and related co-investment in the €1.7 billion 
portfolio of secured real-estate assets sold  
by RNHB Hypotheekbank in the Netherlands; 
resulting in loan notes of £21.3 million. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 65
Directors’ and committee reports
Bribery Act compliance
The Company has anti-bribery and 
corruption policies and standards available 
to its employees. There is a summary of  
the policy complying with the provisions  
of the UK Bribery Act available on the 
Company’s website, which is in line with 
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Guidance on  
the Bribery Act 2010 (‘MOJ Guidance’). The 
policy contains a gifts and hospitality 
procedure and prohibits facilitation 
payments. Adequate and regular training 
on the policy and the principles outlined 
therein is provided to staff and directors.
The Company considers it to have 
adequate procedures within the meaning 
of the MOJ Guidance. The Group chief risk 
officer has primary and day-to-day 
responsibility for implementing this policy.
Remuneration
In line with the Code and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Disclosure Regulations  
2013, details on remuneration including the 
annual report on remuneration and the 
directors’ remuneration policy, which was 
approved at the 2015 annual general 
meeting held on 3 June 2015, can be seen  
on pages 69 to 85.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders, bondholders 
and revolving credit facility providers
In 2016, the Company held a capital 
markets day for institutional investors and 
analysts at the London office of its corporate 
communications advisors, Instinctif,  
which included presentations on results 
and information on the Group’s activities. 
The capital markets presentation can be 
accessed on the Group’s website at  
(www.arrowglobalir.net). The Chairman, 
the Group chief executive officer and the 
Group chief financial officer also hosted  
a dinner, which all major shareholders were 
invited to attend. 
Following meetings or telephone 
conversations with brokers, the Chairman 
communicates to the entire board the 
views of shareholders, bond holders and 
revolving credit facility providers (‘key 
stakeholders’). The Group chief executive 
officer and the Group chief financial  
officer regularly speak and meet with key 
stakeholders. The Chairman is available to 
discuss governance and strategy with key 
stakeholders. Non-executive directors and 
the SID have the opportunity to attend 
meetings with key stakeholders and would 
attend if requested.
Following the announcement of the 
preliminary and interim results and the 
executive directors’ presentations to analysts 
and shareholders, the board receives a 
report on institutional feedback prepared 
by the Company’s advisors.
The Group chief executive officer and 
the Group chief financial officer also verbally 
report on their meetings with shareholders. 
Copies of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings are 
circulated to the board.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting is an 
opportunity for all shareholders to both 
vote on resolutions put forward and ask  
the board any questions they may have.  
See inside cover and page 59 , for information 
on the 2017 annual general meeting. The 
notice of meeting and annual report will be 
sent out at least 20 working days before  
the meeting. Separate votes will be held for 
each proposed resolution and a proxy count 
will be given in each case. 
The proxy forms will provide a ‘vote 
withheld’ option. The chairs of the audit, 
risk, remuneration and nomination 
committees attend and are available to 
answer questions.
Disclosure committee
The disclosure committee is made up of one 
non-executive director, Iain Cornish, who 
chairs the committee, and one executive 
director, Rob Memmott, the Group chief 
financial officer. The disclosure committee 
meets at such times as may be necessary  
or appropriate.
The disclosure committee is responsible 
for monitoring, evaluating and enhancing 
disclosure controls and procedures of  
the Group. In particular, responsibilities set 
out in the terms of reference include

NOMINATION  
COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to provide a report of the nomination committee’s activities in 2016.
The committee plays an important role in ensuring that the Company is led by a board which is best placed to ensure the long-term success 
of the Company and that the Company operates effectively in the context of our strategic objectives.
The committee’s primary focus this year was the identification of potential candidates for the roles of Group chief executive officer and 
non-executive director, following the announcements that Tom Drury and Robin Phipps would be stepping down from their respective 
roles. I am very pleased with the outcome of these processes, which resulted in the appointment of:
>  Lee Rochford as Group chief executive officer. Lee’s appointment was announced on 7 December 2016 and he formally took up the position 
on 3 January 2017; and
>  Andrew Fisher as non-executive director. Andrew’s appointment was announced on 9 December 2016 and he took up the position with 
immediate effect. 
Further detail on the recruitment process for each appointment is set out on page 67 . 
As noted within my Chairman’s statement on page 11, in light of the change in nature and shape of the Group, the country management 
structure was reorganised in 2016, such that from 2017, the Group will operate on a country basis with profit or loss the responsibility of 
country chief executive officers and local leadership teams. The committee was supportive of the reorganisation and the reports of the 
country chief executive officers are located on pages 20 to 23. 
Another important step during the year was the committee’s recommendation to the board, given the growth and complexity of the 
Group, to separate the audit and risk committee and for each committee to be chaired by separate individuals. The board agreed with this 
recommendation and, with effect from 25 January 2017, the combined audit and risk committee, previously chaired by Iain Cornish, was 
formally separated; the newly formed audit committee being chaired by Andrew Fisher and the newly formed risk committee being chaired 
by Iain Cornish. Andrew became a member of the risk committee and Iain remains a member of the audit committee.
The committee continues to monitor board and executive management succession to ensure an appropriate balance of skills and experience, 
with due regard given to the benefits of diversity, and that opportunities for talent progression are identified and developed. 
Robin Phipps stepped down from the board on 27 October 2016. Arising from this, the committee recommended the appointment of  
Lan Tu as chair of the remuneration committee, which the board approved. 
Diversity remains a key area of focus for the committee, with the composition of the board and capabilities of all directors kept under 
review to ensure that board membership is sufficiently diverse and reflects a broad range of skills, knowledge and experience to enable  
it to meet its responsibilities. 
Further information regarding the committee’s activities during the year and its roles and responsibilities are set out in the remainder  
of this report.

Committee membership and meetings
I chair the nomination committee and I was regarded as independent on appointment. 
The committee also comprises two other independent non-executive directors, Iain Cornish 
and Lan Tu. I will not chair the committee when it is dealing with the matter of succession  
to the chairmanship. The committee is compliant with the provisions of the Code as the 
majority of the committee members are independent non-executive directors.
Biographies of the members of the committee are set out on pages 54 to 55.
The committee held three scheduled meetings during the year. Details of attendance by 
all members who held office during the year are set out below:
Role
The committee’s responsibilities are set  
out in its terms of reference. They include 
responsibility for considering and making 
recommendations to the board in respect 
of appointments to the board, the board 
committees and the chairmanship of the 
board committees. It is also responsible for 
keeping the structure, size and composition 
of the board under regular review, and  
for making recommendations to the board 
with regard to any changes necessary. 
Furthermore, the nomination committee  
is required to manage the process for 
evaluating the performance of the board.
The work of the committee in 2016 has 
included:
>  The recruitment of Lee Rochford as  
Group chief executive officer 
>  The recruitment of Andrew Fisher as  
a non-executive director
>  Recommending to the board that the  
audit and risk committee be split into 
separate committees with separate chairs 
>  Recommending to the board the 
appointment of Lan Tu as chair of the 
remuneration committee on  
Robin Phipps stepping down as a non-
executive director
>  Reviewing the talent pipeline across the 
Group’s senior leadership team
>  Reviewing the terms of reference of  
the committee
>  Continued monitoring of the structure, 
size, composition and diversity of both the 
board and its committees
>  Considering approaches to the 2016 board 
and committee performance evaluation 
review and reviewing summaries compiled 
from responses received from board 
members
>  Recommending to the board the re-
election/election of the entire board at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
Recruitment of directors
The appointment of both Lee Rochford and 
Andrew Fisher followed an extensive search 
and a rigorous selection process. For each 
position, the committee assessed the skills 
and experience required to fulfil the relevant 
role and role descriptions detailing the 
capabilities required for each appointment 
were prepared accordingly. The executive 
search firm, Spencer Stuart, was retained in 
relation to the appointment of Lee Rochford 
and the firm, Ridgeway Partners, in relation 
to the appointment of Andrew Fisher. 
Neither firm has any other connection  
with the Company. 
The recruitment process for the role  
of Group chief executive officer resulted  
in two candidates being shortlisted for 
interview. Interviews with both candidates 
were conducted by me, the executive and 
non-executive directors and each candidate 
also undertook an in-depth assessment 
with business psychologists.

NOMINATION  
COMMITTEE REPORT
The recruitment process for the role of 
non-executive director also resulted in two 
candidates being shortlisted for interview. 
Each candidate was then interviewed by me, 
the executive and non-executive directors 
and the Company’s auditors, KPMG, as the 
role description provided that the selected 
candidate would chair the Company’s  
audit committee. 
The committee unanimously  
approved the recommendation of the 
appointment of each of Lee and Andrew  
to the board. The board unanimously 
approved the recommendations and each 
of Lee and Andrew’s appointments were 
announced respectively on 7 December and 
9 December 2016. Lee joined the Company 
on 3 January 2017 and Andrew took up his 
role with immediate effect.
Succession Planning
The committee has considered the 
recommendations published by the FRC 
(FRC Feedback Statement: UK Board 
Succession Planning Discussion Paper (May 
2016)) and recognises the importance of 
strategic, thoughtful and practical succession 
planning as a key driver in maximising 
board effectiveness and as an important 
contributory factor to the Company’s 
long-term success. The committee has taken 
an active interest in talent management 
and acknowledges that internal candidates 
for senior management and board positions 
should be given a broader experience of 
the business, with greater exposure to the 
board and boardroom experience. The 
committee supported the board in its initial 
review of talent progression opportunities 
across the Group’s senior leadership team 
and will continue to work with the relevant 
internal parties, and external executive search 
providers where appropriate, to enhance 
the succession planning programme 
throughout 2017 . 
Diversity
The board recognises the benefits that 
diversity can bring and seeks to recruit 
directors from different backgrounds with  
a range of experience, perspectives, 
personalities, skills and knowledge, which  
is in line with the Company’s equality and 
diversity policy. The board supports, in 
principle, the recommendations outlined  
in the Hampton-Alexander Review published 
in November 2016, particularly in improving 
the representation of women both at board 
level and also below board level and in 
senior leadership positions. The Company 
is a member of the international women’s 
network, ‘Women on Boards’, which all senior 
female leaders have been invited to join. 
Both the committee and the board have 
a fundamental obligation to ensure that 
appointments are of the best candidates who 
are selected on merit against objective 
criteria. Subject to this, the availability of 
suitable candidates and compliance with 
the requirements of the Equality Act 2010, 
the board is committed to strengthening 
female representation at board and senior 
management level. It has not, however,  
set prescriptive targets as it does not believe 
these are in the best interests of either  
the Company or its shareholders. Although 
the company is currently outside the  
FTSE 350, the committee will keep under 
review the Hampton-Alexander Review 
recommendations for female board 
representation in relation to FTSE 350 listed 
companies, as well as recommendations  
in relation to improvements on under-
representation on the executive committee 
and on the layer immediately below for 
such companies. 
The board currently comprises two  
female non-executive directors, Lan Tu and  
Maria Luís Albuquerque, who together 
represent 29% female board membership 
which is just below the 33% target 
recommended by the Hampton-Alexander 
Review for FTSE 350 listed companies.  
The executive committee comprises one 
female member, who represents 11% of  
the executive committee’s membership. 
Effectiveness
In 2016 the committee carried out an 
evaluation of its effectiveness by way of a 
questionnaire. The questionnaire focused 
on areas such as board composition and 
succession planning. Development areas  
to be actioned in 2017 include:
>  Continuing to closely monitor the 
composition of the board, particularly in 
the context of the enlarged Group; and 
>  Enhancing the succession planning 
programme following the detailed exercise 
undertaken in 2016, to include a more 
detailed review of senior management 
capability and progression opportunities.
The board, based on the outcome of the 
evaluation exercise, concluded that the 
committee was considered to be effective 
in fulfilling its role throughout 2016.

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
The report complies with the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations  
2008 (as amended), the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) and the Financial Conduct  
Authority’s Listing Rules. 
This report is split into two sections: the annual report on remuneration which follows this statement and then an extract from the directors’ 
remuneration policy. No changes are proposed to the directors’ remuneration policy (which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM 
with 100% of the votes cast in favour of it). Therefore, we have included in this report, for ease of reference, only the ‘policy tables’ as  
set out in that approved policy; the full policy, as approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM held on 3 June 2015, is included in the 2014 
annual report and accounts available on the Company’s website at (www.arrowglobalir.net). The directors’ remuneration report (excluding 
the directors’ remuneration policy) will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2017 annual general meeting.
Annual statement
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present our directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2016. I succeeded 
Robin Phipps as chair of the remuneration committee after he stepped down from the board on 27 October 2016. I would like to thank 
Robin for his contribution in chairing this committee since the IPO. 
Remuneration policy and link to strategy
No changes are proposed to the operation of the remuneration policy in 2017. At the end of this statement, I have summarised the key 
aspects of our directors’ remuneration policy and how they relate to our overall corporate strategy.
Performance and variable pay outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2016
As described in the strategic report, the Company continues to perform strongly, delivering profitable earnings growth and strong 
progress against our strategy of diversifying by geography, asset class and revenue stream, while driving strong returns on investment, as 
summarised below. 
Underlying profit after tax Increased by 28.7% to £45.6 million
Underlying basic EPS Increased to 26.1p representing growth of 28.5%
Underlying ROE 29.1% ROE delivered
Strategic developments The executive directors and their teams have worked hard to achieve the successful integration  
of the Vesting acquisition, overlaying continued growth from attractive organic investments. 
Integration with the Zenith business in Italy, following completion of its acquisition, will form  
an important programme of work in 2017
Taking into account the performance achieved during the year, the executive directors have earned annual bonuses of:
> Tom Drury: £389,167; and
> Rob Memmott: £296,276.
Further rationale for these payments can be found on pages 73 to 75. Before approving the level of variable remuneration for 2016, the 
remuneration committee sought the views of the Group chief risk officer and the risk committee chairman on the effectiveness of the 
executive’s management of conduct and risk during the year. 
Recognising that Tom Drury was employed for the whole of 2016, the committee has awarded him a bonus based on the achievement of 
the applicable performance conditions. As with Rob Memmott, 33% of that bonus will be delivered in the form of deferred shares; further 
information is set out on page 73.
The first LTIP award, which was granted in March 2014, is scheduled to vest in March 2017 based on performance to 31 December 2016 assessed 
against EPS as regards 75% of the award and TSR as regards the balance. Since Tom Drury was employed for the whole of the three-year 
performance period, the committee permitted him to retain the benefit of this award, subject to the satisfaction of the performance 
conditions: further information is set out on page 70. Following an assessment of these performance conditions by the committee, the EPS 
element of the award vested in full and the TSR element vested as to 44.15%. This will deliver 171,456 shares to Tom Drury and 135,086 shares 
to Rob Memmott. Further details can be found on page 76. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 70
Directors’ and committee reports
DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
Base salary increases
As outlined in our remuneration report last year, the second of the two-year phased salary increases for Tom Drury and Rob Memmott, took 
effect in March 2016. Our approach to executive director salaries for 2017 is summarised below.
Executive director changes
As announced on 7 December 2016, Tom Drury stepped down as Group chief executive officer and as a director of the Company on 3 January 
2017 and left the business on 28 February 2017. Lee Rochford was appointed as Group chief executive officer and executive director with 
effect from 3 January 2017 .
Tom Drury
In summary, the remuneration arrangements in respect of Tom Drury’s departure, which are in line with the shareholder approved directors’ 
remuneration policy, are:
Annual bonus Recognising that Tom Drury was employed for the whole of 2016, he has earned a bonus for the  
year based on the achievement of the applicable performance conditions. 33% of the bonus will be 
delivered in the form of a deferred share award
Tom Drury will not be eligible to earn a bonus for the period of his service in 2017
Existing deferred  
bonus awards
Tom Drury holds deferred share awards in respect of his 2014 and 2015 bonuses. Recognising his 
contribution to the business over the relevant bonus periods and the fact that the awards were  
not subject to further performance conditions, Tom Drury will be eligible to retain these awards.  
The award granted on 9 April 2015 in respect of the 2014 bonus will vest in April 2018 as originally 
envisaged. The committee has decided to accelerate the vesting of the award granted on  
8 April 2016 in respect of the 2015 bonus from April 2019 to December 2018 
Both awards will remain subject to the malus and clawback provisions contained in the  
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) rules
LTIPs Tom Drury’s 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards lapsed on 28 February 2017
Recognising that Tom Drury was employed for the whole of the three-year performance period 
applying to the 2014 LTIP award, and his significant contribution to the business over that period,  
the committee has permitted Tom Drury to retain this award which, as noted above, will vest in  
March 2017 
Lee Rochford
The remuneration arrangements for Lee Rochford, which are line with the shareholder approved directors’ remuneration policy, are 
described on page 81. Lee Rochford’s base salary of £425,000 was set balancing the size and complexity of the Company, his remuneration 
package as a whole, his remuneration package at his previous employer, internal relativities and affordability to the Company, and ensuring 
that the Company does not pay more than is necessary; his overall package has been determined to reflect appropriate shareholder 
alignment through the balance of short, medium and long-term incentives.
Lee Rochford’s annual bonus and LTIP opportunity for 2017 will be the same as for Rob Memmott (and in line with the arrangements for 
2016). No ‘buyout’ or other recruitment award was made to Lee Rochford. Lee Rochford’s service agreement provides for a notice period 
of twelve months. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 71
Directors’ and committee reports
Looking forward to 2017
No changes to the policy or the overall structure of remuneration are proposed for 2017. Lee Rochford’s salary has been set at £425,000 
for 2017 as described above. Rob Memmott’s salary has been increased to £319,300 with effect from 1 March 2017, a 3% increase which is 
within the range of increases awarded to the wider workforce. The structure for the annual bonus and LTIP for 2017 remain the same as for 
2016, and further information is given on page 81. 
Committee evaluation
As part of the overall board evaluation review, the committee reviewed the findings in relation to its overall effectiveness. A small number 
of areas for further improvement were identified and will be acted upon. None were considered material, and overall committee members 
were satisfied with the performance of the committee during the year.
Changes to the committee composition
I succeeded Robin Phipps as chair of the remuneration committee following his stepping down from the board on 27 October 2016. 
Jonathan Bloomer, Iain Cornish and Andrew Fisher (appointed on 9 December 2016) are the other non-executive directors on this committee.
Overall, given the Group’s performance, I am comfortable that the absolute amounts earned by our executive directors are appropriate. 
The following pages describe in further detail how we have implemented our remuneration policy in respect of 2016, together with our 
plans for 2017 .

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
Our executive directors’ remuneration at a glance
We take a disciplined approach to the implementation of our remuneration policy to ensure that our remuneration framework rewards the 
right behaviours and supports the strategic goals of the Group. We have set out below an overview of how our remuneration policy supports 
the strategic objectives of the business.
Annual bonus 
performance metrics
We balance profit growth with other key financial and non-financial targets and specific personal 
objectives linked to our strategic goals of protecting and enhancing our market leading position, 
diversifying the business, delivering strong risk adjusted investment returns and developing our 
customer proposition
We ensure that the strategic goals are specific, measurable and fairly assessed
Annual bonus 
deferral
A proportion of any annual bonus is deferred into shares to ensure that executive directors  
consider the longer-term impact of decisions and the sustainability of the business 
LTIP The LTIP is designed to encourage behaviours which facilitate the delivery of sustainable growth  
of the business, whilst delivering value to stakeholders and promoting the long-term success  
of the Group. For 2016 and 2017:
>  50% is based on underlying basic EPS, aligned to the Company’s strategy to deliver earnings growth;
>  25% is based on underlying return on equity (ROE) which is a key driver of shareholder value and 
reflects the importance of purchasing debt of a suitable quality with an appropriate return; and
>  25% is based on TSR maintaining a link to share price performance and assessing our performance  
to that of peers, namely TSR currently relative to the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index (excluding 
investment trusts)  
Risk Variable remuneration targets are set at a level which reward high performance but which do not 
encourage inappropriate business risk 
Annual bonus payments determined by reference to the performance measures are subject to  
a review of the executive’s management of conduct and risk during the year. The vesting of LTIP 
awards granted from 2015 onwards is subject to a further underpin based on an assessment of risk 
management throughout the performance period 
All annual bonus and LTIP awards are subject to both malus and clawback provisions.
Shareholding 
requirements
Shareholding guidelines apply to all executive directors to align their long-term interests with  
those of shareholders 
In 2015, we increased these guidelines to 200% of salary for our chief executive officer and to 150%  
of salary for other executive directors Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 73

Long-term incentives reflect the value of the awards scheduled to vest in March 2017 based on performance over the three years to 31 December 2016. In accordance with the applicable 
regulations, the value is calculated as the number of shares that are expected to vest multiplied by the average share price over the three month period ending 31 December 2016 (£2.9468), 
plus the value of dividends paid over the period from grant to vesting (£25,546 in the case of Mr Drury and £20,128 in the case of Mr Memmott). Further information is provided on page 69 .

Mr Drury and Mr Memmott received a monthly cash allowance of 15% of salary in lieu of participation in a pension arrangement. The cash allowance is not included in the annual bonus  
or LTIP allocation.

2016 annual bonuses (audited information)
For 2016, executive directors were eligible for an annual performance related bonus of up to 125% of salary, subject to meeting stretching 
performance targets. To encourage behaviours that facilitate continued profitable growth and future development of the business, the 
2016 annual bonus was based on the following:
> 50% of the bonus was based on Group underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders (‘financial element out-turn’), and; 
>  50% was based on a balanced range of financial, strategic, personal and other key Group objectives (‘strategic business/personal objectives 
out-turn’)
The bonus payouts for 2016 are detailed in the table below. Further details on the how the elements of the bonuses have been earned are 
shown below.

33% of the bonus earned will be deferred into shares. In the case of Mr Memmott, the deferred share award will be deferred for a period of 
three years. In the case of Mr Drury, recognising his departure from the business, the deferred share award will vest on 31 December 2018. 
For both Messrs Memmott and Drury, the deferred award will be subject to malus during the deferral period and clawback for a period of 
three years from vesting.  Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 74
Directors’ and committee reports
Financial element out-turn:
The financial element of the 2016 annual bonus was based on achieving underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders, 
in accordance with the schedule below:
       Threshold*  Target*  Stretch*  Actual**
Performance level       £41.07m  £44.4m  £46.62m  £45.5m
Vesting (% of financial element)       20%  50%  100%  75%
 *Straight line vesting between the points.
 **This is underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders, adjusted for bonus purposes and is inclusive of the bonus cost.
Strategic business/personal objectives out-turn:
This element of the bonus was measured on achievement of clear personal objectives and targets which supported the strategic objectives 
of the business. The committee made a judgment based on the committee’s view of the relative importance and impact of each of the 
objectives and factors over the course of the year. Before approving the level of performance in 2016, the remuneration committee sought 
the views of the Group chief risk officer and the risk committee chairman on the effectiveness of the executive’s management of conduct 
and risk during the year.
The objectives and targets (together with commentary of their achievement) were:
Objective Achievement
Financial
>   Build servicing revenues to 15% of Group income 
>   Grow underlying basic EPS by >20%
>   Deliver underlying ROE in excess of 25% 
>   Meet collection targets and manage cost base  
according to budget
>   Further develop capability in the finance function,  
including Risk Weighted Analysis
>   Servicing revenue stream has developed strongly in 2016 as part 
of a move to a more diversified revenue base in line with Group 
strategy. It delivered 19.6% of Group income in 2016 
>   EPS continues to perform well and grew by 28.5% in 2016 
>   ROE similarly performed well and delivered 29.1% in 2016
>   Whilst costs ran ahead of budget for the year, the impact was 
offset by strong revenue performance from the Group’s 
collections streams, with targets being met
>   Several important hires were made across Group Finance which, 
amongst other things, has enabled the development and 
deployment of a Risk Weighted Analysis approach to decision 
making. This remains an emergent approach and will be  
further developed and refined in 2017
Market
>   Implement a pan-European portfolio acquisition approach, 
including further collaboration with credit funds and  
continuation of the build out of the European business
>   Invest in line with Group purchasing target and target

acquisitions in Benelux and Italy to continued collaboration with 
credit funds. The relevant acquisitions are in the process of 
embedding across the Group geographies
>   Investments made at target gross money multiple

Directors’ and committee reports
For the majority of 2016 the non-executive directors were paid a basic fee of £45,000 per annum, with further fees of £7,500 per annum 
being paid for chairing the remuneration committee, audit committee and risk committee and for holding the position of senior 
independent director. The non-executive Chairman’s fee was £160,000 per annum. As set out in the remuneration policy, non-executive 
director fees are reviewed periodically to comparable companies’ pay. These fees were last set at the time of the IPO in 2013. Following  
a peer benchmarking review by our remuneration consultants, it was resolved to increase the fees with effect from 1 January 2017 to the 
following levels:
> £55,000 per annum for the basic fee
> £10,000 per annum for committee chairs/senior independent director
> £170,000 per annum for the non-executive Chairman
Andrew Fisher was paid at the new fee level from appointment on 9 December 2016.
It is proposed that the fees for the non-executive Chairman or other non-executive directors will not be reviewed for another three years.

Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ shareholdings (audited information)
As set out in the remuneration policy, the committee encourages share ownership by the executive directors in order to align their interests 
with those of shareholders. It does this by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is delivered in shares (as well as being 
subject to performance conditions).
The shareholding requirement for executive directors was increased in March 2015 from 100% to 150% of salary (and 150% to 200% for the 
chief executive officer). Newly appointed directors are expected to acquire shares with a value of 100% of base salary within five years of 
appointment (150% in the case of Lee Rochford) and 150% of base salary (200% in the case of Lee Rochford) as soon as possible thereafter. 
Until the requirement has been met, executive directors must retain 50% of all vested LTIP awards (net of tax).
The actual shareholdings of our executive directors in office at the end of 2016 are significantly higher – 5,261% of salary for Tom Drury, 
and 2,255% of salary for Rob Memmott based on the number of shares held and closing share price at 31 December 2016.
Lee Rochford has already taken a significant step towards satisfaction of the guideline, acquiring 174,928 shares on 15 December 2016 for an 
aggregate cost of £496,515, meaning that his holding for the purposes of the guidelines was 123% of his starting salary based on the closing 
share price at 31 December 2016.

Directors’ and committee reports
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2017
Details of Lee Rochford’s remuneration arrangements which are effective from 3 January 2017 are as follows:
Service contract Notice period of twelve months
Salary >   £425,000 per annum
Bonus >   Up to 125% of base salary, subject to meeting performance targets 
>   50% of the bonus is based on financial targets
>   50% of the bonus is based upon a range of strategic and personal objectives 
>   33% of any bonus earned is deferred into shares for a three-year period
LTIP >   Nil cost option, subject to the discretion of the committee, equivalent to 150% of base salary
Shareholding >   Required to acquire a shareholding equivalent to 200% of salary – 150% within five years of 
appointment and 200% as soon as possible thereafter. Until the requirement has been met,  
Mr Rochford must retain 50% of all vested LTIP awards (net of tax)
>   Lee Rochford has already taken a significant step towards satisfaction of the guideline, as  
referred to on page 78 
Pension >   Contribution of up to 15% of salary
No changes are proposed to the policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2015 annual general meeting, and that policy will, 
therefore, apply for the year ending 31 December 2017 as follows:
(a) Base salaries
As noted above, Lee Rochford’s salary for 2017 has been set at £425,000. Rob Memmott’s salary for 2017 has been increased to £319,300 
with effect from 1 March 2017 , a 3% increase which is within the range of increases awarded to the wider workforce.
(b) Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity will remain at 125% of base salary. As for 2016, the 2017 annual bonus will be based on:
> 50% of the bonus will be based on underlying profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
> 50% of the bonus will be assessed against a balanced range of financial, strategic and other key Group objectives
The directors consider the targets under the annual bonus plan to be commercially sensitive because they provide the Group’s competitors 
with insight into the Group’s business plans, expectations and strategic actions. However, the committee will continue to disclose how the 
bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
33% of any bonus for 2017 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP in line with the approved remuneration policy. 
(c) LTIP
The maximum LTIP opportunity for 2017 will remain at 150%. 
The 2017 LTIP awards will be subject to the same performance conditions, being underlying EPS growth, underlying ROE and relative TSR 
performance, with the same weightings and vesting schedules, as apply to the 2016 LTIP awards as referred to on page 77 . Each performance 
condition will be measured over a three-year performance period from 2017 to 2019. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 82

REMUNERATION REPORT
The remuneration committee
Up to 9 December 2016, the committee consisted of two independent non-executive directors, namely Robin Phipps as Chair (until he 
stepped down from the board on 27 October 2016 when he was replaced as Chair by Lan Tu) and Iain Cornish. In addition, the Company 
Chairman, Jonathan Bloomer, who was considered independent on appointment, is a member of the committee. On 9 December 2016, 
Andrew Fisher was appointed to the board and joined the committee. The committee from that date consisted of three independent 
non-executive directors. The Company complies with the recommendations of the Code for companies outside the FTSE 350, concerning 
the number of independent non-executive directors that the committee should have.
The committee held three scheduled meetings during the year. Details of attendance by all members who held office during the year are 
set out below:

The terms of reference of the committee are on the Company website at (www.arrowglobalir.net).
Advisors
During the year, the committee was assisted in its work by Deloitte LLP, who were appointed as advisors in July 2014, following a comprehensive 
and thorough competitive tender. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under 
the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The total fees paid to Deloitte for providing remuneration 
advice were £20,000 for the year ended 31 December 2016. Deloitte also provided internal audit services and advice in relation to taxation 
during the year.
The committee will assess from time to time whether the appointment of Deloitte remains appropriate or should be put out to tender. 
The chief executive officer has also attended committee meetings to provide advice and respond to specific questions, but is not in attendance 
when his own remuneration is discussed. The company secretary acts as secretary to the committee.

AUDIT AND RISK  
COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to provide a report of the audit and risk committee’s activities in 2016.
The committee’s agenda in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2016 has once again been full. In addition to its primary roles, 
of monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting and reviewing the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, the 
committee has overseen various activities undertaken by management to further embed the systems of risk management and internal 
control across the enlarged Group.
The principal issues on which the committee focused in 2016 are set out in the report. These issues continue to be challenging and form 
an extensive list, particularly given the Group’s ongoing expansion and diversification. In spite of these challenges, I continue to have 
confidence that management are able to identify and manage risks and that the committee receives accurate and timely reports on the 
risk and control environment which allows it to discharge its responsibilities.
In August 2016, it was particularly pleasing to have confirmation that our UK business successfully achieved full FCA authorisation. This 
was the culmination of significant investment in people, systems and processes, which are designed to operate in a UK consumer credit 
world. In addition, authorisation was received from the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets in respect of the acquisition of 
Vesting in May 2016.
In my last report, I confirmed that Deloitte had been appointed as the Group’s internal auditors supplementing the in-house internal audit 
team that existed in our Portuguese business and replacing the original internal audit provider in the UK. During the year Deloitte has 
provided a robust audit service, which has provided the committee with a valuable opinion of the prevailing risk and control environment. 
Following the acquisition of Vesting, management have since been reviewing the risk and control framework in the Benelux business. 
Elements of the Group-risk framework have already been implemented, including the creation of a local executive risk committee which 
reports to our Group executive risk committee and finally, in turn, to the Group audit and risk committee. 
More widely, progress has been made in embedding the overall Group risk framework, though more work is required to make it fully 
effective. As we expand into new geographies, for example, through our proposed acquisition of Zenith in Italy, we intend to implement the 
Group risk framework, adapting this as appropriate to meet specific local requirements. During 2017 , we will also review our approach to the 
provision of internal audit services across the enlarged Group.
I am also able to confirm that, with effect from 25 January 2017 , we have operated separate audit and risk committees. The board, supported by 
the nomination committee, considered that, given the increased geographic footprint, complex regulatory environments and the 
consequent impact on risk exposures, it was now appropriate to have separate audit and risk committees, as is the case in many other 
listed financial services companies. I am pleased to confirm that my new colleague, Andrew Fisher, who has recent and relevant financial 
experience as well as having competence in both accounting and auditing, has taken up chairmanship of the audit committee and I continue 
to chair the risk committee as well as maintaining my membership of the audit committee.
During the year, a review of the performance of the external auditors took place. It was supplemented by the committee and senior members 
of the Group finance team completing a questionnaire. A summary of the key findings was reviewed by the committee in private without 
the external and internal auditors being present. The committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the external audit process.  Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 87
Directors’ and committee reports
In accordance with best practice, the committee has continued to keep the provision of non-audit services under review. Fees of £310,000 
were paid to our external auditors, KPMG, for non-audit services in the year, being work performed in relation to the issuance of the  
€230 million seven-year floating rate notes and the £220 million senior secured notes due 2024. Additionally, the auditors performed a 
control report for Vesting in its capacity as a service organisation. We anticipate the ratio of the Group’s non-audit fees to audit fees to 
reduce in 2017 and to continue to be low in future reporting periods. In addition, a revised non-audit services policy, which complies with 
best practice, has been adopted by the audit committee.
In relation to the financial statements, the committee continues to focus on those matters it considers to be important by virtue of their 
size, complexity, subjectivity or impact, and these are set out in this report.
On behalf of the board, the committee has also carried out a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems and found them to be adequate. 
As part of the overall board evaluation review, the committee reviewed the findings in relation to its overall effectiveness. A number of areas 
for further improvement were identified and will be acted upon. A common theme was that improvements were expected once the audit 
and risk functions were formally separated, which would allow fuller participation and more time to consider the issues. Participants also 
noted that the committee’s ongoing professional development to date had been undertaken by ’deep dives’ on certain key issues. It was 
felt by committee members that ‘deep dives’ should be complemented by specific training in some areas. None of the other observations 
were considered material, and overall committee members were satisfied with the performance of the committee during the year.
Robin Phipps stepped down from the board during the year. I would like to thank Robin for his contribution to the committee since the IPO. 
Both Maria Luís Albuquerque and Andrew Fisher joined the committee during the year. I am grateful to my fellow members on the committee 
and to our colleagues throughout the Group, who supported the work of the committee last year.

AUDIT AND RISK  
COMMITTEE REPORT
The committee’s 
responsibilities are set out  
in its terms of reference. 
They include responsibility 
for external and internal 
audit, financial reporting, 
narrative reporting,  
internal controls and risk 
management. The terms  
of reference also set  
out the authority of the 
committee to carry  
out its responsibilities. 
The committee focuses particularly on 
compliance with accounting policies and 
ensuring the maintenance of an effective 
system of internal financial control. It also 
monitors and reviews the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal audit function.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and 
approving the annual report remains with 
the board. The committee is also responsible 
for advising the board on the Group’s 
overall risk appetite and strategy, and for 
overseeing and advising the board on the 
current risk exposures of the Group and the 
overall risk management approach and 
systems of internal control. As part of this, 
the committee reviews the Group’s risk 
assessment processes and methodology and 
its capability for identifying and managing 
risk. In addition, it considers material 
proposed transactions and reviews reports 
on significant incidents and position 
against risk appetite.
The committee met eight times in 2016 
at the appropriate times in the financial 
reporting and audit cycle, and at such other 
times as required. Out of these eight 
meetings, there were an additional two risk 
meetings in 2016. The attendance of  
our members is shown in the table below. 
During 2016, the committee also  
met separately with representatives of  
the external auditor and the head of  
the internal audit function without any 
management present.
The Code recommends that, for companies 
outside the FTSE 350, the audit and risk 
committee comprises at least two members 
who are independent non-executive 
directors and includes one member with 
recent and relevant financial experience.  
For meetings held in 2016, the committee 
comprised of the following members:
Iain Cornish as Chair; Robin Phipps who 
stepped down from the board on 27 October 
2016; Lan Tu and Maria Luís Albuquerque 
(who was appointed to the board on  
9 March 2016). Andrew Fisher joined the 
committee following his appointment  
to the board on 9 December 2016. All are 
independent non-executive directors and 
therefore satisfy the Code’s requirements. 
Iain Cornish has recent and relevant 
financial experience, having held senior 
positions at Yorkshire Building Society until 
his retirement in 2011, as well as a number 
of other non-executive directorships as 
outlined on page 55.
Biographies of the members of the 
committee are set out on pages 54 and 55.

Directors’ and committee reports
Significant areas 
Significant areas considered by the 
committee and discussed with the external 
auditor during the year were:
Estimation of future cash collections 
from purchased loan portfolios:
The estimation of remaining collections from 
debt portfolios is complex and requires 
management to make significant judgment 
in relation to expected life, probability  
and value of related cash flows for each loan. 
The committee considered the value of  
the loan portfolio by reference to cash flow 
models. Management’s key assumptions 
were examined carefully by the committee, 
including the profile of expected future cash 
collection based on the Group’s historical 
collection experience and changes in 
collection strategies.
Value of purchased loan portfolio  
assets and setting of the EIR:
On acquisition of purchased loan portfolios, 
a short period of time is required to 
determine the EIR due to the complexity of 
the loan portfolios acquired. The committee 
considered the EIR of all portfolios and the 
judgments made by management relating 
to the expected life and related cash flows. 
The committee, together with the external 
auditor, considered the robustness of the 
EIRs which were found to be acceptable. The 
auditor’s 2015 observations on improving 
the processes around model governance, 
reconciliations and data inputs were 
incorporated in 2016. The portfolios are 
reviewed by management for any possible 
indications of impairment or enhancement 
at the statement of financial position date 
in accordance with IAS 39 – Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
The committee, together with the external 
auditor, considered the value of the loan 
portfolio by reference to cash flow models.
Vesting and Redrock acquisitions:
During the year the Group acquired the 
entire share capital of Vesting and Redrock. 
Management used the acquisition method  
in considering the appropriate acquisition 
accounting, following the steps required  
by IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations, 
to recognise assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed and measure goodwill. The 
committee reviewed the appropriateness 
of management’s fair value considerations 
and recognition of assets and liabilities on 
acquisition and approved management’s 
methodology.
Accounting for material transactions:
The Group is increasingly making equity 
investments in addition to purchasing 
portfolios in different asset classes and 
geographies, which can lead to new  
and sometimes complex transactions and 
accounting. The buying process is a 
multi-stage approach. The underwriting 
process includes a four-stage approval,  
or gate, process before presentation of the 
investment memorandum to the investment 
committee. The committee then 
determines whether to recommend the 
purchase to the board (when material or 
complex) in advance of submission of a final 
bid. For material and complex transactions, 
the finance team are involved throughout 
the process and, where appropriate, 
accounting papers are produced and 
disclosed for discussions with the external 
auditor and approval by the audit and  
risk committee. 
Internal control and risk  
management systems:
The committee is responsible for 
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems. Through monitoring 
the effectiveness of its internal controls  
and risk management, the committee is able 
to maintain a good understanding of 
business performance, key judgmental 
areas and management’s decision-making 
processes. The committee considered  
the adequacy of management’s response  
to matters raised and the implementation 
of recommendations made. The committee 
carried out the following in 2016:
>  reviewed the framework and effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls
>  received regular updates from management 
on internal control improvements and 
requested that KPMG report on progress  
as part of their year end work
>  reviewed comprehensive reports from  
the external auditor, KPMG, of the results  
of their controls testing as part of the 
external audit
>  reported to the board on its evaluation of the 
operation of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management system, informed by 
reports from Deloitte and KPMG.
External auditor:
The committee carried out the following in 
relation to the external auditor:
>  considered and approved the proposed 
materiality and audit plan prepared
>  considered the quality and effectiveness of 
the external audit process, in light of the 
FRC’s Guidance on Audit Quality – Practice 
aid for audit committees (May 2015). The 
assessment of this effectiveness was 
completed as part of an ongoing process  
of review throughout the year, with the 
committee seeking assurances and 
understanding of the auditor’s approach  
to the audit. The committee considered 
the FRC Audit Quality Review of KPMG and 
discussed the actions taken by KPMG in 
light of the recommendations. A 
questionnaire was completed by members 
of the committee and senior members of 
the finance team (which included 
consideration of the effectiveness of KPMG, 
their approach, fulfilment of the agreed 
audit plan, their handling of key accounting 
and audit judgments, assessments of 
significant risks, communication, 
independence, objectivity and reporting).  
A summary of the results of the 
questionnaire were discussed by the 
committee, with the results communicated 
by the Chairman of the committee to  
the KPMG lead engagement partner and  
the findings presented to the board.  
The committee were satisfied with KPMG’s 
performance and there was nothing of 
concern that would impact on the 
effectiveness of the external audit process Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 92
Directors’ and committee reports
AUDIT AND RISK  
COMMITTEE REPORT
>  reviewed comprehensive reports from the 
external auditors of the results of their 
controls testing as part of the external audit
>  concluded and implemented the Group’s 
policy on the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor
>  Having considered KPMG’s independence, 
compliance with regulatory and ethical 
standards, and assessed its objectivity, the 
committee unanimously recommended to 
the board that a resolution for the 
re-appointment of KPMG LLP as the Group’s 
external auditor be proposed to 
shareholders at the 2017 annual general 
meeting.
The external auditor, KPMG, was appointed 
in July 2014 following a comprehensive and 
thorough competitive tender. The lead 
audit partner will rotate every five years to 
ensure independence. The KPMG lead audit 
partner will not be rotated until July 2019 in 
accordance with the FRC’s Revised Ethical 
Standard 2016. The external audit contract 
will be tendered at least every 10 years as 
prescribed by EU and UK legislation, with a 
change of auditor after 20 years.
Both the committee and the external 
auditor have in place safeguards to avoid 
any compromise of the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. The 
committee considers the independence of 
the external auditor annually and the Group 
has a formal policy for the engagement of 
its external auditor to supply non-audit 
services. The policy is designed to ensure 
that neither the nature of the service to be 
provided nor the level of reliance placed on 
the services could impact the objectivity of 
the external auditor’s opinion on the 
Group’s financial statements.
The policy precludes the appointment 
of the external auditor to provide certain 
prohibited services as set out in the FRC 
Guidance on Audit Committees 2016 and 
the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2016, as 
well as setting out where certain types of 
non-audit services for which the use of the 
external auditor are pre-approved. New EU 
legislation on permitted non-audit services 
came into effect from 17 June 2016, which 
introduced a permitted non-audit services 
fee cap of 70% of the average audit fee over 
a consecutive three-year period. This cap 
will come into effect for the Group in the 
financial year ending 31 December 2020. 
Internal audit
Following a comprehensive and thorough 
competitive tender, Deloitte were 
appointed by the board in October 2015 to 
provide an internal audit function to the 
Group.
In 2016, the committee carried out the 
following:
>  continued to oversee the activities of the 
internal audit function, recognising that in 
the UK full FCA authorisation brings with it 
an even higher expectation in terms of 
customer outcomes and conduct risk
>  reviewed and approved the internal audit 
plan which defines the scope of work that 
internal audit function will carry out
>  reviewed results from audits performed, 
having particular scrutiny over 
unsatisfactory audit findings and related 
action plans
>  reviewed open audit actions, together with 
monitoring progress against the actions
>  reviewed the assurance map to ensure 
there is clear and comprehensive risk and 
assurance coverage
>  met with the lead internal audit partner on 
six occasions
During the year, the committee monitored 
progress of the internal audit function 
against that plan, ensuring that the internal 
audit function had sufficient resource to 
carry out its duties effectively. Reports on 
internal audit work have been received by 
the committee and, where necessary, 
appropriate actions have been 
recommended to the board. The results of 
this work, together with the committee’s 
engagement with the management 
information of the Group and the executive 
directors, have enabled them to conclude 
that the statements given on pages 63 and 
64 of the corporate governance report 
relating to the Group’s systems of internal 
control and its management of risk are 
appropriate. 
Separation of audit and risk committees
As stated in the audit and risk committee 
chairman’s statement on page 86 and 87, 
separate audit and risk committees were 
set up with effect from 25 January 2017 . Each 
committee has its own terms of reference 
which can be found on the company’s 
website at (www.arrowglobalir.net).
Andrew Fisher chairs the audit 
committee and remains a member of the 
risk committee. Andrew Fisher has recent 
and relevant financial experience, as well as 
having competence both in accounting 
and auditing, gained as finance director of 
Provident Financial Plc. Iain Cornish 
continues to chair the risk committee and 
remains a member of the audit committee. 
The members of the separate audit and  
risk committees, effective from 25 January 
2017 are: Iain Cornish, Andrew Fisher,  
Maria Luís Albuquerque and Lan Tu. All are 
independent non-executive directors.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2015):
The risk Our response
Carrying value of purchased 
loan portfolios and loan notes
(£804.1 million; 2015: £610.7
million)
Refer to critical accounting 
estimates and judgements in note 
4 of the financial statements, the 
audit and risk committee report 
on pages 86 to 92 and note 16 in 
the audited part of financial 
statements.
Forecast-based valuation:
The Group’s estimate of the future 
cash collections from the loan portfolios 
is the key variable in determining the 
Effective Interest Rate (‘EIR’) and any 
subsequent revenue adjustments. 
Given the nature of the company’s debt 
portfolios, estimation of future cash 
collections requires significant 
judgement. The Group uses cash flow 
forecasting models to calculate an initial 
estimate of future collections. The 
assumptions used in the models 
include the value, probability and timing 
of expected future cash flows for each 
type of asset class within a portfolio. 
These estimates are subject to ongoing 
review by management to assess 
reasonableness, comparing actual 
performance against previous 
forecasts. Estimates of future cash 
flows are impacted by management’s 
approach to managing the portfolios 
(e.g. changes in collection policies or 
use of specialist collectors). Where 
management believe changes in the 
approach to managing portfolios may 
lead to changes in these estimates 
these are factored into the Group’s 
future cash collection forecasts.
Due to the level of subjectivity inherent 
in the assumptions used in the cash 
flow forecasting models this is a key 
judgement area for our audit.
Our procedures included:
— Controls design: assessing the design and 
operating effectiveness of controls over 
data used in the cash flow forecasting 
models driving the estimated future cash 
flows; 
— Governance controls: assessing the 
design and operating effectiveness of 
controls that cover the outputs of the 
models and manual adjustments to ensure 
that these have been scrutinised by 
appropriate management personnel; 
— Our sector experience: critically assessing 
the cash flow forecast and any manual 
adjustments made by the Group with 
reference to our understanding of the 
Group and industry; and
— Historical comparisons: critically 
assessing the cash flow forecasts and any 
manual adjustments made by the Group 
with reference to our understanding of the 
current and past performance of the 
Group’s portfolios, including recent cash 
collections. 95
The risk Our response
Fair value of portfolios and 
intangibles acquired as part of 
business combinations
(£49.6 million)
Refer to the critical accounting 
estimates and judgements in note 
4 of the financial statements, the 
audit and risk committee report 
on pages 86 to 92 and note 31 in 
the audited part of financial 
statements.
Forecast-based valuation
During the year ended 31 December 
2016, the Group acquired InVesting B.V  
in The Netherlands and Belgium, and 
Redrock Capital Partners S.A  in 
Portugal with the assets and liabilities 
purchased being accounted for at fair 
values at the date of acquisition.
The Group prepared the acquisition 
balance sheets based on their estimate 
of the fair value of assets and liabilities 
acquired. In particular, they prepared 
discounted cash flow models to arrive 
at their estimates of fair value for loan 
asset portfolios and customer 
relationships .This required them to 
exercise judgement in relation to 
determining the expected cash flows 
from the assets and the discount rates 
used.
Our procedures included: 
Acquired loan portfolios
— Our sector experience: challenging the 
assumptions, including the value, 
probability and timing of cash flows used in 
calculating the fair value of the acquired 
loan asset portfolios as outlined in the 
“Estimation of future cash collections on 
debt portfolios” section of this report; and
— Historical comparisons: assessing the 
discount rates used in calculating the fair 
value of the acquired loan asset portfolios 
with reference to the risks associated with 
similar loan portfolios previously acquired. 
Acquired customer relationships
— Our sector experience: challenging the 
assumptions, including value, probability 
and timing of cash flows, made in 
calculating the fair value assigned to the 
customer relationship intangible with 
reference to the business plan, existing 
customer contracts and our knowledge of 
the industry; and
— Historical comparison: assessing whether 
the discount rate used in calculating the fair 
value of the customer relationships 
intangible reflected market conditions 
based on our knowledge of the industry. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement (cont.) 96
The Group audit team instructed the component auditors as to 
the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks 
detailed above and the information to be reported back. The 
Group audit team approved the component materiality of £1.0 
million (2015: £1.0 million), having regard to the size and risk 
profile of Group across the components.
The Group audit team managed and co-ordinated the 
component auditors in the following ways:
At the planning stage, the Group audit team visited component 
audit teams where necessary, participated in site visits, and 
held telephone calls and face-to-face discussions with the 
components audit teams to discuss audit risks and strategy.
During the audit, the Group audit team held regular telephone 
calls with the component audit teams. Through the calls and 
meetings, the findings and observations reported to the Group 
audit team were discussed in more detail and any further work 
required by the Group audit team was then performed by the 
components auditors.
In addition, the Group audit team participated in the audit close 
out meetings of the component teams to all material issues 
affecting the Group are identified and communicated back to 
Arrow Global Group Plc.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £1.9 million, determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation normalised to 
exclude a current year one-off expenses of £23 million in 
relation to the Group’s acquisitions and debt refinancing 
set out on page 100. The group team performed 
procedures on the items excluded from normalised 
group profit before tax. The materiality represents 3.5% 
of the Group’s reported profit before taxation as 
normalised.
In 2015, the materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £1.8 million, 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Group 
profit before tax (PBT), of which it represented 4.6%. 
We report to the audit committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £95,000 
(2015: £90,000), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
How we scoped our audit:
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed on 
all four (2015: three) reporting components, which were:
— Group holding company;
— UK operating and non-operating subsidiaries;
— The Portuguese operating and non-operating 
subsidiaries; and
— The Benelux operating and non-operating 
subsidiaries which include entities in Netherlands 
and Belgium.
The components scoped in for Group reporting purposes 
accounted for 100% of Group revenue, 100% of Group 
profit before tax and 100% of Group total assets.
The audit of the Portuguese and Benelux components 
was performed by component audit teams in Portugal, 
Netherlands and Belgium. The audit of the Group holding 
company, UK operating and non operating subsidiaries 
and consolidation was performed by the Group audit 
team.

In our opinion:
— the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
— the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
— we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and  
— in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to:
— the directors’ statement of viability on page 51, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over 
the three years to 2020; or
— the disclosures in note 3 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the audit committee report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
— the directors’ statements, set out on pages 51 and 105, 
in relation to going concern and longer term viability; 
and   
— the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
page 61 relating to the company’s compliance with the 
eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 60, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the 
scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be 
read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Financial statements
1  General information
Arrow Global Group Plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales and is the ultimate parent Company of the Group. The address  
of the registered office is presented on the inside cover. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
The Company’s subsidiaries and associate, both direct and indirect, at this date are listed in note 23.
The Group’s principal activity is to identify, acquire and manage secured and unsecured defaulted loan portfolios from financial institutions, 
such as banks and credit card companies, as well as retail chains, student loans, motor credit, telecommunication firms and utility companies.
The Group’s and the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted for use in the EU, and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IFRS Regulation. The accounting policies have been applied 
consistently in the current and prior periods.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes of the Company have not been 
presented in this annual report and accounts.
2  Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year beginning 1 January 2016:
> IFRS 11 (amendments) Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations 
> IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendments) Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation 
> IAS 27 (amendments) Equity method in separate financial statements
> Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle 
> IAS 1 (amendments) Disclosure initiative 
During 2016, these new standards and interpretations had an insignificant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been endorsed but are not yet effective for these financial statements 
and have not been early adopted:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
New reporting requirements under IFRS 9 introduce forward looking credit loss models which will lead to changes in timing of 
impairment recognition. We continue to assess the impact of IFRS 9 and have implemented a project plan to ensure compliance with the 
new standard ahead of its proposed implementation date of 1 January 2018. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts. Management are assessing the impact of IFRS 15 on future periods, in 
particular by considering the asset management contracts with customers in relation to contingency collection fees, due diligence, real 
estate management and advisory fees. 
Other standards
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been issued but are not yet endorsed or effective for these financial 
statements and have not been early adopted:
> IAS 7 (amendments) Disclosure initiative 
> IAS 12 (amendments) Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
> IFRS 16 Leases
> IFRS 2 (amendments) Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions
> IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations. So far, the Group does not expect any significant impact. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 105
Financial statements
3  Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and also, the Group financial 
statements comply with EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than the fair value of derivative 
contracts and the amortised cost value of portfolio assets.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 2016 and comparative period. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with its investee entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the 
investee entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Also see the accounting policy ‘shares held in an employee benefit trust’ (EBT).
Going concern
The directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the foreseeable future. 
The directors have given this matter due consideration through a review of forecast cash flow models and scenarios and current cash 
availability and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis. Refer to the 
statement of viability on page 51 for further details of the going concern assessment.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) (Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred 
tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured in accordance 
with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits) respectively.
IFRS 3 allows a measurement period of up to one year after acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that were made available to the Group at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net 
of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If after reassessment, the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the 
excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. 
Certain assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate 
discount rate.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis in relation to 
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On a business combination the portfolio investments are remeasured to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, 
calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or loss on disposal.

Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant 
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 to 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity, or can demonstrate 
significant influence, or evidence through a number of aspects such as representation on the board of directors, participation in policy 
making and decisions, material transactions between the entity and investee, interchange of managerial personnel or provision of 
essential technical information. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The 
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of the associate 
from the date that significant influence commences until the date that it ceases.
Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method (EIR) Income from purchased loan portfolios
Income from purchased loan portfolios represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments. Purchased loan portfolios are financial 
instruments that are accounted for under IAS 39 and recognised at fair value at the purchase date that equals the price paid. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a purchased loan portfolio and of allocating interest income over the 
expected life of the portfolio. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 84-months of estimated future cash receipts of the purchased 
portfolio asset to the net carrying amount at initial recognition (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). 
Upward revaluations (‘write-ups’) are increases to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt portfolios as a result of 
reassessments to their estimated future cash flows and are recognised in the income from purchased loan portfolios line within revenue, 
with any subsequent reversals to write-ups also recorded in this line. If these reversals (‘write-downs’) exceed any previously recognised 
cumulative write-ups (i.e. a write-down reduces the portfolio carrying amount below its initial purchase price) then impairment is 
recognised as a separate line in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Unallocated cash is held as a liability in the statement of financial position until it is reconciled. Unallocated cash is held as liability until all 
reasonable steps have been taken to show that it has been extinguished, only being released to the consolidated statement of profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income at this point.
Where the Group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward flow agreements, being contracted multiple future purchases, there is no 
difference in accounting treatment than described above.
Impairment of purchased loan portfolios
The portfolios are reviewed for indications of impairment at the statement of financial position date, such as variances to historical cash curves, 
in accordance with IAS 39 . This is considered on a portfolio basis. Where portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, an adjustment, 
being the difference between the current carrying value and the net present value of future estimated cash flows, is recorded to the 
carrying value of the portfolio.
Revenue on assets under management
The Group receives asset management revenue on portfolios managed for third parties in the UK, Portugal and the Netherlands. In 
accordance with IAS 18, the Company recognises revenue on its managed services contracts when the right to receive such revenue is 
reasonably assured and can be measured reliably. The nature of the revenue is contingency collection fees, which are received either as a 
fixed fee, or as a percentage of collections or the outstanding portfolio asset value.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size and nature (i.e. outside of the normal underlying 
operating activities of the Group) to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. These are disclosed 
separately on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Current year non-recurring items are 
explained in notes 8, 10 and 11. The identification of these items has significance as the resulting underlying profit is one of the key 
determinants of dividends payable.
Interest income from secured loan notes
The Group has entered into lending arrangements with third parties to provide capital to purchase non-performing consumer debt portfolios 
(see note 16). Interest income is recognised throughout the year using the EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected life.

Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as the employees provide services to the Group.
The Group has, for the period covered by these financial statements, made contributions to defined contribution plans to provide pension 
benefits for employees upon retirement.
A number of employees of Vesting Finance are entitled to pension benefits that the company has insured through a contract with an 
insurance company. The arrangement meets the definition of a defined benefit plan and the insurance policy represents qualifying plan 
assets of the scheme.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of the defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of plan assets from the insurance policy.
The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed at acquisition and then annually by a qualified actuary. When the calculation 
results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits in the form of any 
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of future economic benefits, 
consideration is given to the applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) 
and the effect of the ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately through the other-comprehensive income. The Group 
determines the net interest expense on the net defined liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined 
benefit obligation at acquisition or the beginning of the annual period to the then net-defined benefit liability during the period as a result 
of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to the defined benefit pension plan are recognised 
in profit or loss.
When the benefits of the plan are changed or when the plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the 
gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. The Group recognises gains and losses 
in the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial position 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions entered 
into to hedge certain foreign currency risks.
For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions 
are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the other-comprehensive income.
Leases
Assets leased are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownerships to the lessee 
but not necessarily legal title. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic 
benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit for the year and is provided at amounts expected 
to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date. Taxable profit 
differs from the net profit as reported in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Current taxation is 
charged or credited in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited to 
equity, in which case the corporation taxation is also dealt with in equity.

3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, 
using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in 
which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at each reporting date. The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred taxation  
is charged or credited in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in equity.
Share based payment transactions
Share based payments transactions in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are 
accounted for as equity-settled share based payments.
The grant date fair value of the share based payment granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted 
is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that 
do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share based payments with non-vesting 
conditions, the grant date fair value of the share based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences 
between expected and actual outcomes. Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries, the 
costs are recharged to the subsidiary in line with the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’.
Shares held in an employee benefit trust (EBT)
Transactions of the Company sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore, reflected in these financial 
statements.
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, as discussed below, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write-off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line 
method on the following basis:
Furniture five years 
Computer equipment three years 
Leasehold improvements five years
Software licences shorter of contractual life and useful economic life
IT platform  useful economic life
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
Acquired licences, such as software licences, are capitalised at cost and amortised over the shorter of contractual life and useful economic life.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes
The Group’s purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. Under IAS 39, such assets are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and are measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method less any impairment.
Purchased loan portfolios are acquired at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future cash flows reflect the likely credit losses within 
each portfolio. The portfolio investments are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The portfolio asset is analysed as current in the statement of financial position as part of the Group’s normal operating cycle. 
As part of the Group’s litigation strategy to recover customer balances, the Group incurs legal costs. Where these are considered recoverable 
these are included within the estimated forecasts of future cash flows within the purchased loan portfolios balance.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the 
rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial 
asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does 
not retain control of the financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the 
portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability 
assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in the OCI is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is 
recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the consideration required to 
settle that obligation at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities, such as loan notes, or as equity in accordance with the substance 
of the contractual arrangement and in conjunction with the application of IFRS.
Financial liabilities are held at amortised cost using the EIR method. The EIR is calculated by estimating the cash flows arising from the 
contractual terms of the instrument over its expected life. Transaction costs are included within the EIR and deducted from the initial 
carrying value of the debt instrument.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage the interest rate 
and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
All derivative financial instruments are assessed against the hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s derivatives 
are cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions and meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. Derivatives are initially 
recognised at the fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date at their 
fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value are recognised immediately within the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and where the hedge 
accounting criteria are met, the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as part of 
finance costs. Amounts accumulated in equity are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the 
income or expense on the hedged item is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
> it is evident from testing that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge;
> the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised; or,
> the underlying hedged item matures or is sold or repaired.

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are stated 
subsequently at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in  
the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. Borrowings are 
classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after 
the statement of financial position date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Legal transaction fees
Legal transaction fees associated with the purchase of portfolios are allocated to the purchase price of the portfolio and included within the 
EIR applied against the asset value.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses relate to administration and costs associated with collection activities. All operating costs are accounted for on an 
accruals basis.
Fair value measurements
The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance with IFRS 13 in the manner described in note 26.
Other reserves
Other reserves include the own share reserve, the translation reserve and the merger reserve. These reserves are further explained on the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 102.
4  Critical accounting judgments and estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
year in which the estimate is revised.
Critical judgments in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgments that have been made in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies and that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
a) Approach to substance of loan notes as portfolios
The Group has purchased a number of loan notes in entities that in turn have legal ownership of underlying loan portfolios. The Group has 
assessed the substance of the loan notes under the criteria set out in IAS 39 to determine whether to account for the underlying portfolio 
loan assets or to recognise an investment in the loan note asset in the entity that has issued the loan notes. 
The decision is based on whether the circumstances meet the requirements of IAS 39, paragraph 19, which deems that the Group would 
recognise its proportionate share of the asset on balance sheet as portfolio loan assets, where the following criteria are met: 
> the loan note issuing entity has no obligation to pay amounts to the Group unless it collects equivalent amounts from the original asset; 
>  the loan note issuing entity is prohibited by the terms of the transfer contract from selling or pledging the original asset other than as 
security to the Group for the obligation to pay them cash flows; and
> the loan note issuing entity has an obligation to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the Group without material delay.
Essentially where the risks and rewards of the loan portfolio assets sit with the Group rather than the issuer of the loan notes, it is appropriate for 
the entity issuing the loan notes to derecognise the underlying asset, and the Group to recognise their proportionate share. 
If these criteria are met the Group recognises its appropriate share of the underlying loan portfolios and if criteria are not met then the 
Group recognises an investment in the loan notes.

Key sources of assumption and estimation uncertainty in applying accounting policies
The following are the key sources of assumption and estimation uncertainty that have been made in the process of applying the entity’s 
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
a) Fair value of acquisition statement of financial position and carrying value of goodwill
The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies. Goodwill is the excess of the 
consideration paid over the fair value of its net assets, therefore the fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill 
recognised on acquisition. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgment, 
particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired loan portfolios and 
customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the 
goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities. Further detail on the valuation of acquired loan portfolios 
is given in section b) below. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that it might be impaired e.g. financial performance of the respective acquired entity/CGU is significantly below expectations. Determining 
whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the 
value in use requires an estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU, which are discounted by an 
appropriate discount rate to calculate a present value of the future cash flows. The discount rate applied is the Group’s weighted average 
cost of capital with an adjustment to reflect the specific risk characteristics of the CGU. This calculation inherently involves a number of 
judgments in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the normal requirement of management reporting, and the 
appropriate discount rate relevant to the CGU is an estimate.
Sensitivities have been considered in note 13.
b) Carrying value and EIR of purchased loan portfolios
84-month cash flow forecasts are prepared for each portfolio on an account basis. These forecasts are generated using statistical 
models incorporating a number of factors, including predictions of probability to pay, which is informed by customer and account level 
data, credit agency data and our historic experience with accounts which have similar key attributes. A further key model input is 
previous payments made by a customer. Additionally estimates are made of the movement of accounts from non-paying to paying, and 
vice-versa, either through breakdown of the account or settlement/pay down of the balances due. In relation to non-paying accounts, 
assumptions will be made as to which operational strategy is the most appropriate to move the account to paying status, this may 
include placing these accounts into litigation. Operational factors, that may impact future estimated cash flows, are also considered 
such as improved collections processes and systems.
Management also review the model on a portfolio basis to take into account external factors, which have impacted historical or will 
impact future performance and where necessary portfolios are calibrated to take into account these known factors. The assumptions 
and estimates made are specific to the particular characteristics of each portfolio. 
The ERCs created from the ERC forecasting models, are regularly benchmarked at a portfolio level against actuals, this informs the 
decision as to whether a write-up or write-down may be required. 
An impairment is only recognised if the ‘write-downs’ exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups and revenue recognised.
Write-downs to the total loan portfolio balance occurred in the year as a result of changed expectations of credit balances and a historic 
claim on one of the Portuguese portfolios. These were more than offset by write-ups on a number of other portfolios. 
The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgment in these financial statements. Flexing the 
expected future gross cash flows by -1/+1% would impact the closing carrying value of the purchased loan portfolios as at 31 December 2016 
by £7,044,000 (2015: £4,123,000). Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by -3/+3% would impact the closing carrying value of the 
purchased loan portfolios as at 31 December 2016 by £21,131,000 (2015: £12,368,000).
c) Measurement of the defined benefit liability
The carrying value of the liabilities relating to the defined benefit pension scheme is valued using an actuarial valuation. The valuation is 
based on assumptions. All the assumptions used are estimates of future events. Further details about the key assumptions used are 
given in note 24.

Collections information is available for the UK and the wider-European operations. This is the only information analysed between the UK

In the current year, we have recognised through current tax, a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset in relation to prior year losses 
been recognised, which with profits in associate accounted for net of tax, deflates the current year tax charge. This is offset by an increase 
in expenses not deductible for tax purposes largely due to current year subsidiary acquisition costs, a higher level of taxable income coming 
from overseas countries with higher tax rates and a chargeable gain. 
Deferred tax
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £14,335,000 (2015: £28,168,000) of tax losses carried forward, due to 
uncertainties over the future utilisation of the losses including the future profitability of the relevant subsidiaries. These losses may be 
available for offset against future profits and have no expiry date.
The Finance Act 2016, which was substantively enacted in September 2016, included provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax from 
20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods 
in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the statement of financial position date. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have generally been calculated using a rate of 17% in these 
accounts, apart from balances on overseas companies that are recognised at the relevant rate applicable in the appropriate jurisdictions.
Non-recurring tax
We have identified non-recurring items in the year amounting to £23,016,000 (2015: £4,309 ,000), with a £3,755,000 (2015: £657 ,000) associated 
tax impact. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 117

12  Dividend
Dividends of £14,123,000 have been included in these financial statements, being the 2015 final dividend of 5.4p per share and the 2016 
interim dividend of 2.7p per share. A final dividend for 2016 has been proposed of 6.4p per share taking the total declared and proposed 
dividends for the year ended 31 December 2016 to 9.1p, being 35% of underlying profit after tax. The proposed final dividend is subject to 
approval at the annual general meeting and has, therefore, not been included as a liability in these financial statements. 
The 2016 interim dividend was declared at 50% of the 2015 final dividend with the subsequent final dividend being proposed based on 
the underlying profit after tax for the year.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 8 June 2017 with a record date of 9 June 2017 and a payment date of 6 July 2017 . Shareholders 
will have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the Company through a dividend 
reinvestment plan.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business 
combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to four aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest 
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and are not larger than the single operating segment defined 
under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments). In relation to goodwill, the four CGUs identified are Benelux, comprising of all the Group companies 
acquired in the Vesting acquisition, Capquest group, comprising all group companies acquired in the Capquest acquisition, Portugal, 
comprising of all the Group companies acquired in the Whitestar, Gesphone and Redrock acquisitions, and Arrow Global Receivables 
Management Limited (‘AGRML’). The Benelux, Capquest and Portugal CGUs, represent the cash flows generated principally from 
collections on acquired purchased loan portfolios and management of third party debt, and the AGRML CGU represents the cash flows 
generated principally from collections on purchased loan portfolios.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:

An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2016 that resulted in no impairment to goodwill. The goodwill was assessed to be 
appropriately stated. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might  
be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the 
value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate and forecast cash collections net of direct collection costs, and allowable 
forecast synergies. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 118
Financial statements
 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
13  Goodwill (continued)
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the CGUs. The starting point for determining the discount rates for each CGU was to use the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital (‘WACC’), and adjust this for specific factors for each of the CGUs to derive a market participant’s rate. The factors took into account 
the risks inherent in each of the CGUs, such as currency, regulatory, and economic risks and the different operations in the CGUs were also 
considered. As a result of applying the various risk factors noted above to the Group’s WACC, a market participant rate of 6.09% was 
determined for the AGRML and Capquest CGUs, a rate of 6.84% was determined for the Portuguese CGU, and a rate of 6.34% was determined 
for the Benelux CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and 
extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity. The forecasts assume growth rates in collection activity which in turn drive the forecast collections 
and cost figures. These assumptions are in keeping with the directors’ expectations of future growth. Appropriate tax rates are applied to the 
cash flow forecasts for each CGU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGUs carrying value. The CGUs would become impaired based 
on an unlevered post tax cash flow noted below, or based on an increase in the discount rate noted below.

             2016
             £000
Net defined benefit liability             1,721
A number of employees of Vesting Finance are entitled to pension benefits that the company has insured through a contract with an 
insurance company. The arrangement meets the definition of a defined benefit plan and the insurance policy represents qualifying  
plan assets of the scheme. The scheme has been recognised since the acquisition of Vesting in May 2016, therefore December 2015 
comparatives are not shown.
The plan is governed by the ‘Pensioenwet’ (the Dutch pension act) and the minimum of vested benefits at the date of departure of an 
employee in a defined benefit pension plan is equal to the difference between the total benefit which would be accrued if the participant 
would remain a participant until the pensionable age and the benefits which can be accrued between the date of departure and the date 
in which the participant would reach their pensionable age. The scheme is funded by a contract with an insurance company to cover the 
committed pension benefits.
The defined benefit plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market 
(investment) risk.

Risk management
Treasury related risks
The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The board delegates certain 
responsibilities to the treasury and tax committee. The treasury and tax committee, which is chaired by the chief financial officer, is 
empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority. Treasury activities and compliance with treasury policies are reported to 
the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are 
designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and 
market risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure the Group is properly funded, that financial counterparties 
are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits. Policies also set out the specific 
instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts. 
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s business operations.  
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options. No 
written options were entered into during 2016 (2015: £nil). Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 129

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled 
by cash or another financial asset.
The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth. 
The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed 
debt facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress testing for the next 18 months on a rolling 
basis. Further, the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates, diversification of debt funding 
sources and no over-reliance on a single or small group of lenders. At 31 December 2016, the Group’s senior secured notes and revolving 
credit facility had an average period to maturity of 5.8 years (2015: 5.0 years). Total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2016 were 
£103,721,000 (2015: £90,000,000).
The treasury function monitors cash through daily reporting, the management accounts and periodic review meetings. Management has 
well established models used to predict collectability of cash receipts and this represents a key performance indicator of the business. The 
Group has a low fixed cost base, is highly cash generative with weekly cash receipts and portfolio purchases (except forward flows) are 
discretionary, which helps to mitigate liquidity risk.
The table below includes both interest and principal cash flows, payable over the contractual life of the non-derivative financial liabilities.

The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. 
Where borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield 
curves at the statement of financial position date.
In addition to the above the Group has entered in to certain forward flow agreements to which it has committed to pay £12,309,000 (2015:

25  Risks arising from financial instruments (continued)
Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk principally comprises interest rate risk and currency risk considered further below.
Interest rate risk
The Group does have an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates on its borrowings, principally on the senior 
secured notes, and therefore seeks to limit this exposure. This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest rate costs, including fixed 
rate funding (predominantly longer-term bond funding), forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding, bank 
borrowing loan draw down periods and interest rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the interest rate costs on a 
proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time. Most hedging is for up to three years.
If interest rates across all countries of operation increased by 50 basis points this would have the following impact:
           Year ended  Year ended
           31 December  31 December
           2016  2015
           £000  £000
Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity         2,570  2,428
Reduction in profit before taxation           (656 ) (304 )
This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
> the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative financial instruments;
>  where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there 
is no impact from a change in interest rates; and
> changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Currency risk
The Group is subject to three types of currency risk; cash flow exposure, net asset exposure and income statement exposure.
Cash flow exposure
The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency. The policy of the Group  
is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months. Where 
cash flow hedges have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Net asset exposure
A proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in Euro. The statement of financial position is reported in sterling and this means 
that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the net assets of the Group. The Group aims to 
minimise the value of net assets denominated in Euro by funding portfolio assets with Euro denominated borrowings where possible.
Income statement exposure
As with net assets, a proportion of the Group’s profit is denominated in Euro, but translated into sterling for reporting purposes. The result 
for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rate relative 
to the Euro will have an impact on the consolidated result for the period. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 132

There has been significant movement in the foreign exchange rates during the year due to one-off events such as the UK Referendum results. 
As such 10% is considered to be reasonable in relation to general market volatility. The above also assumes that there is no impact on retained 
earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability). Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 133

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
25  Risks arising from financial instruments (continued)
The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. Most portfolios by their 
nature are impaired at acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections that in turn inform the ERC’s on which the portfolio 
statement of financial position value is calculated. The ongoing risk is managed through a portfolio valuation process including modelling 
current expectations of recoverability based on historical information on debt types, also factoring in recoveries from collateral held on the 
secured portfolios. Further details of the forecasting process are given in Note 4 b. A pricing gateway process is in place which includes at least 
two members of the executive board as well as other key members from appropriate areas of the business. The Group also monitors its 
exposure to geographic concentration of assets.
This process is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and regulatory risk through to the financial 
assumptions and maximum bid price.
All purchased loan portfolios are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. As part of the regular monitoring process, the future cash 
flows in the ERCs are updated, with ‘write-ups’ or ‘write-downs’ as a result of changes to the estimated cash flows discounted at the EIR rate. 
An impairment is only recognised if the ‘write-downs’ exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups and revenue recognised.
As part of credit risk, the Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks and 
foreign currency and derivative financial instruments. Counterparty risk with debt sellers is managed through warranties.
The Group generally deposits cash and undertakes currency and derivative transactions with highly rated banks, with strict limits on the level 
of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with board approval.
No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial derivatives. The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows:
           31 December  31 December
           2016  2015
           £000  £000

           23,203  10,183
The table represents a worst case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to.
The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are managed within an established risk management framework. The Group’s day-to-day 
working capital is funded by its cash and cash equivalents. 
Capital risk management
The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group is currently 
not required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong statement of financial position but at the same time is providing 
a good return on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of 
debt and equity finance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity.
Management reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis. As part of this review, management considers the cost of capital and the risks 
associated with each class of capital. The Group’s position as at 31 December 2016 was:

Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price 
quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques.
For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees 
of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the 
specific instrument.
Valuation models
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making  
the measurements.
Level 1: inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices within level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices 
for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant 
inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based 
on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments 
that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required 
to reflect differences between the instruments.
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or 
paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, using prices from observable current market transactions 
and dealer quotes for similar instruments and unobservable inputs such as historic performance data and the Proprietary Collections 
Bureau output. The purchased loan portfolios fair value is calculated using our 84-month ERC through our own in-house models. Derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated 
using quoted prices. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows 
estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value.

The following table analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into

There have been no transfers in or out of level 3. 
The statement of financial position value of the Group’s purchased loan portfolios is derived from discounted cash flows generated by an 
84-month ERC model. The inputs into the ERC model are historic portfolio collection performance data. This ERC is updated with the core 
collections experience to date on a monthly basis.
Estimates of cash flows that determine the EIR are based on the Group’s collection history with respect to portfolios comprising similar 
attributes and characteristics such as date of purchase, original credit grantor, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer 
location, and the time since the original charge off.
Management believes the purchase price is the best indicator of fair value at acquisition. Following acquisition it is considered that 
given the nature of the loan portfolios, largely comprising non-performing loans, the information available and our forecasting models, 
the best estimate of the fair value of the purchased loan portfolios is their carrying value. 
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of purchased loan portfolio values. This includes regular 
monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee, which considers actual versus forecast results at an 
individual portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a semi-annual basis, reviews actual against forecast gross money multiple, signs off the 
latest ERC forecast and assesses the carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition.
A reconciliation of the opening to closing balances for the period of the purchased loan portfolios can be seen in note 16.
The Company did not hold any other financial instruments not measured at fair value for which a fair value needs to be calculated (2015: none).
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses foreign currency contracts (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur 
within 12 months of the statement of financial position date and interest rate swaps (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those interest cash flows 
that are expected to occur during the period to November 2017. The effect on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income will also be within these periods. An amount of £827 ,000 has been charged to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash 
flow hedges (2015: £729 ,000). All hedge relationships have been effective in the year and are expected to maintain effectiveness. No charge 
has been made to the Company’s equity. 
The Group has interest rate swaps in place for a notional amount of £571,243,000 (2015: £246,832,000). In 2016, these interest rate swaps

Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts and 
exposure to currency rate fluctuations.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2016 is £186,600,000 
(2015: £67 ,400,000). These comprise:
>  foreign currency contracts to sell sterling for a total notional of £186,600,000 (2015: £67,400,000). These contracts have maturity dates to 
August 2017. These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value 
thereof has been deferred in equity and fair value will be recycled to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in 
August 2017 .
As at 31 December 2016 the aggregate amount of net gain/loss under forward foreign exchange contracts that have been recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income relating to the exposure on these anticipated future transactions is 
£nil (2015: £nil gain).
During the year, £1,680,000 (2015: £1,257 ,000) was recycled from equity to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as 
a result of maturity of the short dated foreign exchange swaps during the year.
The Company did not hold any foreign exchanges swaps at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: £nil).

The carrying value of the bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Bank borrowings can be repaid within 
six months if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date. The impact of discounting is 
therefore negligible.
The fair value of the senior secured notes has been calculated by reference to broker quotes that are based on observable market inputs 
and therefore would be included as ‘level 2’ in the fair value hierarchy table should the liability have been held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative 
transaction. For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of 
fair value.
For the Company, there is no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.
28  Share-based payments – Group and Company
Share incentive plan scheme (SIP)
In April 2016 (and previously April 2015 and 2014), the Group offered to all UK employees the opportunity to participate in a SIP, where the 
Company gives the participating employees one matching share for each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee using the 
participating employees’ gross salaries. The shares vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they are purchased, with employees 
required to stay in employment for the vesting period to receive the shares. 
On 30 December 2014, the Group provided eligible employees with a free share award worth £500, with a grant date price per share of 
£2.29 as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The free shares vest at the end of three years, with employees required to stay in employment 
to receive the shares.
Upon listing in October 2013, the Group provided eligible employees with a one-off award of free shares worth up to £3,000, with a grant 
price per share of £2.425, as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The value of SIP shares awarded was dependent on a linear scale of length 
of service. The free shares vested during the year, with restrictions attached to these shares ceasing to have effect from vesting date.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
On 8 April 2016 and 19 May 2016, nil-cost share options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 150% of base salary. 
Conditional awards were granted to eligible Dutch employees on 19 May 2016. The LTIP awards vest at the end of three years, being 8 April 
2019, subject to the achievement of performance conditions. On the same dates, tax-qualifying options were granted as part of the LTIP 
awards (‘CSOP options’) to eligible UK employees. 
Each CSOP option is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost option part of the awards. If a CSOP option is exercised 
at a gain, the number of shares that may be delivered under the above associated nil-cost option under the LTIP will be reduced at exercise 
by the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by the grant 
of the CSOP option. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 138

Revolving credit facility
On 21 July 2016, the Group entered into a new £180 million revolving credit facility (the ‘Revolving Credit Facility’) with The Royal Bank of 
Scotland Plc acting as security agent for a syndicate of participating financial institutions. The Revolving Credit Facility has a margin of 2.75% 
and a committed term to 31 July 2021. The Group is required to pay a commitment fee at a rate of 35% of the margin per annum on the 
undrawn portion of each Lender’s commitment. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the same assets as the 2021 Euro Senior Notes, 
2023 Euro Senior Notes and 2024 Sterling Senior Notes and ranks super senior to these. The assets that are secured are those of the Arrow 
Global Guernsey Holdings Limited group. On 24 February 2017 the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility were increased from 
£180 million to £215 million.
On 21 July 2016, the Group cancelled its existing revolving credit facility (the ‘Original Revolving Credit Facility’). Upon cancellation the 
Group incurred non-recurring costs of £3.0 million, these costs are included within finance costs (see note 8).

31  Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking
InVesting
On 4 May 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of InVesting B.V. (subsequently renamed Arrow Global Investments 
Holdings Benelux B.V.). InVesting has a similar principal activity as the Group, is a leading consumer debt purchaser and third party 
collections provider with operations both in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The Group paid cash consideration of €76,964,000 (£60,649,000) and contingent consideration of €270,000 (£213,000), with an additional 
requirement to repay outstanding loans and other costs of €12,280,000 (£9,677,000). The contingent consideration is payable on the one 
year anniversary of the transaction and has been included at its fair value, at the amount contractually agreed. The contingent consideration is 
based on the previous shareholders fulfilling their service responsibilities for 12 months post acquisition; management deem this to be 
highly probable at the reporting date. Included within the opening net assets are debt liabilities of £18,412,000, comprising an overdraft with a 
facility limit of €20 million, drawn at the acquisition date to the value €11,084,000 (£8,735,000) and an intercompany loan of €12,280,000 
(£9,677,000) from an entity of the previous Group. Further to this an intercompany loan of €12,280,000 (£9,677,000) was created between 
Arrow Global Investments Holdings Limited and InVesting. 
Goodwill of €47,995,000 (£37,821,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition were to create 
scale and servicing capability across multiple asset classes and to create a market leader within the Benelux market. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2016, InVesting contributed revenue of £40,580,000 and profit of £7,729,000 to the 
consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2016, Group total revenue would have 
been an estimated £250,538,000 and profit after tax would have been an estimated £27,531,000.

Goodwill of £5,410,000 previously recognised in InVesting is not an identifiable asset when applying acquisition accounting and has therefore 
been written off through fair value adjustments accordingly.
Purchased loan portfolios had a fair value at acquisition of £35,343,000. The fair value has been assessed using a methodology consistent with 
the Group’s other purchased loan portfolios as described in Note 4 b. An intangible asset of £13,850,000 was recognised at acquisition being 
the fair value of expected cash flows over a 7-year period arising from contractual and non-contractual customer relationships discounted 
appropriately. A deferred tax liability has been recognised, with respect to the customer intangible asset and the difference between the fair 
value of the purchased loan portfolios and the seller’s balance sheet carrying value. 
A fair value adjustment of £400,000 arose to reduce the deferred tax asset, reflecting the uncertainty over the amounts and timing of 
historical tax losses.  Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 143

31  Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking (continued)
Other receivables in the acquired entities comprise gross contracted amounts of £3,675,000. There is doubt over the recoverability of 
£47 ,000 of this amount, being a specific provision against an overdue amount.
The minority interest was recorded at fair value at the acquisition date.
Redrock
On 29 February 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Redrock Capital Partners, S.A. satisfied with cash of 
€3,200,000 (£2,515,000), together with deferred consideration of €454,000 (£357,000) being a total consideration of €3,654,000 
(£2,872,000). The deferred consideration is payable on the one year anniversary of the transaction and has been included at its fair value. 
Redrock has a similar principal activity as the Group being the management and servicing of non-performing debt portfolios on behalf of 
third party clients and the Group in Portugal.
Goodwill of €3,244,000 (£2,550,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which makes up 
the goodwill, were to enable further synergy gains within the Portuguese CGU from a combination of lower servicing costs and more 
control over owned loan portfolios. This also allows focus on low valuation collections. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2016, Redrock contributed revenue of £268,000 and loss of £386,000 to the consolidated 
results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2016, Group total revenue would have been £235,959,000 
and profit after tax would have been £26,325,000. 
Effect of the acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

An intangible asset of £407 ,000 was recognised at acquisition being the fair value of expected cash flows over a seven-year period arising 
from contractual and non-contractual customer relationships discounted appropriately. A deferred tax liability has been recognised, with 
respect to the customer intangible asset. The fair value of plant, property and equipment within Redrock was assessed to be nil following 
the relocation of the Redrock office.

Prior year acquisitions
Gesphone
On 1 April 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Gesphone Serviços De Tratamento E Acquisção De Dívidas S.A. 
and subsidiary Gesphone STC (‘Gesphone’), satisfied with cash of €6,300,000 and contingent consideration of €2,000,000 for a total 
consideration of €8,300,000. The contingent consideration has been calculated at fair value based on a discount rate of 5.3%, being the 
Group’s current external cost of finance, leading to an overall consideration at fair value of €8,085,000 (£5,797,000). The contingent 
consideration was based on Gesphone employees remaining party to a service agreement, which has been considered highly probable; 
therefore a 100% probability has been applied. Gesphone has a similar principal activity as the Group being the acquisition and management of 
underperforming portfolio of unsecured loans and servicing of debt in relation to third party contracts in Portugal.
Goodwill of €4,475,000 (£3,209,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which makes up 
the goodwill, were to create scale and servicing capability across multiple asset classes, and to strengthen the Group’s position as market 
leader in Portugal. A large element of Gesphone’s prior trade was with Arrow Global, and therefore the majority of the income earned by 
Gesphone is now intragroup income. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015, Gesphone contributed revenue of £1,512,000 and operating profit of £674,000 to the 
consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2015, Group total revenue would have been an 
estimated £166,374,000 and operating profit would have been an estimated £74,990,000.

31  Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking (continued)
Whitestar
On 22 April 2015, the Group acquired 33% of the share capital of Silver Parallel S.A (the holding company of Whitestar Asset Management 
S.A. (‘Whitestar’). Voting control and economic interest passed to the Group on payment of the initial consideration on 22 April 2015, and 
therefore the Group has recognised 100% of Whitestar in its results, as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Group will increase its holding to 
100% in two stages over two years and the total consideration will be satisfied with cash and deferred consideration for €47,833,333. The 
deferred consideration has been calculated at fair value based on a discount rate of 5.3%, being the Group’s current external cost of 
finance, leading to an overall consideration of €47,783,000 (£34,263,000). Whitestar has a similar principal activity as the Group being the 
servicing of debt in relation to third party contracts.
Goodwill of €38,709,000 (£27,756,000) was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which makes up 
the goodwill, were to create scale and servicing capability across multiple asset classes, and to strengthen the Group’s position as market 
leader in Portugal. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015, Whitestar contributed revenue of £9,379,000 and operating profit of £912,000 to the 
consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on the 1 January 2015, Group total revenue would have been an estimated 
£169,320,000 and operating profit would have been an estimated £74,814,000.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have 
been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015.
Effect of the acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:
             Total
             £000
Property, plant and equipment             778

Deferred consideration             19 ,976
             34,263
The fair value adjustment on the intangible assets arises from the fair value of existing customer relationships. An associated deferred tax 
liability is created being 29.5% of the fair value adjustment, the rate of Portuguese corporation tax.
Acquisition expenses
The Group incurred acquisition expenses of £5,022,000 in relation to the acquisitions of InVesting and Redrock and the agreed acquisition of 
Zenith, which has been charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and included within other operating 
expenses and has been disclosed as a non-recurring cost.
Measurement period
Whilst the Group believes the acquisition accounting fair value adjustments to be complete, IFRS 3 allows a measurement period of up to 
one year after acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances that were made available to the Group at 
the acquisition date. If any additional material changes are required within this measurement period, these will be reflected in the 2017 half 
year results of the Group. Arrow Global Group Plc � Annual Report & Accounts 2016 146

the event that they remain unpaid for a period of 90 days or more, if there is not an acceptable arrangement in place to bring the account 
back up to date, in which case the creditor or lender may reasonably believe that the relationship has broken down. Under the Data 
Protection Act 1990 it is a requirement that any organisation seeking to register a default with a credit reference agency must also send a 
notice of intention to file a default, this notice is very similar in nature to that required under the Consumer Credit Act both of which give

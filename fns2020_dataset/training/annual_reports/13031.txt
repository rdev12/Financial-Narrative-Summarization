02
It gives me great pleasure to introduce our results 
and operating review for 2005, a year which has had a
transforming effect on First Artist Corporation’s business.
The past 12 months have seen us reap the benefits of a
successful repositioning of the Group to function as a truly
integrated service for all aspects of sports and celebrity
representation and event management. The figures for all
four of our divisions reflect the mutual benefits that they
are gaining from this strategy.  
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Tim Chadwick (left) and Jarvis Astaire (right) CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FIRST ARTIST ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
03
In summary, I recommend our results to you as
evidence that our year of significant change and
growth has created a company with a broader
income base, strongly positioned for expansion, and
with a uniquely integrated, exciting offer in the
marketplace.We expect all four divisions to continue
their success in 2006, whilst we look to expand our
successful model to new markets overseas.
I would like to thank all those involved in the
restructuring of this Group and thank the Board for
its commitment in turning around a group in what
remains a difficult environment.
Jarvis Astaire, OBE
Chairman
27 January 2006 
I wish to thank my predecessor as Chairman,
Tim Chadwick, whom I look forward to working
with in his new capacity as Vice-Chairman, for his
excellent work on the ABG Financial Management
Limited (“ABGFM”) and The Finishing T ouch
(Corporate Events) Limited acquisitions.
Both these acquisitions, together with the similarly
acquired T eam Sports Management have now been
successfully integrated into the Group and, with their
highly respected management teams continuing on
board, are already delivering significant revenue.
BROADER INCOME: FULLER SERVICE
Our broad-based business, organised across four
divisions, gives us a strong position for growth
through international expansion, and the cross 
referral of income and new business opportunities.
Whilst building on the reputation that First Artist
Management enjoys as one of the world’s leading
football management groups, we have successfully
reduced the dependence of the Group on this one
sport by two-thirds whilst broadening both our
income base and the range of services that we 
offer to clients.
There are considerable opportunities for cross referral
of business and substantial new business opportunities
within our new structure.The wealth management
division created through the ABGFM acquisition
allows us to form deeper and more valuable
relationships with the players and media figures
served through First Artist Management and 
First Artist Entertainment; the event management
business of Finishing T ouch gives us exposure to
Public Sector contracts and the opportunity to
leverage our position as a FIFA and UEFA licensee,
as well as a further outlet for our growing roster of
entertainment clients.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We believe in good corporate governance, and a 
clear division of roles and responsibilities on the
Group Board. Due to the Group now having two
Non-Executive directors, our finance director,
Richard Hughes, is now free to step down from 
our committees.Tim Chadwick will continue as 
Non-Executive Vice-Chairman of the First Artist
Corporation, focusing on relations with the financial
and investor community.
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A BUSINESS
Integrity and credibility are vital commodities in our
business.We pride ourselves on the transparency of
our relationships with players, clubs and media
personalities, and First Artist Management has been 
a prime mover in the creation of the Football Agents
Federation, which establishes guidelines for the
conduct of agents. We make efforts in this area
because of our commitment to sport.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S  
REVIEW
In the last year we have completed
the reshaping of First Artist
Corporation’s business following
the turmoil created by the 2002
collapses of ITV Digital in the UK
and Bertelsmann in Europe,
coupled with the EU reforms of
football player contracts and the
advent of ‘trading windows’. 
At that time our business was almost entirely focused
on football player representation, and this left us
exposed to the disappearance of vast amounts of
television money from the game.
We resisted the temptation to take the Company
back into private ownership because we felt a strong
moral obligation to our shareholders.We also firmly
believed in and started to implement a strategy for
leveraging our global reputation in football to create
a broader personality, event and wealth management
company with powerful synergies and a stable
income base.
Fast-forward to year-end 2005 and the value of 
this strategy has been clearly demonstrated. Our
acquisition programme has diluted our dependency
on football by approximately two-thirds and created a
profitable, omni-functional plc with a strong basis for
growth. Our four divisions complement one another
perfectly: the financial management business is a
second heartbeat to our businesses of sports and
entertainment representation, allowing us to offer
valuable new services to our clients; event
management provides a second income line with
good synergies to our traditional business and
exciting opportunities which will benefit from our
previous experience as one of the UK’s leading event
promoters during the nineties.
Each division benefits from a strong management
team, with the founders of our wealth management
business,ABG Financial Management, and our 
event management business,The Finishing T ouch,
remaining in full-time management roles.The success
of this integration shows in our results across the
Group, and I would like to thank all employees for
the tremendously positive way in which they have
dealt with the changes of the last few years.
2005 PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK
Our traditional business of player representation has
enjoyed its most successful year for several years, with
First Artist Management almost trebling its operating
profit to £1.26 million although the market
continues to be difficult and unpredictable.The
successful integration of T eam Sports Management
has added stability to our London operation and
increased our already wealthy bank of contacts and
experience through the involvement of Mel Stein,
whose contribution has proven invaluable. Our Italian
player representation business, PromoSport has reaped
the benefits of its own recent restructuring and our
developing affiliations in Germany and Spain are
further increasing our operational reach in Europe.
First Artist Entertainment has developed from a
standing start to a six-figure business in two years 
of strong organic growth and I must pay credit to
Corrinne Goodall who heads this division. It has
built on the increasing overlap between sports,
celebrity and light entertainment to develop a client
roster including Andy Gray, Martin T yler, Dennis
Taylor and Suzanne Shaw.The successful
development by Matthew Fisher of the speaker
agency within this division has provided further
opportunities for our growing portfolio of talent,
which complements well with The Finishing T ouch.
ABG Financial Management has delivered an
operating profit of £214,000 since its acquisition by
the Group, demonstrating the vitality of the business
whilst broadening the services available to clients 
of First Artist Management and First Artist
Entertainment.The changes to pension legislation
that will be introduced on 6 April 2006,‘A Day’,
have boosted the value of high-quality investment
advice and should continue to add to the appeal 
of the wealth management service going forward.
Jon Smith
Chief Executive
Officer CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
FIRST ARTIST ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
05
There is also strong potential for expansion alongside 
First Artist Management and PromoSport in Europe,
where the financial advice industry is less developed
and UK-based investments are highly valued.
The Finishing T ouch demonstrated the potential of
event management with a £76,000 profit since its
acquisition by the Group. Increased margins over
Christmas demonstrated rising demand following
several years of cutbacks in events budgets. Long-
term contracts with Accenture and the Public Sector’s
education training programme have provided a stable
income stream for the business, and there are
opportunities to gain further Public Sector 
business in 2006.
ONGOING STRATEGY
Our Group continues to be second half focused
although the recent acquisitions will reduce this
emphasis. Our acquisition programme will advance
over the next 12 months as we continue to secure
opportunities in all four of our strategic sectors,
where we can introduce genuinely complementary
skills to our existing portfolio, further broaden 
the business base of the group and reduce 
historical volatility.
Further developing our entertainment capability is a
particular priority.This is an area that offers significant
crossover to our player management business, as the
organic growth of First Artist Entertainment over the
last two years shows.This is a business we should be
in and know well, with both Phil Smith and myself
having successful roots in this industry sector. It will
definitely be targeted in the ongoing acquisition
programme.The integration of ABG Financial
Management, with its extensive list of music, media
and entertainment clients, should greatly accelerate
the development process.
Finally, I would like to extend my personal thanks to
my fellow Board members for their determination
shown in turning First Artist into a vibrant and
exciting sports and entertainment group.T o Phil
Smith and Vincenzo Morabito for producing
remarkable figures in a difficult market – “probably
the best Agents in the World” and to our finance
director, Richard Hughes, whose skill in the
acquisition market, coupled with his strong financial
management has been so vital in the turnaround 
of the Group.
Jon Smith
Chief Executive Officer 
27 January 2006
Genuine integration has been the secret of our
success in 2005 and it will continue to underpin our
business going forward. Moving The Finishing T ouch
to First Artist’s freehold Wembley offices in early 2006
will give us the opportunity to exploit the synergies
between events and our entertainment representation
business, as well as the potential for leveraging our
status as a FIFA and UEFA licensee, and the matches
and tours that this allows us to organise.The Group’s
close proximity to Wembley Stadium we believe will
also open opportunities for development in the
coming years. It is also worth noting the substantial
capital appreciation of our freehold property as its
neighbour nears completion.
I am equally delighted to welcome our new 
Non-Executive Chairman, Jarvis Astaire, OBE, who
has extensive experience and stature within the
industry and with whom I have previously worked
closely, having successfully staged NFL, NHL and
NBA UK events in the 1980s and 90s. I am just as
delighted that his predecessor,Tim Chadwick, will 
be continuing his excellent work with the financial
and investor community as Non-Executive 
Vice-Chairman.
GLOBAL EXPANSION
Jarvis’ arrival signals a new phase in the development
of First Artist Corporation, as we look to export our
successful, full-service model to new markets. Our
key challenge going forward is to maintain our
pivotal position in the global football market and to
manage the issues that will face that industry in the
next few years. Jarvis will help us to develop our
profile on a global basis, as we aim to replicate our
successes in the UK, Europe, US and Middle East.
Our increasing global profile will also increase our
potential to offer representation in other sports. 06

INTERNATIONAL SCOPE OF 
THE BUSINESS
The Company’s roster of UK clients includes
approximately 200 players, a large number of whom
play in the Premiership for clubs such as Chelsea,
Arsenal, Newcastle,T ottenham, Blackburn,Aston
Villa, Portsmouth and Middlesbrough. First Artist
Management is also the representative of certain
Premiership clubs and, in addition to player
representation, holds licences from FIFA and UEFA
to organise football matches, tours and other events.
The successful acquisition and integration of     T eam
Sports Management in 2005 has greatly strengthened
the business in the UK.
First Artist Management’s European operation, run
through its wholly-owned, Milan-based subsidiary,
PromoSport, led by Claudio Vigorelli, numbers 
some 150 players; the majority of whom are based 
in Italy with others in Spain, Germany, France and
Eastern Europe.
Through its offices in Washington DC and Qatar,
First Artist Management represents a further 
20 players around the globe.
SERVICE AND APPROACH
First Artist Management’s portfolio of services
includes transfer negotiations and contract extensions
on behalf of players and clubs.Through its sister
company,ABG Financial Management, it also offers
players additional advice on how to manage their
money in the most efficient manner and exploit their
commercial value to the fullest appropriate extent.
First Artist Entertainment provides certain players
with a route to exploit their commercial value after
their playing days come to an end.
The Company’s philosophy is based on quality. First
Artist Management keeps its client roster as select as
possible to ensure that it delivers a 24/7 complete
management service and that it always maintains the
highest standards of personal advice.A strictly quality-
driven approach is also taken to commercial
opportunities. Players’ commercial value ultimately
rests on their performance on the field, and it is vital
to ensure that commercial activities are managed and
restricted to allow time for rest and recuperation.
First Artist Management never exploits its players
beyond their best interests.

OPPORTUNITIES
The success of the Premiership and Serie A has
reinforced First Artist Management’s status within the
global football community, providing a number of
opportunities for expanding the business to new
markets.The Italian subsidiary, PromoSport has had
an exceptional year that has extended its influence
globally beyond its Italian borders. First Artist
Management’s trading relationship with Fairsport 
in Germany has further extended its presence in
Europe, with an exciting, full-service offer.
In its European markets, First Artist Management’s
ability to offer high-quality wealth management
advice is a unique point of difference that is
particularly appealing given the popularity of
London-based investments and the less developed
nature of financial advice in Italy and Spain.
First Artist Management’s experience and
international expertise means that it is regularly
approached to handle the issues surrounding the
arrival of foreign players in the UK, where all parties
require an early judgement on the likelihood of a
successful deal, and experience is therefore essential.
Organising transfers such as Jared Borgetti’s recent
move to Bolton from Mexico, Jesper Gronkjaer’s
move from the UK to Stuttgart and Joseph-Desire
Job’s move from the UK to Al Ittihad, Saudi Arabia,
has further raised the profile of the business in the
football community globally.

SCOPE OF THE BUSINESS
Corporate events currently account for approximately
65% of The Finishing T ouch’s core business.The
Company’s long-term Accenture contract represents
approximately 20% of this corporate business and
resulted in some 35 events in 2005, showing
increased activity on the account.The Christmas
events market makes a substantial contribution to 
the corporate business, and margins in this area have
increased dramatically over the past 12-month period
as demand for high-end production recovers
following years of budget cutbacks. Besides
Accenture,The Finishing T ouch’s client list includes
Marks & Spencer, Ernst & Y oung, Harrods and
Electronic Arts.
Three years ago,The Finishing T ouch won a contract
to handle training events for the Education Sector.
This contract involves some 250 events per year 
at venues around the country and represents
approximately 35% of The Finishing T ouch’s business.
It has also backed the creation of a national network
of event management specialists for The Finishing
T ouch and led to the award of several other Public
Sector contracts to the Company.The credibility 
that comes from long-term, large scale Public Sector
work is immensely valuable to The Finishing T ouch
going forward.

OPPORTUNITIES
The ‘A Day’ pension legislation, effective in the UK
from 6 April 2006, has already provided substantial
opportunities for ABG Financial Management’s
business.The changes are particularly significant for
the football industry, with players planning retirement
from the age of 35 onwards, and ABG Financial
Management will be rolling out quality advice 
on this issue across First Artist Management’s 
pan-European client base during 2006.The advent of
Self Invested Pension Plans and the opportunity that
this provides for bespoke pension portfolios will add 
a new long-term dimension to ABG Financial
Management’s business.The Company may also seek
to set up a commercial property portfolio, allowing 
it to offer bespoke property investments to clients as
part of their pension plans.

The strength of First Artist Management’s player
representation business in Europe provides ABG
Financial Management with a further opportunity 
for expansion, particularly given the less developed
nature of financial advice across the continent.
The Company is currently recruiting a multilingual
executive to exploit the business opportunities arising
from PromoSport’s player representation portfolio 
in Italy, Spain and France.

FIRST ARTIST ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005

TURNOVER
Turnover has increased 47% over the year through
increased activity in the representation business 
(up 13%) and through the inclusion of the turnover
generated from the acquisitions of ABG Financial
Management (since 16 July 2005) and The Finishing
T ouch (since 14 September 2005).
OPERATING PROFIT
The operating profit for the Group, before goodwill
amortisation and impairment and one-off exceptional
costs, increased £1.02 million to £1.05 million in
the year of which £0.29 million was generated from
the two main acquisitions.
The football representation division’s performance 
has been its best for several years, with gross margin
improving to 86% (2004: 71%), mainly due to the
increased number of transactions concerning Group
roster, rather than shared, players.
Group overheads for continuing businesses and
central costs increased by 7% to £3.01 million
compared with a 33% increase in gross profits.
The acquisitions resulting in a broader based group,
will start to level out the volatility and seasonality
traditionally experienced in the Group’s profits,
with the main benefits from the acquisitions feeding
through in a full twelve months trading over the
course of 2006.
A more detailed composition of the results,
by division and geographic area can be seen in 
the divisional reports and notes to the accounts.

Richard Hughes
Finance Director GOODWILL AMORTISATION 
AND EXCEPTIONALS
The valuation of goodwill is subject to annual
impairment reviews and provisions are made as
appropriate.An additional payment of £43,000
related to deferred consideration due on the FIMO
acquisition was written off in full during the year.
Exceptional costs mainly resulted from the closure
costs associated with the FIMO Geneva office,
First Artist International and the First Artist 
Snooker Academy .
The Group has retained an involvement in some 
of the Snooker Academy’s ex-students and has an
agreement with their management company, ZEN
Snooker Management to assist in the promotion and
marketing of its player portfolio, which includes
recent UK Championship winner Ding Junhui.
The Group also retained a presence in Qatar and
developed its Middle-Eastern football and other
sports relationships, which resulted in three separate
transactions in the region during this last summer
trading window.
INTEREST PAYABLE, FUNDING 
AND LIQUIDITY
Net interest payable was £41,000 (2004: £42,000).
During the year the Group entered into a five-year
new banking loan facility of £1,550,000, with AIB
to facilitate the acquisition funding and working
capital requirements.
The Board believes that the level of gearing that has
resulted from these transactions will be acceptable
given the cash generative nature of the enlarged
Group. It is envisaged that the Group’s borrowing
levels will steadily reduce whilst it retains sufficient
financial flexibility to continue to invest in
developing its businesses.
The Board has assessed the level of risk in the Group
and feels that, given the broader base of individually
trading businesses that the level of risk previously
faced by the Group has been significantly reduced.
Net debt of £3.27 million (2004: £0.15 million) at
the year-end was comprised of:
TAXATION
The tax charge of £0.30 million comprises a current
tax charge of £0.23 million and a write back of
deferred taxation of £0.07 million.
EARNING PER SHARE
Earnings per share before exceptional items and
goodwill increased from 0.30p to 1.25p, and basic
earnings per share also increased from (0.63)p to
0.89p.This is directly due to the increased
profitability of the enlarged Group and the earnings
enhancing methods of financing the acquisitions.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
Shareholders’ funds increased by £2.23 million to
£3.31 million, resulting in an increase in net assets
per share of 1.5p to 3.7p.The increase was due to net
profit and foreign exchange of £0.45 million and net
proceeds from share issues of £1.78 million.
ACQUISITIONS
In the year the Company completed three
acquisitions each of which have now been
successfully integrated into the Group. Cross-referral
of income, new business generation and operating
cost savings have started to be generated, the full
effect of which should feed through into the 
coming year.

governance. This statement
describes how the principles of
corporate governance are applied 
to the Company.
THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES

discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate
and timely information.The Directors may take
independent professional advice as required.

throughout the year:

FIRST ARTIST ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
29
Company law requires the Directors
to prepare financial statements for
each financial period, which give a
true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the
Group and of the profit or loss of
the Group for that period.  
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors
are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
c. state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and the Group and to enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985.They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities. AUDITORS’ REPORT

AUDITORS’ REPORT
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO
THE MEMBERS OF FIRST ARTIST
CORPORATION PLC
We have audited the financial statements on 
pages 31 to 65.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an Auditors’ Report and for no
other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinion we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF
DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the
Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing
Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view and are
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the
Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the 
Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises only the Financial Highlights,
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executives’
Review, the Business Reviews, the Operating and
Financial Review, the Corporate Governance
Statement, the Remuneration Report and the
Directors’ Report. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
BASIS OF OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing
Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the Directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to 
obtain all the information and explanations which 
we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group at 31 October 2005 and of the
Group’s profit for the year then ended and have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FIRST ARTIST ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable
accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial
statements of First Artist Corporation plc and all of its
subsidiaries made up to 31 October 2005.
No profit and loss account is presented for First Artist
Corporation plc, as provided by Section 230 (3) of the
Companies Act 1985.
INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Purchased goodwill is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset
and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the net assets acquired.
Where goodwill is capable of continued measurement and the
directors are of the opinion that the goodwill has an indefinite
useful economic life, the carrying value of the goodwill is
subject to an annual impairment review and provisions are
made as appropriate.
All other purchased goodwill is amortised evenly over periods
of between 5 and 10 years as in the opinion of the Directors
this represents the period over which the goodwill is effective.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets other than
freehold land at rates calculated to write each asset down to its
estimated residual value over its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% straight line
Short leasehold improvements Over period of the lease
Plant and machinery 15% reducing balance 
Fixtures and fittings 15% reducing balance 
Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance
INVESTMENTS
Long-term investments are classified as fixed assets and stated at
cost less provision for any diminution in value.
LEASING AND HIRE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are
capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives.The interest element of the rental
obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the
period of the lease.
Lease payments under operating leases, where substantially all
the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are charged as
expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay
more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future
have occurred at the balance sheet date.Timing differences are
differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in the
financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
PENSIONS
Group companies make contributions to the personal schemes
of certain employees. Pension costs charged against profits
represent the amounts payable to the schemes in respect 
of the period.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date.Transactions in foreign currencies are
recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transactions.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiary undertakings are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date.The results of foreign subsidiary
undertakings are translated at the average rates of exchange
during the period. Gains or losses resulting from the
realignment of opening net assets and the results for the period
to the period end rates are treated as movements on reserves.
TURNOVER
Turnover represents income receivable, excluding Value Added
Tax, for services rendered during the year. 38
The Group’s net assets, turnover and profit/(loss) before taxation were all derived from activities in the following geographical markets:
NET 2005 PROFIT/(LOSS) NET 2004 PROFIT/(LOSS)

23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and short-
term deposits, finance leases and other borrowings and various
items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly
from its operations.The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to fund the Group’s operations, manage 
working capital and invest surplus funds.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the
Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments
are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for the management 
of these risks and these are summarised below.These policies
have remained unchanged throughout the year.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group’s cash balances and deposits and debt through term
borrowings will be subject to fluctuations in current and future
interest rates. Debt in the form of deferred consideration for
the acquisition of subsidiary companies and unincorporated
businesses and all other significant financial assets and liabilities
do not bear interest.The Group monitors the rates of interest
receivable and payable on its cash and debt balances, but given
the nature of these assets and liabilities, interest liabilities are
not capped.
LIQUIDITY RISK
It is the Group’s policy to finance its business through
internally generated funds with surplus funds invested in 
short and medium fixed term money market deposits.
Requirements are kept under regular review by the Board and
Group companies have negotiated overdraft facilities with their
bankers in order to minimise any exposure to short-term
liquidity risks.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The subsidiary, FIMO Sport Promotion AG based in
Switzerland ceased operations during the previous period. It
regarded the Swiss Franc as its functional currency and there
remain intergroup balances outstanding between itself and its
holding company.
The subsidiary, PromoSport Srl based in Italy produces
accounts in Euros.
The Company and its subsidiaries enter into transfer deals and
other transactions denominated in Sterling, Swiss Francs, Euros
and US Dollars.The Group’s revenue and expenditure can
therefore be affected by foreign currency exchange
movements.
The Board monitors all foreign currency exposure but the
Company does not currently hedge against movements in the
exchange rates of Sterling and foreign currencies in respect of
any financial assets and liabilities. 62

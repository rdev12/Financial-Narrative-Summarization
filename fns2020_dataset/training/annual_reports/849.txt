6 Chairman's statement
AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 4 4
I was delighted to be invited to join AMEC as your 
Chairman in June 2011. I have watched with interest 
the successful and transformational journey of the last 
few years and it is clear to me that there is more to 
come and much that I can contribute. 
Prior to becoming your Chairman, my career was spent 
in the global professional services market, latterly as 
the Global Chairman of Deloittes. This background is 
extremely relevant to AMEC's business activities. Since 
joining I have spent a considerable amount of time 
visiting AMEC businesses and projects, meeting with 
the senior management team, our people across the 
group, customers and shareholders. I wanted to more 
fully understand our business culture, our priorities and 
what will contribute towards the continued success of 
the business. My overriding impression is the sheer 
professionalism and expertise of our employees . Our 
customers rely on our ability to deliver their projects on 
time, on budget and without causing harm . It is clear 
to me that we take this responsibility seriously and that 
it is this proven ability to deliver excellence that will 
underpin our future growth.
The board
In commenting on the board, I will start by thanking 
my predecessor, Jock Green-Armytage, for his 
contribution as Chairman for seven years and as a 
director for seven years before that. The transition 
process between the two of us went very smoothly.
Turning to the directors. Over the early months 
of my chairmanship I have prioritised gaining an 
understanding of each of the directors and the 
contribution they can and do make. I feel fortunate 
to be working with such a strong team of executive 
and non-executive directors, each with the relevant 
experience, skills and determination to take our 
company forward. My board colleagues have much to 
contribute and the way the non-executive team support 
management, yet challenge where appropriate, has 
been very evident.
Notwithstanding the above observations, I believe we 
do need to do more to ensure the diversity of the board 
better reflects the organisation itself. Those of you who 
have been shareholders for some time will know that 
up until 2009 we had two female directors on the board. 
Our ongoing succession planning is clearly focused on 
addressing diversity while adding to the skills base.
A final point on the board. We have commenced a 
process to independently evaluate the effectiveness 
of the board. Outside consultants will complete the 
process in the months ahead and I will share the 
findings and conclusions in next  year's report.
Board priorities
So what role does the board take in supporting the 
delivery of excellence and sustained growth in our 
performance? For me, there are three key elements. 
Firstly, we need to debate and agree the strategy 
the company is to follow and then monitor the 
performance against the strategic goals. One of the 
things that excites me about AMEC is its ambition - 
without it, no growth strategy will be achieved. Our 
Vision 2015 growth strategy was first outlined in late 
2009 . Since that time the economic outlook has 
changed and uncertainty has increased. AMEC’s 
management understand what they are good at, have 
built solid, long-term customer relationships and have 
made sure that the company is well positioned across 
the energy market. Our recent debate on strategy at 
the board reaffirmed the core principles of Vision 2015 
and its continued appropriateness.
Secondly, we have to be certain that the company has 
the right people in place to deliver . This means not 
only assessing the management skills currently in 
place, but also ensuring the mechanisms are in place 
to develop future talent and plan for succession. As I 
know from my own experience, a company that can 
attract the right talent and engage and motivate its 
employees gains that extra edge which provides 
competitive advantage. A key element of our people 
plan is how they are remunerated and this, particularly 
as far as directors are concerned, is very much in the 
public eye at the moment. Not surprisingly, I have 
examined very carefully the practices and policies  
we employ in this area. The AMEC plan for senior 
executives, including the directors, is to align annual 
bonus plans and long-term incentives with the 
company's performance based on hard measures in 
  My overriding impression is the  
sheer professionalism and expertise  
of our employees." AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 5 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
respect of growth in earnings before interest and tax, 
earnings per share growth, cash generation and total 
shareholder return. A detailed report in respect of 
directors is included in the remuneration committee 
report on page 58.
Thirdly, we must ensure that an appropriate level of 
governance is in place. I have reviewed the governance 
structure we have in place in the company, including 
the board committees, the management committees, 
risk management and oversight generally; and whilst 
everything is subject to continuous improvement, I 
believe our structure is fit for purpose. I have outlined 
my views on this in more detail on page 46, in the 
corporate governance statement. Good governance 
has to be more than just a set of policies and 
procedures; it should guide the decisions taken by  
all our employees on a daily basis. During 2011 we 
reviewed and refreshed our Code of Business Conduct 
and our values, in order that they remain real and 
relevant to our employees. I have been pleased to see 
so much evidence of this: we have achieved our best 
ever safety performance; yet again been ranked sector 
leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability index and one  
of Canada’s top 100 best employers; made charitable 
contributions of £506,000, largely by matching the 
fund-raising activities of our employees; and, not least, 
regularly won repeat business from our customers.
Performance and shareholder returns
In a global environment which continues to be complex 
and challenging and to see frequent lowering of 
economic growth projections, AMEC has performed 
well. As reported in more detail in the Chief Executive's 
review, our company had revenue growth in 2011 of 
11 per cent and growth in earnings per share of 
13 per cent.
In light of the continued strong performance, the board 
is recommending a final dividend of 20.3 pence, 
payable on 2 July 2012 to shareholders on the register 
on 1 June 2012. This would bring the total dividend for 
the year to 30.5 pence, an increase of 15 per cent over 
2010. It is the board’s intention to continue with a 
progressive dividend policy.
Given the strength of the balance sheet, the board has 
decided to commence a share buyback programme of 
£400 million. We expect to complete this over the next 
12 months.
Looking ahead
We have a highly energised and extremely able team 
in AMEC, focused upon our clients and on clear, 
transparent goals.
On your behalf, I would like to thank Samir Brikho, his 
management team and all AMEC's 27,000 people for 
their hard and valuable work in 2011.
John Connolly  
Chairman 
21 February 2012 6 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Chief Executive's review
It has been said before but can never be under- 
estimated: knowing your destination is half the journey. 
In late 2009 we set out our Vision 2015 growth strategy 
and everything we have done since then has been 
consistent with this. Against a backdrop of economic 
and political uncertainty, AMEC’s continued growth 
towards our Vision 2015 targets is something of which 
I am very proud. In 2011, revenues grew by 11 per cent, 
operating profits were 12 per cent higher and earnings 
per share, at 70.5 pence, up 13 per cent on 2010. 
In many ways, ours is a straightforward business. In 
each of our markets, we provide technical expertise  
to support our customers as they build, operate or 
decommission their assets. We are paid for the hours 
of service we provide and for helping our customers 
achieve their key goals. Our reputation for consistent 
and successful delivery is invaluable in achieving 
success; simply put, if we do good work, we win more 
good work. To achieve this, we need to employ, train 
and retain high-quality people. Our Vision 2015 growth 
strategy and ongoing success are built on these two 
key pillars – our customers and our people.
Customers 
In recent years we have been positioning AMEC to 
meet our customers’ challenges: including increasing 
complexity; remote and harsh locations; and safety, 
community and environmental concerns. If we are  
to achieve our goals, we also need a strong culture 
which is consistent with our vision. During our  
global conference in March 2011, AMEC’s top 100 
managers discussed how to make the company more  
customer-focused. We challenged ourselves on our 
preconceptions and drew lessons from our successes 
and the experience of others outside our industry. 
These analogies can be very helpful in prompting a 
different way of thinking, for example by comparing 
and contrasting the customer service we provide with 
that of a world-class hotel or restaurant. Among many 
actions which have been implemented as a result are 
the introduction of global leaders for each of our 11 
sectors; a simplification of our values to make them 
easier to remember and apply (see inside back cover); 
and a more explicitly client-focused vision. The results 
of our most recent employee survey suggest that  
our employees understand the importance of this 
customer focus. We will continue to do more work  
in this area in 2012. 
We have worked with many of our customers - which 
range from international oil companies, to utility 
companies, to local and national governments - for 
many years. During 2011, we continued to build 
successfully on these long-term relationships. There 
are many examples shown throughout this report and 
on our website, including BP, ConocoPhillips, BG and 
Magnox. Since the year end, we have announced the 
renewal of our contract with National Grid. 
We have also targeted and won work with new 
customers, such as GDF SUEZ on their Cygnus gas 
field development in the North Sea, a three-year 
nuclear services contract with URENCO and 
importantly, the work we are doing for the Marine Well 
Containment Company (MWCC) in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The sectors we are operating in are growing, supported 
by population growth and its impact on the demand  
for energy. At the same time, the requirements of our 
customers are becoming more complex, as their 
activities take place in more remote locations. We are 
increasingly providing a wider range of solutions to 
help them manage these challenges in a sustainable 
way . Just one example is the Ecospacial information 
database which is discussed further on page 25. 
During 2011, the carbon emissions in tonnes per 
employee increased by 1.5 per cent, as the result of our 
more accurately measuring the site usage. A continued 
focus on our carbon emissions not only helps us 
achieve one of our core sustainability goals, but 
importantly has the potential to reduce the cost of 
doing business.
People 
It is easy to sound glib when talking about the 
importance of our people to our success. We now 
employ over 27,000 people, directly or as agency 
labour, and it is their skills and talents which we sell  
to our customers. We need to hire the best people  
and keep them safe while they are at work. This is the 
right thing to do, and also has a direct impact on our 
reputation and financial results. It is why we track a 
number of non-financial metrics in this area which  
we believe are important forward indicators of 
performance, some of which are shown on pages  
24 to 26.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 7 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
AMEC Academy is now well established and provides  
a well-used suite of tools to support our employees  
as they develop their skills and talents and so their 
careers.
Our health and safety performance remains strong and 
is an important component of our sales proposition to 
clients. We had 15 lost time incidents in the year (2010: 
22), a significant improvement in a growing company, 
though above our target of zero. More importantly, the 
total recordable case frequency rate also dropped, to 
0.37 per 200,000 exposure hours (2010: 0.42). But we 
cannot afford to be complacent. During 2012 we will 
be focusing on three key areas which have been 
responsible for high potential incidents* in the past, 
namely working at height, working around energy 
sources and driving. 
As we continue to globalise our operations, we need 
to be able to protect our employees in new countries 
or regions. This last year our plans were tested by the 
unrest in Libya. It was a great relief to us all once our 
expatriate workers were safely home and our local 
workers had been reunited with their families.
How we work to support our customers is a core 
component of how we expect to deliver our Vision 
2015 strategy . Our employees increasingly take a 
collaborative approach, with projects being worked 
on across offices and divisions. The way in which we 
manage projects has been standardised, to facilitate 
this sharing of work and ensure that our global 
customers receive the same level of service from us, 
no matter where in the world they are. We will continue 
to work to improve this, consistent with our value of 
consistently delivering excellence to our customers.
Growth 
During 2011, we welcomed almost 3,500 new 
employees to AMEC through acquisition. The largest of 
these was MACTEC, based in the US, which has now 
been well integrated into our existing Environment & 
Infrastructure business. As one of their employees said 
recently: “We used to think we were big with 2,600 
employees, but now we’ve got the power of 27,000 
people supporting us, around the world.” Harnessing 
this power is what makes an acquisition successful; an 
investment rather than a cost. We will continue to look 
for other suitable acquisitions which allow us to expand 
our geographical presence and / or our capabilities, in 
line with our Vision 2015 objectives. At the same time, 
the strength of our customer relationships and the 
skills of our people will support continued organic 
growth. In 2012, we expect underlying revenue growth 
to be in double digits.
  Our vision is that by continually 
delivering excellence, we inspire trust 
and loyalty in our customers."
Summary
I started with a quote and I will finish with one too: 
know your limits – but never stop trying to exceed 
them. We are seeking to create a culture for AMEC 
where our people respect each other, work sustainably 
and ethically, never compromise on health and safety, 
understand customer needs and are engaged with the 
company. I would like to thank all our employees who 
have worked so hard to achieve the many successes 
demonstrated elsewhere in this report. 
Irrespective of the economic and political climate, we 
need to stay focused on what we are good at and what 
matters to our clients. Our 2012 priorities remain 
simple: to deliver consistently and excellently to our 
customers, time after time.

Our markets and sectors
AMEC operates in four key markets: oil & gas, 
minerals & metals, clean energy, and environment & 
infrastructure. These markets can be sub-divided into 
11 sectors, as shown in the table below. The services 
provided to customers in each market are very similar 
and run right across the lifecycle of the asset, from 
consulting, engineering and construction management 
to project management, operations and maintenance 
and decommissioning. They are explained in more 
detail on page 16. This section looks in more detail at 
these markets and sectors, explaining their growth 
characteristics and how we are positioned for delivery 
of the Vision 2015 growth strategy (see page 18). In 
each, the strength of customer relationships and 
proven ability to deliver successfully, even in harsh or 
remote environments, is what enables us to win new 
business.
AMEC has considerable experience and capability in 
the world’s main energy sectors. We are well placed to 
respond to the increasing demand for clean energy, the 
need to improve the efficiency of mature assets and the 
requirement for increased flexibility. Each of the areas 
in which AMEC operates is forecast to grow over the 
long term, supported by global fundamentals. AMEC  
is carefully and deliberately positioned across sectors 
so as to benefit whatever the relative weighting in the 
energy mix.
There is no one competitor operating in the same 
markets and with the same geographic footprint as 
AMEC. Further details on the competitive landscape  
by market can be found in our introductory investor 
presentation on amec.com.
Global market trends 
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
World Energy Outlook 2011, global primary energy 
demand rebounded by 5 per cent in 2010. Since then, 
the importance of a reliable energy supply has been 
reinforced by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi 
nuclear power plant in Japan and turmoil in parts of 
the Middle East and North Africa. In addition, concerns 
about sovereign debt levels have shifted attention away 
from energy policy, with a knock-on impact on global 
climate change objectives. Looking to the future, world 
primary energy demand is predicted to increase from 
12,150 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2009 to

Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
16,950 Mtoe in 2035, a 40 per cent increase. At the 
same time, developing new sources of energy is 
becoming a more complex challenge, with resources 
often in harsh or remote regions. The forecast (IEA 
New Policies Scenario) assumes that recent 
government policy commitments are implemented  
in a cautious manner . 
As ExxonMobil states (2012 The Outlook for Energy: A 
View to 2040), population and economic growth are the 
key factors behind the increasing demand for energy. 
ExxonMobil expects the world's population to grow by 
more than 25 per cent between 2010 and 2040, to 
nearly nine billion people. The balance and mix of 
energy type may change both locally and globally but 
the pressure for more is an ever-upward trend. The 
energy market is increasingly determined by countries 
outside the OECD, which are responsible for 90 per 
cent of energy demand growth.
To meet this demand, IEA believes a global investment 
in energy supply infrastructure of $38 trillion is 
required between 2011 and 2035, with oil and gas 
collectively accounting for almost $20 trillion of this. 
Most of the balance is power, especially (40 per cent) 
for transmission and distribution networks. Demand 
for all fuels is expected to rise, though the proportion  
of the total made up by fossil fuels is expected to fall.  
In the power sector, renewable energy technologies  
led by hydropower and wind account for half the  
new capacity installed to meet growing demand.
The skills challenge 
This growth in the markets in which AMEC operates 
will inevitably put further pressure on the availability of 
suitably qualified engineers, consultants and project 
managers. 
As just one example, the Chairman of the UK’s National 
Nuclear Skills Academy said in December 2011 that he 
expected the nuclear sector workforce will need to 
grow by about 68 per cent before 2025. He predicted 
that by the same date some 8,500 people will leave the 
UK industry due to retirement, equivalent to about 
one-third of the current nuclear-specific workforce. 
Continuing to attract and retain those with experience 
in successfully delivering complex projects will remain 
important as we look to satisfy our Vision 2015 growth 
aspirations.  
We will continue to supplement our external resourcing 
activities with internal development activities. These 
are discussed in more detail on pages 18 and 24, in our 
sustainability report and on our website. They include:

AMEC’s markets
Oil & Gas
The market
The IEA forecasts primary oil demand increasing from 
87 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2010 to 99 mb/d by 
2035. The increase is driven by the transport sector in 
emerging economies and occurs despite gains in fuel 
economy in Europe and the US.
A change in the production mix is expected over the 
same period, with a greater share being taken by 
natural gas liquids and unconventional sources. The 
fastest growing major energy source will be natural 
gas, with ExxonMobil suggesting that global demand 
will rise by about 60 per cent from 2010 to 2040. 
Production of conventional crude oil is forecast (IEA)  
to remain at current levels before dipping slightly to 
around 68 mb/d by 2035. The gross additional capacity 
required to maintain current production levels is 47 
mb/d by 2035 and this is assumed to come from fields 
already discovered but yet to be developed, largely in 
OPEC countries. 
The IEA forecasts an upstream oil and gas capital 
spending requirement between 2011 and 2035 of about 
$620 billion per annum on average, compared with 
over $550 billion in 2011.
JP Morgan’s latest Global Exploration and Production 
spending analysis suggests that in 2012, organic 
upstream spending could be 9 per cent higher 
than 2011. 10 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Our markets and sectors continued
The IEA forecasts suggest that unconventional oil & 
gas supply will grow from 2.6 mb/d in 2010 to 10 mb/d 
by 2035. In Canada, Alberta has proven oil reserves 
of 171.3 billion barrels and estimates capital 
expenditure of some Cdn$218 billion over the next  
25 years. Two main extraction techniques are used 
in the Canadian oil sands: surface mining, which 
currently accounts for around one half of production, 
and in-situ, which is expected to increase its share of 
the market over the next 10 years. In-situ methods, 
used to extract deeper reserves, utilise steam injected 
into reservoirs to mobilise the oil. 
BP, in their Energy Outlook 2030, forecast that shale 
gas and coal bed methane will account for 63 per  
cent of North American production by 2030. They 
expect unconventionals to play a growing role in  
other countries in the long term, as current  
technical and regulatory hurdles recede.
In general, oil & gas resources are increasingly difficult 
to extract. Projects have become larger and more 
complex and environmental pressures have increased. 
As existing infrastructure ages and reserves are being 
depleted, ever more sophisticated performance and 
efficiency improvement solutions are required. Oil & 
gas producers want oil services companies, such as 
AMEC, to provide expert consultants, engineers and 
project managers with a proven experience in 
delivering projects on time, on budget, without 
harming people or the environment. 
AMEC’s position
 Further details on the customer base and recent 
project wins can be found on pages 28 and 32. 
Conventional Oil & Gas 
AMEC offers a wide range of capex and opex services 
to a broad range of customers, which includes 
International Oil Companies (IOCs), National Oil 
Companies (NOCs) and independent operators in 
Europe, Americas, Middle East and Africa, the Caspian, 
South East Asia and China. We do not operate in early 
cycle exploration or drilling, but are involved in every 
part of the project delivery phase. Offshore, we support 
fixed platforms and floating production units, largely 
'above the water'. Recently and as a part of Vision 2015, 
we have been expanding our subsea engineering 
capabilities. We also support onshore oil and gas fields, 
booster stations, gathering centres, tank farms and 
gas-oil separation plants, and pipelines.
AMEC has global experience of delivering large and 
complex projects, with capabilities in deepwater and 
hostile conditions including Arctic environments and 
earthquake-prone regions. We have developed a strong 
position in frontier regions including the Caspian, South 
East Asia and West Africa and have a good track record 
in proactively helping customers deal with 
environmental pressures.
In the opex arena, AMEC is a leading international 
provider of asset support services. We are the market 
leader in UK North Sea brownfield services and also 
provide duty holder services and more integrated 
solutions to new entrant operators in the region. AMEC 
is increasingly providing more sophisticated solutions: 
for example,  adapting existing facilities to cope with 
both mature reservoir conditions and new 'tie-backs' 
developments.
Unconventional Oil & Gas 
AMEC is the market leader in the provision of project 
management and engineering services to the 
upstream surface mining Canadian oil sands sector . 
From helping to build the world’s first oil sands plant 
in 1967 to the world’s largest plant in 1978, AMEC’s 
operations have matured along with the industry, with 
participation in most recent oil sands developments. 
Of particular significance in recent years has been 
Imperial Oil's Kearl project, which has just moved into 
the expansion phase. Historically AMEC’s focus was on 
mineable oil sands, with the acquisition of BDR in 2008 
bringing in-situ expertise. This positions AMEC for the 
anticipated shift in activity as the new technology is 
increasingly being used, and on larger projects. 
AMEC has also started working on shale gas and coal 
bed methane projects, providing services such as 
environmental impact assessments and water table 
management.
AMEC is aware of the environmental concerns  
raised by these activities. The full capability of the 
Environment & Infrastructure division (see page 32) 
can be used to ensure that customers meet and, where 
possible, exceed local legislation, providing them with 
solutions to environmental challenges. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 11 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
Minerals & Metals 
The market
Demand for commodities continues to grow, stoked by 
strong growth in emerging markets. Both BHP Billiton 
and Anglo American recently reaffirmed (November 
2011) that the long term supply/demand fundamentals 
remain intact. Goldman Sachs, in a note entitled ‘Time 
to dig deep for the miners’ (September 2011) state that 
supply is increasingly constrained as development 
projects become more complex and are typically in 
more remote, unfamiliar territory. PwC's 8th Annual 
Review suggests that the capital programmes planned 
by the top 40 mining companies amount to more than 
US$300 billion, of which the US$120 billion planned for 
2011 was more than double the 2010 spend. 
In general, fewer easy-to-produce resources are 
leading to more challenging, complex and expensive 
developments, in more remote and riskier locations. 
Rio Tinto, in their 'Outlook for Copper 2010', suggested 
that while over half of all development in 2010 were in 
lower risk areas, by 2020 only 44 per cent would be. 
Increasingly new mining projects are underground 
rather than surface mines, and more logistical 
infrastructure and environmental controls are required.
As in oil & gas, the mining majors who dominate  
mine development capital investment are looking for 
suppliers, such as AMEC, with proven ability in project 
delivery.
AMEC’s position
AMEC has long sought to mitigate the impact of 
economic volatility by positioning itself to support a 
diverse range of commodities and service markets.  
We offer mining consultancy (including ore resource 
estimation, mine planning and feasibility studies), 
design, project and construction management services 
to global mining customers who are producing 
commodities including potash, gold, diamonds, base 
metals, coal, iron ore and uranium. We believe this 
provision of consulting and environmental services 
provides a distinct competitive advantage.
The business is a recognised leader in environments 
where projects have significant logistical challenges 
associated with remote location and difficult access. 
AMEC occupies a top-tier position in international 
consulting and a leading position in the North and 
South American EPCM (Engineering, Procurement  
and Construction Management) markets, where we 
have provided services for many of the world’s  
leading mining companies. 
The acquisition of GRD Minproc in November 2009 
added world-class technical capabilities in a number 
of  key commodities, including copper, gold, nickel, 
uranium and iron. It also delivered critical mass in 
Australasia and enhanced AMEC’s presence in Africa 
and South America. It is now fully integrated into our 
core activities and has successfully facilitated the 
winning of new business, which was not previously 
accessible to either company. 
AMEC’s historic focus has been largely on surface 
mining. In line with Vision 2015, this expertise has now 
also been applied to underground mining, including 
work on Oyu Tolgoi LLC’s copper and gold mining 
project in Mongolia. Going forward, we are looking to 
increase our position with major mining firms and on 
large scale developments.
 Further details on the customer base and recent 
project wins can be found on pages 28 and 32. 
Clean Energy
The market
Clean energy provides an increasingly key part of the 
global energy mix. Growth in this market is driven by 
the increasing demand for energy, energy security 
requirements, environmental regulations and 
government mandates. If targeted reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions are to stand any chance 
of being met, alternatives to fossil fuels have to be 
implemented alongside energy efficiency measures.
In 2011, global investment in clean energy reached 
a new high of $260 billion (Bloomberg New Energy 
Finance). 
Nuclear
The market
Prior to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
plant in March 2011, nuclear power capacity worldwide 
had been projected to increase to 630 GW in 2035, 
from 393 GW in 2009. Several governments are now 
reconsidering their policies towards nuclear power, 
either abandoning plans to build new nuclear plants  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 12
Our markets and sectors continued
(Italy) or accelerating or introducing timetables to 
phase out nuclear plants (Germany, Switzerland). 
However many more are expected to continue with 
their plans, though with delays as safety standards are 
reviewed.
Although the prospects for nuclear power are inevitably 
more uncertain, the latest IEA projections still show 
capacity growing to 630 GW in 2035 . About 60 per cent 
of the nuclear capacity forecast to be added in OECD 
countries is to replace ageing nuclear plants which will 
have been retired. Hence capacity in this region is 
forecast to increase by only 16 per cent.
Growth in the use of nuclear power continues to be 
supported by the need to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and by security of supply concerns, as it  
is less subject to economic or political uncertainty. 
The UK Government continues to support the 
replacement of the existing UK fleet of nuclear power 
stations. The Weightman report, issued by the Office 
for Nuclear Regulation, confirmed that there was  
no fundamental weakness in the UK's licensing 
programme and stressed that nuclear power is safer 
than it has ever been.
In Canada, nuclear power is used to generate 
approximately 15 per cent of electricity requirements, 
with 18 reactors in three provinces generating 12,600 
MWe of power capacity. Broad support remains for the 
further expansion of nuclear capacity, with the World 
Nuclear Association Nuclear Century Outlook 
suggesting that a further seven to 17 GWe could  
be put in place by 2030. 
Many of the world’s nuclear facilities will be reaching 
the end of their active life over the next 20 years. The 
clean-up and management of the nuclear legacy is one 
of the most demanding challenges facing the industry.
AMEC’s position
AMEC’s nuclear capability has been developed over 50 
years. We are deliberately positioned to support the full 
lifecycle of nuclear energy; from new build to reactor 
support (including lifetime extension) and finally to 
nuclear decommissioning and waste management. 
Our expertise remains ‘technology independent’ and 
our experience ranges across all four generations of 
nuclear technology. We work with our customers in 
long-term relationships based on partnering to 
support their major assets and have significant 
experience in effectively managing complex 
stakeholder relationships. Our customers include 
major utilities, governments, national regulators  
and other significant stakeholders and we have a 
particularly strong presence in the UK and Canada. 
Other key geographies for AMEC include Central  
and Eastern Europe and South Africa. 
Principal activities include:
 
 Providing pre-licensing and architect and owner 
engineer services ensuring support for project 
construction management on new build 
programmes worldwide. During the year, AMEC 
continued supporting EDF’s architect engineer 
operations on its UK nuclear new build programme
 
 Supporting major reactor re-start programmes  
such as Bruce Power in Ontario, Canada 
 
 Providing key technical and project management 
services to support the continued operation, 
enhancement and life time extension of existing 
reactor fleets 
 
 Managing UK decommissioning and waste 
management programmes. Importantly, AMEC 
holds a key position within Nuclear Management 
Partners (NMP) for the management of the 
Sellafield complex on behalf of the Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority (NDA)
 
 Providing project management, engineering and 
safety assurance services to nuclear 
decommissioning programmes across Europe 
 
 Providing licensing and regulatory support for the 
complete asset lifecycle from engineering, through 
commissioning and operation to decommissioning.
 Further details on the customer base and recent 
project wins can be found on pages 30 and 32. 
Renewables / Bioprocess 
The market
Growth in the renewables sector is driven by the 
requirement for energy security, the need to meet 
national and international emissions control and 
pollution control legislation, incentive mechanisms 
including short-term stimulus packages and improving 
technology. The market was previously dominated by 
technology developers but more recently utility, power  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 13 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
and oil & gas companies have all started to build 
positions. At the same time, technology improvements 
and rapid innovation are driving down unit costs. A 
review by Ernst & Y oung (Renewable Energy Country 
Attractiveness Indices, February 2011) suggested that 
the US has a total capacity of 58 GW, balanced across 
clean energy technologies and supported by a range  
of incentives. The opportunity in each of Canada and 
the UK is smaller, at about 7 GW, and focused on  
wind and biomass. 
The IEA forecasts that renewable based electricity 
generation worldwide will almost triple, from 3,900 
TWh in 2009 to 11,100 TWh in 2035. The bulk of the 
growth is expected to come from wind, hydro (one- 
third each), biomass and solar PV and amounts to an 
investment of some $5.9 trillion. Of this, over US$2.1 
trillion is invested in wind, US$1.5 trillion in solar and 
US$664 billion in biomass. ExxonMobil expect modern 
renewable fuels to account for about 7 per cent of 
global energy demand in 2040, compared to around  
3 per cent in 2010.
AMEC’s position
AMEC's focus is on wind, solar, biomass and biofuels 
projects and our customers include power utilities, 
financial institutions, government agencies, technology 
developers, OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) 
and specialist consultants. We are able to draw on our 
considerable experience and expertise in areas such  
as the power and pulp and paper sectors to assist our 
customers in implementing new technologies. For 
example, AMEC has considerable expertise and 
experience in wood handling, storage and conveyance, 
boiler technologies and co-firing of biomass in 
industrial boilers within the conventional power sector 
which is readily transferable to biomass. We are also  
a leader in the development of cellulosic ethanol, and 
have contributed to high-profile demonstration plants. 
Our customers appreciate the flexibility our technology 
neutrality brings, our focus and our ability to provide  
a full service EPC (Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction) solution. Projects may range from 
consultancy support during technology development 
for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the UK to wind 
EPC in Canada.
 Further details on the customer base and recent 
project wins can be found on pages 30 and 32. 
Power
This sector comprises generation of electricity from 
conventional sources other than nuclear, such as 
natural gas, oil, hydro and coal.  
The market
The IEA expects both the demand and supply of 
electricity to increase over the period to 2035. The 
increase will be particularly pronounced in non-OECD 
countries but will also be seen elsewhere. Government 
policies, particularly those relating to the use of carbon 
pricing and subsidies to renewables, are expected to 
influence the costs and hence the relative mix of 
different technologies and fuels used to satisfy this 
demand. Further, in the OECD alone, almost 800 GW of 
operational coal, gas, and oil-fired capacity is expected 
to be retired in the period to 2035, with an equivalent 
amount of replacement capacity more heavily biased 
towards gas. 
AMEC’s position
AMEC has expertise in the delivery of state-of-the-art 
boilers, gas turbines, gasifiers and turbine generators 
with high efficiency and low emission technology, as 
well as air quality control systems technologies for 
particulate, NOx, SOx, mercury, CO
2
 and other 
hazardous pollutants. 
The majority of services are performed for major 
energy providers, governments, developers and 
independent power producers, primarily in Europe  
and the Americas. 
Transmission & Distribution (T&D)
This sector covers power transmission and distribution 
for medium, high, and extra high voltage transmission 
lines and cables, substations and interconnectors. It 
also includes gas transmission and distribution.
The market
The sector is characterised by medium-term, 
sustainable growth which will be resistant to major 
cyclical swings. 
 
 Increasing global power demand creates the 
requirement for increased interconnection
 
 Shifts in supply and demand points, with the 
transition to low carbon generation and renewable 
energy in remote locations, drive system 
configuration changes AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 14
Our markets and sectors continued
 
 T&D networks in AMEC current and future 
territories require major asset renewal to replace 
life-expired assets following many years of 
underinvestment.
Gas investment will continue to grow in the short term, 
driven primarily by the issues of security of supply and 
the need to increase storage capacity in Europe and 
North America.
IEA World Economic Outlook 2011 suggests a total of 
$7.1 trillion needs to be invested in T&D infrastructure 
between 2011 and 2035. Of this, more than one-third  
is in OECD countries, where more than half the 
requirement will be spent on refurbishment and 
replacement of existing assets  as they reach the end  
of their technical lifetime.  
AMEC's position
Our major customers are T&D system owners with 
which we have had long-standing relationships. They 
include National Grid (including involvement in the 
Electricity Alliance West and in the M1 Gas Alliance, 
both in the UK) and Wales and West Utilities. In January 
2012, we announced a five-year extension to the 
Electricity Alliance West contract.
Environment & Infrastructure
The market
The environmental consulting and engineering market 
is both large and highly fragmented. 
An Environmental Analyst report 'Global Environmental 
Consulting Strategies and Competitor Analysis 2011' 
states that the global market was worth over US$25 
billion in 2009/10 and forecasts growth to US$30 billion 
by 2014/15. In particular, the climate change and 
energy services sub-sector is expected to grow by 50 
per cent as a result of strong underlying legislative  
and political drivers. Those economies led by natural 
resource industries, namely Australia, Brazil, Canada 
and South Africa, are expected to be more buoyant.  
The report also states that large private sector  
clients are increasingly looking for seamless global  
service provision.
Despite the strong, long-term market drivers, public 
sector spending cuts have had some impact in recent 
years. For example, the UK market declined in 2010 for 
the second year running (Environment Analyst, October 
2011) after two decades of uninterrupted growth. 
Nevertheless, in AMEC's opinion the underlying drivers 
of market growth remain strong. Growth in the UK 
market in 2011 has been estimated at 0.5 per cent. 
The top dozen international consultancies make up 
around a quarter of the global market, with the balance 
highly fragmented. 
AMEC’s position
AMEC operates in four sectors within this market: 
water / municipal, transportation / infrastructure, 
government services and industrial / commercial. The 
range of services provided is described in more detail 
on pages 32. 
Much of the work done by the Environment & 
Infrastructure division is in these four sectors, though 
27 per cent of the division's revenues now come from 
AMEC's other markets. Examples of projects on which 
AMEC has worked can be found on our website at 
amec.com/projects. The skills used are highly 
transferable across sectors and customers and are 
increasingly being used across AMEC's activities.
Water / Municipal
Water is a scarce resource, with less than 1 per cent of 
the world’s fresh water readily accessible for direct 
human use. Similar to energy, growth in the water 
sector is driven by demographic, economic, social and 
technological factors. In ‘Charting our Water Future’ 
(2010) the Water Resources Group suggests that water 
usage will grow from 4,500 billion m
3
 to 6,900 billion m
3
 
by 2030, 40 per cent above the current accessible, 
reliable supply. Closing this gap is estimated to require 
an increased annual capital expenditure of some $50 
– 60 billion, even with efficiency savings. Some 70 per 
cent of water withdrawals are for agriculture; industrial 
withdrawals are expected to increase from 16 to 22 per 
cent of the total by 2030. 
Similarly, in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) 
report ‘Water Crisis’, water is described as the 'oil of 
the 21st century'. The current market size is estimated 
to be US$500 billion, with compound annual growth  
of 6 per cent anticipated. BAML believe that the sector 
offers numerous growth opportunities for  
those with exposure to the industry’s value chain, 
particularly in Asia and South America and in the   AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 15

areas of water treatment, water management and 
water infrastructure.
AMEC’s position
AMEC provides a multi-disciplinary approach to water 
projects at all stages of planning, study, design and 
construction, seeking to provide sustainable and 
environmentally sound solutions for our government, 
business and industrial customers, whether the water 
source is above or below ground. Our primary areas of 
focus are:
 
 Water supply - including managing the transition 
from agricultural to municipal uses in semi-arid 
regions, managing aquifers beneath competing 
agency boundaries, and planning for anticipated 
water shortages
 
 Storm water - including both water quality and 
quantity services, ranging from site-specific to 
watershed-wide solutions
 
 Water quality - protection and enhancement, 
including contaminant removal services, modelling, 
and design treatment options such as lake aeration 
and wetland restoration
 
 Water treatment - including detail design of 
treatment systems as well as construction and 
environmental management.
Water services are also commonly provided to 
customers in AMEC's other markets, including 
minerals & metals and oil & gas.
Transportation / Infrastructure
AMEC has provided programme management, 
planning and design, project and construction 
management, asset development and long-term  
asset support to government transportation agencies, 
national and local customers and private developers  
in Canada and the US for over 50 years. 
We use our expertise to provide sustainable solutions 
which maintain, improve and increase the capacity  
of transportation infrastructure, whether highways  
and roads, ports and marine, or rail. Work is often 
completed in extreme conditions.
For example:
 
 Pavement management work involving hot and cold 
in-place recycling, which reduces the consumption 
of natural resources and minimises carbon 
emissions
 
 The design, installation and operation of road 
weather information systems, which enable 
transportation agencies to optimise winter 
maintenance activities
 
 Specialised marine weather forecasting services, 
providing operational support to offshore oil 
companies, major marine contractors and vessel 
operators.
Government services
A broad range of services are provided, including to  
the US Federal Government, which is the largest 
procurer of environmental services in the world. Here, 
customers include the US Air Force, US Army and  
US Navy, where services range from remediation 
programmes to fixed price design and delivery of 
airfield facilities at bases in the US and around the 
world. 
Again, work is often completed in diverse and 
challenging environments. Examples include ‘soil 
washing’ lead bullets and fragments from the crater 
of Hawaii’s Diamond Head volcano; and successfully 
installing an in-situ remediation system at Barnes Air 
National Guard Base. 
Industrial / Commercial
AMEC serves clients in the commercial, financial 
and legal community as well as manufacturing and 
industrial clients. Compliance and due diligence 
services are provided, ranging from geotechnical and 
environmental to materials and water resources 
consulting. AMEC’s knowledge of regulatory 
environments is used to apply a risk-based approach to 
environmental liability assessment and management.   
For example, since 1998 AMEC has provided 
environmental services to Home Depot Canada on 
over 100 project sites. These services have included 
environmental site assessments (ESA), report peer 
review, remediation supervision, site specific risk 
assessment, as well as support to Home Depot's 
overall Environmental Management Program.

experience, independent of location. We can deploy the 
best mix of our capabilities through a well-integrated 
work share and technical performance management 
system. We have a particular expertise in undertaking 
large and complex projects in remote areas and in 
extending the life of assets in the mid-late stages of 
their lifecycle.

Implementing Vision 2015
AMEC is a focused supplier of consultancy, engineering 
and project management services to the world’s oil and 
gas, minerals and metals, clean energy, environment 
and infrastructure markets. Our vision is that by 
continually delivering excellence, we inspire trust 
and loyalty in our customers. 
In our Vision 2015 strategy, first announced in 
December 2009, we showed how we expected to 
achieve growth towards our vision. We believe growth 
will come from the strength of our customer 
relationships; the skills of our people and the way in 
which they deliver successful projects; the markets in 
which we are positioned (see pages 8 to 15); and the 
strength of our balance sheet.
In financial terms, we expressed our Vision 2015 goal 
as being to achieve earnings per share of greater than 
100 pence in 2015, more than double the starting point 
in 2009.
2011 achievement 
 
 EPS was 70.5 pence, up 13 per cent on 2010
 
 We now expect to achieve our targeted EPS before 
2015
We have identified a number of areas of focus which, 
combined, will enable us to achieve our Vision 2015 
strategy. During 2011 significant progress has again 
been made towards our long-term goals.
Our customers  
We want our customers to recognise our engineering, 
project management and consultancy expertise  
and to trust us to deliver their projects successfully.  
Such a reputation does not come overnight, but is  
a key cornerstone of future growth. Our history 
demonstrates the importance of the long-term 
relationships we have built with many of our 
customers. Only by understanding their business,  
their objectives and their values can we identify how 
best to use our expertise to help them deliver . 
2011 achievements included:
 
 Further expanded existing customer relationships. 
For example, BG awarded us a three-year contract 
for engineering, procurement, construction, 
commissioning and project management for all their 
upstream North Sea assets, including the Armada, 
North Everest and Lomond platforms. We had 
previously only supported the Armada platform.  
In addition, we won a number of new or expanded 
contracts from BP, including engineering and project 
management services for the main platform design 
for Clair Ridge; programme management of BP's 
North Sea on and offshore projects; and a five-year 
US$600 million engineering and small projects 
contract for on and offshore assets in Azerbaijan. We 
also expanded our position with other customers, 
including Magnox and Sapphire Energy
 
 Added new customers including: GDF SUEZ (front 
end engineering design for Cygnus field in Southern 
North Sea), URENCO (three-year contract for full 
range of nuclear services in UK), Paladin,

the Marine Well Containment System in the Gulf of 
Mexico) and TGLP .
 Further details on these and many other contract 
wins can be found on pages 28, 30 and 32.
 Received a number of awards, details of which can 
be found on our website  
amec.com/aboutus/sustainability.
 
Our people  
Our success lies in the success of our employees and 
the way in which they deliver to our customers, as we 
do not own significant plant and equipment or 
proprietary technology. 
It is vital that we recruit, develop and retain the best 
people, ensuring they are engaged with AMEC and 
committed to the company’s success. We want to 
provide a safe working environment and encourage  
our people to take this same thinking home and into 
their communities – AMEC’s Beyond Zero approach. 
2011 achievements included:
 
  Over 8,000 gross new hires, of whom almost 3,000 
were recruited to work on UK North Sea projects

Achieving growth  
To achieve our Vision 2015 strategy, we need to not  
only build on our existing market positions but  
also to enhance our capabilities and expand our 
geographic coverage. We see this expansion as coming 
from a combination of acquisition and organic growth. 
In terms of capability, we have been looking to expand 
our service offering in areas such as subsea 
engineering, underground mining, renewables and 
water services. As well as building our presence in  
our established geographies of the UK and North 
America, we are looking to expand in the Middle East, 
Australasia and South America. At the same time, by 
careful positioning and rigorous attention to customer 
relationships and project delivery, we see opportunities 
to outperform the general market.
2011 achievements included:
 
 The acquisition of MACTEC, a 2,600-person,

Delivering the AMEC Way  
Even the best of employees will struggle to deliver high 
quality work if they are not provided with the right tools 
and support. The AMEC Way is how we work together 
across the company to deliver successful projects for 
our customers, supporting our 2011 achievements and 
our future growth.
2011 achievements included:
 
 The successful integration of MACTEC and the other 
acquisitions made during 2011
 
 Reissuing AMEC's Code of Business Conduct and 
introducing a Supply Chain Code of Business 
Conduct
 

 Establishment of the project delivery policy, which 
mandates a common global approach to  project 
delivery. By using common project processes, 
anyone in AMEC can start work from any location on 
any new project and understand the requirements 
immediately. 
Improving financial metrics  
Vision 2015 also looks at financial metrics, recognising 
that AMEC needs a more efficient capital structure and 
that the tax rate can be reduced while continuing to 
exercise due corporate responsibility.
2011 achievements included:

2012 outlook 
The priority for 2012 remains to grow the business by 
continuing to deliver for customers whilst investing in 
AMEC's people.
AMEC is on track to deliver double-digit underlying 
revenue growth in 2012, despite the continued macro- 
economic uncertainty. The strength of the order intake 
during 2011, the continued demand for AMEC's 
services and the on-going customer investment in 
AMEC's core markets are driving growth expectations. 
The full-year impact of acquisitions made in 2011 will 
further boost revenue growth. In addition, the pipeline 
for further acquisitions in 2012 remains strong.
Overall margins are expected to reduce somewhat, 
impacted by a shift in business mix and an increase in 
procurement activities for strategic customers. 
Management remains focused on the Vision 2015 
strategy and now expects to achieve earnings per 
share of greater than 100 pence ahead of 2015. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 21 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
Business threats and opportunities 
AMEC operates in some 40 countries globally, serving 
a broad range of markets and customers. As such,  
the group is subject to certain general and industry-
specific risks. Where practicable, the group seeks to 
mitigate exposure to all forms of risk through effective 
risk management and risk transfer practices.
Risk management process
A consistently applied methodology is used at project, 
operating company and group levels to identify the key 
risks that could have a significant impact on the ability 
of AMEC to achieve its objectives. These are recorded  
in risk registers and evaluated to determine the likely 
impact and probability of occurring. 
Control actions are developed to mitigate or eliminate 
risks that are considered unacceptable. Risk owners 
are identified and given responsibility for ensuring 
actions are implemented with appropriate review 
dates.
The risk registers are reviewed and updated at least 
quarterly with the relevant risk owners.
Reporting and monitoring
Reporting directly to the board, the risk management 
committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and meets 
at least twice each year to:
 
 review risk management policies, procedures and 
processes
 
 review the AMEC plc risk register and make 
recommendations as appropriate
 
 review, approve and make recommendations in 
respect of those risks which AMEC is willing to 
accept or assume in the ordinary course of business 
('risk appetite')
 
 review any issues raised by other committees of  
the board that impact on the risk profile of AMEC
 
 review any emerging risks and any potential impact 
they may have on risk appetite
 
 review and consider reports on key risk issues such 
as new business and geographical locations for 
operations or projects 
 
 issue risk reports and make recommendations  
to the board.

Managing risk continued 
The table shows AMEC’s principal business and strategic risks. Each is specific to the group and could have a 
material impact on it. Actions have been taken to mitigate these risks and these are also shown. 
Other financial risks are shown on page 97.
Principal business and strategic risks
Risk Mitigation
Geopolitical and economic conditions
AMEC operates predominately in the UK 
and North America and is therefore 
particularly affected by political and 
economic conditions in those markets.
Changes in general economic conditions 
may influence customers’ decisions  
on capital investment and/or asset 
maintenance, which could lead to volatility 
in the development of AMEC’s order 
intake. These may also lead to change  
in the customer base, competition and in 
the way customers procure the services  
we provide.
 
AMEC seeks to maintain a balanced geographic presence, and, through 
acquisitions and organic growth, will continue to increase its exposure to other 
attractive regions of the world.
 
The risk associated with economic conditions resulting in a downturn and 
affecting the demand for AMEC’s services has been addressed, as far as 
practicable, by seeking to maintain a balanced business portfolio in terms of 
geographies, markets, clients and service offering / business model.
In light of current global economic uncertainties, steps have been taken to 
assess and monitor any potential impact on AMEC’s business opportunities and 
address potential increased supply chain and, more broadly, counterparty risk.
 Further details on our markets and sectors can be found on page 8.
Changes in commodity prices
A sustained and significant reduction in  
oil and gas or commodity prices could 
have an adverse impact on the level of 
customer spending in AMEC’s markets and 
consequently represents a risk to organic 
growth.
 
This risk is mitigated by maintaining a balanced business portfolio of 
geographies, markets, clients and service offering.
Expansion of global footprint 
AMEC’s strategy would be affected by a 
failure to expand the global footprint into 
higher growth regions and to respond to 
competitive forces. 
 
AMEC‘s Vision 2015 strategy identified, by geography, the opportunities and 
risks across the markets in which AMEC operates. The strategy is regularly 
reviewed for continued relevance and covers both organic growth and mergers 
and acquisitions.
Mergers and acquisitions 
A failure to identify, complete and 
successfully integrate target acquisitions 
represents a risk to growth.
 
The Vision 2015 strategic plan includes a structured internal review of 
identified target acquisitions, followed by an established and robust due 
diligence and integration planning process.
Project delivery  
Failing to maintain discipline and meet 
customer expectations on project delivery 
could result in damage to reputation, loss 
of repeat business and potentially lead to 
litigation.
 
AMEC operates a system of globally applied policies and procedures. These, 
combined with comprehensive management oversight, the risk management 
process, project reviews, internal audit, peer reviews and customer feedback, 
mitigate the risk to successful project delivery.
Pensions 
AMEC operates a number of defined 
benefits pension schemes, where careful 
judgement is required in determining 
the assumptions for future salary and 
pension increases, discount rate, inflation, 
investment returns and member longevity. 
There is a risk of underestimating this 
liability.
 
This risk to AMEC’s pension schemes is mitigated by:
n maintaining a relatively strong funding position over time
n  taking advice from independent qualified actuaries and other 
professional advisers
n agreeing appropriate investment policies with the trustees
n  close monitoring of changes in the funding position, with reparatory action 
agreed with the trustees in the event that a sustained deficit emerges.
See note 14 on page 90 for further details on our pension schemes. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 23 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
Risk continued Mitigation continued
Health, safety and security 
AMEC is involved in activities and 
environments which have the potential  
to cause serious injury to personnel or 
damage to property or the environment 
and damage to our reputation.
In order to control risk and prevent harm, AMEC is focused on achieving the 
highest standards of health and safety management. This is achieved through 
setting of an effective health and safety policy and ensuring effective leadership 
and organisational arrangements are in place to deliver this policy.
The personal security risk to AMEC employees whilst travelling or working in 
potentially hazardous locations is mitigated by providing professional advice 
and support, together with appropriate contingency planning.
Health and safety performance is regularly reviewed against agreed targets to 
facilitate continuous improvement.
 The KPIs on page 26 show details of our recent performance.
Legacy risk
Litigation and business claims from 
divested and non-core businesses remain  
a risk to AMEC.
Managing non-core legacy assets until 
divestment may require skills which are  
not common to the rest of the company.
 
The established legacy team manages these claims with internal and external 
legal advice. The aim is to seek cost-effective management of litigation and 
promote commercially sensible settlements where appropriate.
AMEC has made provisions for the legacy issues which are believed to be 
adequate and is not aware of any current issues relating to disposed 
businesses which are likely to have a material impact.
Specialist teams with the appropriate knowledge are brought in as required.
Information technology (IT) 
AMEC is exposed to the risks that the IT 
systems on which it relies fail and/or that 
sensitive data held by the group is lost. 
 
AMEC has appropriate controls in place in order to mitigate the risk of systems 
failure and data loss, including systems back-up procedures and disaster 
recovery plans and also has appropriate virus protection, network security 
controls and encryption of mobile devices.
Staff recruitment and retention 
An inability to attract and retain sufficient 
high-calibre employees could become a 
barrier to the continued success and growth 
of AMEC.
 
This risk is mitigated with a clear Human Resources (HR) strategy, which is 
aligned to the business strategy and focused on attracting, developing and 
retaining the best people for AMEC. It is underpinned by an employee 
framework which describes how we manage our people consistently.
In addition, there is a continuous review of compensation and benefits to 
ensure sector and geographic competitiveness and there are localised 
recruitment teams capable of recruiting large numbers into AMEC using 
common systems.
AMEC Academy delivers development activities to enhance delivery and 
prepare employees for more advanced roles.
Ethical breach 
A substantive ethical breach and/or 
non-compliance with laws or regulations 
could potentially lead to damage to AMEC’s 
reputation, fines, litigation and claims for 
compensation.
AMEC has a number of measures in place across the group  to mitigate this 
risk, including:
n embedded policies and procedures
n Code of Business Conduct 
n segregation of duties
n management oversight   
n financial and operational controls 
n independent whistle-blowing mechanism 
n appointment of Ethics officers
n anti-fraud and other internal audits
n legal team advice
n ethics training programme
n oversight by the ethics committee of the board.

Sustainability 
This section provides a brief summary of our approach 
to sustainability. Further details can be found elsewhere 
in this report, in our sustainability report and on our 
website at amec.com/sustainability. 
Our aim is to create a successful, sustainable company 
for the long-term. To achieve this, we need to balance 
economic, social and environmental issues in our 
decision-making processes, ensuring sustainable 
working is integrated into the very core of our business. 
In 2011 we revised our sustainability strategy to 
strengthen the visible linkage with the core business 
strategy – from our values to Vision 2015 and beyond.  
We are now using three interwoven elements - living 
our values, excellent project delivery and sustainable 
growth – to support the delivery of our vision. See 
diagram opposite.
Living our values
We believe that AMEC’s vision and strategy for growth 
cannot be achieved without a solid foundation – AMEC’s 
values. Our values are integral to how we do business 
and how we deliver projects successfully for our 
customers. They create the cultural context in which 
we work, and form the foundation to our sustainability 
strategy in four key areas;
 
People
 
Safety
 
Environment 
 
Integrity.
Policies, processes and standards are in place globally 
so we can manage these areas consistently wherever 
we work. 
Highlights include:
 
Over 230 safety tours were undertaken by members 
of our leadership team, putting safety leadership into 
action and driving engagement on safety (safety)

across all AMEC operations (environment).
Excellent project delivery 
Our growth aspirations will only be achieved by focusing 
on our customers and how we deliver to them safely 
and sustainably in line with our values. 
Our customers face increasing legislative and other 
pressures to operate in a sustainable way and we at 
AMEC are in an ideal place to support them, working 
with our partners and supply chain. 
They are looking for sustainability solutions: 
sustainability consulting services such as greenhouse 
gas management; sustainable engineering projects 
such as wind farms or biodiesel facilities; and applied 
sustainability, incorporating key aspects of 
sustainability into a project as a value-added service. 
In each of these areas, we utilise our internal 
programmes and tools, along with AMEC’s technical 
and scientific expertise, to ensure excellent customer 
delivery.
Highlights include:
 
Consistent project management systems and 
processes are enabling our minerals & metals 
groups in Canada,  South Africa and the Philippines

Carbon associated with our office utilities was down 
16 per cent  from 2010 levels giving a saving of some 
£1 million on our energy costs. 
In our reporting on sustainability we focus on those 
areas which are most important for us, to our 
stakeholders, and those which are critical for AMEC’s 
long-term success. We set targets for, and check on 
the progress of, over 40 sustainability indicators, some 
of which are incorporated into this report. The 2011 
Annual Sustainability Performance report is on our

Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
Business and financial review
Introduction
This business and financial review sets out descriptions 
of each of the group’s business segments, their 
markets, strategy and significant factors affecting 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2011. It 
should be read in conjunction with the information on 
our markets and sectors (page 8), our services (page 
16) and our Vision 2015 strategy (page 18). It includes 
comments on movements in the income statement, 
balance sheet and cash flow statement and on matters 
that may have an impact on the group’s future financial 
performance. The review provides a broader 
perspective of AMEC’s businesses to enable a more 
informed judgement to be made of the group’s 
financial performance and prospects. Certain 
forward-looking statements with respect to the 
financial condition, operations and results of AMEC’s 
businesses are contained in the review. These 
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they 
relate to events and depend upon circumstances that 
will occur in the future. There are a number of factors 
that could cause actual performance or developments 
to differ materially from those expressed or implied  
by these forward-looking statements. The review is 
provided solely to provide additional information to 
assist in the assessment of the group’s strategy and 
future prospects. It should not be relied on for any 
other purpose.
Basis of presentation and discontinued 
operations
The following analysis is based on the results for 
continuing operations before intangible amortisation 
and exceptional items but including joint venture profit 
before interest, tax and intangible amortisation (EBITA).
During 2011, the basis of preparation has been revised 
to present the results to the nearest million rather than 
to one decimal place. Calculated numbers, such as 
EPS and margin rates, continue to be based on the 
underlying numbers to one decimal place precision. 
In accordance with IFRS 5*, the post-tax results of 
discontinued operations are disclosed separately in  
the consolidated income statement.
The cash flows of discontinued businesses are fully 
consolidated within AMEC up to the date of sale.
Segmental analysis
Segmental analysis is provided for the group’s core 
activities in the Natural Resources, Power & Process 
and Environment & Infrastructure (previously Earth & 
Environmental) divisions, as well as for non-core 
Investments and other activities.
Amounts and percentage movements relating to 
continuing segmental earnings before net financing 
income, tax and intangible amortisation (EBITA)  
are stated before corporate costs of £34 million  
(2010: £36 million) and pre-tax exceptional costs  
of £6 million  (2010: income of £11 million). The 
segmental analysis for the year ended 31 December 
2010 has been restated for certain changes to the 
reporting allocation as explained on page 71. 
The average number of employees for the years ended 
31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 stated in 
this review includes agency staff and 2010 figures have 
been restated in line with the changes to reporting 
allocations.

others. 
In addition, in January 2012 AMEC was awarded 
extensions to two asset support contracts worth  
£70 million over three years for SABIC.
2011 performance 
Revenue in the Natural Resources division improved  
9 per cent to £1,742 million through a mix of organic 
growth and acquisitions. The oil and gas and mining 
sectors were the primary drivers, both up compared to 
2010. This was offset by a decline in oil sands activities 
due to the phasing of work on Imperial Oil’s Kearl 
project, which peaked in 2010 at the height of the  
first phase.
EBITA (£192 million) was up 7 per cent, and the EBITA 
margin remained broadly stable at 11.0 per cent. 
Contract wins in 2011 reflect continued customer 
spending in core energy and commodity markets, the 
strength of UK North Sea activity and AMEC’s work on 
strategic customer relationships. 
 Further details can be found on our website.
Order intake has improved with oil and gas and mining 
activity driving the increase. The order book at 
31 December 2011 was up 17 per cent at £2.2 billion. 
The outlook for growth in 2012 is good. This is driven by 
positive trends in the oil and gas market, particularly 
within the UK North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and 
the minerals and metals market, with oil sands 
volumes also expected to improve.
The shift in business mix and the increase in 
procurement activities for strategic customers will 
impact margins. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 30

Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
Elsewhere in the North American clean energy market, 
good progress is being made on the Sapphire Energy 
biofuel project in the US and new contracts were 
signed for the 99 MW Erieau wind project and the  
10 MW Brockville PV solar project in Canada.
2011 performance 
Revenue increased 6 per cent, to £849 million in  
2011 (2010: £802 million), reflecting increased activity 
in North America and in the UK nuclear sector  
in particular .
EBITA was up 11 per cent, to £72 million (2010: £65 
million), with the Sellafield decommissioning joint 
venture contributing £20 million (2010: £16 million). 
The overall EBITA margin improved by 40 basis points 
to 8.5 per cent.
Contract awards in 2011 reflect the focus on the clean 
energy market, particularly nuclear where AMEC has 
benefited from an increase in safety engineering work. 
 Further details can be found on our website.
The order book at 31 December 2011 was £1.0 billion, 
(2010: £1.0 billion). The tier one Sellafield 
decommissioning contract, as it is an equity accounted 
joint venture, is not included in these figures.
Progress continues to be made on the resolution of the 
‘older contracts’, which, as previously referenced, do 
not meet the revised criteria of low-risk services with 
high value-add.  
Looking ahead, activity levels are expected to improve 
through the ongoing customer focus and the growing 
market for AMEC’s engineering, project management 
and consultancy services in the clean energy market. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 32

Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
The order book improved to £0.5 billion (31 December 
2010: £0.3 billion) largely due to the inclusion of 
MACTEC.  
In 2012, revenue growth is expected to continue, 
boosted by the MACTEC acquisition and a more 
favourable outlook for both the natural resource 
sectors and the North American economy in general.
Investments and other activities 
This principally comprises the Incheon Bridge PPP 
project in Korea, now in operational phase, the 
Lancashire Waste PPP project, and AMEC’s residual 
UK wind development activities. Revenue was £7 
million (2010: £7 million) with EBITA £3 million (2010: 
£6 million).

Basis of preparation of the accounts
The 2011 annual report and accounts have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the 
EU (adopted IFRS) as at 31 December 2011. 
The directors have identified the policies for accounting 
for retirement benefits, long-term contracts and 
provisions for litigation matters and liabilities related  
to the sale of businesses, as the most critical because 
they involve high levels of judgement and estimation.
Retirement benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for  
in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries but significant judgements are required in 
relation to the assumptions for future salary and 
pension increases, discount rate, inflation, investment 
returns and member life expectancy that underpin 
their valuations. For AMEC, these assumptions are 
important given the relative size of the schemes that 
remain open.
Financial review AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 34
Financial review continued
Long-term contracts 
A significant amount of the group’s activities is 
undertaken via long-term contracts. These contracts 
are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ which require estimates  
to be made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs 
and revenues on the latest available information, which 
includes detailed contract valuations. In many cases 
the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term 
contractual obligations which span more than one 
reporting period. Contract costs and revenues are 
affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the 
outcome of future events and often need to be revised 
as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved. The 
estimates of contract costs and revenues are updated 
regularly and significant changes are highlighted 
through established internal review procedures. In 
particular, the internal reviews focus on the timing and 
recognition of incentive payments and the age and 
recoverability of any unagreed income from variations 
to the contract scope or claims. The impact of the 
changes in these accounting estimates is then 
reflected in the ongoing results.
Provisions for litigation matters and liabilities  
related to the sale of businesses
When accounting for provisions for litigation and other 
items, the group has taken internal and external advice 
in considering known legal claims and actions made by 
or against the group. It carefully assesses the likelihood 
of success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions 
are made for legal claims or actions against the group 
on the basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are 
made for those which, in the view of management,  
are unlikely to succeed.
Results  
Revenue for the year increased 11 per cent to  
£3,261 million (2010: £2,951 million). Underlying 
revenue increased by 3 per cent, driven by a  
strong performance within the oil and gas and 
minerals and metals markets, offset by a decline  
in oil sands and US federal activities.
EBITA increased 12 per cent to £299 million  
(2010: £269 million) with margins broadly in line at  
9.2 per cent (2010: 9.1 per cent). The underlying EBITA 
increased by 6 per cent.
Adjusted profit before tax of £311 million was ahead of 
the previous year (2010: £280 million) driven by volume 
growth and acquisitions. There was joint venture tax of 
£7 million (2010: £7 million), amortisation of £39 million 
(2010: £25 million) and exceptional losses of £6 million 
(2010: profits of £11 million) resulting in profit before 
tax of £259 million (2010: £259 million). The tax charge 
for the year, including tax on amortisation and 
exceptional items, was £52 million (2010: £23 million) 
resulting in a total profit for the year from continuing 
operations of £207 million (2010: £236 million). 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations were 70.5 pence (2010: 62.5 pence), an 
increase of 13 per cent.
Operating cash flow for the period was £267 million 
(2010: £219 million), up £48 million from last year, 
reflecting EBITA growth and the continued focus on 
cash management. Cash conversion was 89 per cent 
(2010: 81 per cent).
The average number of employees was up 17 per cent 
in 2011, to 25,757. This reflects increased activity levels, 
particularly in UK North Sea and the Americas, as well 
as the impact of acquisitions. The largest increase was 
seen in the Environment & Infrastructure division, 
which was up 39 per cent to 6,262 (2010: 4,517) boosted 
by the impact of MACTEC and ten months’ impact of 
BCI.
Geographical analysis 
The group’s largest market was the UK with 30 per 
cent of revenue (2010: 29 per cent), driven by oil and 
gas, nuclear, power and environmental services. 
Canada was the group’s largest market in 2010, but  
in 2011 revenue was affected by the decline in oil  
sands activity, as previously referenced.
Administrative expenses 
Administrative expenses increased by £2 million  
to £209 million (2010: £207 million) as a result of 
acquisitions during the period. The impact was partially 
offset by a reduced charge in respect of share-based 
payments. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 35 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
Net financing income 
Net financing income of £16 million was £1 million 
higher than last year (2010: £15 million) and included 
bank interest of £4 million (2010: £6 million), net 
interest on pensions assets and liabilities of £9 
million (2010: £7 million) and foreign exchange gains 
and other items of £3 million (2010: £2 million). 
The average interest rate received was approximately 
0.8 per cent compared to 0.9 per cent in 2010.
In addition, AMEC’s share of interest payable of  
equity accounted joint ventures was £4 million (2010: 
£4 million).
Taxation 
Continuing operations
The group’s effective tax rate in 2011 for the 
continuing businesses (including tax attributable to 
joint venture interests) before exceptional items and 
excluding intangible amortisation was 24.1 per cent 
(2010: 25.9 per cent). The reduction principally 
reflects the benefit of previously unrecognised tax 
losses, decreases in statutory tax rates, the 
agreement of historical items with various tax 
authorities and more proactive management.
The tax rate in 2012 and beyond is expected to be  
in the mid-20s.
Deferred tax
At 31 December 2011, the group had deferred tax 
assets of £72 million (2010: £60 million) arising 
primarily from short-term timing differences relating 
to provisions, property, plant and equipment, 
retirement benefits and tax losses, offset by liabilities 
in respect of intangible assets.
Changes to reporting allocations 
In 2011 the allocation of certain items was changed: 
 
The UK Asset Support business was transferred 
from Power & Process to Natural Resources
 
The net interest on pension assets and liabilities 
and the net interest within equity accounted JVs 
were transferred from EBITA to net financing 
income. 
These were reallocations only and there was no 
overall impact to profit before tax or earnings. 
Financial position and net cash
The group remains in a strong financial position, with 
net cash as at 31 December 2011 of £521 million 
(2010: £740 million).
Cash generated from operations in 2011 was £209 
million (2010: £172 million). After adjusting for 
exceptional items and discontinued operations, 
legacy settlements, pension payments in excess of 
amounts recognised in the income statement and 
dividends received from joint ventures, operating 
cash flow was £267 million (2010: £219 million).
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the group has 
adequate resources to operate for the foreseeable 
future. 
Intangible amortisation and goodwill 
impairment 
The charge of £39 million for 2011 (2010: £25 million) 
includes intangible amortisation of £37 million and 
goodwill impairment of £2 million. Intangible 
amortisation relates to capitalised software and 
intangible assets acquired as part of the group’s 
expansion programme. The 2011 charge is £12 
million higher than the prior year (2010: £25 million) 
with the increase due to the acquisitions in the year 
and the full-year impact of acquisitions in 2010. 
In line with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, annual 
impairment reviews have been performed on the 
goodwill carried on the balance sheet. As a result of 
the disposal of a small business during the year, 
there was £2 million impairment charge in 2011 
(2010: nil).
Exceptional items 
One small business was divested during 2011 and 
there were various adjustments to existing provisions 
in respect of prior year disposals. Other exceptional 
items include transaction and deferred compensation 
costs on acquisitions, costs associated with exiting 
the group’s activities in Libya and restructuring costs 
in Environment & Infrastructure following the 
acquisition of MACTEC.
In aggregate, there was a post-tax exceptional gain of 
£25 million (2010: £45 million).  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 36
Legacy issues
No new significant contingent liabilities were added  
in 2011. Provisions currently held for future costs of 
litigation total £54 million (2010: £50 million).
Balance sheet highlights 
Key movements in the balance sheet are discussed 
below:
Intangible assets
The net book value of intangible assets as at 31 
December 2011 was £848 million (2010: £621 million) 
comprising goodwill £725 million, software £27 million 
and other acquired intangible assets £96 million.
The increase in goodwill of £164 million primarily 
relates to the acquisitions in the year of Zektingroup, 
qedi, BCI and MACTEC. Other acquired intangible 
assets include the value of customer relationships, 
brand names/trademarks, non-compete agreements 
and order backlogs of acquired businesses.  
Working capital
Days’ sales in inventory / WIP and receivables are as 
follows:

Group 80 78
The increase in days’ sales in inventory / WIP and 
receivables reflects the increase in activity during the 
second half of the year compared with the same period  
in 2010.
Derivative financial instruments
As at 31 December 2011, there were derivative 
financial instruments with a net liability of £14 million 
(2010: £37 million) on the balance sheet. This net 
liability represents the fair value of foreign exchange 
contracts used to hedge the cash flows of foreign 
currency contracts and cross currency instruments 
used to hedge the net investment in overseas 
subsidiaries.
Distributable reserves
As at 31 December 2011, distributable reserves of 
AMEC plc stood at £820 million (2010: £696 million). 
£ million
As at 1 January 201 1 696
Dividends approved during 201 1 (86)
Dividends received by subsidiaries 188
Other movements 22
As at 31 December 201 1 820
A dividend of £19 million received from a subsidiary 
company in a prior period is not considered to be 
distributable.
Pensions
The IAS 19 surplus of the principal UK pension 
schemes at the end of 2011 of £32 million was lower 
than in 2010 (£63 million) reflecting principally a 
reduction on the discount rate, which was partly offset 
by higher than expected asset returns and other 
actuarial gains.  
The triennial valuation of the main UK schemes was 
finalised during 2011. The actuarial assumptions 
adopted for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2011 
have been updated in line with the scheme experience 
identified as part of the triennial valuation. The revised 
mortality assumption was chosen with regard to the 
latest available tables, adjusted where appropriate to 
reflect the experience of the schemes’ membership.  
The tables adopted are part of the S1 series of tables, 
taking into account each member’s year of birth 
adjusted by an age rating of -½ year for males and +¼ 
year for females, and allowing for an underpin of 1.25 
per cent per annum improvements in longevity. For a 
male/female aged 65 in 2011, these tables show a life 
expectancy of 22.7/24.1 years. For a male/female aged 
45 in 2011, these tables show a life expectancy from 
age 65 of 24.5/26.1 years.
In association with the trustees of the schemes, AMEC 
will continue to monitor scheme mortality experience 
and will revise assumptions as appropriate.
Contributions of £28 million were paid to the company’s 
defined benefit schemes during the year (2010: £22 
million). This included special contributions agreed 
with the trustees of £5 million (2010: £5 million).  
Financial review continued AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 37 
Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials Overview 
There are a number of smaller schemes which are  
in a deficit position. The combined deficit as at 31 
December 2011 was £81 million (2010: £36 million) 
with the increase in the year being due to an actuarial 
loss in a Canadian scheme and a deficit on a scheme 
which was acquired with MACTEC.
Provisions
Provisions held at 31 December 2011 were £169 
million (31 December 2010: £187 million). During 2011, 
£36 million of the brought forward provisions were 
utilised. As part of the ongoing review of the potential 
liabilities, £29 million of provisions were released as 
they were no longer required but an additional £47 
million of provisions were created, which included  
£23 million arising from business combinations 
matched by a corresponding indemnity asset. 
Provisions are analysed as follows:

2012 the board commenced an on-market share 
buyback programme of £400 million. It is expected that 
this programme will be completed over the following 
12 months. Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 43 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
at the 2012 annual general meeting to extend the 
authority of the directors to make market purchases  
of up to 14.99 per cent of the company’s shares within 
prescribed limits. It is expected that the first purchases 
under this programme will be held as treasury shares 
to satisfy obligations under the company's employee 
and executive share schemes. It is the company's 
intention that the significant majority of the shares 
purchased under the programme will be cancelled.
Authority to allot shares
Authority was granted to the directors at the 2011 
annual general meeting to allot shares or grant rights 
to subscribe for or to convert any security to shares  
up to a nominal amount of £54,891,707 (Section 551 
amount) of which up to £8,316,925 could be allotted for 
cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive offer 
(Section 561 amount). Resolutions will be proposed at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting to extend  
this authority to 1 June 2013. The revised Section 551 
amount will be £55,382,860 and the revised Section  
561 amount will be £8,307,429.
The directors have no present intention of issuing any 
shares other than in respect of the exercise of share 
options. No issue will be made which will effectively 
alter the control of the company without the prior 
approval of shareholders in general meeting. 
Major interests in shares
On the basis of notifications received under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 5) and other 
notifications received by AMEC from shareholders, 
shareholdings of 3 per cent or more of the voting rights 
of the company as at 31 December 2011 were 
as follows: 
Number Per cent
BlackRock, Inc 33,121,639 9.94
Legal & General Assurance 13,197,514 3.96
The shareholding percentages have been adjusted 
from those notified to reflect the current issued share 
capital net of treasury shares. There were no other 
notifications received under DTR 5 between 
31 December 2011 and 21 February 2012.
There are no shareholdings which carry special rights 
relating to control of the company.
Financial instruments
Disclosures relating to the group’s use of financial 
instruments can be found in note 19 on page 97 and 
are incorporated into this report by reference.
Significant arrangements - change of 
control
The company is not party to any significant agreements 
that would take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control following a takeover bid.
Employees  
In 2011 AMEC employed on average 25,757 people 
worldwide including agency staff. 
At AMEC, we give high priority to the development of 
our employees to ensure that we have the necessary 
skills and behaviours to deliver our strategic business 
objectives and to provide for management succession. 
Processes are in place across the group for the regular 
and consistent review of employee performance, 
development and management succession. Common 
training needs are delivered through the AMEC 
Academy (see page 9 for further information).
It is of key importance that we engage with employees 
to ensure they understand the direction in which the 
company is going, are committed to AMEC’s values, 
and are empowered to propose and make changes to 
improve how we operate. Our employees embody our 
knowledge, brand and reputation and it is through their 
activities, day by day, that we deliver on our business 
objectives and commitments to shareholders, clients 
and the wider community. 
A regular survey of employee opinion is conducted  
and we are committed to sharing and acting on the 
outcomes (see page 25). AMEC provides a wide range 
of mechanisms for employees to share knowledge, to 
be kept informed of developments within AMEC and  
to raise issues and discuss matters of concern.
Respect for cultural diversity and commitment to equal 
opportunities are included in our values and Code of 
Business Conduct. Our policy is to recruit from the 
widest labour market, to determine the careers of all 
employees solely on merit and to make judgements 
about employees without bias or prejudice. 
As part of AMEC’s equal opportunities policy, 
procedures are in place that are designed to provide for 
full and fair consideration and selection of disabled  44

The above statement is made in accordance with 
section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Annual general meeting
This year’s annual general meeting will be held at  
The Auditorium, Ground Floor, Deutsche Bank AG, 
Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London, 
EC2N 2DB on 19 April 2012 at 10.30 am. The notice  
of meeting, which includes explanatory notes on the

Code).
Shareholders will also be asked to renew both the 
general authority of the directors to allot shares in 
the company and to allot such shares without the 
applicants, to ensure they are properly trained to 
perform safely and effectively, and to provide career 
opportunities that allow them to fulfil their potential. 
Where an employee becomes disabled in the course  
of their employment, AMEC will actively seek to retain 
them wherever possible by making adjustments to 
their work content and environment or by retraining 
them to undertake new roles.
Our SAYE share option schemes allow employees to 
participate in AMEC’s share price growth. They are 
open to employees in all major countries of operation 
who meet a minimum service qualification. Offers to 
participate are currently being made on a regular 
basis. 
Sustainability

Donations
Total donations worldwide amounted to £506,000 for 
the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: £553,000). Of 
these, donations to UK charities amounted to £240,000 
(2010: £295,000). 
Our policy is not to make political donations and none 
were made during 2011 (2010 – £nil).
Creditor payment policy
Individual group businesses are responsible for 
agreeing terms and conditions under which 
transactions with their suppliers are conducted. 
It is our policy that payments to suppliers are generally 
made in accordance with these terms and conditions, 
provided that the supplier complies with all of its 
obligations in this regard. 
The company had 29 days' purchases outstanding  
as at 31 December 2011 (2010: 41 days) based on the 
average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during  
the year .
Going concern 
The directors, having made enquiries, consider that  
the group has adequate resources to operate for the 
foreseeable future and, therefore, it is appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 45

application of statutory pre-emption rights. In addition, 
shareholders will be requested to authorise the 
company to make market purchases of its own shares 
within prescribed limits and approve the resolution,  
to be repeated at each annual general meeting going 
forward, to authorise the calling of general meetings, 
other than annual general meetings, on 14 clear  
days’ notice.
The board views the annual general meeting as an 
opportunity to directly communicate the group’s 
progress and engage with shareholders. Where 
possible, the entire board will attend the annual 
general meeting and will be available to answer 
questions from those shareholders present. The board 
encourages all shareholders to attend and participate 
where possible.

changes and be in a position to provide the necessary 
rigour to the process. The last such review was in 2008.
The board has placed particular emphasis on 
monitoring risk and on the structured approach to the 
management of risk in the company. This has included 
an emphasis on risk segmentation to ensure the more 
significant risks are continually focused upon by 
management. Our approach to risk management  
and a review of key risks are presented on pages 21  
to 23. Continuous improvement in this area will be  
an ongoing priority.
The discussions I have had with many of our major 
shareholders have allowed me to understand more 
about their views on our company, its strategy and 
management. In return I have explained what I have 
found since joining the company and my priorities 
going forward. I find these discussions invaluable and 
will continue to prioritise them. I am looking forward  
to meeting many more shareholders at our annual 
general meeting in April and would encourage you  
to attend. 
As a board, we support the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and believe we have largely complied with its 
provisions throughout the year ended 31 December 
2011. The only exception is the requirement for an 
externally facilitated evaluation of the board’s 
performance at least every three years (provision 
B.6.2), as discussed above. Further details on how we 
have applied the principles of the Code to our activities 
can be found in this statement and in the remuneration 
report on pages 56 to 64.
John Connolly 
Chairman
21 February 2012
The ultimate goal of your board is to collectively and 
effectively lead the company in delivering long-term, 
sustainable success for the benefit of our stakeholders.  
A vital responsibility of the board, which contributes to 
this, is maintaining strong corporate governance 
practices - and essentially strong corporate 
governance is about helping to run our company well.  
It is about the approach we take to governance, what 
we do, how we do it, the values we embed in our people 
and the company, and how the leadership sets the tone 
for the organisation. Strong governance is about 
leadership, collaboration and constantly seeking 
improvement. We have welcomed the recent debate 
and guidance in this area and continue to seek to 
incorporate improvements into our way of working.
Since I became your chairman in June 2011, I have 
concentrated on a few key governance issues.  
A particular priority has been to establish the right  
kind of relationship with the Chief Executive and the 
executive team based upon an appropriate balance of 
positive support combined with healthy, constructive 
challenge where required. I have sought specific input 
from all directors on board priorities, areas where  
our practices can improve and on the extent and 
appropriateness of information provided to the board 
by the executives. I have reviewed the composition  
and remit of our board committees and the results can 
be seen on pages 51 to 53. In particular, the terms  
of reference for the ethics committee have been 
refocused and strengthened, in support of AMEC’s core 
value of ‘acting with integrity.’ Our Code of Business 
Conduct has been updated and reissued, ethics officers 
appointed and our ethics helpline re-launched in 
multiple languages, so better reflecting the global 
nature of our business. 
I have undertaken an internal evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the board, both by discussions with 
individual members and using board debate. I believe 
we have a good, strong mix of skills represented, 
though further work is required to ensure the diversity 
of our business is reflected at a board level. In 
particular, I am very aware that we currently have no 
women on our board and will be seeking to remedy this 
as part of the process of board renewal. I am planning 
an externally-led board evaluation process in 2012, by 
which time I believe we will have bedded in recent

Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
The board
Board composition 
As at 31 December 2011, the board comprised the 
non-executive Chairman (John Connolly); three 
executive directors: the Chief Executive (Samir Brikho), 
Chief Financial Officer (Ian McHoul) and Chief 
Operating Officer (Neil Bruce); and four non-executive 
directors. Taking into account the provisions of the 
Code, the board has determined the non-executive 
directors remain independent and free from any 
relationships or circumstances which could affect  
their independent judgement. The Chairman was 
considered to be independent on appointment at  
1 June 2011. 
The directors consider the size, combination of skills 
and weight of industry experience on the board 
appropriate to the range and breadth of markets  
AMEC operates in. The balance of executive and 
non-executive directors, reinforced by adherence to 
sound governance procedures and the fostering of 
mutual respect and individual director integrity, 
ensures no one individual, or group of individuals, 
dominates the board’s decision-making process. The 
varied backgrounds and commercial experience 
provided by the non-executive directors, and their 
independence of management, ensure rigorous debate 
at meetings and the constructive challenge of the 
executive directors in relation to both the strategic 
direction and performance of the group. The entire 
board receives a succession planning presentation 
each year and is mindful, when considering 
recommendations from the nominations committee,  
of the maintenance of an appropriate balance of skills 
and experience both at, and directly below, board level 
to ensure the delivery of the group’s strategy and 
performance.
In line with the recommendations of the Code, and in 
accordance with article 81 of the articles of association 
of the company, the Chairman will retire from office  
at our 2012 annual general meeting and offer himself 
for election. In compliance with the Code and, as 
commenced last year in the interests of good corporate 
governance, all of the other directors wishing to 
continue serving, and considered eligible by the board, 
will offer themselves for re-election. Details of the 
directors, including their biographies, other significant 
commitments and committee memberships can be 
found on pages 40 and 41 and will enable shareholders 
to take an informed decision on their re-election. In 
addition, details of the directors’ service contracts, 
emoluments and share interests are set out in the 
remuneration report on pages 56 to 64. 
The Chairman and Chief Executive 
The company does not combine the role of Chairman 
and Chief Executive. There is a clear and well 
established division of accountability and responsibility 
between the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
and these are set out in writing and have been agreed 
by the board. The consequence of a clear division of 
responsibility at the head of the company is such that 
no individual has unfettered powers of decision. 
The Chairman is principally responsible for the 
leadership and effectiveness of the board. At a high 
level, he is accountable for facilitating constructive 
relations between, and the participation of, all board 
members, so as to encourage a culture of openness 
and debate and enable the board to fulfil all aspects of 
its role. The Chairman has undertaken to ensure that 
the board discharges its duties in the best interests of 
all of the company’s stakeholders, and to guide AMEC’s 
business and conduct in accordance with the highest 
ethical standards. In setting the board’s agenda, the 
Chairman ensures sufficient time is available for 
discussion and meaningful challenge of all matters 
before the board, particularly strategy, performance, 
value creation and accountability. 
The Chief Executive’s principal responsibility is  
running AMEC’s businesses with the primary  
objective of creating shareholder value. Consistent  
with this objective, the Chief Executive has ultimate 
responsibility for the proposal, development and 
implementation of the group’s strategy. The building 
and maintenance of an effective executive team, and 
the allocation of responsibility within it, are key 
components of, and essential to, the performance of 
the Chief Executive’s role. The Chief Executive takes the 
lead role in the promotion of AMEC and gives personal 
leadership to the preservation of AMEC’s culture and 
values and encourages the highest standards of safety, 
health and environmental performance.
Senior Independent Director 
Tim Faithfull has acted as the board’s Senior 
Independent Director since 13 May 2009. He was 
selected for the role on account of his extensive  48

non-executive director . In this role, he is responsible 
for:

sounding board for, the Chairman

acting as an additional channel of communication 
between the Chairman and the other directors

non-executive directors as to the performance of  
the Chairman
 
following completion of the above evaluation

overseeing the recruitment of the Chairman.
Non-executive directors  
Our non-executive directors are crucial in bringing  
an external view and wide range of skills, experience 
and expertise to the board’s deliberations and 
development of strategy. They constructively challenge 
and scrutinise the performance of management 
against agreed objectives and provide an invaluable 
contribution to the work of the board’s committees.  
The board benefits greatly from the contribution and 
balance provided by the non-executive directors. To 
ensure the preservation of this benefit, the Chairman 
holds regular meetings with the non-executive 
directors, without the executive directors present.
AMEC’s non-executive directors are appointed for 
specified terms of three years, subject now to annual 
re-election in accordance with the Code. Prior to 
appointment and on any material changes, the external 
commitments of each non-executive director, including 
those of the Chairman, are reviewed. Any significant 
external commitments are disclosed to the board  
to ensure they will be able to commit sufficient time to 
meet what is expected of them. Each director’s 
undertaking as to their ongoing commitment to the 
role, together with an assessment of their continued 
independence, is reviewed as part of their performance 
evaluation. 
The non-executive directors are not employed by the 
company in any capacity, nor have they been in the 
past. The letters of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the company’s 
registered office, by request to the Company Secretary, 
and will be available for inspection at the company’s 
forthcoming annual general meeting.   
Role and responsibilities
The board is ultimately responsible for ensuring  
the long term success of the company in accordance 
with the expectations of, and its obligations to, all 
stakeholders. In order to discharge its role the board 
must provide leadership of the company within an 
entrenched system of effective controls to ensure the 
assessment and management of risk. It is responsible 
for setting the company’s strategy and ensuring the 
security of the resources necessary to achieve the 
resulting objectives. Fundamentally the board must 
also set and guarantee the dissemination of, and 
adherence to, the company’s values and standards. The 
directors believe that the board leads and controls the 
group effectively and that all directors act in accordance 
with what they consider to be the best interests of the 
company, consistent with their statutory duties under 
the Companies Act 2006 and other legislation.
In order to ensure it retains appropriate overall control 
of the group, the board maintains a schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval. The matters reserved include 
the following areas: 
 
annual strategic plans
 
financial and treasury policies
 
risk identification, risk appetite, risk management 
and internal control systems
 
major acquisitions and disposals
 
annual and interim accounts
 
dividend policy
 
succession planning for directors and senior 
executives AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 49 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
 
group-wide policy framework
 
ensuring the effectiveness of governance practices.
The reserved powers of the board are complemented 
by the management of AMEC’s businesses on a 
decentralised basis. Overall operational management 
has been passed to the Chief Executive who has in turn 
delegated authorities to the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Chief Operating Officer . The Chief Operating Officer 
has further delegated authorities to divisional 
management and they have further delegated authority 
to their teams. The management philosophy is to 
empower the Chief Operating Officer and divisional 
management to take the actions necessary to deliver 
the company’s operational business objectives. The 
board regularly reviews its operational structure and 
during the year reviewed the schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval and the delegations of 
authority to the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer 
and Chief Operating Officer to take account of the 
changing requirements of the business, changes in 
governance requirements and overall risk appetite.  
To ensure the operation of AMEC’s businesses in 
accordance with a cohesive policy framework, the 
board has issued a number of group-wide policies, 
including the recently revised Code of Business 
Conduct, which set out the standards all AMEC 
employees are expected to achieve and adhere to.  
The board also takes a significant interest in the 
group’s commitment to health and safety.
The board is supported in its work by four board 
committees (audit, remuneration, nominations and 
ethics), chaired solely by non-executive directors, and  
a number of management committees, chaired by 
executive directors, to which specific responsibilities 
have been formally allotted. Details of the membership, 
duties and responsibilities of the committees are set 
out on pages 51 to 54. 
Attendance at meetings
The board holds regular meetings throughout the  
year, scheduled in accordance with an annual 
timetable and as otherwise required to ensure the 
effective discharge of its duties. Directors are expected 
to attend all board and relevant committee meetings, 
unless they are prevented from doing so by unavoidable 
prior work commitments or other valid reasons. Where 
a director is unable to attend a meeting, they are 
provided with the papers scheduled for discussion and 
fully briefed as appropriate. The table below is a record 
of director attendance at the board and board 
committee meetings held during the year ended 
31 December 2011. 
In addition to the matters reserved for the board, 
certain items are considered at every scheduled board 
meeting, including financial results, health and safety 
reports, short range plan progress and strategy 
performance review. The Chief Executive updates  
the board on market trends, developments and 
opportunities, the competitive positioning of the 
company and its current priorities. Divisional 
management are invited to present at board meetings 
from time to time.

To ensure effective strategic planning, the board  
holds an additional meeting each year to perform  
a full strategic review of the group. In 2011, the board 
spent a day focused, within the context of AMEC’s 
performance, on industry developments and key  
Vision 2015 priorities, on the direction and shape of 
AMEC’s business, the strategic challenges ahead  
and updating AMEC’s sector plans. 
Conflicts of interest
The board has procedures in place for the disclosure  
of conflicts of interest. Prior to appointment, director-
elects provide information on any conflicts of interest 
by means of a questionnaire, and thereafter potential 
conflicts of interest are considered at the start of each 
board meeting. An effective procedure is in place for 
the board to deal with any conflicts, should they arise, 
in accordance with the company’s articles of 
association. Accordingly, each director is aware of their 
responsibility, under the Companies Act 2006, to avoid 
a situation where they have an actual or potential 
conflict of interest, the requirement to keep the same 
under review and inform the Chairman and Company 
Secretary of any change in their situation. The 
Company Secretary is responsible for keeping 
appropriate records, including the scope, of any 
authorisations granted by the board, and ensuring  
the board undertakes regular reviews of conflict 
authorisations. During the financial year under review, 
no conflicts have arisen.
Professional development 
A comprehensive induction programme is in place  
for all new directors which, taking into account their 
previous experience, background and role on the  
board, is designed to further their knowledge and 
understanding of the group and their associated role 
and responsibilities. The Chairman is responsible  
and focused on ensuring, with the assistance of the 
Company Secretary, the provision and development  
of an effective programme in accordance with best 
practice and feedback received from members of the 
board. All new directors are provided with key board, 
corporate and financial information; attend meetings 
with other members of the board, group management 
and their extended teams; receive briefings on 
governance within AMEC; and, where possible, meet 
AMEC’s major shareholders. Where a new director is  
to serve on a board committee, induction material 
relevant to the committee is also provided.
Following induction, the Chairman is keen to continue 
regular reviews of each director’s individual training 
and development needs to ensure the continued 
cultivation of their skills and knowledge, in order that 
they may best fulfil their role on the board and its 
committees. Internally-facilitated training is arranged 
as necessary by the Company Secretary on topical 
issues which, in the course of the year under review, 
has included the introduction of the UK's Bribery Act. 
During the year the legal / HSSE team delivered 
training to the board on their individual and collective 
duties. The board receive presentations from 
management on changes and developments in the 
business. It also receives regular updates on HSSE 
matters and changes in legislation from the HSSE 
Director and bi-monthly communications from the 
Company Secretary’s office on key developments  
in corporate governance. To further develop the 
directors' understanding of the group’s operations  
and culture, the board undertakes a number of  
visits throughout the year to various places of  
AMEC business. A formal process also exists for the 
directors to receive, where appropriate, external 
training organised by the Company Secretary, at the 
company’s expense.
Evaluation
The board has the benefit of an open and honest 
atmosphere on all matters and is cognisant of  
the value of continued self assessment as a key 
component in its performance. During the year, the 
Chairman co-ordinated a discussion with each director, 
and thereafter with the board as a whole, on continued 
collective and individual effectiveness. The Chairman is 
confident in the continued commitment to the role, and 
effective contribution of each director, and is focused 
on the regular review of their developmental priorities.  
As referred to by the Chairman in his introduction  
to the corporate governance statement, the last 
externally-led review of the effectiveness of the board 
and its committees was in 2008. The board has been 
keen to ensure the optimal timing of its next externally 
facilitated review. Because of the material number of 
changes in its membership, and so of its committees, 
over the past two years (including the appointment of 
the Chairman on 1 June 2011), the next such review 
has been deferred until 2012. The board regards the  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 51 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
postponement as essential to allow the complete 
integration of its new members, and the bedding-in  
of any consequent changes. This will enable the 
necessary rigour of evaluation, and consideration 
thereafter, as anticipated by the Code. The usual 
internal evaluation process was continued in 2011,  
the results of which will help to shape the focus of  
the external evaluation. The board looks forward to 
focusing in 2012 on further improving its behaviours, 
processes and effectiveness as part of this process.  
In line with its support for the direction of the Davies 
Report, the board is also fully accepting of the addition 
to the Code of new supporting principle B.6 and will 
ensure that the 2012 evaluation process considers the 
board’s 'diversity, including gender' as one of the 
factors relevant to its effectiveness. 
As required by the Code during the year the Senior 
Independent Director, apprised of the views of the 
non-executive and the executive directors, reviewed  
the performance of the then Chairman, Jock Green-
Armytage. The Senior Independent Director is 
scheduled to meet with the current Chairman in March 
2012, to review his performance since joining the board. 
The Chief Executive conducts annual performance 
development reviews with the executive directors and 
his direct reports.
Information and support 
The Chairman’s responsibilities for ensuring that  
the directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information are, in the main, discharged via the 
Company Secretary, who is fundamental in ensuring 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the board. 
The Company Secretary ensures that all board 
procedures are followed and that the board is informed 
of all legislative, regulatory and governance matters 
related to its operation. The Company Secretary is also 
responsible for ensuring the flow of information to,  
and within, the board and its committees. Agendas  
and supporting papers are circulated approximately 
one week prior to all meetings to allow sufficient time 
for digestion and reflection and to ensure informed 
debate and challenge at meetings. Where the  
directors, particularly any non-executive director, 
require further insight on any issue, the Company 
Secretary will facilitate the same from the business or 
relevant members of the senior management team. 
Members of senior management are also regularly 
invited to attend board meetings to present on specific 
projects and issues as required. In addition to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, which 
are available to all of the directors, a formal process 
exists for the directors to take independent professional 
advice, at the company’s expense, where they conclude 
it necessary to discharge their responsibilities. The 
Company Secretary is responsible for the organisation 
and co-ordination of access to such advice. 
The Company Secretary is also accountable for 
ensuring that an accurate record of all meetings of  
the board and its committees is taken. If a director  
had a concern about the running of the company or  
a proposed action which could not be resolved,  
this would be recorded in the minutes. Further, on 
resignation, should a director have any such concerns, 
they would be invited to provide the Chairman with a 
written statement for circulation to the board. No  
such statements were received during 2011. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary  
is one of the matters reserved for the board.

management’s responses to it and the audit 
representation letters and makes recommendations  
to the board. In 2009/2010, the committee participated in 
a rigorous exercise that resulted in the appointment of 
Ernst & Y oung LLP as auditors of the company. This 
process included an in-depth review to benchmark the 
level of service, fees and value being delivered and to 
make appropriate recommendations to the board.
In 2011, the review of the effectiveness of the external 
auditors was carried out on behalf of the committee by 
the Head of Internal Audit. 
The audit committee also monitors the implementation 
of the policy on the engagement of the external auditor 
to supply non-audit services. This policy follows the 
guidelines set out by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales and clearly defines 
what work can and cannot be performed by any group 
company’s statutory auditor . It also sets out the 
necessary approval process for those non-audit services 
that are acceptable.
All non-statutory audit or non-compliance tax services 
provided by the auditor are reported to the audit 
committee. During 2011, the fees paid to the company’s 
auditor, Ernst & Y oung LLP and its associates, for 
non-audit work relating to taxation were £0.4 million 
(including a minimal amount for other work) (2010: £0.6 
million, of which £0.5 million related to taxation and £0.1 
million to other work).
All additional Ernst & Y oung fees were approved in 
accordance with AMEC’s policy covering non-audit 
services. As a result of the application of this policy and 
additional discussions with them, the directors do not 
believe that Ernst & Y oung’s independence has been 
compromised because of their additional work on behalf 
of the company.
The Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors are 
both given the opportunity to discuss matters with the 
audit committee, without the executive directors being 
present. There were no matters raised in this context 
during the year . The audit committee has unrestricted 
access to company documents and meets with any other 
relevant member of staff, without the executive directors 
being present, as necessary. 
The audit committee reviews the Head of Internal Audit’s 
regular reports and carries out an annual assessment of 
the internal audit function’s effectiveness. In 2011, this 
ensuring the board committees have appropriate terms  
of reference, which are reviewed by the board against  
best practice on a regular basis. Full written terms of 
reference for the audit, nominations, remuneration and 
ethics committees can be found at amec.com/aboutus/
culture/corporategovernance. The Chairman is also 
responsible for ensuring that the board committees are 
properly structured. All of the board’s non-executive 
directors are members of each of the board committees. 
The board considers that this structure and consistency  
of membership contributes to the effectiveness of the 
committees, such that no one member is unduly relied 
upon and the benefit of each member’s independence 
and external viewpoint is extended to their work. The 
secretary to each board committee ensures that a proper 
and timely record of all meetings is made and circulated 
to each member . The chairman of each board committee 
provides regular updates on its proceedings, as 
appropriate, to the board. 
A diagram illustrating the board’s governance structure is 
shown on the previous page. Details of each committee, 
including membership, duties and responsibilities, is set 
out on the following pages.
Audit committee 
Chaired by Colin Day, its membership comprises all  
the non-executive directors. Colin has significant 
relevant and recent competence in auditing and 
accounting (see biography on page 41). The quorum for 
the committee is two members.
The audit committee monitors the integrity of AMEC’s 
accounts, including the annual and interim results,  
the related report and accounts and stock exchange 
announcements and any other formal announcements 
in connection with the company’s financial performance, 
and recommends their approval to the board.
It reviews the company’s internal financial controls and 
internal control and risk management systems.
It oversees AMEC’s relations with the external auditors, 
including considering and making recommendations  
on their appointment, re-appointment, removal, 
remuneration and terms of engagement. It assesses the 
qualifications, expertise, effectiveness and independence 
of the external auditors at least annually and discusses 
the nature and scope of the audit, together with any 
issues arising from the audit process. 
It also reviews the auditors’ management letter,  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 53 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
exercise was carried out on behalf of the committee 
by the Head of Internal Audit. No material changes 
were identified as being necessary as a result of this 
exercise. The Head of Internal Audit formally reports 
to the committee chairman.
Nominations committee
Chaired by John Connolly and comprising all the 
non-executive directors, it leads the process for 
identifying, and makes recommendations to the 
board concerning the appointment or termination  
of, any new director or the Company Secretary and,  
in the case of non-executive directors and the 
Chairman, the extension of existing appointments.  
It also makes recommendations to the board on 
appointments to the board committees. The quorum 
for the committee is three members.
The committee regularly evaluates the structure, size 
and composition of the board, including the mix of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge of 
the directors. In considering recommendations to  
the board, with regard to any changes considered 
necessary to maintain the appropriate balance of 
skills and experiences to progress the group’s 
strategy, the committee is cognisant of the benefits  
of diversity, including but not limited to gender . 
The committee also reviews board succession 
planning, in conjunction with reports from the Chief 
Executive and Group HR Director on senior 
management succession planning, so as to ensure 
that an appropriate balance of skills is maintained 
both within AMEC and on the board. 
During 2011, the committee, chaired by the Senior 
Independent Director, with the assistance of external 
search consultants, conducted the rigorous 
recruitment processes that led to the appointment  
of the Chairman. 
Remuneration committee 
Chaired by Tim Faithfull and comprising the 
Chairman and all the non-executive directors, it sets 
and reviews the overall remuneration policy 
framework for the Chairman, the executive directors 
and the Company Secretary and other designated 
executives, including a risk assessment of the policy, 
in conjunction with the audit committee, relating to 
such matters as financial performance setting and 
measurement for both bonus and long-term 
incentives. The quorum for the committee is two 
members.
It considers and determines the individual 
remuneration packages and contracts for the Chief 
Executive, the other executive directors and the 
Company Secretary on appointment and reviews 
these as required and agrees the performance 
targets of the executive directors and the levels of 
bonus paid to them under the bonus and long-term 
incentive schemes. It also agrees with the board the 
remuneration structure, including annual bonus, for 
other designated executives.
It agrees the terms to be offered to a proposed new 
Chairman and reviews these terms as required. 
It approves the structure, performance targets, 
participation and level of awards for any executive 
share-based incentive scheme. 
Ethics committee 
Chaired by Simon Thompson and comprising all the 
non-executive directors, the purpose of the 
committee is to assist the board in upholding AMEC’s 
core value of integrity.
It reviews and monitors business ethics within AMEC, 
including compliance with relevant legislation, 
regulation and current best practice relating to such 
matters as the prevention of bribery and corruption, 
government contracting, competition and import/
export restrictions, trade compliance and 
discrimination or inappropriate behaviour in the 
workplace. It also reviews and approves AMEC’s  
Code of Business Conduct at least annually to ensure 
that it addresses the above issues.
It considers and reviews the scope and planning of  
all compliance activity within AMEC and reviews the 
extent and effectiveness of AMEC’s internal training 
and external reporting of compliance and ethics 
matters.
In the event of an actual or suspected material breach 
of AMEC’s Code of Business Conduct or any relevant 
legislation, a member of the committee will take 
responsibility for and manage any investigation into 
the relevant matters with the support of the General 
Counsel. The committee may use internal resources 
and is also authorised to employ external consultants 
to carry out any such investigation. 54

Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
Internal control
The board is responsible for reviewing AMEC’s 
systems of internal control. Their reviews cover the 
effectiveness and adequacy of financial, operational, 
compliance and risk management systems and are 
undertaken regularly. These systems can however 
only provide reasonable assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, as they are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure  
to achieve business objectives.
The board and its committees have an ongoing 
process, that is reviewed regularly by the board and 
accords with the Turnbull guidance, for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by 
AMEC, including strategy, major projects to be 
undertaken, significant acquisitions and disposals,  
as well as entry into and exit from different markets. 
This process has been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of this report.  
Where appropriate, business decisions are reached 
following a structured and documented review of 
potential opportunities and threats, taking steps 
designed to manage or mitigate any risk exposure. 
Principal business risks are set out in the risk section 
on pages 21 to 23 and are incorporated into this 
report by reference.
The threats and opportunities associated with tender 
submissions are reviewed by commercial review 
boards at various levels in the group, in line with 
delegated authorities. The highest value tenders are, 
in addition, reviewed by the tender review committee. 
AMEC applies a set of contracting principles, under 
which the level of approval required is dependent  
on the contractual provision in question. The most 
significant issues in terms of risk require the approval 
of the tender review committee. 
The internal control processes are complemented by 
an annual control self-assessment exercise carried 
out by the principal businesses. This covers health, 
safety and environment, legal, commercial and 
contractual, financial, information technology and 
human resources. The results are reviewed by the 
board, through the audit committee, as part of the 
ongoing internal control monitoring process.
AMEC has interests in a number of joint ventures and 
joint arrangements  where controls may not be 
reviewed as part of AMEC’s formal corporate 
governance process because of the joint 
management responsibilities. Responsibility for such 
reviews rests with the joint venture boards and these 
are reviewed from time to time as part of AMEC’s 
normal internal audit process. Details of significant 
joint ventures can be found on page 120.
Relations with shareholders
The executive directors and senior management 
undertake an extensive programme of meetings with 
institutional shareholders during each year . Events 
such as results presentations and other capital 
market events are webcast and made available on 
our website for those unable to attend in person.
Each year, the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director write to all major shareholders, reminding 
them that they are available for meetings or 
telephone calls with them, as required. Jock 
Green-Armytage wrote such a letter in March 2011.
Soon after his appointment as Chairman, John 
Connolly met three of AMEC’s most significant 
shareholders to understand more about their views 
on the company. In December 2011, he hosted  
a group lunch attended by a wider group of 
representatives from institutional shareholders.  
The Chairman also attends preliminary results 
presentations.
Ad-hoc requests from shareholders for meetings 
with members of the board are facilitated by the 
investor relations team. In 2011, these requests 
largely related either to the remuneration report  
prior to the 2011 annual general meeting, or the 
Chairman’s appointment.
An in-depth perception study of investors’ views is 
prepared each year by an independent third party and 
presented to the board. In 2011, this took place in 
January at a meeting also attended by the company’s 
brokers. The board also receives unedited feedback 
reports following shareholder meetings and all 
material brokers’ research notes on the company.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 56
Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ remuneration report 
The purpose of this report is to show how the company 
determines the remuneration arrangements for 
executive directors and how this relates to the Vision 
2015 growth strategy and the company's performance. 
How we operate
The remuneration committee’s membership 
comprises all the non-executive directors and the 
Chairman. Its terms of reference can be found at  
amec.com/aboutus/culture/corporategovernance 
or on request from the Company Secretary. 
In considering the matters within its remit, the 
committee takes account of recommendations from 
the Chairman in respect of the Chief Executive and 
from the Chief Executive in respect of other executive 
directors. It is advised both by our Human Resources 
department and independently by New Bridge Street 
(NBS). The terms of engagement between the 
company and NBS are available from the Company 
Secretary. NBS does not undertake any material 
additional work for AMEC. NBS is wholly owned by  
Aon Corporation and while other companies within the 
Aon group do undertake material non-remuneration 
work for the company, the committee does not believe 
that the independence of its adviser is compromised  
in any way. 
The committee normally meets three times a year  
and has an established annual agenda of items that it 
considers at the various meetings, the major elements 
of which are summarised below:
November/
December
 
Overall remuneration policy and 
practices, incorporating risk

and total remuneration

Incentive plan structures
Remuneration structure and policy
Executive remuneration comprises four elements:  
base salary, benefits, annual bonus and long-term 
incentive (L TI).  The committee’s aim is to balance each 
of these elements so as to provide remuneration 
packages that are competitive in the markets in which 
the executives are based and which incentivise senior 
executives to achieve superior short-term performance 
while increasing the medium and long-term value of 
AMEC for its shareholders. We are particularly keen to 
encourage executives to build and retain a significant 
shareholding in AMEC.
More specifically our approach is to:
 
Review base salaries annually taking account of pay 
levels more broadly within the company and the 
market including a review of the mid-market 
practices of a relevant group of companies regarded 
as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, 
revenue, employee numbers, market capitalisation 
and/or geographic coverage 
 
Set annual bonus financial targets that provide an 
incentive to achieve and improve on the company’s 
demanding short-range plan and which link to the 
achievement of the company's longer-term strategy. 
The threshold for the EBITA element is also normally 
set higher than the previous year’s actual result. The 
structure of the annual bonus plan is described in 
more detail on page 58
 
Make annual share-based awards that are subject  
to both absolute and comparative performance 
targets over a three-year period. A key element of  
this plan is that part of each year’s award is dependent 
on the executives investing their own money in  
AMEC shares and holding these for the three-year 
period. The structure of the long-term incentive plan 
(Performance Share Plan – PSP) is described in  
more detail on pages 58 and 59
 
Review overall remuneration levels and the balance 
between these elements to ensure that they are in 
line with competitive market practice as determined 
by external research. Our current approach is to have 
a higher weighting on long-term than annual 
incentives to support the focus on delivering our 
Vision 2015 growth strategy. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 57 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
The chart below shows the balance between fixed  
and incentive based payments for the Chief Executive 
at threshold and maximum performance levels. 
Maximum assumes achievement of maximum bonus 
and full vesting of shares under the PSP and assumes 
that the full investment/matching opportunity has 
been taken. Threshold values are 25 per cent of 
maximum bonus excluding the deferred element (see 
page 58) and 25 per cent vesting of the PSP award.

2011 performance and its reflection in 
pay levels
The company had another strong year with EBITA 
growing year on year by 12 per cent. The result was 
above the level that had been set for target bonus but 
below the target for maximum and hence also did  
not achieve the additional stretch for the deferred 
element. Cash flow was just above the threshold level.  
Achievement against strategic personal bonus targets 
was strong. This resulted in the following annual 
bonus payments to each of the three executive 
directors (expressed as percentage of base salary 
earned in the year):
Max Actual 2010
Samir Brikho 150 96 121
Ian McHoul 125 77 92
Neil Bruce 125 77 97
Three-year earnings per share growth (2011 versus 
2008) on the basis used for the PSP was 64.0 per cent.  
This exceeded the required growth of 45.5 per cent  
(10 per cent per annum plus RPI) for maximum 
payment for that element of the 2009 PSP awards. The 
second element is dependent on comparative Total 
Shareholder Return based on the average share price 
for the first quarter of each year . The outcome of this 
will not be known until April when the relevant portion 
of the shares will vest. 
The table on page 63 shows the number of shares 
vesting during 2011 under both the PSP and the 
one-off Transformation Incentive Plan. However 
both of these awards vested on the basis of 2010 
performance as explained in notes (ii) and (iii) to 
the table.  
As set out in last year's remuneration report, the 
one-off Transformation Incentive Plan covered the 
period 2008 to 2010 and was designed to give 
additional impetus to the transformation of the 
company and to aid retention of selected top 
executives through this critical period. The main 
performance measure was 2010 operating margin.  
A full description of the plan and the outcome against 
the performance measures was included in last year’s 
remuneration report. The plan is now ended and no 
further awards can be made under it.
Changes for 2012
The following annual salaries have been approved 
from 1 January 2012: 
From 1 Jan 2012 
salary
From 1 Jan 2012

Samir Brikho £900,000 2.8 Nil
Ian McHoul £500,000 2.7 Nil
Neil Bruce £475,000 5.6 15.4
 
These increases are within the range of those 
awarded to AMEC UK-based employees generally.  
Awards to employees in other countries were 
generally higher with average increases by country 
ranging from 3 to 9 per cent. Neil Bruce's increase 
reflects his continuing development in the Group COO 
role to which he was appointed in the second half of 
2010.
The methodology for the cash element of the annual 
bonus has been adjusted to provide additional focus on 
the conversion of profit to cash. 58
Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ remuneration report continued
AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Annual bonus plan
The executive directors and other senior executives 
participate in the AMEC Executive Annual Bonus  
Plan which generates bonus payments calculated by 
reference to a mix of EBITA, cash flow and personal 
targets that vary from year to year and between 
individuals to reflect the business priorities associated 
with each role and link to the achievement of our overall 
Vision 2015 objectives.
Business performance targets are set so that a target 
level of bonus is paid normally for achieving the 
company’s short-range plan. To achieve maximum 
bonus, higher targets have to be met. In determining 
targets, the committee takes account of the general 
business circumstances including the perceived 
difficulty inherent in the short-range plan and the need 
to balance stretch against risk. Executive directors have 
an additional bonus opportunity for super-stretch 
EBITA performance, with any such additional bonus 
being deferred in AMEC shares for three years during 
which it is subject to forfeiture and claw-back. The 
additional bonus only begins to be earned for 
performance that exceeds the maximum target that 
applies to other executives below board level.
Cash flow is split into two elements, one based on  
profit to cash conversion for the year as a whole and 
one based on average year-to-date cash flow.
The breakdown of bonus potential (as a percentage  
of base salary) for each executive director at various 
performance levels is as follows: 
Chief Executive COO and CFO
Threshold EBITA 17.5 13.75
Cash flow 6.25 5
Target EBITA 46.67 36.67
Cash flow 16.67 13.33
Maximum EBITA 70 55
Cash flow 25 20
Super stretch* EBITA 25 25
Other strategic 
objectives
30 25
Overall maximum 150 125
*This element, introduced in 2011, is paid as shares deferred for three 
years during which it is subject to forfeiture and claw-back.
Performance Share Plan
Long-term incentives for the top management group 
are provided through the Performance Share Plan 
under which annual awards are made of shares that 
will vest after three years only to the extent that 
pre-determined performance targets are met. For 
awards from 2011 onwards, the number of shares 
vesting from these awards is increased to take account 
of reinvested dividends during the three-year 
performance period. Where awards are made in the 
form of nil cost options, participants have an eighteen-
month period following vesting in which to exercise.  
Awards are made in two parts: a basic award and a 
matching award which requires participants to invest 
on a post-tax basis in AMEC shares that are held on 
their behalf as investment shares for the three-year 
performance period and matched two for one. If 
investment shares are withdrawn before the end of the 
performance period, the matching shares lapse. The 
policy for executive directors is a basic award with a 
value at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base 
salary plus a matching award up to a maximum of  
75 per cent of base salary. This latter assumes the 
maximum investment of 37.5 per cent of post-tax 
salary – participants may invest less than this and the 
matching award reduces accordingly. Awards are 
normally made in April.
There are two performance conditions – total 
shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share growth 
– each of which operates independently on different 
portions of the awards. Half of the basic part of the award 
is dependent on earnings per share and half on total 
shareholder return. The matching share part of the 
award is solely dependent on earnings per share.
For the total shareholder return portion, the 
requirement for full vesting is for AMEC to be ranked  
in the top quartile of the chosen comparator group. 
No awards will vest if AMEC’s performance is below 
median. If AMEC’s performance is at the median, 25 
per cent of the award will vest. Between the median 
and the upper quartile, the award will vest on a straight-
line basis. In addition, to ensure that AMEC’s underlying 
performance is properly reflected, no awards will vest 
unless there has been sustained financial growth of the

Lists of the comparator companies for the 2008 
awards that vested during the year and the awards 
made in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were disclosed in 
previous years' reports.
For the earnings per share growth portion of the 
awards, threshold (25 per cent of that part of the 
award vests) and maximum (100 per cent of that 
award vests) requirements are set with straight-line 
vesting between these. This is determined by 
comparing the earnings per share achieved in the 
final year of the three-year period with that in the 
year immediately before the start of the period and 
expressing the growth as an annualised rate in 
excess of the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index 
over the same period. In line with the PSP awards 
granted in 2011, for the awards to be made in 2012, 
the real growth requirement for minimum vesting is 
5 per cent per annum and for maximum vesting it is 
12 per cent per annum. For the awards made in 2009 
and 2010 the growth requirement is 3 to 10 per cent 
with, in the case of the 2010 awards, an underpin that 
2012 earnings per share must be greater than 62 
pence. The 2008 awards had a range of 45 to 53 
pence for 2010 earnings per share.
The earnings per share figure is adjusted for certain 
defined items and calculated on a consistent basis 
between base and final years. The remuneration 
committee takes appropriate external advice on  
the method of calculation and any adjusting and 
potentially adjusting items. Performance against  
the total shareholder return targets is calculated 
independently and reviewed by the remuneration 
committee. In the event of a change of control, 
awards will normally vest to the extent that the 
performance conditions have been met at the date 
the change of control takes place. 
Awards are also made under the Plan to a wider 
group of senior managers, with lower levels of face 
value. The application of performance conditions and 
matching criteria may also be varied for this group.
Shares held by the trustee of the AMEC Employee 
Share Trust (currently BWCI Trust Company Limited), 
in connection with the Performance Share Plan, may 
be voted at their discretion.
Other share plans
No awards have been made under the Executive 
Share Option Scheme since 2004. Authority for this 
plan is due to lapse in 2012. In addition, executive 
directors may participate in relevant all-employee 
share plans that provide options, without 
performance conditions, related to savings contracts 
with an aggregate limit of £250 savings per month.
Directors' share interests

company of the directors holding office as at 31

Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ remuneration report continued
AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Except for interests under share option schemes  
and the Performance Share Plan, details of which are 
contained in this report, no director as at 31 December 
2011 had any other interests, beneficial or otherwise, 
in the share capital of the company or any of its 
subsidiaries. 
On 9 January 2012, John Connolly acquired 190 
shares, which he elected to receive for part of his 
shareholding, in lieu of the interim dividend paid on  
3 January 2012. There were no other changes in the 
directors’ interests in the share capital of the company 
between 31 December 2011 and 21 February 2012.  
Up to date details of the interests and transactions  
of current directors are available on our website.
Share ownership guidelines
Guidelines are in place requiring executive directors 
and members of the Group Management team to 
build up over a three-year period and retain a holding 
of AMEC shares received from incentive plans or 
purchased by them. The level of targeted 
shareholding was increased during 2011 from 200  
to 250 per cent of base salary for executive directors 
and from 100 to 125 per cent of base salary for other 
senior executives. Executives have until the end of 
2013 to build up to the higher target. Based on the 
average share price and salaries during December 
2011, the shareholdings shown above represented the 
following percentages of base salary:
Samir Brikho 1,660  per cent
Ian McHoul 415  per cent
Neil Bruce 211  per cent
Executive directors’ pension 
arrangements and other benefits
Executive directors are eligible for membership of  
the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and to have top-up 
benefits provided through the AMEC Executive 
Pension Scheme. The schemes are both defined 
benefit schemes registered with the UK’s HM Revenue 
& Customs (HMRC) and also provide for life 
assurance cover and dependants’ pensions.  
There are no unregistered pension arrangements.
Executive directors who participate in the pension 
schemes accrue pension rights that are linked to the 
length of pensionable service and to pensionable 
salary. Executive directors who remain in employment 
beyond normal pension age are able to continue to 
accrue further pension rights. Pensionable salary in 
respect of scheme membership up to the end of 2007 
is based on final salary and in respect of membership 
from 2008 onwards is based on career average 
revalued earnings. Benefits are restricted to a 
scheme earnings cap which was set at £141,250 for 
the 2011/12 tax year (£149,000 for 2012/13). In 
recognition of this restriction of pension benefits, 
participating executive directors also receive a taxable 
supplement of 20 per cent of their base salaries above 
the cap. Executive directors are able to opt-out, in 
which case they will receive a salary supplement of  
20 per cent of basic salary in lieu of further pension 
accrual. If individuals do accrue benefits that exceed 
either the Annual or the Life Time Allowances, the 
payment of the associated tax liability will be the 
responsibility of the individual and not AMEC.
Samir Brikho is a member of both pension schemes 
with a normal pension age of 60 and also has the 
benefit of additional life assurance in respect of 
earnings above the cap. Neil Bruce also participates 
and has a normal pension age of 62 with a historic 
right to draw accrued pension from age 57 onwards 
without actuarial reduction for early payment. Ian 
McHoul has not joined the schemes and therefore 
receives the 20 per cent supplement on his full salary 
and also has the benefit of life assurance of four times 
his basic salary.
Employment related benefits, principally the provision 
of a company car or car allowance, long-term 
disability and private medical expenses insurance,  
are also provided to executive directors.
Executive directors’ employment contracts 
AMEC’s policy is that on appointment, executive 
directors will normally be employed with a notice 
period of one year . In the event of employment being 
terminated with less notice than this, damages will  
be determined at the time taking account of the 
circumstances leading up to the termination and  
the individual’s duty to mitigate the loss. Executive 
directors are required to give six months’ notice of 
resignation. This policy is followed for all current 
executive directors.
Contracts for executive directors do not provide for 
extended notice periods, other enhancements or  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 61 
Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
payments in the event of a change of control. It is not 
the remuneration committee’s intention to introduce 
such provisions. The contracts of the executive 
directors are available for review at the company’s 
registered office in accordance with relevant 
legislation.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to accept 
external directorships without the prior approval of 
the board. Ian McHoul is a director and chairman of 
the audit committee of Premier Foods plc for which 
he received remuneration of £70,000 during the year .  
Samir Brikho and Neil Bruce each hold one external 
directorship with a charity for which they receive no 
remuneration.
Samir Brikho’s role as a member of the Advisory 
Board of Stena AB is not a non-executive directorship. 
He received fees of CHF60,000 during the year in 
relation to this appointment. 
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for 
determining the remuneration and other terms of 
appointment of the Chairman of the board. John 
Connolly receives an annual fee of £300,000 which is 
due to be reviewed on 1 January 2013. He does not 
participate in any AMEC benefit schemes or incentive 
schemes. His engagement may be terminated on six 
months’ notice on either side. The previous Chairman, 
Jock Green-Armytage, retired in May 2011, and was 
paid until the end of the second quarter .
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is 
determined by the Chairman and the executive 
directors under delegated authority from the board. 
The non-executive directors receive fees for their 
services and do not participate in any of the incentive 
or benefit schemes of the group. The policy with 
regard to fee structure is to reflect time commitment 
and responsibility of the various roles. 
Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2012 
and increased by an average 2.8 per cent. The current 
base fee is £55,500 per annum. There is an additional 
fee of £8,350 per annum paid to the Senior 
Independent Director . Additional fees are paid for 
chairing committees of the board as follows:
Audit committee £13,500
Remuneration committee £8,350
Ethics committee £5,550
The board’s policy is that non-executive director 
appointments are normally for three consecutive 
three-year terms, subject to review after the end of 
each term. The non-executive directors as at 31 
December 2011 have fixed-term contracts that run 
until the dates set out below:
Date of contract Service review date
Tim Faithfull 10 February 2005 2014 AGM
Simon Thompson 21 January 2009 2012 AGM
Neil Carson 31 August 2010 2014 AGM
Colin Day 14 October 2010 2014 AGM
In accordance with the articles of association of 
AMEC, all directors are required to seek re-election 
by shareholders at the AGM following initial 
appointment and every three years thereafter . 
However, our practice is that all directors submit 
themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line 
with the recommendations in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The contracts of non-executive directors may be 
terminated by the individual at any time. There are  
no specific provisions for compensation in the event 
of early termination by the company.

Notes
(i)  The terms and conditions of the above awards have not been varied during the year .
(ii)  For the PSP awards made in 2008, AMEC met the performance condition for maximum vesting of the portion dependant on earnings per 
share growth from 2007 to 2010 (actual adjusted EPS of 65.5 pence versus a target of 53 pence) and for 67 per cent vesting of the portion 
dependant on total shareholder return (ranking 10th out of 26). The share prices at the dates of vesting were 1192.0 pence for Samir Brikho 
and Neil Bruce and 899.0 pence for Ian McHoul.
(iii)   As reported last year, the achievement against the 2010 margin based performance condition for the TIP awards resulted in 78 per cent 
vesting. The vesting dates for awards under the TIP were three years from the dates the individuals lodged their investment shares and 
hence did not occur until 2011. The share prices at the respective dates of vesting were Samir Brikho 1175.0 pence, Neil Bruce 1154.0 pence 
and Ian McHoul 896.5 pence.
(iv)  The award made in June 2011 was a top-up to the award made in April, following shareholder approval at the AGM and the lodging of 
additional investment shares by the individual, and is subject to the same performance conditions and period.
(v)  The dividends which accrue on the PSP awards from 2011 onwards have increased the number of shares under the 2011 awards by 1.7 per 
cent at 31 December 2011. These will be awarded to the extent that the three-year performance targets are met.
(vi)   The closing price of the shares at 30 December 2011, the last trading day before year end, was 907.5 pence (2010: 1150.0 pence). Had the 
outstanding restricted shares detailed above vested in full, including the dividend accrual on the awards from 2011 onwards, on that date the 
approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Samir Brikho £6,582,000, Neil Bruce 
£2,634,000 and Ian McHoul £3,660,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all relevant performance conditions would have been fully 
met, which in practice may not transpire.
(vii)   The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 740.5 pence to 1251.0 pence.
(viii)   The register of directors’ interests, which is open to inspection at the company’s registered office, contains full details of directors’ 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans. 64

(i)  Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year . 
(ii)  Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Trustee’s transfer value basis.
(iii)  The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service 
terminated at the year-end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director’s contribution.
(iv)  The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and 
directors, such as stock market movements. It is calculated after deducting the director’s contribution.
(v)  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.

guidance to assist in the determination of control where 
this is difficult to assess and is effective for periods 
commencing 1 January 2013.
IFRS 11, ‘ Joint arrangements’ replaces IAS 31 ‘Interests  
in Joint Ventures’ and is effective for periods commencing 
1 January 2013. IFRS 11 deals with how a joint 
arrangement of which two or more parties have joint 
control should be classified. Under IFRS 11, joint 
arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint 
ventures, depending on the rights and obligations of the 
parties to the arrangements.
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’  
includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of 
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, 
associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance 
sheet vehicles. It is effective for periods commencing  
1 January 2013.
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve 
consistency and reduce complexity by providing a  
precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair 
value measurement and disclosure requirements for  
use across IFRS. It is effective for periods commencing  
1 January 2013.
Restatements
The accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010  
have been restated to present the results rounded  
to the nearest million rather than to one decimal place. 
Following this change in presentation, all calculated 
numbers, for example earnings per share, continue to  
be calculated on the underlying numbers to one decimal 
place precision.
The consolidated income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2010 has been restated to present pension 
financing income within net financing income rather than 
within administrative expenses. The purpose of this 
restatement is to report the results of financing the pension 
schemes within net financing income. The impact of this 
restatement is an increase in administrative expenses of 
£7 million for the year ended 31 December 2010. Net 
financing income has increased by the same amount. The 
restatement has no impact on the group’s reported profit.
The segmental analysis of the results for the year ended 
31 December 2010 has been restated, in line with the 
group’s internal reporting structure, to present the UK 
asset support business within the Natural Resources 
division rather than the Power & Process division. In 
addition, the segmental analysis has also been restated  
to include net financing income of equity accounted  
joint ventures within net financing income not EBITA.
1 Significant accounting policies
AMEC plc is a public limited company, which is listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. 
Statement of compliance
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of  
AMEC plc (‘ AMEC’) and all of its subsidiaries made up to 
31 December each year, and the group’s share of the profit 
after interest and tax, and net assets of joint ventures and 
associates, based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), 
the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted for use in the EU as at 
31 December 2011 (‘adopted IFRS’), International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations 
and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The company has elected 
to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  
(‘UK GAAP’); these are presented on pages 113 to 118.
Accounting standards adopted in the year
There are no IFRS or IFRIC interpretations effective for the 
first time this financial year that have had a material 
impact on the group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued 
but not effective which have not been early adopted by 
the group
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations 
to existing standards have been published that are 
mandatory for the group’s annual accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2012 or later periods. The 
group has elected not to adopt early the standards 
described below:
IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011 
and is effective for periods commencing 1 January 2013. 
The impact on the group will be to replace interest cost 
and expected return on plan assets with a net interest 
amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to 
the net defined benefit asset.
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the 
classification, measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities and is effective for periods 
commencing 1 January 2013. It replaces the parts of IAS 
39 that relate to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments. 
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds on 
existing principles by identifying the concept of control as 
the determining factor in whether an entity should be 
included within the consolidated financial statements of 
the parent company. The standard provides additional  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 72
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
A significant amount of the group’s activities is undertaken 
via long-term contracts. These contracts are accounted for 
in accordance with IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ which 
requires estimates to be made for contract costs and 
revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and 
revenues on the latest available information, which includes 
detailed contract valuations. In many cases the results 
reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual 
obligations which span more than one reporting period. 
Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of 
uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events 
and often need to be revised as events unfold and 
uncertainties are resolved. The estimates of contract costs 
and revenues are updated regularly and significant changes 
are highlighted through established internal review 
procedures. In particular, the internal reviews focus on the 
timing and recognition of incentive payments and the age 
and recoverability of any unagreed income from variations to 
the contract scope or claims. The impact of the changes in 
accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
When accounting for provisions for litigation and other items 
the group has taken internal and external advice in 
considering known legal claims and actions made by or 
against the group. It carefully assesses the likelihood of 
success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions are 
made for legal claims or actions against the group on the 
basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for those 
which in the view of management are unlikely to succeed. 
In accordance with IFRS 5, ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations’ the post-tax results of 
discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Discontinued operations include the non-core Built 
Environment businesses, which were sold during 2007 
and SPIE, which was sold in 2006. The cash flows of 
discontinued operations are fully consolidated within 
AMEC up to the date of sale. The results and other 
disclosures in respect of discontinued operations are 
shown in note 9.
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the group has adequate 
resources to operate for the foreseeable future. At 
31 December 2011 the group held net cash of £521 million.
The group will finance operations and growth from its 
significant existing cash resources. The group’s policy 
aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate 
amount of funding to meet both current and future 
forecast requirements consistent with the group’s budget 
and strategic plans.
The net impact of the above restatements is to increase 
revenue and EBITA of the Natural Resources division by 
£82 million and £4 million respectively for the year ended 
31 December 2010. Revenue and EBITA of the Power & 
Process division has reduced by £82 million and £10 
million respectively. In addition, EBITA of the Investments 
and other activities segment and net financing income 
have both increased by £3 million. 
Basis of preparation
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the 
nearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost 
basis except that derivative financial instruments and 
retirement benefit assets and liabilities are stated at fair 
value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect  
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, 
and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting 
policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation 
arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension 
schemes under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’, for long-term 
contracts under IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and IAS 18 
‘Revenue recognition’ and for provisions under IAS 37 
‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for  
in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries but significant judgements are required in 
relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, discount rate, inflation, investment returns and 
member life expectancy that underpin their valuations.  
For AMEC, these assumptions are important given the 
relative size of the schemes that remain open.

AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Bid costs
Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is 
appointed as the preferred bidder . Subsequent to 
appointment as preferred bidder, bid costs are 
capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the 
award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected 
to generate sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the 
bid costs. Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial 
close, the proceeds are applied first against the balance of 
costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional 
amounts treated as deferred income and released to 
profit over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill
The purchase method is used to account for all business 
combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the 
purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is 
capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both 
annually and when there are indications that its carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is not amortised.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash comprises cash balances and deposits repayable  
on demand and available within one working day 
without penalty.
Cash equivalents are other deposits with a maturity  
period of three months or less from date of acquisition; 
convertible without an undue period of notice; and not 
subject to a significant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of AMEC’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Deposits with a maturity period of more than three 
months at inception are classified as short-term 
investments.
Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities  
held for sale
A discontinued operation is a separate major line of 
business or geographic area of operations that has either 
been disposed of, or is part of a plan to run down a line of 
business. An operation is classified as a discontinued 
operation in the year that the above criteria are met. 
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale 
and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are 
recognised in the income statement. Gains are not 
recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Certain legacy settlements and relevant provision 
adjustments are allocated to discontinued operations 
when appropriate.
Given the group’s significant cash resources the decision 
was made during 2008 not to renew the group’s 
committed facilities. This decision has been kept under 
review since then. However, appropriate facilities will be 
maintained to meet ongoing requirements for 
performance related bonding and letters of credit.
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit 
risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform under  
the contract. AMEC manages these risks by ensuring that 
surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30  
mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a  
pre-approved limit. These limits are set at prudent levels 
by the board and are based primarily on credit ratings set 
by Moody’s, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Credit ratings 
are monitored continuously by the group treasury 
department.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless 
otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated accounts.
Basis of consolidation
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC. Control is 
achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated accounts from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities 
AMEC has joint control, established by contractual 
agreement. An associate is an entity in which AMEC has 
significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated accounts include the 
group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of 
associates and joint venture entities on an equity 
accounted basis. The results of joint venture entities and 
associates are included in the consolidated accounts from 
the date that joint control or significant influence 
commences until the date that it ceases.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised 
only to the extent of the group’s interest in the joint venture 
or associate, unless the group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party 
has its own separate interest in particular risks and 
rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable 
share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it 
incurs and its share of the income measured according to 
the terms of the arrangement.
1 Significant accounting policies continued 74
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is 
determined by reference to market values for similar 
financial instruments or by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The sale and purchase of derivative financial instruments 
are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a 
hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, 
any gain or loss on the effective part of the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated within the hedging reserve. The 
gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised. 
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in  
the hedging reserve remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss in the 
hedging reserve is transferred to profit or loss in the same 
period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Foreign currencies
The group’s consolidated accounts are presented in 
Sterling, which is also the parent company’s functional 
currency. Each entity in the group determines its own 
functional currency and items included in the financial 
statements of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency. An entity’s functional currency reflects 
the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are 
relevant to it.
At an individual entity level, transactions in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the entity are 
translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate 
ruling at the day of the transaction. Entities which have 
multiple foreign currency transactions apply the average 
rate for the month as an approximation of the exchange 
rate on the day of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date and any foreign exchange 
differences arising are recognised in the income 
statement except those arising on intra-group balances 
settlement of which is neither planned nor probable to 
occur which are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured 
in terms of historical cost and are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the results of entities with a functional 
currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling 
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid 
price) is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at 
the balance sheet date on AA rated corporate bonds that 
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the 
group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a 
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
Exceptional items
As permitted by IAS1 ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements’, certain items are presented separately as 
exceptional on the face of the consolidated income 
statement. In the opinion of the directors, these 
exceptional items require separate disclosure by virtue  
of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear 
and consistent presentation of the group’s underlying 
performance and to provide consistency with internal 
management reporting. Exceptional items may include, 
but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on 
disposal of businesses or on closure of businesses; 
business restructuring charges; profits or losses arising 
on the disposal of fixed assets; the amount of acquisition-
related costs; and elements of deferred consideration.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. 
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the 
instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at 
amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially 
and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on 
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge 
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 
AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011
Leases 
Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Long-term contracts
As soon as the outcome of a long-term contract can be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are 
recognised in the income statement in proportion to the 
stage of completion of the contract. The stage of 
completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work 
performed. When the outcome of a contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent 
of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be 
recoverable, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. 
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
Revenue in respect of variations to the contract scope and 
claims is recognised when it is probable that it will be 
received and is capable of being reliably measured. 
Incentive payments are recognised when a contract is 
sufficiently far advanced that it is probable that the 
required conditions will be met and the amount of the 
payment can be reliably measured.
The gross amounts due from customers under long-term 
contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, less 
provision for recognised losses and progress billings. These 
amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due 
from customers are included in trade and other payables.
Net financing income
Net financing income comprises interest receivable on 
funds invested, interest payable, pension financing 
income, the unwinding of discounted balances and foreign 
exchange gains and losses. Interest income and interest 
payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, 
using the effective interest method.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the 
cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and 
equipment, until the relevant assets are brought into 
operational use. The only material projects where this  
has occurred are those held in the group’s investments  
in joint ventures which are involved in PPP projects to 
finance, design and build assets and operate them on 
behalf of the customer .
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost 
of property, plant and equipment as at 1 January 2004, the 
date of transition to adopted IFRS, was determined by 
reference to its fair value at that date.
using a monthly average exchange rate. The net assets  
of such entities are translated into Sterling at the closing 
exchange rate.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign 
currency net investments and any foreign currency 
borrowings, or forward contracts used to hedge those 
investments, are taken to a translation reserve. They are 
recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal 
or closure of a business. The cumulative translation 
difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero 
as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS.
Impairment
The carrying values of all of the group’s assets other than 
inventories, balances on long-term contracts and deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying 
value then the recoverable amount is estimated and 
compared to the carrying amount. For goodwill and assets 
not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is 
estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the 
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Intangible assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include 
software, customer relationships, trademarks and order 
backlogs, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. The cost of an intangible asset 
acquired in a business combination is fair value at date  
of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated lives of intangible assets held at 
31 December 2011 are as follows:
Software Three to five years 
Customer relationships Two to ten years 
Brand/trademarks Up to five years 
Other Up to six years
Inventories
Inventories, including land held for and in the course  
of development, are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Development land and work in progress is included at cost 
less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing of 
the development. Cost includes cost of acquisition and 
development to date, including directly attributable fees 
and expenses net of rental and other income attributable 
to the development.

conditions upon which the awards were granted. The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of shares that vest except where 
non-vesting is due to share prices or total shareholder 
return not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises the sum of current tax 
charge and the movement in deferred tax. 
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable 
profit for the year using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in 
other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is 
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity  
as appropriate.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences with deferred tax assets being 
recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  
at each balance sheet date and adjustments made to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient profits 
will be available.
Assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
differences arise from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where 
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted to apply when 
the deferred tax asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and it is intended that they will be settled on  
a net basis.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and 
equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual 
value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its 
estimated useful life. Reviews are made annually of  
the estimated remaining lives and residual values of 
individual assets.
The estimated lives used are:
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the lease  
 term or 50 years 
Plant and equipment Mainly three to five years
Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of  
the obligation.
The group has taken internal and external advice in 
considering known legal claims and actions made by or 
against the group. It carefully assesses the likelihood of 
success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions are 
made for legal claims or actions against the group on the  
basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for 
those, which in the view of management are unlikely  
to succeed. These possible but not probable liabilities are 
disclosed in note 26 as contingent liabilities.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for 
goods and services supplied to external customers. It 
includes the group’s share of revenue from work carried 
out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion  
of the contract, as set out in the accounting policy for 
long-term contracts.
Share-based payments
There are various share-based payment arrangements 
which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; 
these awards are granted by AMEC. The fair value of 
awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during 
which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the award. The fair value of the award is measured using  
a valuation model, taking into account the terms and

2 Segmental analysis of continuing operations 
AMEC has three divisions: Natural Resources, Power & Process and Environment & Infrastructure, that offer 
consultancy, engineering and project management services to customers in the world’s oil and gas, minerals and 
metals, clean energy, and environment and infrastructure markets. Each of the divisions is considered to be a reportable 
segment. Following the acquisition of MACTEC, the Earth & Environmental division has been rebranded to Environment 
& Infrastructure to better reflect the services and scope of the current business and its global growth strategy. AMEC’s 
Chief Executive together with the senior management team constitute the chief operating decision maker and they 
regularly review the performance of these three divisions, as well as the Investments and other activities segment. The 
Investments and other activities segment principally comprises the Incheon Bridge PPP project in Korea now in the 
operational phase, the Lancashire Waste PPP project being commissioned and AMEC’s remaining UK wind development 
activities. Details of the services offered by each division and the end markets in which they operate are given in the 
business and financial review on pages 27 to 37.

On 23 March 2011, in his Budget Speech, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a reduction in the rate of 
Corporation Tax from 28 per cent to 26 per cent from 1 April 2011, with further reductions of 1 per cent per annum to  
23 per cent by 1 April 2014. As at 31 December 2011, the reduction in the rate to 25 per cent on 1 April 2012 has been 
substantively enacted.
The change in deferred tax has resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of £2 million which has been recognised 
in the income statement. However, the remaining reductions in the rate have not yet been substantively enacted and 
therefore the proposed changes are not reflected in the figures reported.
The decrease in the rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent would reduce the balance sheet deferred tax asset by 
approximately £1 million and would reduce unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately £1 million. During the 
period to 2014, AMEC estimate that the effect of the proposed changes to income and equity would be a charge of 
£1 million to the income statement. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 83

The group is required to test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently  
if indicators of impairment exist. 
The review of unamortised goodwill for indications of impairment by management is performed against the three core 
segments of Natural Resources, Power & Process and Environment & Infrastructure being the lowest level of cash 
generating units (‘CGU’) monitored for goodwill purposes. This is consistent with the integration of acquisitions into the 
three segments in order to generate synergies. Goodwill has been allocated between segments on a relative fair value 
basis.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow 
projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two-year period and pre-tax 
discount rates as set out in the table below. Given the current market conditions, management believe that the 
discount rates chosen are conservative. For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow 
projections beyond the two-year period include 2 per cent growth per annum (2010: 2 per cent), which is in line with 
long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate. The value-in-use has been compared to 
the carrying value for each CGU and no impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of any of the CGUs.
The financial budgets are developed using an assumed workload and margin for the following year .  Workload is 
underpinned by a secured order book for each CGU, and order book remains strong at £3.7 billion as at 31 December 
2011 (2010: £3.1 billion). The margin selected is based on management’s review of the margins on orders received and is 
consistent with Vision 2015 objectives. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key 
assumptions. For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a 1 per cent 
decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments. Similarly, zero growth 
after the initial two-year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a 1 per cent increase in discount rate, did not 
identify any material impairments.
Goodwill of £2 million has been allocated to a small business divested during the year .

14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities
The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees. Substantially all UK members  
are in funded defined benefit schemes, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC 
Executive Pension Scheme. The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes. Contributions by 
the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes
The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 31 March 2011  
and updated by the schemes’ actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes 
as at 31 December 2011. The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2011.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows:
 31 December 
 2011
 Per cent
 31 December 
 2010
 Per cent
Rate of discount 4.7 5.4
Rate of inflation 3.0 3.4
Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 4.4
Rate of increase in pensions in payment (service before/after 1 January 2008) 3.0/2.3 3.4/2.4
Expected rate of return on scheme assets:
Equities 8.1 7.7
Bonds 4.7 5.4
Gilts 3.1 4.2
Property 5.1 6.2
The main overseas schemes as at 31 December 2011 consist of three defined benefit schemes held in Canada and The 
Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan that was acquired as part of the acquisition of MACTEC. The obligations have 
been measured in accordance with IAS 19. A discount rate of 4.6 per cent (2010: 5.4 per cent) and salary inflation rate of 
2.75 per cent (2010:  3.25 per cent) have been used for the three defined benefit schemes held in Canada. A discount rate 
of 4.6 per cent has been used for the Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan retirement scheme. No further benefits 
are being accrued in this scheme. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 91

Member aged 45 (life expectancy at 65) 24.5 26.1 23.3 25.5
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, 
which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of 
expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated 
with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. 
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected 
long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 5.4 per cent assumption as at 
31 December 2011 (2010: 5.9 per cent).

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years
There are a number of factors that may affect the group’s future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with 
tax authorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation 
and tax rates. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items:
 31 December 
 2011
 £ million
 31 December 
 2010
 £ million
Deductible temporary differences 15 20
Tax losses 20 48
35 68
Tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets. 
In addition, claims have been made to HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) to offset tax losses of up to £79 million against 
the group’s UK taxable profits. These losses were generated in a legacy German business in accounting periods up to 31 
December 2002. If successful, the claims will result in a refund of UK Corporation tax. The amount and availability of the 
refund depends on a number of factors which are currently being discussed with HMRC.
This potential refund is not included as an asset in the accounts.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of £474 million (2010: £382 million) of unremitted earnings of 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be £24 million 
(2010: £19 million).

19 Capital and financial risk management
Capital management 
The objective of the group’s capital management is to ensure that it has a strong financial position from which to grow 
the business to meet its Vision 2015 targets and is able to maximise shareholder value. The appropriate capital structure 
for the group would comprise of a mix of debt and equity. The mix would be determined by considering business profile 
and strategy, financial policies and availability and cost of funding.
The group is currently in a net cash position. If debt is subsequently required, the long-term net debt is expected to be no 
more than two times EBITDA. The group may exceed this operating parameter should the business profile require it. 
However, it is expected that any increases would be temporary given the net operational cash flows of the group.
In February 2012, the board approved a share buyback programme of £400 million which is expected to  be completed 
over the next 12 months.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during 2011 or 2010.
Financial risk management
The principal financial risks to which the group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange risk; funding and liquidity risk; 
counterparty credit risk; and interest rate risk. The board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
The group’s treasury department manages funding, liquidity and risks arising from movements in interest and foreign 
currency rates within a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the board. The treasury department does not 
operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. Treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the board, most recently in 
October 2011. 
Foreign currency exchange risk
The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling. The majority of the group’s trading income is denominated in 
the local currency of the business operations which provides a natural hedge against the currency of its cost base. Where 
commercial contracts are undertaken which are denominated in foreign currencies, the group seeks to mitigate the 
foreign exchange risk, when the cash flow giving rise to such exposure becomes certain or highly probable, through the 
use of forward currency arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options. There are currently no 
material transactional exposures which have been identified and remain unhedged. AMEC has no reason to believe that 
any outstanding forward contract will not be able to be settled from the underlying commercial transactions.
A portion of the group’s earnings is generated in non-Sterling currencies. Such overseas profits are translated into 
Sterling at the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the year . There is currently no hedging in place for profits 
generated in non-Sterling currencies but the impact on group profits is monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition, the 
group has various assets denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars and Canadian dollars. A proportion of 
these assets, including unamortised goodwill, have been designated in net investment hedges using cross-currency 
instruments. The policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business. The existing 
hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature. In specific circumstances, for example the planned repatriation of 
foreign assets, the group may from time to time enter into new net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange risks.
Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk – cash flow hedges
The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in, 
non-local currency. Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are 
designated as cash flow hedges. The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and 
swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows:

The group hedges its material transaction related exposures and hence has no material transactional profit or loss 
sensitivity. With respect to translation related exposure, the group hedges a proportion of assets denominated in foreign 
currencies. A 10 per cent movement in Sterling/Canadian dollar and Sterling/US dollar rates results in a £14 million 
credit/charge (2010: £25 million credit/charge) to other comprehensive income arising on net investment hedges.
Funding and liquidity risk
The group’s policy aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet both current and 
future forecast requirements consistent with the group’s budget and strategic plans. The group will finance operations 
and growth from its significant existing cash resources and as such no additional facilities are currently in place. The 
requirement to enter into external facilities has been kept under review during 2011.
Appropriate facilities will be maintained to meet ongoing requirements for performance related bonding and letters 
of credit.
Counterparty credit risk
The group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its 
financial instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the group’s risk 
management activities. 
The credit risk associated with customers is considered as part of each tender review process and is addressed initially 
via contract payment terms, and, where appropriate, payment security is sought. Credit control practices are applied 
thereafter during the project execution phase. A right to interest and suspension is normally sought in all contracts.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the board 
approved treasury policy. The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the group’s exposure to credit risk from 
its treasury activities by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30 mainstream banks and 
with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit. These limits are set at prudent levels by the board and are based 
primarily on credit ratings set by Moody’s, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Credit ratings are monitored continuously by the 
group treasury department. 
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid an over-concentration of 
exposure to any one counterparty.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative 
financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.

31 December 2011 include £2 million (2010: £2 million) in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year . The group 
believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 100

 £ million
 2010
 £ million
As at 1 January (22) (20)
Exchange movements – (2)
Net impairment allowance credited 2 –
As at 31 December (20) (22)
Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade 
receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government backed organisations, and the credit 
ratings of these organisations are monitored. Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent 
company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The group’s most significant customer in 2011 accounted for around 14 per cent (2010: 22 per cent) of continuing 
revenues, and a similar percentage of current trade and other receivables.
Interest rate risk - The group remained in a net cash position throughout the year . Long-term interest rate hedging (for 
periods beyond three to six months) is not considered appropriate as the surplus cash position is viewed as temporary. 
Interest rate risk – contractual maturity and effective interest rates

Fair values
The carrying values of all financial instruments held at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 equate to their fair 
values. 
Fair values are determined using observable market prices (level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’) as follows:
Trade and other receivables and payables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued at their 
amortised cost, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual 
forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 101

Provision was made during 2006 and prior for the estimated litigation, settlement and future legal costs in connection 
with the group’s ongoing major litigation. 
The provision for indemnities relates to the indemnification of the purchasers of SPIE in 2006, purchasers of the Built 
Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses in 2007, and to the Wind Developments business which was 
sold in 2008.
The insurance provision relates to the potential liabilities in the group’s captive insurance entity and provisions in relation 
to risks associated with insurance claims. These potential liabilities and risks relate predominantly to industrial disease 
of former employees.
Future outflows in respect of the onerous property contracts are expected to occur over the next several years. Due to the 
nature of the other liabilities, the timing of any potential future outflows is uncertain. 
Provision has been made for AMEC’s potential liability to fund loss-making joint venture entities.
22 Share capital and reserves
Movements in share capital and reserves are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on pages 68 
and 69.
Share capital
The authorised share capital of the company is £350 million (2010: £350 million). This comprises 700 million  
(2010: 700 million) ordinary shares of 50 pence each. All the ordinary shares rank pari passu in all respects. To the 
company’s knowledge and belief, there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company or on voting rights 
between holders of shares.
As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the company had in issue 337,965,871 ordinary shares of 50 pence each. 
The allotted, called up and fully paid ordinary share capital at these dates was £169 million.
Reserves
The group has acquired 1,000,000 shares (2010: 1,000,000) during the year which are held in treasury. During the year 
1,922,253 shares (2010: 468,814) were transferred to share scheme participants leaving a balance held in treasury as at 
31 December 2011 of 5,735,806 shares (2010: 6,658,059). £49 million (2010: £51 million) has been deducted from equity in 
respect of these shares.
A qualifying share ownership trust (‘the Quest’) was established on 26 August 1999. The Quest holds shares issued by the 
company in connection with the savings related share option scheme. There was no activity in the Quest during 2011 or 2010. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 102
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
22 Share capital and reserves continued
As at 31 December 2011 the Quest held 259 (2010: 259) shares.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging 
instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities and the cumulative net change in the fair value of instruments 
that hedge the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Share-based payments
Offers are made periodically in certain countries under the UK and International Savings Related Share Option Schemes 
which are open to all employees in those countries who meet minimum service criteria. Grants of share options are 
made to participating employees that entitle them to buy shares in the company normally after three years at up to 20 
per cent discount to the market price of the shares at the time of offer . In the US, to conform with the relevant tax rules, 
options are granted at a maximum discount of 15 per cent to the share price at the time of grant and are normally 
exercisable after two years. In certain countries, awards take the form of cash-settled stock appreciation rights.
Under the Performance Share Plan, annual awards are made to directors and selected senior employees of restricted 
shares that are subject to both market and non-market based conditions calculated over a three-year period. During 
2008, one-off awards were made under the Transformation Incentive Plan that were subject to non-market based 
conditions related to 2010 performance. Detailed terms of these plans are included in the remuneration report on  
pages 58 to 59.
The company has a further scheme in place, the Executive Share Option Scheme. AMEC’s policy is to grant share options 
under this scheme only selectively and in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment. No awards have been made 
under this scheme since 2004.
The share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are predominantly equity-settled and, other than in 
defined good leaver circumstances, require participants to be still in employment with the group at the time of vesting.

The performance conditions attaching to the Performance Share Plan involve a comparison of the total shareholder 
return of the company with that of its comparators and achievement of targeted earnings per share growth. The former 
is a market based test and as such is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
Dividends
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2011 of 20.3 pence  
per share, which will absorb an estimated £67 million of equity. Subject to approval, it will be paid on 2 July 2012  
to shareholders on the register of members on 1 June 2012. This dividend has not been provided for and there are  
no income tax consequences for the company. This final dividend together with the interim dividend of 10.2 pence  
(2010: 7.3 pence) per share results in a total dividend for the year of 30.5 pence per share (2010: 26.5 pence). AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 104

24 Acquisitions and disposals
Acquisitions in 2011
The following purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.  MACTEC, Inc contributed £126 million to consolidated 
revenue and £10 million to consolidated EBITA in the period from the date of its acquisition to 31 December 2011. If the 
acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the EBITA of the group would have been £307 million and 
consolidated revenue would have been £3,386 million. None of the other businesses acquired made a material 
contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from their acquisition to 31 December 2011, nor would they 
have done in the year ended 31 December 2011 if they had been acquired on 1 January 2011.  
Intangible assets recognised at fair value on the acquisition of these businesses included brands, trade names, customer 
relationships, order backlogs and non-compete agreements. 
QED International Limited
On 21 February 2011, the group acquired all of the shares in QED International Limited ('qedi').  qedi is a market-leading 
project delivery company, focused on delivering specialist completion and commissioning services for major projects in 
the oil and gas industry.  The acquisition strengthens AMEC’s project delivery capability across its key sectors, supports 
the Vision 2015 strategy, and reinforces AMEC’s excellent track record through commissioning into operation.

in completion and commissioning services for major projects in the oil and gas industry, which did not meet the criteria 
for recognition as intangible assets at the date of acquisition. The acquisition also provides opportunities for expansion of 
the qedi business utilising AMEC’s geographic coverage.
Zektin Group Pty Limited
On 28 February 2011, the group acquired all of the shares in Zektin Group Pty Limited ('Zektingroup'). Zektingroup is an 
Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.  The acquisition 
provides AMEC with oil and gas capability on the east coast of Australia, as well as access to the coal seam methane 
sector . This is fully aligned with AMEC’s Vision 2015 strategy of assured growth through a strengthened geographic 
footprint and enhanced capabilities in key sectors. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 106

Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Zektingroup through recognition of the value of its workforce of circa 220 which 
has strong capabilities and experience in target markets which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible 
assets at the date of acquisition. The acquisition also provides opportunities for synergies with and cross-selling for 
existing AMEC businesses.
At December 2011, the latest forecasts indicate that due to events that have occurred since the acquisition, the 
contingent consideration will not be payable and the provision has been released to the income statement.
MACTEC, Inc
On 3 June 2011, the group acquired all of the shares in MACTEC, Inc ('MACTEC'). MACTEC is a leading US engineering 
and environmental services company which provides a similar wide range of services to the group’s existing Environment 
& Infrastructure business. The acquisition provides greater access to new customers and regions, is fully aligned with 
the Vision 2015 strategy and provides the group with the right scale to service the important and growing environmental 
and infrastructure engineering services market.

Goodwill has been recognised on this acquisition through recognition of the value of its workforce of circa 2,600 mostly 
highly skilled technical professionals which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets as at the date of 
acquisition. MACTEC’s 70 offices are mainly based in eastern USA, complementing the strength of the existing AMEC 
Environment & Infrastructure business in western USA and Canada. The acquisition also provides significant 
opportunities for synergy benefits and cost savings.
Other acquisitions
Other acquisitions were made in the year for a total consideration of £14 million of which £11 million was paid on 
completion with the balance of £3 million dependent on the achievement of set targets for labour revenue growth. The 
aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets was £6 million, which consisted of £6 million relating to other intangible 
assets, cash and cash equivalents of £1 million and other net liabilities of £1 million. Goodwill arising was £8 million and 
has been recognised as a result of expected synergies.
A further £16 million was paid in the period in respect of businesses acquired in 2010 and prior years.
Disposal in 2011
There was one small disposal made during the year . In addition, there were various cash payments in respect of 
businesses sold in prior years and adjustments to provisions held in respect of prior year disposals resulting in a net loss 
of £2 million and a net cash outflow of £9 million.
Acquisitions in 2010
The following purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions. None of the businesses acquired made a material 
contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from their acquisition to 31 December 2010, nor would they 
have done in the year ended 31 December 2010 if they had been acquired on 1 January 2010. 
Intangible assets recognised at fair value on the acquisition of these businesses included brands, trade names, customer 
relationships, order backlogs and non-compete agreements. 
Currie & Brown (Australia) Pty Limited
On 29 January 2010, the group acquired all of the shares in Currie & Brown (Australia) Pty Limited. The name of this 
company was subsequently changed to Aquenta Consulting Pty Limited ('Aquenta'). Aquenta trades almost entirely in 
Australia and is a provider of independent cost, contract and consulting services to the oil and gas, mining, building, 
transport, utilities and infrastructure sectors. The business provides similar services to the existing AMEC subsidiary 
Rider Hunt International Limited and was acquired to increase the size of the consultancy services business. This is fully 
aligned with AMEC’s Vision 2015 strategy of assured growth, through a strengthened geographic footprint in key regions 
and enhanced capabilities in chosen sectors. It builds on AMEC’s earlier acquisition of GRD Minproc.

The contingent consideration of £6 million shown above was dependent upon achievement of a profit target for the  
year following the acquisition date. The profit targets were achieved and the deferred consideration was paid during the 
year ended 31 December 2011.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Entec primarily through the acquisition of Entec’s expertise in various 
environmental fields, primarily water services, as well as expected synergies. 
Other acquisitions
A number of smaller acquisitions were made in 2010 for £9 million in cash paid on completion. The aggregate fair value 
of identifiable net assets was £nil (including cash acquired of £1 million and goodwill arising on the acquisitions was £9 
million).
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of their skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria 
for recognition as intangible assets at the dates of acquisition.
A further £9 million was paid in 2010 in respect of businesses acquired in 2009 and prior . The aggregate goodwill on 
these acquisitions was reduced by £8 million as the conditions for payment of elements of the deferred consideration 
were not met.

Guarantees and indemnities
The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC.
Legal claims and actions
AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the 
company. Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified 
in this note. AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of 
the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed. Provisions of £54 million 
(2010: £50 million) are shown in note 21 in respect of these claims. It is not practicable to quantify the remaining 
contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
AMEC Group Limited (‘ AGL ‘) is currently the subject of ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in respect of 
an incident involving a fatality to a subcontractor at the Leftbank Apartments project in Manchester in April 2004 where 
AMEC was principal contractor . A summons has been received and AMEC entered a not guilty plea. The case was heard 
at Liverpool Crown Court in June 2011 and resulted in a hung jury and a retrial will be held in March 2012. If AGL is found 
guilty and prosecuted for this case, it could be liable to unlimited fines. 
However it is considered improbable that this case will result in a material liability for AGL.
27 Related party transactions
During 2011 there were a number of transactions with the senior management group, joint venture entities and 
subsidiary companies.

Responsibility statements of the directors
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are

statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in the  
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
consolidated and parent company accounts may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

in respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 n
the accounts, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 n
the directors report includes a fair review of the

Statement of directors’ responsibilities  
in respect of the annual report and  
the accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the consolidated and parent company accounts, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
consolidated and parent company accounts for each 
financial year . Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the consolidated accounts in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company accounts in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
consolidated and parent company accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the consolidated and parent company 
accounts, the directors are required to: 
 n
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently 
 n
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent
 n
for the consolidated accounts, state whether they  
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU
 n
for the parent company accounts, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company accounts and 
 n
prepare the consolidated and parent company accounts 
on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the consolidated and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the parent company and enable them to ensure that its 
accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2011 112
We have audited the consolidated accounts of AMEC plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the 
related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 111, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the consolidated 
accounts and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the consolidated accounts in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the consolidated 
accounts
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the consolidated accounts sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the accounts are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
consolidated accounts.
Opinion on consolidated accounts
In our opinion the consolidated accounts:
■ ■
Give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
■ ■
Have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and 
■ ■
Have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the consolidated 
accounts are prepared is consistent with the consolidated 
accounts.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■
Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
■ ■
We have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
■ ■
The directors’ statement, set out on page 111, in relation 
to going concern; and
■ ■
The part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review; and
■ ■
Certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company 
accounts of AMEC plc for the year ended 31 December 
2011 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having  
been audited.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards and the Companies Act 2006.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss 
account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies  
Act 2006. 
Restatement
The accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 have 
been restated to present the results rounded to the 
nearest million rather than to one decimal place. 
Cash flow statement
The company is exempt from the requirement of FRS 1 
‘Cash flow statements’ to prepare a cash flow statement 
as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash 
flow of the group.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than 
freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or 
valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on  
a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. For plant 
and equipment the estimated useful lives are mainly 
between three and five years. Depreciation is provided 
from the month in which the asset is available for use.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. 
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the 
instruments. Cash, deposits and short-term investments 
are held at amortised cost. Derivative financial 
instruments are accounted for as described in note 1 to 
the consolidated accounts.
The company is exempt from the disclosure requirements 
of FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ as the 
financial instruments disclosures of IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: disclosure’ are included in the notes to the 
consolidated accounts.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in a currency other than Sterling are 
translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the  
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and exchange differences are taken to profit and loss 
accounts in the year . Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
are measured in terms of historical cost and are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of  
the transaction.
Interest 
Interest income and payable is recognised in profit or 
loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest 
method.
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for 
permanent diminution in value. Where equity settled 
share based payments are granted to the employees of 
subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is 
treated as a capital contribution by the company and the 
investment in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this 
capital contribution.
Pensions
The company participates in a UK group wide funded 
defined benefit pension scheme. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the company. 
The company is unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a 
consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as 
required by FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’, accounts for 
the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. 
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss 
account represents the contributions payable to the 
scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit scheme can be found in 
note 14 of the consolidated accounts.
Share-based payments
There are share-based payment arrangements which 
allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; these 
awards are granted by AMEC. The fair value of awards 
granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period 
during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the award. The fair value of the award is 
measured using a valuation model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the awards were 
granted. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest 
except where non-vesting is due to share prices not 
achieving the threshold for vesting.

Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as 
otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’.

On the 23 March 2011, in his budget speech, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a reduction in the rate of 
Corporation Tax from 28 per cent to 26 per cent from 1 April 2011, with further reductions of 1 per cent per annum to 23 
per cent by 1 April 2014. As at 31 December 2011, the reduction in the rate to 25 per cent on 1 April 2012 has been 
substantively enacted.
The change in deferred tax has resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of £nil which has been recognised in the 
income statement. However, the remaining reductions in the rate have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore 
the proposed changes are not reflected in the figures reported.
The decreases in the rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent would reduce the balance sheet deferred tax asset by 
approximately £nil and would reduce unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately £nil. During the period to 2014, 
AMEC estimate that the effect of the proposed changes to income and equity would be a charge of £nil to the profit and 
loss account.

We have audited the parent company accounts of AMEC 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise 
the company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 111, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
accounts and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company accounts in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the accounts
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the accounts sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the accounts are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the accounts.
Opinion on accounts
In our opinion the parent company accounts:
■ ■
Give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2011;
■ ■
Have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
■ ■
Have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
■ ■
The information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the accounts are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company accounts.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■
Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
■ ■
The parent company accounts and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
■ ■
Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
■ ■
We have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter

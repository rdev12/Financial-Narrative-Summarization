Company information
Symphony is also developing processes for the destruction of, and creation of value from, 
used tyres. It is the lead partner in a UK Government grant funded collaboration project.
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc is a British Public Company and head  
of a Group established in 1995, dedicated to Controlled-life Plastic. It has over  
50 Distributors around the world, and is present in more than 90 countries. 
Symphony has its own laboratories in England with the latest equipment,  
where it constantly tests, develops, and improves its products. 
Symphony is a member of the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association (www.biodeg.org), 
the Society for the Chemical Industry (UK) and the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM). Symphony holds an ISO 9001-2008 certificate for quality management, 
and is represented on the British Standards Institute.
Symphony’s Technical Department includes more than 30 years experience in the 
manufacture of plastic products. Symphony is therefore able to provide a first-class 
product, and after-sales service without parallel in the industry.
Symphony has developed a range of oxo-biodegradable products marketed  
as d
2
w
®
 Controlled-life Plastic with ever increasing markets and applications.
Company Profile
d

w
®
 Technology
Plastic is a very useful material which is indispensible for 
modern life, but the problem is that it can lie or float around 
for decades if it gets into the environment. Symphony has 
developed a low-cost insurance. It is a special formulation 
called d
2
w
®
 which is added to the plastic when it is being 
made. It breaks the molecular chains within the polymer, 
and makes plastic self-destruct in the presence of oxygen on 
land or water at the end of its service-life, but until then it has 
no effect on the product, which can be re-used many times.
d
2
w
®
 plastic can be made to biodegrade from as little as two 
months onwards, leaving no fragments nor “heavy metals”, 
and without emitting methane, even when buried in landfill. 
It can be recycled with normal plastics (see http://www.
biodeg.org/position-papers/recycling/?domain=biodeg.org), 
or incinerated for energy-recovery. d
2
w
®
 is certified safe for 
food-contact and has been proved not to be eco-toxic.
When d
2
w
®
 plastics reach the fragmentation stage they  
are no longer plastic. They have a completely different 
molecular structure, and can be bioassimilated in the  
same way as a leaf.
d
2
w
®
 Controlled-life Plastic products are made from  
a by-product of oil which used to be wasted, so nobody  
is importing extra oil to make them. They can be made  
with the same machinery and workforce and the same 
polymers, as ordinary plastic so there is no need to disrupt 
the supply-chain and there is little or no on-cost and no  
loss of jobs. 
Symphony’s d
2
w
®
 additive formulation is so effective that it 
can be included at rates starting as low as 1% – resulting in 
considerable savings in cost, transport, and storage. It is 
manufactured under licence from Symphony by carefully 
selected and audited companies around the world. 01

The aim for the next year is to build on the achievements to date whilst 
continuing to develop new markets. The Group has improved its technical 
facilities and increased its team to ensure that product development is 
continually advanced.
The Group is working closely with its distributors and will be investing in 
various marketing opportunities during the forthcoming year to ensure 
that revenue growth for d
2
w
®
 Controlled-life products is maximised. 
These products show strong growth globally and are currently being sold 
into 90 countries.
Developments on Symphony Energy are progressing with the aim of 
commercialisation as soon as practical.
These impressive results reflect the efforts of all involved within the 
Group, whom I thank, and we look forward to building on this excellent 
foundation. I would like to congratulate and thank the many people 
associated with helping the Group become what it is today; a Group that is 
profitable, cash-flow positive and one that is in good position to capture a 
substantial part of the potentially large and developing oxo-biodegradable 
plastics market. Thank you also to our many loyal shareholders and staff 
who have worked tirelessly over the years and have supported the 
management team since inception. It is due to this remarkable and long 
standing effort, that our technology, the d
2

In particular , the Group is a world leader in the development and 
marketing of Controlled-life plastics and sells both pro-degradent 
additives and finished plastic products through a growing network of 
international distributors and agents. The Group has chosen not to 
manufacture products itself, but to subcontract this work to carefully 
selected and audited companies around the world. This flexibility 
provides security of supply, local availability, and significant cost  
benefits to the Group and its customers.
The Registered office, and headquarters of Symphony’s global 
operations, are located in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, which is  
just north of London. Our laboratory is in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.  
The Group employs directly around 30 staff. 
The Group was founded in 1995, specialising in the procurement and 
distribution of polythene bags, sheet, film and other related products  
in the UK in particular .
Towards the end of 1997 , the Group realised the need for , and worldwide 
market potential of, plastic which could be made biodegradable. 
Symphony started to market biodegradable plastics under licence.
In August 2000, shares in the Company were first publicly traded 
following admission to the Ofex market. In November 2001, its shares 
were admitted to the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock 
Exchange, with an open offer of shares to the public. In 2008 ADRs in 
Symphony’s shares became available in the US through the Bank of  
New York.

Adding value to waste 
Effective and efficient waste management is currently one of the 
hardest challenges for modern society. As a consumer society we 
produce a lot of waste. The best method for dealing with this problem 
is to transform the waste into goods again.
Scrap “tyre mountains” are unsightly and make 
unproductive use of vast areas of land – they  
are also a public-health hazard. Mosquitoes
breed in the rainwater that collects in tyre 
carcasses and go on to spread malaria, dengue 
and other dangerous diseases. Symphony 
Energy Ltd. has addressed this problem and is 
developing the w
2
v
®
 system for creating value 
from this until-now rejected material.
In June 2003, Symphony developed its own additive which has since  
then been sold under the “d
2
w
®
” trademark. 
In April 2007 there was a major re-organisation of the management 
structure, and the number of Distributors worldwide was increased  
from 7 to over 50 today. 
In April 2008 a consortium of companies, of which Symphony Energy  
Ltd is the lead partner, was awarded a UK Government grant for  
research and development in the area of high value manufacturing  
relating to a rubber product enhanced recovery technology project,  
the “RµPERT” project. The project is programmed to last three years, 
with the aim to commercialise as soon as practicable.
In August 2009 , Symphony launched d
2
p antimicrobial technology.  
This is applied within the plastics manufacturing process similarly  
to d
2
w
®
. The markets for d
2
p are also similar to d
2
w
®
.
d
2
p Antimicrobial – Design to protect
Product description
d
2
p is an additive system that gives plastic products anti-microbial and 
fungicidal performance.
d
2
p is a masterbatch designed for specific applications. The inorganic 
nature, small particle-size and high temperature-tolerance of the active 
ingredient makes it ideal for use in a wide range of polymer processes.
How does it work?…Silver based biocide
Silver is widely accepted as having broad-spectrum anti-microbial 
activity. In order to understand why this is so, it is necessary to examine 
the action of silver ions against microbes.
Stage 1:   Silver ions enter micro-organism’s membrane and cause 
damage and disruption to the cellular wall before 
penetrating the cell.
Stage 2:  Silver ions are highly reactive with enzymes and can 
deactivate vital molecules.
Stage 3:  Silver ions interact with the DNA cell and prevent replication.
d
2
p a successful protection against micro-organisms
d
2
p is effective against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, 
mold and yeast. 06

Plastic is strong, durable, versatile, 
lightweight, safe, and is the most effective 
and cost-effective material for most 
packaging applications. 
However, modern plastic is virtually 
indestructible and can last for many 
decades after its useful life. 
Over the last decade businesses, consumers and Governments have 
sought to minimise their impact upon the environment. Be it through 
reactive or pro-active measures, tighter legislation has changed the 
business landscape to one seeking alternative technology applications 
which are environmentally friendly.
The Group’s enthusiasm for , and particular emphasis on, degradable 
plastics derives from the significant and growing increase in interest  
in the environment in general and, in particular , on the adverse effects  
of the durability of traditional plastics and the major problems caused  
by plastic litter .
This enthusiasm is being matched by many companies who are  
pursuing genuine Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) objectives,  
and from consumers who understand their responsibilities towards  
the environment and who are providing those companies who use 
degradable plastics with a real marketing benefit. 
The pressure towards the use of degradable plastics is simultaneously 
coming from Governments who in some cases are introducing legislation.
Most recently the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa has 
ruled that bread bags made with Symphony’s d
2
w
®
 Controlled-life  
Plastic can be advertised as biodegradable. 
The Problem with Plastic
* F a c t : Plastics can take many 
decades to break down. Almost  
all the plastics ever made can  
still be found somewhere. 07
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
* F a c t : Global production and consumption of plastics has increased 
from 5 million tonnes in 1950 to 245 million tones in 2006
(Plastics Europe, The Compelling Facts About Plastics – An analysis of plastics production, 
demand and recovery for 2006 in Europe, January 2008)
* F a c t : Recent surveys show that consumers believe that packaging 
is the top environmental problem in relation to the products they 
buy. Less packaging, and more recyclable, recycled or 
biodegradable packaging came at the top of their wish list
http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/strategy/factsheets/packaging.htm
* F a c t : UK Government (DEFRA) research shows that 80 per cent  
of people re-use plastic carrier bags in the home. Evidence from 
members of the Carrier Bag Consortium (who make and supply  
bin liners and refuse sacks) shows a plastic bag tax introduced in 
Ireland resulted in an increase of 300 - 500 per cent in the sale of 
plastic refuse bags and bin liners
http://www.brc.org.uk/details04.asp ?id= 1 109&kCat=&kData=263&sCat=Retail+Myths
* F a c t : When oxo-biodegradable plastic has reached the 
fragmentation stage it is no longer a plastic, and is “biodegradable” 
in the same way as nature’s wastes such as straw and twigs. The 
process continues until the material has biodegraded to nothing 
more than CO
2
, water , and humus, and it does not leave fragments 
of petro-polymers in the soil

Symphony Environmental

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
All plastics will eventually become 
embrittled, and will fragment and be 
bioassimilated, but the difference made  
by Symphony’s d
2
w
®
 technology is that  
the process is accelerated. 
d
2
w
®
 plastic is intended to address the environmental problem caused  
by plastic waste which gets accidentally or deliberately into the open 
environment, because it is designed to degrade in the presence of  
oxygen at the end of its useful life. The process will be accelerated by  
heat and ultra-violet light but they are not essential, and the process  
is not inhibited by moisture. Until the material has degraded it has the 
same strength, impermeability, printability, recyclability and other 
characteristics of normal plastic.
The d
2
w
®
 additives which cause accelerated degradation are added to 
conventional plastics at the extrusion stage. These additives are not 
phyto-toxic and do not contain toxic metal substances ie lead, mercury, 
cadmium and hexavalent chromium. As d
2
w
®
 additives are included  
at very low rates there is little or no on-cost, and d
2
w
®
 plastics can be 
made with the same machinery as ordinary plastics.
It is important to note that while all plastics fragment as they degrade,  
the fragments created by oxidative degradation do not remain in the 
environment for extended periods. This is because the molecular-weight 
of the material is reduced by d
2
w
®
 to the point where it no longer has the 
molecular structure of a plastic, and can be bioassimilated in the same 
way as twigs and straw.
The applications for which d
2
w
®
 plastics are normally used can vary  
from very short-life products designed to last only a few weeks after 
unpacking, to durable shopping bags designed to last five years or more. 
The conditions under which they are likely to be discarded can also vary 
from cold and wet conditions to hot and dry desert conditions. It is for  
the companies producing or using these products to evaluate test results 
to judge the suitability of the tested material for those applications and 
conditions, and to describe and market them accordingly. 
Timescale in the natural environment depends on the amount of heat, 
light, and stress to which the material is subjected. Nature’s wastes such 
as twigs and straw may take ten years or more to completely biodegrade, 
but d
2
w
® 
 plastics will do so more quickly – and much more quickly than 
ordinary or recycled plastic.
The d
2
w
®
 Solution
Responsible use of plastic – The Three R’s 
  REDUCE:  Plastic is a very efficient use of resources.  
A plastic bag can hold 2,500 times its  
own weight. d
2
w
®
 can help to reduce the 
burden of plastic waste in the environment
  REUSE:  d
2
w
®
 based products can be re-used many 
times during their service-life
  RECYCLE:  d
2
w
®
 based products can be recycled and 
made from recycled plastic polymers

Controlled-life Plastic Technology at:
 http://www .youtube.com/watch?v=i3TGqcpWJTM Then the plastic starts degrading at the end of its service-life by a process of 
oxidation in the presence of air, which is accelerated by light, heat and stress. 
When the molecular weight has been reduced the material is no longer a 
plastic, and can be bio-assimilated in the same way as straw and twigs.
Finally, bio-degradation is completed by 
micro-organisms.

By contrast, vegetable-based or “compostable” plastics do not readily 
degrade in the open environment, as they are designed for industrial 
composting. Industrial composting is not the same as biodegradation  
in the environment. The fact that compostable plastics are designed to 
convert to CO
2
 gas within 180 days is not useful even for composting, 
because it contributes to climate change instead of contributing to the 
fertility of the soil. Nature’s lignocellulosic wastes and d
2
w
®
 plastics  
do not behave in this way.
It as a positive factor that ordinary plastics and d
2
w
®
 plastics are  
made from by-products of oil, natural gas, or coal. For so long as the 
world needs these materials as fuels it makes good environmental  
sense to use the by-product, and nobody is extracted these resources  
to make plastics. 
It is not desirable to send otherwise recoverable plastic to landfill, but  
if oxo-biodegradable plastics do end up in landfill, they are designed to 
disintegrate and biodegrade in contact with oxygen. Any particles in 
anaerobic conditions deep in landfill are likely to be minimal, and will not 
be converted to methane in significant amounts – unlike compostable 
plastics, and unlike paper, and wood, which are major components  
of landfill.
So far as recycling is concerned, oxo-biodegradable plastic can be 
recycled in the same way as ordinary plastic (see http://www.biodeg.org/
position-papers/recycling/?domain=biodeg.org ). “Compostable” plastic 
cannot be recycled with ordinary plastic, and will ruin the recycling 
process if it gets into the waste stream.

The Group has continued to invest in research and development for new 
products together with improvements to existing products as well as 
testing and compliance protocols. 
Costs have been carefully monitored with increases to support the 
growth in revenues. The Group has reduced its interest bearing debt by 
£0.34 million leading to a reduction in finance costs. This reduction in 
debt was limited due to a substantial increase in trade toward the end of 
the last quarter resulting in higher working capital balances reported at 
the end of the year , including amounts payable on invoice discounting.
Working with our distributors, we continue to monitor and have an 
influence on legislation in certain parts of the world and we are making 
considerable efforts to maximise awareness of d

 products.
These reported figures reflect the impact of the considerable work

Trading results
I am pleased to report Group revenues increased by 31% during the year 
from £5.36 million to £7 .04 million. Group gross profit margins increased 
from 44% to 55%. These factors resulted in a 63% increase in the 
contribution from gross profit from £2.37 million in 2008 to £3.88 million  
in 2009.
The Group made an operating profit of £0.83 million compared to an 
operating loss of £0. 15 million in 2008, resulting in the Group’s maiden 
profit before tax of £0.64 million compared to a loss before tax of £0.40 
million in 2008. 
Development costs of £0.23 million were capitalised in 2009. A £0.01 
million research and development tax credit was received during  
the year.
The Symphony Environmental Limited d

w

 division made a profit before 
taxation of £0.98 million and has recognised further deferred tax credit 
resulting in a carried forward deferred tax asset of £0.99 million at the  
end of the year . Losses within the non-degradable division reduced to  
£0. 16 million in 2009 compared to a loss of £0.47 million in 2008.
The Group primary selling currency is the US Dollar . The Group hedges 
where possible by purchasing in US dollars and has banking facilities  
in place in order to secure rates going forward. As at 31 December 2009 
the Group had a net balance of US Dollar assets totalling $1.29 million. 
 
Chief Executive’ s Review 11
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
As a result of this financial performance, the Group reports a profit  
for the year of £0.92 million with basic earnings per share increasing  
to 0.80 pence (2008: 0.35 pence) 
Cashflow
The Group has recorded an improvement in cash-flow of £1.21 million 
from 2008 by generating £0.57 million from operations (2008: £0.64 
million loss). £0.04 million was invested in plant and equipment together 
with £0.23 million in product development which has been capitalised. 
Further research and development spend is included within expenses 
and was not capitalised as it does not meet the appropriate accounting 
criteria.
Debt was reduced by £0.34 million in 2009. The amount payable on the 
invoice discounting facility increased from £0. 16 million in 2008 to £0.32 
million in 2009. This was due to increased revenues in the last quarter  
of 2009 resulting in high levels of amounts receivable and hence 
financeable at the end of the year .
The Headstart loan has been repaid in accordance with the terms 
renegotiated in January 2009. At 31 December 2009 the balance of  
the loan was £40,000. This has been settled in full since the year end.
Invoice financing and banking facilities remain in place for 2010 which 
together with the current trade profile show adequate resources are 
available for the foreseeable future. 
Operations 
Total costs increased in 2009 due to the level of support required to 
service the growth in revenue and number of distributors.
Having developed a strong distributor base, the main function for the 
Group continues to be product support and development, marketing  
and brand-recognition. 
On 19 March 2010 the Group moved its head office within Borehamwood 
UK to premises more suited for the next five to ten years of operations.
Symphony Energy
The Group currently absorbs annual running costs of £0. 18 million. The  
RµPERT project is in its second year out of three and the Group is actively 
pursuing commercial outlets for the elements within the project. 
Outlook
As stated above, the Group has moved its global headquarters to a 
modern facility that is more than twice the size of the Group’s original 
premises as a result of the growth in activities. Further investments will 
be made in technical support services, research and development, and 
also marketing activities. These investments, which are essential to a 
growing business of our size, will be undertaken carefully so as not to 
materially undermine short term expectations.
The Symphony distributor network has a busy year ahead with 
exhibitions, product development and other related projects on a global 
basis. So far in 2010, d
2
w
®
 representatives have participated in six major 
events. In the coming months, we will be at The Master Investor Show, 
London; Chinaplas 2010 Plast, China; exhibitions in Central America and 
Latin America, and towards the end of the year at one of the world’s 
largest plastic events in Germany; the K T rade Fair . Product launches 
and other events are planned for the UK and other markets in the coming 
months. Details of these events will be communicated through our 
normal commercial channels.
The current year has started well and in line with management’s 
expectations. The Board is confident that further expansion will be  
achieved during this year and that long term debt will continue to reduce.

Research and development
The group is involved in the research and development of degradable polythene and other polyolefin products, and waste to value systems.
The Directors and their interests
The directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the company are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 14.
Policy on the payment of creditors
It is the group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the transaction to ensure that suppliers are aware  
of these terms and abide by them. T rade payables at the year end amount to 46 days (2008 – 47) of average supplies for the year for the group and  
47 days (2008 – 78) for the company. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year . Under that law the directors have elected to prepare 
group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
The parent company’s own financial statements continue to be prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss of 
the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
state whether applicable IFRS or United Kingdom accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and •	
explained in the financial statements; 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business. •	
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
group and the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 13
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
In so far as each of the directors is aware:
there is no relevant audit information of which the group’s auditor  •	
is unaware; and
the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that •	
the auditor is aware of that information.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the group’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The group as a whole is performing profitably and generating positive cash flows. Taking this into account together with cashflow forecast the 
management has prepared for the ensuing twelve months, the directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing these financial statements.
Corporate governance
The group is committed to developing and adhering to high standards of corporate governance. As an AiM listed company it is not required to comply 
with the Combined Code as issued by the UK’s Listing Authority. However , it seeks to follow the principles of good governance as far as management 
believes it is practical for a group of its size, nature and circumstances. 
Financial risk management policies
The group’s financial risk management policies are detailed in note 3 to the financial statements.
Post balance sheet events
On 19 March 2010, Symphony Plastics Limited entered into a new lease at 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree House, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire,

is for ten years, with a five year break provision. The net total rentals payable over the first five years total £452,000.

for the year ended 31 December 2009 20
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
1 General information
Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc (‘the company’) and subsidiaries (together ‘the group’) develop and supply plastic degradable additives and 
products, and develop waste to energy systems.
The company, a public limited company, is the group’s ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England (Company number 
3676824). The address of its registered office is 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 1JD, England. The company’s  
shares are listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange, the PLUS market in London and as a level 1 ADR in New York.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU, issued and effective or issued as at 31 December 2009, and also comply with IFRS as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
The accounting policies have remained unchanged from the previous year , except as noted below with regard to IAS 1 and IFRS 8.
The adoption of IAS 1 (Revised 2007) has not affected the financial position or profits of the Group, but gives rise to additional disclosures. IAS 1 
(Revised 2007) introduces a “Statement of comprehensive income”. The Group has chosen to prepare a single statement of comprehensive income 
which incorporates the income statement and statement of other comprehensive income. The adoption of IFRS 8 requires the disclosure of significant 
customers, that is, those that comprise more than 10% of revenue, as disclosed in note 5. Under IFRS 8, the accounting policy for identifying segments 
is now based on the internal management reporting information that is regularly reviewed at Board level. This has not changed the segments 
reported as previously.
The third balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2007 has not been presented, because the information is unchanged from the previously 
published financial statements.
Going concern
The group as a whole is performing profitably and generating positive cash flows. Taking this into account together with cashflow forecast the 
management has prepared for the ensuing twelve months, the directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing these financial statements.
Business combinations exemption
The group has not restated business combinations which took place prior to the transition date. 
Accordingly the classification of the combination remains unchanged from that used under UK GAAP . The assets, liabilities and other reserve are 
recognised at date of transition, and are measured using their United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) carrying amount.
Business combinations completed prior to date of transition to IFRS
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all subsidiary undertakings. 
The acquisition of Symphony Plastics Limited on 9 December 1999 was accounted for under merger accounting under UK GAAP and has been treated 
in this manner under IFRS as the business combination exemption has been adopted in these Annual Report and Accounts. The merger accounting 
method requires assets and liabilities to not be adjusted to fair value and the results of the subsidiary to be included as if it had always been part of the 
group. Therefore, the results of the group included both the results pre and post-acquisition. The other reserve was established as a result of this 
accounting method.
Segment reporting 
In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group’s service lines, which represent the main products and services 
provided by the Group.
The activities undertaken by the degradable segment includes the sale of degradable products. The non-degradable segment includes the supply  
of non-degradable products to external customers. The waste to value segment includes all activities involved in the development of waste to  
value systems.
Each of the operating segments is managed separately as each of these service lines requires different technologies and other resources as well as 
marketing approaches. All inter-segments transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices.
Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts 21
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same as those used in its financial statements, except that:
one off costs such as post-employment benefit expenses; •	
expenses relating to share-based payments; •	
are not included in arriving at the operating profit of the operating segments. In addition, corporate assets which are not directly attributable to  
the business activities of any operating segment are not allocated to a segment. In the financial periods under review, this primarily applies to the 
Group’s headquarters in Borehamwood, UK.
Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented. IFRS 8 only requires disclosure of segment information.  
No asymmetrical allocations have been applied between segments.
Revenue
Degradable and non-degradable goods and services
Revenue is stated at the fair value of the consideration receivable and excludes VAT and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions have been satisfied:
a) ownership of the significant risks and rewards has been transferred to the buyer;
b) the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the  
goods sold;
c) the amount of revenue can be measured effectively;
d) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
e) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction shall be 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. The outcome of a transaction can be estimated 
reliably when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;
c) the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and
d) the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
Government grants
Government grants are included within the income statement once the group has fulfilled all obligations necessary to qualify for the grant.
Non-recurring items
Expenditure is classified as non-recurring where the cost is considered to be material, one-off and will not continue in the future.
Intangible assets
 – Research and development costs
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale; •	
the group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; •	
the group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; •	
the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market for the output  •	
from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or , if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in generating such benefits;
there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and •	
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably. •	
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to  
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The nature of the Group’s activities in the field of development work renders some 
internally generated intangible assets unable to meet the above criteria at present.
Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset and is shown within administrative expenses and is included at the following rate:

Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Careful judgement by the directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met. This is 
necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the time of 
recognition. Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date. 
– T rademarks
T rademarks represent the cost of registration and are carried at cost less amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
T rademarks   – 10 years straight line
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery   – 20% reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings   – 25% reducing balance
Motor vehicles   – 20% reducing balance
Office equipment   – 25% straight line
The residual value is reconsidered annually.
Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Those intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal discounted 
cash flow evaluation. All assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Cost is 
determined on the basis of purchase value on a first-in first-out basis.
Leased assets 
In accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17 the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee 
bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset. The related asset is recognised at the time of inception of 
the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or , if lower , the present value of the minimum lease payments plus incidental payments, if any, to be 
borne by the lessee. A corresponding amount is recognised as a finance leasing liability. The interest element of leasing payments represents a 
constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Pension costs
The group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group.  
The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
T axation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year .
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax 
credits to the group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts continued 23
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying 
deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance  
sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items 
that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. T ransactions 
in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into 
account in arriving at the operating result.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial assets are assigned 
to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which they were acquired. 
The designation of financial assets is re-evaluated at every reporting date at which a choice of classification or accounting treatment is available.
All financial assets are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are initially 
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. 
The group currently has the following financial assets:
– T rade receivables
T rade receivables are categorised as loans and receivables. T rade receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. T rade receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the 
income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in 
accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
– Available for sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for inclusion in any of 
the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets are the equity investments in Bin Hilal LLc and Oxobioplast Inc.
The equity investments in Bin Hilal LLc and Oxobioplast Inc. are measured at cost less any impairment charges, as their fair values cannot currently 
be estimated reliably. Impairment charges are recognised in profit or loss.
An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each balance sheet date.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the financial asset is transferred and 
that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset have been 
transferred or the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash 
flows to one or more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition if the group transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the group neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer 
control of that asset.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
The group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, other creditors, bank overdraft, convertible loan and other loans. These are classified as 
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities also include conversion rights and warrants which are embedded derivatives held at fair value through profit and loss – held for 
trading.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised at fair values net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are charged to the income 
statement, where applicable, on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent they are not settled in the period in which they arose. 24
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Where a financial liability contains embedded derivatives they are bifurcated into financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and financial 
liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss – held for trading by fair valuing the embedded derivative.
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit and loss are re-measured at each reporting date at fair value, with changes in fair value 
being recorded in the income statement. 
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Equity settled share based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 are recognised in the financial 
statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are 
rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of the instrument granted are determined using the Black-Scholes model. This fair value is 
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of new market vesting conditions. The fair value is charged to the income statement between  
the date of issue and the date the share options vest with a corresponding credit taken to shareholders’ funds.
Warrants granted to employees which relate to salary sacrifice arrangements are attributed a fair value by reference to the services provided. This 
fair value is charged to the income statement when the service is provided with a corresponding credit taken to shareholders’ funds.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
“Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares; •	
“Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the •	
share issue; and
“Other reserve” is a reserve established following the adoption of merger accounting. The company was entitled to merger relief offered by •	
Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 in respect of consideration received in excess of the nominal value of the equity shares issued in connection 
with the acquisition of Symphony Plastics Limited on 9 December 1999.
Standards and Interpretations not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been 
published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policy for the first period beginning after the 
effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s 
financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised 2009) (effective from 1 July 2009)
The standard is applicable for business combinations occurring in reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will be applied 
prospectively. The new standard introduces changes to the accounting requirements for business combinations, but still requires use of purchase 
method, and will have a significant effect on business combinations occurring in future reporting periods.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Revised 2009) (effective from 1 July 2009)
The revised standard introduces changes to the accounting requirements for the loss of control of a subsidiary and for changes in the Group’s interest 
in subsidiaries. These changes will be applied prospectively in accordance with the transitional provisions and so do not have an immediate effect on 
the Group’s financial statements.
Notes to the Annual Report and Accounts continued 25
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Annual Improvements 2009 (effective from 1 July 2009 and later)
The IASB has issued Improvements for International Financial Reporting Standards 2009. Most of these amendments become effective in annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 or 1 January 2010. The Group expects the amendments to IAS 17 Leases to be relevant to the Group’s 
accounting policies. Prior to the amendment IAS 17 generally required a lease of land to be classified as an operating lease. The amendment now 
requires that leases of land are classified as finance or operating applying the general principles of IAS 17 . The Group will need to reassess the 
classification of the land elements of its unexpired leases at 1 January 2010 on the basis of information existing at the inception of those leases. Any 
newly classified finance leases are recognised retrospectively. Preliminary assessments indicate that the effect on the Group’s financial statements 
will not be significant.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2013)
The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety by the end of 2010, with the replacement 
standard to be effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2013. IFRS 9 is the first part of Phase 1 of this project. The main phases are:
Phase 1: Classification and Measurement
Phase 2: Impairment methodology
Phase 3: Hedge accounting
In addition, a separate project is dealing with derecognition. Management have yet to assess the impact that this amendment is likely to have on the 
financial statements of the Group. However , they do not expect to implement the amendments until all chapters of the IAS 39 replacement have been 
published and they can comprehensively assess the impact of all changes.
3 Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. The directors review 
and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years. 
The group’s financial assets and liabilities are summarised as follows:
       2009 2008 
       £’000 £’000

Liquidity risk
The group seeks to manage financial risk, to ensure financial liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and 
profitably. Short-term flexibility is achieved through trade finance arrangements.
The maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2009 is summarised as follows:

Currency risk
The group operates in overseas markets and is subject to currency exposure on transactions undertaken during the year . The group hedges the 
transactions where possible by buying goods and selling them in the same currency. The group also has bank facilities available for hedging 
purposes.

Sensitivity shows the effect on equity and the income statement.
Credit risk
The group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value of financial assets at the balance sheet date, summarised as follows:
       2009 2008 
       £’000 £’000
Loans and receivables:
 Trade receivables       1,386 953
 Cash and cash equivalents       34 92
       1,420 1,045
The credit risk associated with the cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The 
principal credit risk arises therefore from trade receivables. The seven largest customer balances at the end of the year make up 75% of the above 
trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history, third party credit references and use 
of credit insurance. These limits are reviewed regularly.
The maturity of overdue debts is set out in Note 16. During the period no debts were written off.
Capital requirements
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are monitored regularly to ensure the group has sufficient liquidity and its exposure to interest rate risk is 
mitigated. Management consider the capital of the group comprises the share capital and interest bearing loans and borrowings. Management satisfy 
the Companies Act 2006 requirement to hold £50,000 issued and authorised share capital. The rule that 25% must be paid up is also satisfied, by 
reference to Note 18.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events 
and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those actions.
In preparing these accounts the following areas were considered to involve significant judgement:
– Recoverability of capitalised development cost
Judgements relating to capitalised development costs are detailed in Note 12.
– Going concern
Judgements relating to going concern are detailed in Note 2. 28
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
In preparing these accounts the following areas were considered to involve significant estimates:
– Bad debts
Provisions for bad debts are shown in Note 16. Where there is no provision then it is due to adequate credit insurance being in place, or cash has been 
received since the end of the year , or adequate information exists to support the recoverability of the debt.
– Recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgements relating to a deferred tax asset are detailed in Note 9a.
5 Segmental information
Management currently identifies the group’s three service lines as operating segments as further described in note 2. These operating segments are 
monitored and strategic decisions are made on the basis of adjusted segment operating results excluding one-off items such as employee settlement 
costs.
The segmental results for the year ended 31 December 2009 are as follows:

There are tax losses of approximately £12,300,000 (2008: £12,900,000).
Of these losses a deferred tax asset of only £46 1,000 has been recognised in this year’s accounts (2008: £719 ,000). The recognition of this asset is 
based on sensitised forecasts where Symphony Environmental Limited has started to generate profits as recorded in this year’s accounts.
10 Earnings per share and dividends
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year .
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed 
conversion of all dilutive options and warrants.
Reconciliations of the profit and weighted average numbers of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

The group relies on the continued development of its product range and in so doing is maintaining satisfactory goals in fulfilling its strategy (see 
Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review). After taking this into account together with the considerations of liquidity risk, see Note 3,  
the directors do not believe that an impairment provision is required.
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with Note 2. 
The significant judgements within the sensitivity analysis were sales forecasts and foreign exchange rates.

The group holds 30% of the ordinary share capital in Symphony Bin Hilal LLc, a company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates. The directors 
consider this an investment as they have no significant influence and have no management rights in the strategic, tactical or operational decisions 
made by Symphony Bin Hilal LLc. The value of the investment in the company is recognised at cost as the equity investment is unquoted and the value 
cannot be measured reliably. The group does not intend to dispose of the investment in the foreseeable future.
A value of £nil has been assigned to the shares held in Oxobioplast Inc. to which the company owns c.5% of that company’s issued common stock.
The directors cannot assign a fair value of Oxobioplast Inc. as the equity investment is unquoted and the value cannot be measured reliably.

The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their book values. There is a provision of £150,000  
for impairment of receivables (2008: £150,000). The maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date equates to the fair value of trade 
receivables. Further disclosures are set out in Note 3.
T rade receivables that are less than three months old are not considered impaired. As of 31 December 2009 trade receivables of £101,000 (2008: 
£64,000) were past due but not impaired. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

Directors
Directors’ interests in shares and share incentives are contained in the Remuneration Report on page 14.
Fair value of options granted
The fair values of options granted were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model that takes into account factors specific to the share 
incentive plans. The following principal assumptions were used in the valuation:
      2009  2008
Weighted average exercise price     £0.03  £0.03
Expected volatility     11.5%-117%  26%-113%
Expected life     4-8 years  4-10 years
Average risk-free rate     3.45%  4.9%
Expected dividends      0%  0%
The underlying expected volatility was determined by reference to historical data of the Group’s shares over a period of time since its flotation on AIM. 
No special features inherent to the options granted were incorporated into measurement of fair value.
In total, £13,000 of employee remuneration expense (all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions) has been included in 
profit or loss for 2009 (2008: £ 12,000) and credited to retained earnings.

On 19 March 2010, Symphony Plastics Limited entered into a new lease at 6 Elstree Gate, Elstree House, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, 
WD6 1JD. The registered office and head office for the company and group companies changed to this new address. The lease is for ten years, with a 
five year break provision. The net total rentals payable over the first five years total £452,000.
Since the year end the group has committed to leasehold improvement and equipment costs totalling £200,000.
On 22 January 2010 the company issued 250,000 options to each of the three non executive directors. Details are given in the remuneration report on 
page 14.
25 Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and •	
to provide an adequate return to shareholders •	
by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity plus its subordinated loan, less cash and cash equivalents as presented on 
the face of the statement of financial position.
The Group’s goal in capital management is to maintain a capital-to-overall financing ratio of 1: 1 to 1:3. 
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure, i.e. equity and financial liabilities. The Group manages the capital 
structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Notes to the Company balance sheet
26 Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP).
Fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery   – 20% reducing balance
Fixtures and fittings   – 25% reducing balance
Motor vehicles   – 20% reducing balance
Office equipment   – 25% straight line
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the 
company, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements of future 
obligations under the leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the consolidated profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire 
purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease 
term.
Pension costs
Company pensions are operated within the group pension scheme. The group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees. The 
assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group. The annual contributions payable in respect to the company are charged to the 
profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or 
events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exception: 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits 
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. T ransactions 
in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into 
account in arriving at the operating profit.
Investments
Investments are included at cost or fair value less amounts written off.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of the financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those financial 
instruments are classified as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs are calculated so as to 
produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classified as an equity 
instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity. 42

Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
26 Principal accounting policies continued
Equity settled share based payments
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2007 are recognised in the financial 
statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are 
rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values are determined by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This 
fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is charged to the profit and loss 
account between the date of issue and the date the share options vest with a corresponding credit taken to shareholders’ funds.
Warrants granted to employees which relate to salary sacrifice arrangements are attributed a fair value by reference to the services provided. This 
fair value is charged to the profit and loss account when the service is provided with a corresponding credit taken to shareholders’ funds by reference 
to Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) 44.

Company information
Symphony is also developing processes for the destruction of, and creation of value from, used tyres. It is the lead partner in a UK Government grant 
funded collaboration project.
Symphony Environmental Technologies plc is a British Public Company and head  
of a Group established in 1995, dedicated to Controlled-life Plastic. It has over  
50 Distributors around the world, and is present in more than 90 countries. 
Symphony has its own laboratories in England with the latest equipment,  
where it constantly tests, develops, and improves its products. 
Symphony is a member of the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association (www.biodeg.org), 
the Society for the Chemical Industry (UK) and the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM). Symphony holds an ISO 9001-2008 certificate for quality management, 
and is represented on the British Standards Institute.
Symphony’s Technical Department includes more than 30 years experience in the 
manufacture of plastic products. Symphony is therefore able to provide a first-class 
product, and after-sales service without parallel in the industry.
Symphony has developed a range of oxo-biodegradable products marketed  
as d
2
w
®
 Controlled-life Plastic with ever increasing markets and applications.
Company Profile
d
2
w
®
 Technology
Plastic is a very useful material which is indispensible for 
modern life, but the problem is that it can lie or float around 
for decades if it gets into the environment. Symphony has 
developed a low-cost insurance. It is a special formulation 
called d
2
w
®
 which is added to the plastic when it is being 
made. It breaks the molecular chains within the polymer, 
and makes plastic self-destruct in the presence of oxygen on 
land or water at the end of its service-life, but until then it has 
no effect on the product, which can be re-used many times.
d
2
w
®
 plastic can be made to biodegrade from as little as two 
months onwards, leaving no fragments nor “heavy metals,’ 
and without emitting methane, even when buried in landfill. 
It can be recycled with normal plastics (see http://www.
biodeg.org/position-papers/recycling/?domain=biodeg.org), 
or incinerated for energy-recovery. d
2
w
®
 is certified safe for 
food-contact and has been proved not to be eco-toxic.
When d
2
w
®
 plastics reach the fragmentation stage they  
are no longer plastic. They have a completely different 
molecular structure, and can be bioassimilated in the  
same way as a leaf.
d
2
w
®
 Controlled-life Plastic products are made from  
a by-product of oil which used to be wasted, so nobody  
is importing extra oil to make them. They can be made  
with the same machinery and workforce and the same 
polymers, as ordinary plastic so there is no need to disrupt 
the supply-chain and there is little or no on-cost and no  
loss of jobs. 
Not surprisingly they are now being used by major 
companies around the world, and last year Symphony  
sold enough d
2
w
®
 to make 8 billion plastic products. 
Symphony’s d
2
w
®
 additive formulation is so effective that it 
can be included at rates starting as low as 1% – resulting in 
considerable  savings in cost, transport, and storage. It is 
manufactured under licence from Symphony by carefully 
selected and audited companies around the world. “Some things
we want to keep forever, 
“We do not inherit the 
  earth from our ancestors,
  we borrow it from our children. ”

4.8 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
I am pleased to present my first Chief Executive’s review 
since my appointment in November 2013. It marks the end 
of a period of significant change and substantial progress 
for Centaur Media.
Less than 18 months ago, Centaur Media was the 
aggregate of more than 50 small businesses working 
independently from one another . As a result, although the 
breadth and depth of expertise was considerable, attention 
and investment were fragmented and core revenues  
were declining.
I am pleased to report that the business is now restructured, 
focused and ready for growth. With our change programme 
complete we have delivered improved results, and 
momentum is building in both revenue and margin.
Today we are a united business of content experts, 
delivering multi-platform content that focuses on 
key markets. I am very proud of what we’ve achieved 
in a relatively short space of time, but this is just the 
beginning. I am excited for the future of this company and 
I look forward to seeing just how much we can do and how 
far we can go. 
For 4 months of this reporting period, prior to my 
appointment, our Group Finance Director Mark Kerswell 
led the business as interim CEO. My thanks go to him for 
his steady hand on the tiller during this time.
As our year end has changed from 30 June to 31 
December, this Annual Report covers the statutory 
18 month reporting period to 31 December 2014. 
Commentary throughout this Annual Report reflects 
the performance in this reporting period and where 
considered beneficial, we have included additional 
unaudited information for the years ended 31 December 
2014 and 2013. 
As a result of the change in financial year end, and 
with our ambition to reduce the business’ seasonality, 
the Board is rebalancing the interim and final dividend 
payments on a more equal basis. The Board is 
recommending a final dividend for the period July to 
December 2014 of 1.3p per share, giving a total dividend 
for the reporting period of 3.85p. In the year ended 31 
December 2014, the transition to a re-balanced dividend 
results in a dividend of 3.0p, a 24% increase on the 2.425p 
dividend for the comparable period to 31 December 2013. 
Further detail is provided in the Financial Review.
PERFORMANCE REVIEW
8 9
With our change 
programme 
complete we  
have delivered  
improved results 
and momentum  
is building in  
both revenue  
and margin It is particularly pleasing that during a period of 
substantial change we have successfully launched new, 
innovative products and refreshed some of our existing 
iconic publications. I am delighted that the focus on our 
brands has been recognised through a number of industry 
awards, including several from the PPA.
These awards reflect the commitment and energy of each 
and every member of the Centaur Media team. The quality 
of this team is crucial to the future growth and success of 
the group and we have collectively responded well to the 
challenges and changes across the business over the last 
18 months. We want to become an employer of choice and 
we are committed to attracting and retaining the  
best talent. 
In November, we set out the key financial metrics against 
which we will measure the business’s performance; 
you will find these set out in more detail in the strategic 
report. We are now seeing growth in underlying revenues, 
with improvements in paid-for-content and live events 
more than compensating for declines in advertising 
revenues, and momentum is continuing to build. The 
group is increasingly well positioned for future growth. 
The restructure of the business, coupled with our clear 
vision for the group, has enabled the management team 
to prioritise and lead with focus. This process has led to 
procurement and efficiency savings in excess of £1 million, 
as well as more effective management of our capital 
expenditure investment.  These efficiencies have provided 
us with the capacity to make the necessary investments in 
data and training.
Revenues for the 18 months to 31 December 2014 were 
£105.6m. Adjusted operating profits for the same period 
were £11.7m, an adjusted operating margin of 11%. For 
the purposes of comparison only, revenues for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 of £72.8m compare to revenues 
of £74.4m in the previous twelve months. Adjusted for the 
disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014, underlying 
revenues in the year ended 31 December 2014 increased 
by 3%. Adjusted operating profits over the same period 
of £10.2m compared to £10.0m in 2013, representing 
an adjusted operating margin of 14% (year ended 31 
December 2013: 13%).
Underlying revenues in the period July to December 
2014 grew by 7% and momentum across the business 
is encouraging as we head into 2015. The structure and 
mix of the business has improved considerably; net debt 
has been reduced to £14.7m, which in part reflects the 
disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014, as well as an 
ongoing focus on cash flow across the business.
Centaur Media is now focused on four core segments: 
Marketing, Financial Services, Home Interest and the four 
portfolios aggregated into the Professional segment. 
Each portfolio is now supported by centralised expert 
teams, working across commercial, digital product 
development, marketing and research, production and 
live events. These disciplines are deployed centrally and 
strategically to add maximum value across the business.
This new market-led structure is a marked contrast to 
the previous format-based structure and enables Centaur 
Media to provide its customers with multi-platform, 
integrated content that utilises insight, live events and 
digital paid-for content as appropriate.
NATIONAL MEDIA AWARDS WON:
PPA Awards 2014: Event of the Year
PPA Awards 2014: Digital Innovation of the Year
PPA Digital Awards 2014: Development Team of the Year
PPA Digital Awards 2014: Innovation of the Year
PPA Connect Awards 2014: Launch of the Year
AEO Excellence Awards 2014: Innovation of the Year 
Across all our portfolios, there has been substantial progress 
for Centaur Media’s brands. Case studies on selected brands 
across each portfolio are included in the operating review. 
The headlines include a re-launch for Money Marketing, 
Marketing Week and Celebrity Intelligence, a new format 
for The Festival of Marketing, the launch of The Lawyer 
Research Service and the repositioning of the London 
Homebuilding Show. We are strengthening our brands and 
building clear competitor differentiation.
Alongside the focus on four core markets, the leadership 
team has developed four strategic priorities:
To be the most 
knowledgeable, connected 
and authoritative experts  
in our markets
To generate sustainable 
growth in profits and cash 
flow with high quality, 
recurring revenue streams 
and an efficient and scalable 
operating model
To create products and 
services that are both 
innovative and market-
leading, backed by strong 
digital and events expertise
To be a united team of 
entrepreneurial, multi-
skilled professionals.

REVENUE MIX TRENDS  
(Excluding Perfect Information) The investment in data will crucially provide greater insight 
into the commercial opportunities across the group in 2015 
and beyond. These initiatives will deliver further efficiency 
and scale benefits as the group continues to grow.
Alongside the operational initiatives completed in 
2014, the group completed two strategic transactions 
in June 2014. The resolution of the Econsultancy 
earn-out removed the final obstacle to an integrated 
Marketing portfolio. This portfolio is now fully focused on 
accelerating the pace of growth. The disposal of Perfect 
Information, a single format business with limited overlap 
with other parts of the business and limited potential  
for growth without significant investment, reduced 
leverage and provided capacity for further targeted 
investment elsewhere.
This Annual Report will be the last overseen by our 
Chairman Patrick Taylor. He has served this business 
tirelessly and diligently for 11 years. The business has 
undergone an extraordinary evolution in that time and we 
all thank him for his contribution and commitment. On a 
personal note, I am very grateful that he has given me the 
opportunity to lead Centaur Media.
The changes made over the 18 months to December 2014 
have been far-reaching but the business has responded 
exceptionally well. We end the period with a stronger 
balance sheet, a structure that is fit for purpose and 
a sharp focus on innovation and progress in our core 
markets. Our performance in the second half of 2014 has 
been particularly strong, and we are very encouraged by 
the outlook for 2015. 
The business feels reinvigorated and positive. We have 
achieved a lot - and we have only just begun.

STRATEGIC REPORT
STRATEGY
Centaur Media is a content business that predominantly 
offers professionals products and services that accelerate 
their marketing and business performance. Our core 
objective is to deliver sustainable growth in revenues, 
profits and cash flow, and in turn to increase shareholder 
value. To achieve this we have set out four strategic 
priorities. These are set out below alongside the initiatives 
we are taking to deliver these, the associated risks and the 
KPIs against which we measure progress internally.  See

PERFORMANCE REVIEW 
12 13 BUSINESS MODEL
The group’s activities are categorised across four market 
segments: Marketing, Financial Services, Professional and 
Home Interest. These activities are supported by expert 
teams across commercial, digital product development, 
marketing and research, production and live events. 
The group generates revenues from three primary revenue 
sources: paid-for content, live events and advertising.
 Paid-for content revenues include:
   Subscriptions: These are the fees that customers 
pay to receive access to the group’s information, 
through online access to various databases, regular 
delivery of soft copy research or hard copy magazines. 
Subscription revenue is recognised over the period of 
the subscription.
  Copy sales: These are generated primarily across 
the group’s Home Interest print titles, Homebuilding 
& Renovating, Real Homes and Period Living, and 
selectively across the group’s business magazines, 
including Creative Review and Marketing Week. This 
revenue stream includes the sale of market reports 
from the Platforum business and other one-off sales  
of products and services. Revenues are recognised in 
line with the publishing schedule for these products.
  Live events revenues are recognised when the event is 
held and are typically paid in advance of the event.  
These include:
  Exhibitor revenues: These represent space sold at 
our live events that enable our customers to raise 
awareness and sell their products and services. It is an 
ideal way for our customers to forge new relationships 
through face-to-face meetings and sell or showcase 
their products.
  Sponsorship revenues: Across all of our live events, 
we have partners that want to be associated with the 
event. Through their participation they can create, 
develop and increase brand awareness, furthering 
their credibility within a target audience to develop 
contacts and exposure for their business. 
  Attendee revenues: Our consumer focused  
exhibitions, The Festival of Marketing and our meetings 
and awards events all charge a fee to attendees. The 
group also generates revenues from sales of tables 
for companies and individuals to attend the various 
industry awards evenings the group organises, as well 
as the paid-for entries to these awards. 
   Training revenues: The group provides digital 
marketing training services to customers in the UK  
and overseas through the Econsultancy business. 
These services are delivered through public training 
courses and through the delivery of bespoke services 
to clients. Revenues are recognised when the training 
is delivered.
  Advertising revenues represent the fees that customers 
pay to place an advertisement in one or more of the 
group’s publications, either in print, online or mobile. 
There are products where advertising is the main driver 
and others where advertising is simply a supplemental 
earnings stream. This includes display, classified and 
recruitment advertising whatever the delivery platform. 
The group also classifies as advertising, revenues 
generated from sponsored content, content marketing, 
native advertising and other publication-based marketing 
solutions, whether print or digital. Revenue is recognised 
on publication.
The focus on our markets and audience enables us 
to build a deeper understanding of the commercial 
opportunities across each market. We know that our 
customers want flexible content that works seamlessly 
across multiple platforms.  By leveraging this market 
insight and an understanding of our customer 
requirements we are able to offer a higher value customer 
proposition. This is delivered in whatever format our 
clients want, whether that is in print, digital or as a live 
event. Each market portfolio has clear growth plans 
focused on new digital products, new revenues streams, 
multi-platform content and clear competitor differentials.
Supporting each of these markets, we have centralised 
expert teams across commercial, digital product 
development, marketing and research, production and live 
events. These teams provide the expertise and scale that 
allows us to support effectively and efficiently the delivery 
of commercial opportunities across each market. The 
creation of these expert teams also enables us to manage 
our cost base effectively and to prioritise investment 
across the business.
The commercial activities of the business, including 
the market-facing portfolios and the expert teams, are 
supported by group functions including finance, HR, 
property, legal, risk management and IT.
All costs across the business are tightly managed with a 
rigorous focus on margin and return on investment. We 
seek to maintain as flexible and scalable cost base as 
possible, outsourcing or consolidating shared activities 
where possible. All of our London activities are now 
consolidated within one building.
This structure creates scale opportunities that alongside 
underlying revenue growth enables good progression 
in adjusted operating margins.  It also creates the 
opportunity to effectively bolt-on acquisitions where these 
can accelerate revenue and margin growth. 
While our business remains primarily UK focused, we 
have a growing presence in North America and Asia, 
and we continue to explore opportunities across these 
markets. An experienced general manager to oversee our 
US businesses was appointed in February 2015 and will be 
based in our New York office.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
In November 2014, the group set out the following core 
financial metrics to measure our performance going 
forward. These are summarised below:
The key performance indicators are within the board’s 
expectations and the ongoing focus on these measures 
will support its successful strategy. These indicators are 
discussed in more detail in the Chief Executive’s Review

18 months to 31 December 2014
Revenues for the reporting period were £105.6m. Adjusted operating profits for the 
reporting period were £11.7m, with an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.1%. In the 
previous statutory reporting period for the year ended 30 June 2013, reported revenues 
were £72.0m. Adjusted operating profits for the same period were £10.0m with an 
adjusted operating profit margin of 13.9%. The reduction in adjusted operating profit 
margin across these two statutory periods reflects the inclusion in the reporting period 
of the July to December trading period, which has traditionally been seasonally weaker, 
in both 2013 and 2014. Reported operating margins have also been impacted by the 
disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014 and the cost savings achieved over the latter 
part of the reporting period.
Live events and paid-for content revenues contributed £70.5m (67%) to revenues in the 
reporting period compared to £46.5m (65%) in the previous statutory reporting period for 
the year ended 30 June 2013. Advertising revenues accounted for 32% of revenues in the 
reporting period compared to 35% in the previous statutory reporting period for the year 
ended 30 June 2013. These trends illustrate the ongoing shift in focus of our revenues to 
higher quality live events and paid-for content revenue streams.
Additional information (unaudited)
Revenues and adjusted operating profits for the year ended 31 December 2014  
were £72.8m (year ended 31 December 2013: £74.4m) and £10.2m (year ended 31 
December 2013: £10.0m) respectively. While our reported results for the year ended  
31 December 2014 are broadly in line with results reported in 2013, underlying trends  
across the business, when adjusted for the disposal of Perfect Information in June  
2014, demonstrate significant improvement and growing momentum over this  
12 month period.
Underlying revenues in the year ended 31 December 2014 grew by 3%, with revenues  
in the second half of the year growing by 7% compared to a modest decline in the  
first half. This return to growth reflects excellent growth across our paid-for content  
revenues, a return to growth across our live events revenues and declines in advertising 
revenues moderating. 
Paid-for content revenues (£20.6m, 28% of total revenues) grew on an underlying basis 
by 19%, live events revenues (£28.9m, 40% of total revenues) grew by 3% and advertising 
revenues (£22.4m, 31% of total revenues) declined by 9%. Other revenues primarily 
include rental income.
DIVISIONAL REVIEW
Across our four market segments, revenues are weighted towards the Marketing and 
Professional segments, with the Financial Services and Home Interest segments each 
accounting for approximately 15% of total group revenues. 
MARKETING
This segment includes all of the group’s brands that serve the marketing and creative 
professions, including Econsultancy, Marketing Week, Festival of Marketing, Celebrity 
Intelligence, Fashion Monitor, Design Week and Creative Review.
18 months to 31 December 2014
Revenues for the reporting period were £37.6m. Adjusted operating profits for the same 
period were £4.0m, with an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.6%. In the previous 
statutory reporting period for the year ended 30 June 2013, reported revenues were 
£23.8m. Adjusted operating profits for the same period were £2.6m with an adjusted 
operating profit margin of 10.9%.
Revenues for the reporting period reflect good growth across digital paid-for content revenue 
streams, including Econsultancy, Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion Monitor . Revenues for 
the reporting period include only one edition of Marketing Week Live, which ran in June 2014. 
Additional information (unaudited)
Revenues of £26.8m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (year ended 31 December 
2013: £25.0m) increased by 7%. Paid-for content and live events revenues contributed 
73% (year ended 31 December 2013: 70%) to this segment’s revenues. Operating profits 
increased significantly, from £2.4m to £3.9m, with operating margins increasing from 
9.6% to 14.6%. Operating margins reflect a higher depreciation and amortisation charge, 
which in turn, relative to other market segments, reflects the higher levels of investment 
in digital products across the marketing portfolio.
The settlement of the Econsultancy earn-out liability in June 2014 was intended to enable 
faster integration of Econsultancy and in turn to accelerate revenue growth across the 
marketing portfolio, the largest part of the group. The £0.5m of cost savings anticipated 
as a result of the settlement has been achieved and the outlook across this portfolio 
remains encouraging. Reported and underlying revenues grew by 16% in the second half 
of 2014 compared to flat revenues in the first half of the year. While these trends reflect 
the re-phasing of some events, including The Digitals awards event, the improving rate of 
growth reflects the benefit of consolidated commercial teams and strong growth across 
Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion Monitor’s digital paid-for content revenues.
The re-launch of Marketing Week in October 2014 was well received by the market and 
was timed to coincide with the Festival of Marketing. Marketing Week has been at the 
heart of the UK’s marketing community for 37 years providing relevant content to enable 
excellence in their field. This professional community has changed over time and the 
product needed to move in step with that. The re-launch incorporated a new identity and 
logo, new editorial content and a new responsive web platform enabling new desktop, 
tablet and mobile versions.

The Festival of Marketing was also well received, with delegates of 3,000 and revenues 
of £2m. This event incorporated The Digitals awards for the first time. The Festival of 
Marketing is an excellent example of how the group can leverage its brand strengths 
across the entire portfolio: Econsultancy, Design Week, Creative Review, Marketing 
Week, Celebrity Intelligence and Fashion Monitor were all represented at the event. 
Elsewhere across this portfolio, Fashion Monitor was launched in the US and a number 
of new events were successfully launched, including Programmatic Marketing. 
The outlook across the Marketing segment is exciting. The settlement of the 
Econsultancy earn-out has enabled faster integration across the portfolio, and we expect 
this portfolio’s live events and paid-for content revenues to continue to grow strongly.

Celebrity Intelligence
The award-winning Celebrity Intelligence was launched in October 2013, bringing 
together two existing products, Red Pages and Entertainment News, to create the 
definitive celebrity engagement tool. With professional and demographic details on 
more than 35,000 global celebrities, Celebrity Intelligence is relied upon by over 1,000 
corporate subscribers in both the UK and the US to match the best celebrity to their 
commercial needs. The revolutionary Buzz Index produces daily rankings based on 
a celebrity’s presence in the press and on social media. The dynamic new service is 
growing at around 30% per annum and was recognised at the prestigious PPA Awards  
in 2014, where it won Digital Innovation of the Year - Business Media.    
Marketing Week
The market-leading publishing brand Marketing Week went through the biggest 
transformation in its 37 year history in October 2014, simultaneously re-launching 
in print, online and mobile, with deeper, more analytical content and a dramatic, 
contemporary new look. Print and digital were designed to be completely in harmony, 
with the weekly magazine for the first time taking digital’s lead. The refresh has won 
critical and commercial acclaim, and in the first three months, 35,000 marketers from 
across the sector have signed up to the new proposition. Marketing Week is the first of 
Centaur Media’s publishing brands to use the new WordPress digital platform, which is 
being rolled out across the rest of the business during 2015. 
Festival of Marketing
The Festival of Marketing is the biggest gathering of senior marketing professionals in 
the UK. Launched in October 2013, the annual two-day event is held at Tobacco Dock 
in East London and brought together more than 3,000 marketers to learn, network, 
and celebrate the very best in their industry. Opened by the Olympic cyclist Sir Bradley 
Wiggins, the 2014 event featured top-level contributions from Coca-Cola, Google, IBM 
and Sony and also incorporated for the first time The Digitals industry awards event.  
The festival scooped two national media awards in 2014, winning Event of the Year – 
Business Media at the PPA Awards in July and Launch of the Year at the PPA Connect 
Awards in November.  PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Revenues for the reporting period were £17.6m. Adjusted operating profits for the same 
period were £2.6m, with an adjusted operating profit margin of 14.8%. In the previous 
statutory reporting period for the year ended 30 June 2013, reported revenues were 
£13.3m. Adjusted operating profits for the same period were £2.0m with an adjusted 
operating profit margin of 15.0%.
Revenues for the reporting period reflect good growth across Platforum offset by  
weaker revenues across the advertising funded titles including Money Marketing  
and Fund Strategy.
Additional information (unaudited)
Revenues of £12.0m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (year ended 31 December 
2013: £13.6m) declined by 12%. Paid-for content and live events revenues contributed 
57% (year ended 31 December 2013: 52%) to this segment’s revenues. This portfolio has 
the highest exposure to advertising revenues, which accounted for 42% of 2014 revenues 
(year ended 31 December 2013: 48%). The decline in advertising revenues reported in 
the first nine months of 2014 stabilised in the last quarter of 2014. Operating profits fell 
from £2.6m to £2.0m, with operating margins at 16.7% (year ended 31 December 2013: 
19.1%). The decline in operating profits reflects the operational gearing associated with 
the anticipated decline in revenues, mitigated by good cost control and the efficiencies 
related to the expert hub teams.
The performance across this segment has been materially impacted by more stringent 
regulatory requirements that are impacting audiences, sponsors and advertisers. To 
respond to these changes, the portfolio has new commercial and editorial leadership  
and has successfully re-launched Money Marketing. Platforum and Money Marketing  
are now well positioned to support demand for greater insight and analysis around key 
topics such as investment, retirement, mortgages, protection and technology.
The earn-out payment for Platforum was settled in August 2014 and this business,  
with a new management team in place, is now fully integrated into the Financial  
Services portfolio.
The outlook across the Financial Services segment is positive. With refreshed leadership 
the group is better able to leverage the strengths of each brand within the portfolio. 
Advertising revenues which have been volatile are showing signs of stability and we  
are confident that this segment can return to growth in due course. 
CASE STUDIES - FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO
Platforum
Platforum enables financial providers and fund managers to make critical decisions that 
will impact the highly competitive £400 billion online retail financial distribution markets. 
Platforum content is delivered in multiple formats, all created from proprietary data by 
industry experts. Following the completion of the earn-out in August 2014, Platforum has 
appointed an experienced, new management team and in February 2015 launched its 
first report outside of the core investment sector. The UK Retirement Funding Guide is 
being produced in response to the dramatic reforms to the pension market and is aimed 
at product providers and fund managers seeking to introduce solutions that provide 
flexibility, functionality and viability.   
Money Marketing
In response to the continuing, far-reaching changes in the personal finance sector 
following the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) in December 2012, the market leading 
weekly magazine Money Marketing underwent a dramatic transformation in April 
2014, changing from tabloid newspaper to A4 news magazine, even giving up the pink 
paper that had marked it out since its launch in 1985. And the effects have been equally 
dramatic. Money Marketing came top in independent industry readership research 
in June, the magazine was three times voted best B2B publication at the 2014 ABI, 
Santander and Headline Money awards, and crucially, the refresh helped reverse  
adverse print advertising trends with growth in the final quarter of 2014. PERFORMANCE REVIEW

statutory reporting period for the year ended 30 June 2013, reported revenues were 
£24.1m. Adjusted operating profits for the same period were £3.9m with an adjusted 
operating profit margin of 16.2%.
Revenues for the reporting period reflect the impact of:
 • Two editions of The Meetings Show and Employee Benefits Live.
 •  Only one edition of The Business Travel Show in February 2014 and of  
SubCon in June 2014.
 • The disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014.
The reduction in operating margins in the reporting period reflects the impact of the 
launch of The Meetings Show in July 2013 which made a loss in its first edition as 
expected, and the disposal of the high margin business, Perfect Information.
Additional information (unaudited)
Revenues of £22.9m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (year ended 31 December 
2013: £25.0m) declined by 8%. Adjusted for the sale of Perfect Information, underlying 
revenues increased by 6%. Paid-for content and live events revenues contributed 64% to 
this segment’s revenues (year ended 31 December 2013: 59%). Operating profits fell from 
£3.3m to £2.6m, with operating margins of 11.4% (year ended 31 December 2013: 13.2%).
Across each of the four subsidiary market portfolios:
 •  The Legal portfolio reported revenues of £7.0m in 2014, an 8% increase compared 
to 2013. Growth across this portfolio was driven through increases in digital paid-for 
content and live events revenues, offset by weaker advertising revenues.
 •  Revenues across the HR portfolio of £4.9m were 10% lower than in 2013, reflecting 
the legacy issues referred to in the interim report for the six months to June 2014. 
Revenues in the second half of 2014 were in line with the same period in 2013.
 •  The Engineering portfolio reported stable revenues and is expected to deliver 
modest revenue growth in 2015 as a result of the group restructuring initiatives 
completed in 2014.
 •  The New Markets portfolio included the Business Travel, Meetings and Aidex 
events. Perfect Information, which was sold in June 2014, contributed £2.6m to 
2014 revenues compared to £6m in 2013. The Meetings Show and The Business 
Travel Show in aggregate contributed £4.1m to 2014 revenues, an increase of 
40% compared to 2013. Aidex, a humanitarian event serving the international aid 
industry, delivered a modest profit contribution on 2014 revenues of £0.8m. The 
Aidex event, which was not a core part of the group’s business, was sold in February 
2015. Further details on this are set out in note 31 to the financial statements.
The outlook across this portfolio is encouraging. The legal market offers many 
opportunities to drive strong growth in paid-for content and events revenues. New 
Markets, which now focuses on Travel and Meetings, is well positioned to innovate  
and grow further. The reorganisation of the HR and Engineering portfolios, along  
with refreshed leadership, gives us confidence that these portfolios can return to  
growth in 2015. PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Homebuilding & Renovating
Britain’s leading home improvement title Homebuilding & Renovating has undergone 
a radical revamp, which was unveiled at the National Homebuilding Show in the 
Birmingham NEC at the end of March 2014. The best-selling monthly title has adopted 
new, more modern branding, which is used consistently across print, digital and events, 
together with a fresh, clean design. The new look is carried through digitally, with 
Homebuilding & Renovating introducing a fully responsive mobile site for the first time. 
And with the clear focus on “people with projects”, the online service provides lots of 
practical help and advice on managing complex building projects, as well as continuing 
to deliver inspiration in the form of interior and exterior design. 
London Homebuilding Show
The repositioning of London Homebuilding Show in November 2014 as a more focused, 
premium event was highly successful, with revenue and yields up and venue and 
marketing costs down, all translating into a fourfold increase in profit. The three-day 
exhibition is part of a series of homebuilding events – the largest in the UK – which 
provide market-leading interaction for those in the world of home improvement, 
renovation and self-build. A total of seven regional shows are held every year from 
Glasgow to Shepton Mallet, with flagship events in Birmingham as well as London. The 
shows attract more than 80,000 visitors and 1,600 exhibitors, with hundreds of seminars 
and masterclasses making these events the most dynamic source of content for this 
fast-growing industry. PERFORMANCE REVIEW

FINANCIAL REVIEW
REPORTING PERIOD AND YEAR-END CHANGE
This Annual Report covers the statutory reporting period which is the 18 months to 31 
December 2014 (“the reporting period”). The Annual Report for the previous statutory 
reporting period covered the financial year ended 30 June 2013. The change in the 
group’s financial year end from 30 June to 31 December was made to reflect the 
seasonality of the business and to align the group’s financial year-end with the majority 
of its peers. Commentary throughout this Annual Report reflects the performance in the 
reporting period and where considered beneficial, we have included additional unaudited 
information for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.
ADJUSTED AND STATUTORY RESULTS
In these results we refer to adjusted and statutory results. Adjusted results are prepared 
to provide a more comparable indication of the group’s underlying business performance. 
Adjusted results exclude adjusting items as set out in the Consolidated Income 
Statement and below.
The group’s activities are predominantly UK based and therefore currency movements 
have negligible impact on the group’s adjusted or statutory results.
The group is now reporting against an adjusted operating profit measure rather than 
adjusted EBITDA, as in the opinion of the Directors this better reflects the underlying 
profitability across each of the market portfolios and is consistent with the majority of 
Centaur Media’s peers.
Adjusted operating profit reconciles to profit before tax as follows:

SUMMARY
Commentary on revenues and adjusted operating profits for the 18 months to 31 December 
2014 (“the reporting period”), the previous statutory period for the year ended June 2013, 
and the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 are set out within the operating review. 
In the context of the significant change managed across the business over the reporting 
period, these are good results. Revenue mix and momentum is improving, and the group 
has the potential to accelerate margin growth. The cash flow performance in the reporting 
period has been strong, with 110% of adjusted operating profits converting into operating 
cash flow. Net debt at 31 December 2014 was £14.7m compared to £19.5m at 30 June 2013.

The group set out new financial KPI targets in November 2014. These KPI targets were 
underlying revenue growth, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted EPS and cash 
conversion.  We are making good progress against each, and further detail is set out in this 
Financial Review and in the Operating Review.
REVENUES
Revenues for the reporting period were £105.6m. In the previous statutory reporting 
period for the year ended 30 June 2013, reported revenues were £72.0m. Further 
information on the divisional revenue performance and the mix of revenues across paid-
for content, live events and advertising is included in the Operating Review.    
OPERATING PROFIT
Adjusted operating profits for the reporting period were £11.7m, with an adjusted 
operating profit margin of 11.1%. In the previous statutory reporting period for the year 
ended 30 June 2013, adjusted operating profits were £10.0m with an adjusted operating 
profit margin of 13.9%. Further information on the divisional adjusted operating profit 
performance is included in the Operating Review. 
Net adjusted operating expenses were £93.9m. In the previous statutory reporting 
period for the year ended 30 June 2013, net adjusted operating expenses were £62.0m. 
Employee related expenses in the reporting period were £40.5m (year ended 30 June 
2013: £26.4m), with the average number of permanent employees during the reporting 
period at 584 (year ended 30 June 2013: 593).  
Reported operating profits for the reporting period of £1.1m include a £3.4m charge for 
amortisation of intangible assets (year ended 30 June 2013: £2.3m), exceptional costs of 
£6.7m (year ended 30 June 2013: £3.2m) and share based payments of £0.5m (year ended 
30 June 2013: £0.2m). In the previous statutory reporting period for the year ended 30 
June 2013, the group reported an operating loss of £34.9m, which in addition to charges 
in respect of amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional costs and share based 
payments, included an impairment charge of £39.2m.
ADJUSTING ITEMS
Adjusting items in the reporting period generated a profit before tax of £1.2m (year ended 
30 June 2013: expense of £46.2m). 
The disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014 generated a profit of £14.7m (year 
ended 30 June 2013: £nil). 
Restructuring costs in the reporting period of £1.2m (year ended 30 June 2013: £3.1m) 
include redundancy costs of £0.9m (year ended 30 June 2013: £2.8m). 
Other adjusting items include the charge for unwinding the remaining discount on the 
Econsultancy.com Limited deferred contingent consideration provision of £2.9m (year 
ended 30 June 2013: £1.3m), IFRS 3 earn-out charges of £5.0m (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£4.3m), an adjustment to the deferred contingent consideration balance of £nil (year ended 
30 June 2013: credit of £5.4m), impairment of goodwill of £nil (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£39.2m), amortisation of acquired intangibles (not included in exceptional costs) of £3.4m 
(year ended 30 June 2013: £2.3m) and share based payments of £0.5m (year ended 30 June 
2013: £0.2m).  Other charges of £0.5m (year ended 30 June 2013: £1.2m) related to property 
consolidation, acquisition related costs and other exceptional items. 
Further analysis on these costs is included in the Basis of Preparation section of the 
Statement of Accounting Policies.
NET FINANCE COSTS
Adjusted net finance costs for the reporting period were £1.6m (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£1.2m). Net finance costs for the reporting period were £4.5m (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£2.5m). This includes the charge for unwinding the remaining discount on the Econsultancy.
com Limited deferred contingent consideration provision of £2.9m (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£1.3m), which was accelerated as part of its early settlement in June 2014.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Share-based payment costs in the reporting period were £0.5m (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£0.2m). Share based payments have been included as an adjusting item in 2014 with the 
comparatives being restated. This presentation is consistent with a number of our quoted small 
cap peers, and better reflects how the performance of the business is monitored by the Board. 
TAXATION
A tax charge of £0.8m (year ended 30 June 2013: £1.0m) has been recognised for the 
reporting period. The adjusted tax charge was £2.1m (year ended 30 June 2013: £2.2m) 
giving an effective tax rate (compared to adjusted profit before tax) of 21% (year ended 
30 June 2013: 25%). The fall in tax rate is due to the recent Finance Act which has meant 
that the company’s profits are taxed in the UK at a blended rate of 22% (year ended 30 
June 2013: 23.75%). Furthermore, as the Finance Act 2013 also included legislation to 
reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% from April 1 2015, and had 
been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the group’s deferred tax balances 
arising in the UK are recorded at 20%.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The group has reported adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the reporting period 
of 5.5p (year ended 30 June 2013: 4.6p). Fully diluted earnings per share for the reporting 
period were 7.2p (year ended 30 June 2013: loss per share of 27.3p). Full details of the 
earnings per share calculations can be found in note 7 to the Financial Statements. The 
treatment of share based payments as an adjusting item increases fully diluted earnings 
per share for the reporting period by 0.1p (year ended 30 June 2013: 0.1p).
DIVIDEND
An interim dividend of 0.85p per share was paid in respect of the period July to December 
2013 (July to December 2012: 0.825p). A second interim dividend of 1.7p per share was 
paid in respect of the period January to June 2014 (January to June 2013: 1.575p). A 
final dividend in respect of the period July to December 2014 of 1.3p per share (July 
to December 2013: 0.85p) is proposed by the Directors, giving a total dividend for the 
reporting period of 3.85p. In the previous statutory period for the year ended June 2013 
the dividend was 2.4p. The final dividend in respect of the reporting period is subject to 
shareholder approval at the annual general meeting and will be paid on 29 May 2015 to 
all ordinary shareholders on the register at close of business on 8 May 2015.
The group has historically generated the majority of its earnings in the period from 
January to June. With the seasonality of earnings expected to reduce in the medium 
term, the Board is re-balancing the dividend payments for the periods January to June 
and July to December on an approximately equal basis. The second interim dividend 
declared for the six-month period to 30 June 2014 of 1.7p (2013: 1.575p) reflected the 
established larger weighting. The final dividend for the period July to December 2014 
reflects the new weighting and is therefore higher than the previous smaller weighting 
for this period. The transition to more balanced dividend payments is therefore beneficial 
to shareholders.
Alongside the re-balancing of dividend payments, the group has adopted a progressive 
dividend strategy. Dividend cover in the reporting period was 1.4 times and it is intended 
to move above 2 times in the medium term. PERFORMANCE REVIEW

CASH FLOW
A summary of the group’s cash flow in the reporting period, in the year ended 30 June 
2013 and in the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 is set out below. The group 
generated free cash flow in the reporting period of £6.7m (year ended 30 June 2013: 
£2.2m). This improvement reflects the impact of growing subscriptions and events 
revenues together with an ongoing focus on working capital and capital expenditure. 
Movements in working capital have also benefited from a rent free period on the group’s 
London office space. Adjusted cash conversion, measuring the ratio of operating cash 
flow to adjusted operating profits, was 110% in the reporting period (year ended 30 June 
2013: 96%).

Capital expenditure in the reporting period was £6.5m. The cash impact of exceptional 
items included payments related to redundancy costs and vacant property provisions.
Acquisitions net of disposals generated a cash inflow of £3.9m in the reporting period 
(year ended 30 June 2013: cash outflow of £11.6m). This reflects the £23.2m net proceeds 
in respect of the disposal of Perfect Information offset by the £12.5m earn-out settlement 
for Econsultancy, and earn-out payments in respect of FEM and IPL. 
Dividend payments in the reporting period were £5.8m. 
NET DEBT
Net debt at 31 December 2014 was £14.7m, £4.8m lower than the £19.5m reported as at 
30 June 2013.
FINANCING AND BANK COVENANTS
In 2012, the group agreed a four year £40.0m revolving credit facility, provided by RBS and 
Barclays. Following the disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014, the facility size was 
reduced to £25.0m. This facility runs to 31 March 2016. The principal financial covenants 
under the facility are: maximum net debt to EBITDA of 2.25 times, reducing to 2.0 times 
with effect from June 2015, and interest cover of at least 5 times. All covenants under 
the facility at 31 December 2014 and throughout the reporting period have been met. The 
group intends to refinance these facilities prior to the release of its interim results for the 
six month period to 30 June 2015.

The reduction in goodwill and other intangible assets between 30 June 2013 and 31 
December 2014 of £12.8m comprises £8.9m and £2.0m of goodwill and intangibles 
respectively, disposed of on the sale of Perfect Information plus the normal amortisation 
charge for other intangible assets. There was no impairment of goodwill in the reporting 
period (year ended 30 June 2013: £39.2m). The other significant movement in the 
reporting period is an £11.7m reduction in the deferred consideration payable following 
the settlements of Econsultancy.com Limited (£12.5m in June 2014), Platforum (£4.2m in 
August 2014) and FEM (£2.9m in September 2013). Further details are included in note 19 
to the financial statements.
The reduction in deferred income of £2.2m between 31 December 2014 and 31 December 
2013 principally reflects the disposal of Perfect Information. Underlying deferred 
revenues, adjusted for this disposal were broadly flat and reflect the re-phasing of a 
number of events that ran in January to June in 2014 into the second half of the financial 
year in 2015. This is consistent with the expected reduction in seasonality of revenues 
and earnings in the medium term. PERFORMANCE REVIEW

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
Recognising the change in the year end from 30 June to 31 December, we have 
considered it beneficial to include additional information in respect of the years  
ended 31 December 2014 and 2013. Further commentary is set out below.
Revenue and adjusted operating profit
Revenues and adjusted operating profits for the year ended 31 December 2014  
were £72.8m (year ended 31 December 2013: £74.4m) and £10.2m (year ended  
31 December 2013: £10.0m) respectively. While our reported results for the year  
ended 31 December 2014 are broadly in line with results reported in 2013, underlying 
trends across the business, when adjusted for the disposal of Perfect Information in  
June 2014, demonstrate significant improvement and growing momentum over this 
12-month period.
Adjusting items
Adjusting items before tax in the year ended 31 December 2014 totalled a credit of £5.0m 
(year ended 31 December 2013: expense of £44.5m). In the year ended 31 December 
2014, a non-core business, Perfect Information, was disposed of generating a profit of 
£14.7m and in the year ended 31 December 2013 there was an impairment of goodwill 
charge of £39.2m.
Net finance costs
Adjusted finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 were £1.0m (year ended 
31 December 2013: £1.2m). The reduction in finance costs reflects the reduction in net 
debt following the disposal of Perfect Information and the settlement of the Econsultancy 
earn-out. Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 of £3.5m (year ended 
31 December 2013: £2.3m) include a charge of £2.5m (year ended 31 December 2013: 
£1.2m) for unwinding the remaining discount on the Econsultancy.com Limited deferred 
contingent consideration provision which was accelerated as part of its early settlement 
in June 2014.
Share based payments
Share-based payments in the year ended 31 December 2014 increased to £0.4m  
(year ended 31 December 2013: £0.1m) 
Tax
A tax charge of £1.0m has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2014 (year 
ended 31 December 2013: £1.2m). The adjusted tax charge was £1.9m (year ended 31 
December 2013: £1.9m) giving an effective tax rate (compared to adjusted profit before 
tax) of 21% (year ended 31 December 2013: 22%)
Adjusted earnings per share
Fully diluted adjusted earnings per share in the year ended 31 December 2014 were 5.0p 
(year ended 31 December 2013: 4.7p), an increase of 6%. The treatment of share based 
payments as an adjusting item increases fully diluted earnings per share in 2014 by 0.1p 
(year ended 31 December 2013: nil)
Cash flow
The group generated free cash flow in the year ended 31 December 2014 of £9.2m (year 
ended 31 December 2013: £3.7m). This improvement reflects the impact of growing 
subscriptions and events revenues together with an ongoing focus on working capital 
and controlled capital expenditure. Adjusted cash conversion, measuring the ratio of 
operating cash flow to adjusted operating profits, was 121% (year ended 31 December 
2013: 99%)
Dividend
A second interim dividend of 1.7p per share was paid in respect of the period January to 
June 2014 (January to June 2013: 1.575p). A final dividend in respect of the period July 
to December 2014 of 1.3p per share (July to December 2013: 0.85p) is proposed by the 
Directors, giving a total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 3.0p (2013: 
2.425p), an increase of 24%.
The second interim dividend declared for the six-month period to 30 June 2014 of 1.7p 
(2013: 1.575p) reflected the established larger weighting. The final dividend for the 
period July to December 2014 reflects the new weighting and is therefore higher than 
the previous smaller weighting for this period. The transition to more balanced dividend 
payments is therefore beneficial to shareholders. Dividend cover in the year to 31 
December 2014 was 1.7 times (year ended 31 December 2013: 1.9 times)
CONCLUSION
The quality of the group’s revenues and profits continues to improve, with live events and 
paid-for content revenues accounting for 67% of total revenues in the reporting period. 
These revenues are visible, recurring and generate strong upfront cash-flows. 
The reduction in net debt to the £14.7m reported at 31 December 2014 reflects the 
ongoing discipline around capital expenditure and the management of working capital. 
It also reflects the impact of the sale of Perfect Information and the settlement of the 
Econsultancy earn-out in June 2014. 
The operational changes across the business give us a platform which is efficient and 
scalable. With underlying revenues growing, I am encouraged by the opportunity to 
progressively increase adjusted operating margins.

PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the group and the mitigating actions taken in 
relation to those risks include the following:
Trends in print advertising and direct sales of print products mean that revenues 
from these sources continue to shrink and are not replaced like-for-like with online 
or digital products. The non-print media sector has high levels of competition from a 
wider group and low barriers to entry. This leads to different pressures on audience 
and customer retention as well as pricing.
The strategy of identifying the type of content our audiences want and how they want to 
consume the content means that we are not simply putting print products online to try to 
replace diminishing print revenues for traditional brands. We launched more than 20 new 
products in 2014 and re-launched some of our traditional publications with the specific 
aim of meeting current and future demand from audience and advertisers. Our recently 
appointed Commercial Director has experience in new areas of the market, consistent 
with our policy to hire people with these experiences and skills.
High levels of attrition amongst staff and loss of key staff lead to recruitment and 
training costs, loss of productivity, potential loss of clients and potential inability to 
deliver projects.
All employees of the group have regular performance reviews at which personal 
and career development opportunities are discussed. All employees have access to 
training, share schemes and other benefits as well as incentive schemes. The group 
has conducted a staff engagement and satisfaction survey in 2014 and will repeat the 
survey in 2015 to ensure progress in this area is made and measured. Addressing levels 
of attrition is a KPI for managers’ performance targets in 2015. During 2014, we have 
undertaken a full job evaluation exercise and benchmarked remuneration against the 
external media market place to inform managers on setting appropriate remuneration 
across the group to ensure we remain competitive within the market.
It is a focus of Portfolio Directors to ensure that client relationships are maintained as 
a team rather than by an individual, where possible. In addition, most senior employees 
enter into certain restrictive covenants upon starting employment with the group.
Delays or inefficiencies in implementation of our IT infrastructure and system 
upgrades leads to issues with management of client relationships, exposes us to risk 
of systems failure and impedes our ability to use data to which we should have access 
to drive sales and assess performance.
The group is engaged in several significant IT system upgrades due to be completed 
during 2015. The efficient and timely implementation of a new CRM and finance system, 
as well as cleansing and upgrading our databases, are key to delivery of the group’s 
results. We have engaged a new IT Director and are investing in new roles in these areas. 
We have robust contracts with the consultants who are supporting implementation and 
are using internal teams to resource implementation where possible to reduce the risk  
of relying on third parties.
Fraudulent or accidental breach of our security,  insufficient security or ineffective 
operation  of IT and data management systems leads to loss of confidential 
information, breach of data protection requirements, damage to our reputation or 
direct financial impact.
The central group IT support function monitors and assists IT systems, including data 
management. Appropriate IT security is undertaken for all key processes to keep the IT 
environment safe. Websites are hosted by specialist third-party providers who provide 
warranties relating to security standards. External access to data is protected and 
staff are instructed to minimise access to data and the sending of data lists, which are 
password protected or encrypted where appropriate. The group has a disaster recovery 
plan which includes its IT systems and there is regular back-up of data, which is stored 
off-site. A review of internal processes for accessing bank accounts remotely was 
undertaken during 2014.
The group runs events that gather large numbers of people in single venues and 
locations, often in large cities in the UK and elsewhere. This results in operational 
health and safety risks including fire safety, food hygiene, crowd control, security 
and failure of equipment. As the group operates events in locations hired from third 
parties including hotels as well as venue operators it is generally not in control of 
safety policies for the locations and depends upon the third party venue operator to 
have adequate safety policies, processes and equipment in place and to comply with 
Health and Safety regulations. If a serious physical incident occurred at an event, 
physical injury, death and other significant damage could occur .
Events are the responsibility of a specific team within the group who have experience and 
training in health and safety risks and responses. The group’s own employees are always 
in attendance at our events. Wherever possible we ensure that contracts provide for 
liability to remain with venue operators who are best placed to manage the risks and we 
maintain insurance to cover our public liability.
The group’s products could be vulnerable to replication by competitors in the UK  
or other markets.
The group has invested in creating an expert hub, entirely focused on digital product 
development. The business is led by experienced digital product experts and adequately 
resourced in terms of product expertise and personnel. The product pipeline is planned 
up to 12 months ahead, and progress against this schedule is reviewed fortnightly to take 
into account changes in customer requirements and business priorities. 
Changes to regulations and legal requirements restrict or burden the  
group’s activities.
Legal and regulatory matters are dealt with by our legally qualified Company Secretary 
appointed in 2014 or outsourced to our panel of respected legal firms. Our Company 
Secretary, supported by our lawyers and internal experts in employment and health and 
safety matters, is tasked with updating and advising the Board on changes to law and 
regulation that may affect the group’s interests PERFORMANCE REVIEW

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Centaur Media is committed to developing a culture of environmental awareness and 
social responsibility and we seek where appropriate to incorporate environmentally and 
socially responsible practices into the way we deliver services and products and the way 
we procure goods and services from third parties.
ENVIRONMENT
Operating in the media sector, our impact on the environment is less significant than 
that of companies operating in many other sectors. As our products are increasingly 
delivered digitally the use of consumable items such as paper and plastic is reducing 
over time. The move of all our London-based employees to a single location in Wells 
Street has meant that the group has been able to take advantage of consolidating 
building-related environmental impacts and benefitting from group sharing of items 
such as photocopiers. Centaur Media actively seeks to minimise adverse environmental 
impacts and to promote good environmental practices wherever possible. We do not have 
a company car policy or provide parking at our London office, but parking for bicycles is 
provided.  Some of our other initiatives have included:
 •  adopting a policy of turning off equipment at the end of the day rather than leaving it 
on standby;
 • use of energy-efficient light bulbs where appropriate; 
 • installation of motion sensors in offices to control lighting;
 •  analysing and adjusting the timing of boilers and chillers for the office air 
conditioning to increase energy efficiency;
 •  buying paper that is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) accredited which means that 
the paper has been sourced in an environmentally-friendly, socially responsible and 
economically viable manner;
 •  active engagement in the recycling of cans, tins, plastic, glass, cardboard and paper 
with a monthly report showing the percentage of waste collected that was recycled; 
 • recycling of printer cartridges where possible;
 •  increasing the use of aqueous inks, which limit the release of volatile  
organic compounds; 
 • increasingly validating the environmental credentials of suppliers (ISO14001); 
 • use of eco-friendly taxis and courier vehicles that are less than 3 years old; 
 • use of cyclist couriers where possible;
 • provision of bicycle storage and cycle to work scheme; and
 • encouraging staff to use public transport by provision of season ticket loans.
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
The group supports local communities and charitable organisations through direct 
fundraising, donation and pro-bono work. During the reporting period, our staff raised 
£13,000 for 2014’s chosen charity, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and the group 
donated a further £10,000 through a matching commitment. £5,452 was also donated 
to MacMillan nurses in the reporting period. We have used our events to raise money 
from third parties including requesting donations in return for entry for awards and 
taking collections at the event. A total of £63,500 of charitable donations were made in 
this way during the year ended 31 December 2014 for charities including the Children’s 
Trust, Cystic Fibrosis Trust, UK SEPSIS Trust, Refuge and Great Ormond Street Hospital. 
Every year, the group offers each employee a paid day off to spend volunteering for the 
non-for-profit cause or charity of their choice. We offer internship and work experience 
opportunities for people from a variety of backgrounds. The group is in the FTSE4Good 
Index, an independent body which measures the performance of all FTSE companies 
against a number of stringent social and environmental criteria.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are committed to the safety of our staff. Due to the nature of the business, risk of 
work-based accidents is relatively low but the group takes its responsibilities for the 
health and safety of its employees seriously. Our facilities manager is responsible for 
maintaining a safe environment for employees and an Accident Book is available to all 
staff in Reception. Where work-related activities take place which have a higher risk 
attached – such as travel, marketing events and outdoor activities – additional planning 
is undertaken which includes a risk assessment and mitigation plan.
EMISSIONS
During 2014, we started the process of measuring our carbon footprint by monitoring 
our Energy Usage and we are pleased to confirm that we are compliant with the new EU 
Energy Efficiency Directive ‘Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme’ (ESOS).  
The greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions from our operations in the reporting period are 
set out below:

DIVERSITY 
Centaur Media is committed to recruiting and promoting the most talented people from 
the widest pool and providing equal opportunities for all employees and prospective 
employees.  To support this aim, the group has an Equal Opportunities policy which 
covers recruitment and selection, promotion, training and development and standard 
contract terms for all staff. Further information is included within the Directors’ Report.

CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
Dear Shareholder,
This is my final review as Chairman of Centaur Media.  I joined the Board in 2004 and 
in the last eleven years I have witnessed remarkable progress: the group floated on the 
stock market and has evolved from a portfolio of publishing brands to the multi-format 
content and media company that it is today, still with multiple market-leading brands.
In the tradition of an incumbent passing on some wise words to his successor, here 
are mine: in this industry, never stop changing. The media industry has transformed in 
ways that even the most foresighted of us could not have imagined a decade ago. I am 
delighted that in the last 18 months Centaur Media has been transforming. Under the 
leadership of Andria Vidler, the business has been re-energised and re-focused, and 
we are already seeing the results. From the orientation of the business around market 
portfolios to the creation of dedicated delivery teams we are beginning to deliver on 
our potential in this new media world. We are closer than we have ever been to our 
customers and to our audience.
My thanks go to Andria, her leadership team and everybody at Centaur Media who have 
worked so hard to re-launch Centaur Media’s business. We have seen the results in the 
team, and we are starting to see the results in the numbers too.
Reporting Period
This Annual Report covers the statutory reporting period which is the 18 months to 31 
December 2014 (“the reporting period”). The Annual Report for the previous statutory 
reporting period covered the financial year ended 30 June 2013. The change in the 
group’s financial year end from 30 June to 31 December was made to reflect the 
seasonality of the business and to align the group’s financial year-end with the majority 
of its peers. Commentary throughout this Annual Report reflects the performance in the 
reporting period and where considered beneficial, we have included additional unaudited 
information for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.
Governance
In this governance section of the Annual Report we detail Centaur Media’s commitment 
to operating ethically and in line with the very best corporate governance practices 
and explain how we achieve this as well as giving details of the group’s approach to 
remuneration. Accountability, integrity and visibility are key operating tenets for any 
modern business and at Centaur Media we have established practices to ensure that 
the group is run in such a way. The Board is responsible for overseeing the strategic 
development of the group, setting its vision and values, identifying and assessing risks, 
ensuring the health and safety of our people and working to alleviate any negative 
environmental or social impact arising from our operations. In addition, the Board reviews 
the performance of Executive Directors in realising our vision and values, whilst delivering 
results that represent the best possible outcome for shareholders. 
Changes to the Board
Throughout the reporting period, the Board has comprised six members; at the 
beginning of the period this included a single Executive Director, Mark Kerswell,  
who acted as interim Chief Executive as well as Group Finance Director prior to  
Andria’s appointment in November 2013. I personally thank Mark for taking on  
these responsibilities while we recruited a permanent Chief Executive.
In November 2013 Colin Morrison stepped down from the Board as Non-Executive 
Director and Andria Vidler joined as Chief Executive. At the same time, Chris 
Satterthwaite took over the role of Chairman of the Nomination Committee from  
me, and Rebecca Miskin became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
These changes to the Board reflect the group’s commitment to putting in place the right 
balance of skills and experience to support Centaur Media’s future. With the quality of 
people that we have on the Board and across the senior management team, all working 
together to deliver against a robust strategy, I am certain progress from here will  
be substantial.
I am proud to leave this business in better shape than I have known it for many years. I 
am greatly encouraged by the quality of the management team Andria has established, 
by their unity of purpose and by the excitement they show for the opportunity ahead of 
them. With Andria’s leadership, I am confident that Centaur Media is in good hands; that 
the group’s customers will always be front of mind; and that a platform for real growth in 
the business has now been created.

QUALIFYING THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY PROVISIONS
By virtue of article 217 of the Articles of Association of the Company, a qualifying 
indemnity provision (within the meaning given by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) 
is in force at the date of this report in respect of each Director of the Company and was in 
force throughout the reporting period. 
The company has purchased appropriate insurance in respect of legal actions against 
Directors and officers.
PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
It is the group’s policy to agree credit arrangements with suppliers as part of the  
general terms of supply. Payment is then made in accordance with these terms provided 
the goods and services have been delivered in accordance with the agreed terms and 
conditions. The number and diversity of supply relationships means the group pursues 
no formal code or policy beyond this. Trade creditors of the group at 31 December 2014 
were equivalent to 6 (30 June 2013: 17) days’ purchases. The company had no trade 
payables at 31 December 2014 or 30 June 2013.  GOVERNANCE

It is the group’s policy to give full consideration to suitable applications for employment 
by disabled persons.  Opportunities also exist for employees of the group who become 
disabled to continue in their employment or to be trained for other positions in the group.
The group actively encourages employee involvement at all levels, both through monthly 
employee briefings and by direct access to managers and the Operating Board. In 
addition, the share incentive plan as described in note 22 encourages employees’ 
participation in the group’s performance.
All employees are regularly briefed on the group’s performance and new initiatives 
through our regular all-staff newsletter from the Chief Executive, monthly town hall 
meetings and management cascade communication. 
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
The group’s bank facility agreement, referred to in note 26 to the financial statements, 
is a significant agreement that is terminable on a change of control of the company. In 
addition awards under certain of the long-term incentive plans, details of which are set 
out in note 22, will vest or may be exchanged for awards of a purchaser’s shares, upon a 
change of control of the company.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Following the implementation of legislation on conflict of interest, reflected in the 
changes to the company’s Articles of Association in 2008, procedures are in place to deal 
with such conflicts and they have operated effectively.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A statement in relation to the use of financial instruments by the group is shown in note 
26 to the financial statements.
INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER THE LISTING RULES
In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules (LR 9.8.4C), the 
information to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts,  where applicable, under 
LR 9.8.4, is set out in this Directors’ report, with the exception of details of transactions 
with controlling shareholders which are set out on page 131 (note 21 to the accounts). 
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have carefully assessed the company’s ability to continue trading and 
have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of this report and for the 
foreseeable future. 
Net debt at 31 December 2014 amounted to £14.7m (30 June 2013: £19.5m). In 2012, the 
group agreed a four-year £40.0m revolving credit facility, provided by RBS and Barclays. 
Following the disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014, the facility size was reduced 
to £25.0m and the term of the facility was extended to 31 March 2016. The continuing 
strength of the group’s cash generation is reflected in the 110% conversion of adjusted 
operating profits into operating cash flow during the reporting period.
The group has net current liabilities, which arise normally from its high levels of  
deferred income. An assessment of cash flows for at least the next 12 months has 
indicated an expected level of cash generation which would be sufficient to allow the 
group to fully satisfy its working capital requirements, to cover all principal areas of 
expenditure including maintenance capital expenditure and taxation during this period 
and to meet interest payments, as they fall due, and the financial covenants under the 
revolving credit facility. GOVERNANCE

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and supports the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2012). The Board sets out below its report 
on how the group has applied the principles of, and complied with, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the reporting period.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The company has applied the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
throughout the reporting period. The Board is committed to maintaining a structure 
which establishes a sound corporate governance framework on behalf of the company’s 
shareholders. Throughout the reporting period, the group has complied with all the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
THE BOARD
During the first part of the reporting period (from July 2013 to 13 November 2013 when Colin 
Morrison did not offer himself for re-election at the AGM) the Board comprised one Executive 
Director (Group Finance Director and interim Chief Executive) and five Non-Executive 
Directors. As at 31 December 2014 the Board had four Non-Executive Directors and two 
Executive Directors (Chief Executive and Group Finance Director). Biographies for each 
currently serving director are shown on page 44. The Board endeavours to maintain diversity 
in its composition with respect to gender, skills, knowledge and length of service in order 
to ensure the balanced and effective running of the company. The Chairman of the Board is 
Patrick Taylor, an independent Non-Executive Director, who leads the Board and ensures that 
both Executive and Non-Executive Directors make available sufficient time to carry out their 
duties in an appropriate manner, that all directors receive sufficient financial and operational 
information and that there is proper debate at Board meetings. The Board is responsible for 
the leadership of the company and the group, and in discharging that responsibility it makes 
decisions objectively and in the best interests of the group. The Board sets the vision, values 
and standards for the group. The balance of the Board, together with the advice sought from 
the Operating Board members and the company’s external advisors, ensures that no one 
individual has unfettered powers of decision. The Board delegates day-to-day responsibility 
for the running of the company to the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman is responsible for the effective performance of the Board through a schedule 
of matters reserved for approval by the Board (comprising issues considered most significant 
to the group in terms of financial impact and risk) and control of the Board agenda. The 
Chairman conducts Board and shareholder meetings and ensures that all directors are 
properly briefed. The Chief Executive, supported by the Group Finance Director and Operating 
Board, is responsible to the Board for running the business and implementing strategy. The 
Board reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and the group against agreed 
budgets and against the group’s objectives, strategy and values.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Chris Satterthwaite who is also the 
Chairman of the Nominations Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. The 
Company Secretary is Grainne Brankin, who is also General Counsel. The Company 
Secretary assists the Chairman in ensuring there is efficient communication between all 
directors, the committees and senior management, as well as professional development for  
directors. Independent advisors including lawyers, remuneration specialists and external 
auditors are available to advise the Non-Executive Directors at the company’s expense. 
All the Non-Executive Directors consider themselves to be independent. Committee 
meetings are held independently of Board meetings and invitations to attend are extended 
by the Committee Chairman to other directors, the group’s advisors and management as 
appropriate. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee  
and the Remuneration Committee, including their roles and the authority delegated to them 
by the Board, are available on request from the Company Secretary and will be available at 
the AGM.

The number of full Board Meetings in the table includes meetings held by telephone 
on short notice for a specific purpose. If a director is unable to attend a meeting they 
are provided with the same level of information as the other directors in advance of the 
meeting and given the opportunity to express their views, which will then be shared at  
the meeting. 
In addition to the key items identified for discussion by the Committees above, the Board 
discussed the following matters at the Board meetings during the reporting period:
 • Review of financial performance against budget and prior year;
 • Review of group strategy and objectives for the Executive Directors;
 • Review and approval of budgets;
 • Review of group key performance indicators;
 • Review of acquisition targets and strategic disposals;
 • Approval of financial reports and communication to shareholders and investors; and
 •  Approval of the group’s internal control policy, including an assessment of the risk 
and corporate governance environment.
BOARD ASSESSMENT AND DIRECTORS’ PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
The Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
committees and individual directors. Individual evaluation aims to show whether each 
director continues to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the 
role (including commitment of time for Board and committee meetings and other 
duties). Evaluations are undertaken annually by self-assessment and the Chairman’s 
performance is also evaluated by the other Non-Executive Directors at a separate 
meeting for this purpose each year. In addition the Chief Executive is subject to an annual 
performance review with the Chairman. New directors receive an induction programme 
and all the directors are encouraged to undertake continuous professional development 
programmes as appropriate. The group offered training presentations in relation to 
directors’ duties to the Board during 2014 and maintains insurance cover in respect of 
legal action against its directors.
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
The Board delegates the day-to-day running of the company to the Executive 
Directors, who in turn share the operational running of the group with the Operating 
Board. Throughout the reporting period, the Operating Board was the primary body 
implementing operational management across the group. The role of the Operating 
Board is to review:
 • Financial performance and budget (at operational level);
 • Human Capital management; 
 •  Operational efficiency and developments (including group IT, procurement  
and facilities);
 • Product development; 
 • Market development;
 • Business planning;
 • Acquisition needs;
 • Internal and external communications;
 •Business transformation and change management.
The biographies of the members of the Operating Board are set out on page 44. 
Supporting the Operating Board are the portfolio directors who are responsible for 
specific market segments and the expert leaders who lead the teams delivering 
functional expertise. The focus on our markets and audience enables us to build 
a deeper understanding of the commercial opportunities across each market. We 
know that our customers want flexible content that works seamlessly across multiple 
platforms.  By leveraging this market insight and an understanding of our customer 
requirements we are able to offer a higher value customer proposition. The expert  
teams provide the expertise and scale that allows us to effectively and efficiently  
support the delivery of commercial opportunities across each market. The creation  
of these expert teams also enables us to effectively manage our cost base and to 
prioritise investment across the business.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The company encourages meaningful dialogue with all shareholders. Shareholder 
communication centres primarily on the publication of annual reports, periodic press 
releases, investor presentations and trading updates. The Chairman and Executive 
Directors are available for discussions with shareholders throughout the year and 
particularly at the time of results announcements. The Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director is also available should any shareholder wish to draw any matters 
to his attention. The Directors are available for comment throughout the year and at all 
General Meetings of the company. Centaur Media values the views of its shareholders 
and recognises their interest in the company’s strategy and performance, Board 
membership and quality of management. The group therefore has an active programme 
to meet and make presentations to its current and potential shareholders to discuss its 
objectives. The AGM is used to communicate with investors and they are encouraged to 
attend the AGM and to participate in proceedings formally or sharing their views with 
Board members informally after the meeting. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees are available to answer questions. Separate resolutions 
are proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper consideration and there is  GOVERNANCE
56 57
a resolution to approve the annual report and accounts. The company counts all proxy 
votes and indicates the level of proxies lodged on each resolution, after it has been voted 
on by a show of hands. All shareholders can gain access to the annual reports, trading 
updates, announcements, press releases and other information about the company 
through the company’s website at www.centaur.co.uk.
RISK ASSESSMENT
Risks that affect or may affect the business are identified and assessed, and appropriate 
controls and systems implemented to ensure that the risk is managed. The group’s risk 
register is kept by the Company Secretary with the input of the Operating Board and is 
reviewed by the Audit Committee every six months with appropriate mitigation actions 
also being reported to and overseen by the Committee.
The principal risks facing the group, with associated mitigating controls are detailed on 
page 38 within the Strategic Report.
ETHICS
The group carries out its business in a fair, honest and open manner, ensuring that it 
complies with all relevant laws and regulations. The company has specific policies on 
fraud, director conflict, bribery and whistleblowing, which are widely distributed and 
compliance with these policies is monitored. The Board has oversight of the group’s 
actions. The HR team ensures that new job opportunities are made available to existing 
employees as well as to outside applicants and that all employees are able to benefit 
from training, career development and promotion opportunities where appropriate. The 
recruitment of new personnel is made without prejudice and the group believes in equal 
opportunity and encourages diversity. The analysis of the group’s workforce and Board by 
gender is set out in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 41.
Through all our interaction with our customers and partners we ensure that we treat 
them fairly and openly whilst abiding by the terms of contracts and relevant law. Equally, 
we treat our suppliers fairly and do not exploit them or their employees. 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
The disclosure in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions of the group that are 
attributable to human activity in tonnes of carbon dioxide is set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on page 41. 
FRAUD
Whilst the group cannot guarantee to prevent fraud, the internal control framework is in 
place to reduce the likelihood of fraud arising. The group also ensures that all employees 
are aware of the whistleblowing policy should any individual become aware of any 
incidence of fraud.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS
Group and subsidiary directors have to notify their employing company of all 
directorships they hold. Annual conflict of interest disclosures require them to disclose 
such directorships or other relationships, which they or a person connected to them may 
hold. These are reviewed by the Board to assess the impact on the company and whether 
it would impair the group’s objectives.
BRIBERY ACT 2010
In response to the Bribery Act 2010, the Board performed a risk assessment across the 
group and formalised its policy to prevent bribery. The Board has in place processes to 
prevent corruption or unethical behaviour. The policy explains what is considered a bribe 
or facilitation payment, which are prohibited, and provides guidance over the levels of 
gifts, entertainment and hospitality that are considered reasonable. This documentation 
has been circulated to all staff. Training has been mandatory for those groups of 
employees identified and is available as required to new joiners. The group’s policy was 
communicated to all appropriate third parties. It is re-communicated to staff on an 
annual basis. The more rigorous processes around declaring directors’ interests and 
identifying potential conflicts have improved the regular monitoring of the group’s policy.
WHISTLEBLOWING
The company is committed to the highest standards of integrity and honesty. Along with 
other policies, which encourage this behaviour, a whistleblowing policy is annually re-
communicated to all staff. This allows all employees to disclose openly, in confidence or 
anonymously, any concerns they may have about possible improper practices, in financial 
or other matters. An escalation process has been communicated to employees. Any 
matters raised will be investigated and resolved. The Audit Committee will be notified 
of any issues raised through this process and appropriate action taken. However, no 
incidents were noted during the period.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for the 18 months to 31 
December 2014 (“the reporting period”). This report details the Audit Committee’s on-
going responsibilities and key activities over the period. The role of the Committee is 
to review and report to the Board on the group’s financial reporting, internal controls 
and risk management processes and the performance, independence and effectiveness 
of the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Audit Committee receives 
regular reports from management on performance and risk management as well as 
input from the auditor.  The Executive Directors, representatives of the auditors and other 
group executives including legal counsel regularly attend meetings at the invitation of 
the Committee. At least once during the year, the Committee meets separately with the 
external auditors and with management and as Chairman I am in regular direct contact 
with the external auditors and with the Group Finance Director. 
During the reporting period, the Audit Committee’s composition changed due to Colin 
Morrison stepping down from Centaur Media Plc’s Board at the last AGM in November 
2013. At that time Chris Satterthwaite also left the committee and Rebecca Miskin 
and Patrick Taylor joined. For the remainder of the reporting period, the Committee 
comprised Robert Boyle (Chairman), Patrick Taylor and Rebecca Miskin. 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to:
 •  Monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the group and any public 
announcements relating to the group’s financial performance, reviewing significant 
financial reporting judgements contained in them;
 •  Review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional 
and regulatory requirements;
 •  Review and assess the annual report in order to determine that it can advise the 
Board that, taken as a whole, the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides shareholders with the information they need to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy as required by provision C.1.1 of the Code;
 •  Make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external 
auditors and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external 
auditors;
 •  Develop and implement policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply 
non-audit services;
 •  Review the effectiveness of the group’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems;
 •  Review the group’s finance and operational policies and procedures to ensure they 
remain effective and relevant;
 •  Oversee the whistleblowing arrangements of the group and to ensure they are 
operating effectively; and
 •  Report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the reporting period and up until the date of this report, the Audit Committee 
undertook the following activities to ensure the integrity of the group’s financial 
statements and formal announcements:
 •  Regularly met with management and the Group Finance Director to discuss the 
results and performance of the business; 
 •  Received reports from management on the internal controls covering the financial 
reporting process;
 •  Reviewed and agreed the external auditors’ audit strategy in advance of their audit 
for the reporting period; 
 •  Discussed the report received from the external auditors regarding their audit in 
respect of the reporting period, which included comments on significant financial 
reporting judgements and their findings on internal controls; and
 •  Reviewed and discussed with management and the Group Finance Director each 
formal announcement made by the group.
The most significant financial reporting judgements considered by the Audit Committee 
and discussed with the external auditors during the reporting period were as follows:
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
The Audit Committee has reviewed management’s assessment of the recoverability of 
the group’s goodwill and intangible assets and whether there is a need for any resulting 
impairment. The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined through value 
in use calculations of each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) based on formally approved 
forecasts for the first three years of the value-in-use calculation and applying a terminal 
growth rate of 2.25%. 
Being mindful of the impairment recognised in the year to 30 June 2013 the Audit 
Committee paid particular attention to the judgements and assumptions used in forecast 
cash flows, particularly around revenue, EBITDA margin and growth rates. The Audit 
Committee focused its challenge across the financial and professional segments where 
headroom is lowest. Having also considered the CGU’s historical budgeting performance 
and the sensitivities performed, the Audit Committee was satisfied that the value in use 
calculation reflects management’s best estimate and that no impairment was required. 
As a result the Audit Committee was satisfied with the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets in the group balance sheet.
Further details on goodwill and the impairment testing are included in note 8 to the 
financial statements.
Adjusting items 
The Audit Committee has challenged management over recent financial reporting 
periods with regard to the presentation of exceptional items and is pleased to see these 
are expected to reduce with the completion of the restructuring project during the 
reporting period and settlement of all bar one of the earn-out arrangements. 
The Committee assesses the appropriateness of items disclosed as adjusting and the impact 
these have on the quality of the group’s underlying earnings. The Committee has specifically 
reviewed the treatment of share-based payments as a new adjusting item in the reporting 
period (with prior year restatement), and is satisfied that this treatment is consistent with the 
approach adopted by other quoted small cap peers, and is adequately disclosed.
Further details on adjusting items are included in the Statement of Accounting Policies in 
the financial statements. GOVERNANCE
60 61
The Audit Committee has also considered the presentation of the profit on disposal of 
Perfect Information, which whilst not judgemental in nature, is material and one-off in its 
presentation in the financial statements.
GOING CONCERN
The Audit Committee received a report setting out the going concern review undertaken 
by management which forms the basis of the Board’s going concern conclusion. As a 
result of the disposal of Perfect Information in the reporting period, the group’s liquidity 
has been enhanced and gearing reduced. Headroom on all covenants has increased. The 
existing finance facilities have been extended to 31 March 2016 to allow the Board to fulfil 
its responsibilities with regards to going concern and renewal will be negotiated in spring 
2015. On this basis the Committee is satisfied that the adoption of the going concern 
basis is appropriate.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The group’s management is responsible for the identification, assessment and 
management of risk, as well as for designing and operating the system of internal 
control. The Audit Committee has worked closely with management and received 
detailed information to assess the effectiveness of internal financial control and risk 
assessment and management systems and report on them to the Board (which retains 
ultimate responsibility). Throughout the reporting period, the group has reviewed the 
process for compilation of its risk register. The Audit Committee has overseen this review 
and the resulting changes to internal control systems. 
RISK OF FRAUD
The Audit Committee considered the risk of fraud in the business, and through its review 
of the effectiveness of internal controls and reporting from management concluded that 
adequate controls were in place.
WHISTLEBLOWING
The Audit Committee reviewed the group’s whistleblowing policy and is satisfied that 
this has met FCA rules and good standards of corporate governance. Further details 
of the whistleblowing policy are set out within the Directors’ statement on corporate 
governance on page 57.
KEY ISSUES 
Other significant issues monitored and approved by the Committee following appropriate 
presentations during the reporting period were:
 •  Selection of new finance system software for the group and adoption of a plan to 
implement this during 2015;
 •  Review of data protection policies and compliance;
 •  Review of business continuity plans and the results of related testing;
 •  Implementation of a revised authority framework;
 • Review of internal procedures for managing security of banking administration;
 •  Review of the draft circular documents with respect to the Perfect Information 
disposal; and
 •  Monitoring the roll out of anti- bribery training.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee considered whether it was appropriate to appoint internal auditors and 
concluded that given the size of the business, its relatively centralised operations and the 
risks identified, together with the mitigating controls, this is not currently required.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, were appointed in 2004 and no 
formal retender process has been conducted since this time.
The Audit Committee monitors the external audit process to ensure high standards of 
quality and effectiveness. This was assessed throughout the reporting period using a 
number of measures, including:
 •  Reviewing the quality and scope of planning of the audit and the level of fees; and;
 •  Obtaining feedback from management and directors on the quality of the audit 
team, their business understanding and audit approach.
The Audit Committee considered the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors through a careful review of their terms of engagement, scope of work and level 
of fees. This included reviewing the nature and extent of non-audit services supplied by 
the external auditors to the group, seeking to balance objectivity and value for money. 
The external auditors are excluded from providing services where there could be a threat 
to their independence. Prior approval from the Audit Committee has been required where 
non-audit fees exceed twice the annual audit fee. This policy will be brought into line with 
new regulations in 2015.
During the reporting period, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided non-audit services 
to the group in respect of taxation compliance and advisory, corporate finance and 
other assurance services. The Audit Committee is satisfied that adequate safeguards 
were established to mitigate independence threats and there has been no impairment 
of their objectivity and independence. It is anticipated that the level of non-audit fees 
will fall in 2015. Please refer to note 2 of the financial statements for fees paid to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the reporting period. The external auditor’s report 
to the directors and the Audit Committee confirmed their independence in accordance 
with auditing standards.
SELF ASSESSMENT
During the period the Audit Committee performed a formal, questionnaire based  
self-assessment with satisfactory results.
REPORT TO THE BOARD
The Board has requested the Committee to confirm that in its opinion the Board can 
make the required statement that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the company’s performance, business model and strategy. The Committee has given 
this confirmation on the basis of its review of the whole Annual Report, underpinned by 
involvement in the planning for its preparation, review of the processes to ensure the 
accuracy of factual content and by assurances from the Remuneration Committee.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR
The Committee recommended to the Board that a resolution be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting for the re-appointment as auditors of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination Committee for the 18 months to 31 
December 2014 (“the reporting period”). This report details the Committee’s on-going 
responsibilities and key activities over the period. 
During the reporting period, the Nomination Committee’s composition changed due 
to Colin Morrison stepping down from Centaur Media Plc’s Board at the last AGM in 
November 2013, at which time Chris Satterthwaite became Chairman of the Committee 
and for the rest of the reporting period the Committee comprised Chris Satterthwaite, 
Patrick Taylor and Rebecca Miskin, ensuring that there is a majority of independent Non-
Executive Directors on the Committee.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee’s key responsibilities include:
 •  Reviewing the Board’s structure, size and composition;
 •  Reviewing the composition of board committees;
 •  Defining the role and competencies required for appointments to the Board;
 •  Identifying, nominating and reviewing candidates for appointment to the Board;
 •  Putting in place plans for succession for the Chairman and other members of  
the Board, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director; and
 •  Reviewing the leadership needs of the organisation, both Executive and  
Non-Executive.
The appointment of directors is a matter for the Board, which considers 
recommendations by the Nomination Committee. The Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that the Board and the Board Committees are properly constituted and 
balanced in terms of skills, experience and diversity. Our policy on Board diversity is set 
out in the Director’s Report and since the appointment of Andria Vidler in November 2013 
there have been two female Board members, comprising 33% of the Board. 
ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD
Following Colin Morrison’s departure the Committee considered that the group’s Board 
was adequately constituted by its existing three Non-Executive Directors and Chairman 
and the main focus of the Committee was to appoint a new Chief Executive who would 
join the Board as an Executive Director (in addition to the Group Finance Director).  
It was not therefore recommended to the Board that an additional Non-Executive 
Director be appointed during the reporting period. Following the appointment of Andria 
Vidler as Chief Executive in November 2013, the main activity of the Committee was to 
plan for the succession of the Chairman whose intention to retire from the Board was 
announced in July 2014. The Committee agreed a detailed process that was approved  
by the Board and in accordance with that process conducted a rigorous search assisted 
by Ridgeway Partners as executive search consultants. Following a comprehensive  
short list and interview exercise a replacement Chairman has been recommended to 
the Board and is expected to be confirmed as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
immediately following the AGM on 13 May 2015 when Patrick Taylor will not offer  
himself for re-election.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Report for the 18 months to 31 December 2014 (“the reporting period”) for which we will 
be seeking approval at the Annual General Meeting on 13 May 2015. In line with the new 
reporting regulations that came into effect on 1 October 2013, our Remuneration Report 
is in three parts; this Annual Statement, a Policy Report and an Annual Report  
on Remuneration.
CONTEXT FOR EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION AT CENTAUR MEDIA
The reporting period was an active one for Centaur Media’s Remuneration Committee.  
At the start of the period the Group Finance Director, Mark Kerswell, was acting as 
interim Chief Executive while the Board sought to find a successor to a long-serving  
Chief Executive. The process of engaging a new Chief Executive and some of 
the subsequent changes she has started to introduce in the company’s broader 
remuneration strategies have meant that we have been able to increasingly implement 
our commitment to simplification, performance-related remuneration and long-term 
share-based incentives. During the reporting period, there have been two annual pay 
reviews for the company’s employees (other than the Operating Board, Group Finance 
Director and Chief Executive) and going forward pay reviews will take place in the first 
quarter of each financial year, to take effect from 1 April.
It is Centaur Media’s policy that executive and employee reward are appropriately  
linked to the delivery of our strategy and in 2014 there are real signs that our strategy  
is delivering. In the reporting period, we have seen some turnover in management  
and other positions, in part reflecting new senior management and the high levels  
of change. Retention of our key people is a focus of the Remuneration Committee  
for the forthcoming period, reflecting a priority of the Operating Board and for the 
company generally.
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
As a review of Centaur Media’s executive remuneration was last undertaken in February 
2013 by the Committee, no changes are being proposed. Andria Vidler was appointed to 
the role of Chief Executive in November 2013 and her remuneration was set to reflect 
the market, her experience and the principles set following the 2013 review. At the same 
time, Mark Kerswell resumed his permanent role as Group Finance Director and his 
remuneration reverted to the normal level following payment of an additional monthly 
allowance in recognition of his increased responsibilities as interim Chief Executive 
between May and November 2013.  Having remained unchanged since her appointment, 
Andria Vidler’s base salary will be increased from 1 April 2015. Mark Kerswell who last 
received a salary increase in October 2013 (3.5%) will also receive an increase from 1 
April 2015. The budgeted average salary increase at the time of the annual pay reviews in 
October 2013 and October 2014 for all other management and staff across the Group was 
2.5% for each year. 
The Executive Directors and Operating Board did not have a remuneration review during 
the 2014 calendar year as it was decided to await the end of the extended financial year 
before review. From 2015, executive remuneration review will reflect the new practice 
introduced across the Company of reviewing in Q1 of each calendar year, to fit with the 
new financial year end of 31 December.
SHARE SCHEMES
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
awards granted in November 2013 which are due to vest in March 2017 as well as Mark 
Kerswell’s Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (SELTIP) award which vested in 
September 2013 and 2014. Only Part A of the awards, which were granted in 2011, vested 
in each of 2013 and 2014 (representing 50% of award) as Part B vesting was based on 
relative TSR targets that were not met. There are no further SELTIP awards outstanding.
In September 2013, the LTIP, adopted in 2006, was amended to introduce claw back 
provisions and in the Committee’s view, the plan now more closely reflects current 
market practice. In addition, and after consultation with major investors,  the EPS 
performance targets for 2013 LTIP awards were adjusted in accordance with the plan 
rules to reflect the divestiture of the Perfect Information business in June 2014. We 
take the views of our shareholders very seriously and seek to maintain a dialogue on 
remuneration matters.
Centaur Media’s LTIP is due to reach the end of its 10 year life in 2016 and at this time we 
expect to consider and seek approval for a replacement share scheme. Given this timing, 
and the changes made to LTIP in September 2013, the decision has been made to grant 
awards to executives only under our existing LTIP (adopted in 2006) for 2015.
REMUNERATION FOR 2015
We believe the remuneration policy remains fit for purpose and therefore no changes will 
be made for 2015.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Centaur Media recognises the need to attract, retain and incentivise executives with the 
appropriate skills and talent to manage and develop the group’s businesses in such a 
way as to drive the group’s strategy and deliver shareholder value. The main principles  
of Centaur Media Plc’s executive remuneration policy are:
  •  To achieve total remuneration packages that are competitive in the sector within 
which the group operates and with the market in general;
 •  To provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration which 
rewards high levels of performance; and 
 •  To incentivise and retain management and to align their interests with those  
of shareholders.
CONSIDERATIONS OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Committee considers the general base salary increase for all employees when 
determining the annual salary increases for the Executive Directors.  Employees have not 
been consulted in respect of the design of the Group’s Executive Director Remuneration 
Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each 
year. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the course of the year 
is then considered as part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy. In 
addition, the Committee will seek to engage directly with major shareholders and their 
representative bodies should any material changes be made to the Remuneration Policy. 
Details of votes for and against the resolution to approve last year’s Remuneration 
Report are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
REMUNERATION POLICY – SUMMARY TABLE
The table below sets out the remuneration policy that will, subject to shareholder 
approval, become formally effective from the date of the 2015 AGM.
Note that payments may be made under arrangements in place prior to this policy 
becoming effective (including pension, other benefits and incentives).
The remuneration policy offered to employees of the group will be adapted to reflect local 
market practice and seniority.

NOTES
1. The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the company intends to implement 
the policy presented above.
2. Below Executive Director level, a lower or no annual bonus opportunity may apply and 
participation in the LTIP is limited to Executive Directors and certain selected senior 
managers. Other employees are eligible to participate in the company’s all employee 
share plans. In general these differences arise from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of individuals, 
together with the fact that remuneration of the Executive Directors and Senior Executives 
typically has a greater emphasis on performance related pay.
3. The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus plan reflect the 
Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging 
and primarily tied to financial measures.
4. The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected 
by the Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns 
to shareholders and the group’s financial growth are consistent with the company’s 
objective of delivering long-term value to shareholders.
5. Executive Directors may participate in any all employee share plan, in line with HMRC 
limits, to the extent offered.

NOTES
1. Fixed pay consists of salary from 1 April 2015. The value of benefits and pension has 
been estimated for 2015.
2. Target performance is the level of performance required to deliver 50% of the 
maximum bonus and 25% of the maximum LTIP value (see below).
3. Maximum performance would result in a maximum bonus payment of 100% of salary 
and full vesting of the LTIP award (100% of salary).
4. No share price appreciation has been assumed
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT AND PROMOTIONS
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance 
with the terms of the company’s prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time 
of appointment and would take into account the skills and experience of the individual, 
the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the 
relevant individual. 
On recruitment, salary may be (but need not necessarily) set below the normal market 
rate, with phased increases as the executive gains experience. The maximum annual 
bonus would be no more than 100% of salary and grants under the LTIP would be 
limited to a maximum of 100% of salary. In addition, on recruitment the company 
may compensate for amounts foregone from a previous employer (using Listing Rule 
9.4.2 if necessary) taking into account the quantum foregone and, as far as reasonably 
practicable, the extent to which performance conditions apply, the form of award and the 
time left to vesting.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of their prior 
role should be allowed to pay out according to its terms. Any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to 
shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
The Committee may agree that the company will meet relocation, legal fees and / or 
incidental costs where appropriate.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTACTS AND LOSS OF OFFICE PAYMENTS
The current Executive Directors have service contracts which provide twelve month 
notice periods.
In respect of Andria Vidler’s service contract (dated 30 October 2013), at the Board’s 
discretion, a payment in lieu of any unexpired notice may be paid, comprising an amount 
for base salary, pension and any accrued holiday entitlement.  The amount may be paid 
in one lump sum or in two instalments and mitigation will be applied to the second 
instalment.  If termination is within six months of a change of control, a payment equal 
to 12 months’ salary, pension and accrued holiday pay is payable.  Where the company 
terminates the contract in any other manner, any damages shall be calculated in 
accordance with common law principles including those relating to mitigation of loss.  
Notwithstanding the above, the company is entitled to terminate employment without 
compensation, damages or payment in lieu of notice in specified circumstances (e.g. 
serious misconduct).
In respect of Mark Kerswell’s service contract (dated 11 October 2011), at the Board’s 
discretion, a payment in lieu of any unexpired notice may be paid, comprising an amount 
for base salary, pension, bonus and any accrued holiday entitlement. Where the company 
terminates the contract in any other manner, any damages shall be calculated in 
accordance with common law principles including those relating to mitigation of loss.  
Notwithstanding the above, the company is entitled to terminate employment without 
compensation, damages or payment in lieu of notice in specified circumstances (e.g. 
serious misconduct).
In respect of incentives, an annual bonus will normally be payable with respect to the 
period of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the 
normal pay-out date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director 
under the company’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. 
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, retirement or 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may be 
applied. For good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, subject 
to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at the time and reduced pro-
rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the 
Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at cessation of employment  
and / or to not apply time pro-rating.
In addition to the above, outplacement support may be provided and / or legal fees and 
any other minor incidental costs which are considered appropriate may be payable. GOVERNANCE

BASE SALARY
The Executive Directors salaries were reviewed in February 2015, and the proposed 
increases in basic salaries will be effective from 1 April 2015, consistent with the annual 
pay cycle adopted across the group as a whole. The current salaries are as follows:
 From 1 April 2015 As at 1 April 2014 From 1 July 2013
7
Andria Vidler £355,300 £340,000 £340,000

1 October 2013 and from 1 April 2015 will be increased to £243,500 (1.46%). Andria Vidler 
was appointed Chief Executive in November 2013 on a salary of £340,000. From 1 April 
2015 Andria Vidler’s salary will be increased to £355,300 (4.5%).
PENSION AND BENEFITS
The Committee intends that the implementation of its policy in relation to pension and 
benefits will be in line with the disclosed policy on page 68 of this report.
ANNUAL BONUS
The Committee will operate an annual bonus plan for Executive Directors during 2015 in 
line with that operated in the 18 months to 31 December 2014 (“the reporting period”). 
The maximum bonus will remain at 100% of salary, with performance measured against 
revenue and PBTA targets. Any annual bonus greater than 75% of basic salary will be 
awarded in Centaur Media plc shares and deferred for three years.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2015 will be over 100% of salary and will be 
subject to EPS and TSR conditions as follows:
 •  50% of the 2015 LTIP award will be based on absolute earnings per share targets.  
25% of this part of the award will vest for a threshold EPS of 6.5p increasing pro-
rata to 100% vesting for a maximum EPS of 10.5p for the year ending 31 December 
2017; and
 •  50% of the 2015 LTIP award will be based on relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
measured against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap (excluding investment 
trusts).  25% of this part of the award will vest for median TSR increasing pro-rata to 
100% vesting for upper quartile TSR over the three years ending 31 December 2017.  
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Committee will need to be satisfied 
that the Company’s TSR performance reflects the underlying financial performance of 
the Company for this part of an award to vest.
FEES FOR THE CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Company Chairman’s fee and those of the Non-Executive Directors are determined 
as described on page 72. There are no changes proposed to the fees for Non-Executive 
Directors for 2015. The proposed annual fee for the new Chairman from 13 May 2015 has 
been set at £125,000.

 The 2013 long-term incentive value for Mark Kerswell is based on 43,918 SELTIP awards vested on 17 
September 2013 based on a performance period ending 30 June 2013.  As 50% of these awards lapsed as a 
result of the TSR performance target being failed (see below), 21,959 awards have been included based on a 
share price at vesting of 46.25p.  These 21,959 awards were exercised 50% on 20 September 2013 and 50% on 
15 September 2014. Geoff Wilmot was not granted any SELTIP awards in the reporting period.

 Mark Kerswell received a balancing payment of £6,954 in pension contributions in November 2014 which was 
due to a correction of past payments.
3
 In addition to his base salary and as disclosed in 2013, Mark Kerswell received a temporary supplement of 
£3,000 a month in recognition of his additional responsibilities as Interim Chief Executive from 15 May to 30 
November 2013.  This was a non-pensionable allowance.

 As disclosed in the previous Directors’ Remuneration Report, Geoff Wilmot stepped down from the Board on 
15 May 2013 and his employment as Chief Executive terminated on 30 June 2013.  Colin Morrison stepped down 
from the Board on 13 November 2013.  Further details are provided below. 
ANNUAL BONUS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD (AUDITED)
The maximum annual bonus opportunity in the reporting period for Executive Directors 
was 100% of salary, pro-rated to 150% to take account of the longer reporting period.  
The actual bonus paid to Andria Vidler in respect of the reporting period was £221,340. 
This represented 55.8% of the potential opportunity over the period from 4 November 
2013 to 31 December 2014. Andria Vidler’s bonus was calculated based on actual 
performance in the 12 months to 31 December 2014, measured against budgeted annual 
revenue and PBTA targets, and then calculated on a pro rata basis over the fourteen-
month period from her appointment to 31 December 2014. 
The actual bonus paid to Mark Kerswell in respect of the reporting period was £178,920. 
This represented 48% of the maximum opportunity over the period from 1 July 2013 to 
31 December 2014. £133,920 of this bonus was calculated based on actual performance 
in the 12 months to 31 December 2014, measured against budgeted annual revenue and 
PBTA targets. The remaining £45,000 was based on financial performance relative to 
budgeted financial targets in the six month period from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013. SCHEME INTERESTS AWARDED DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD (AUDITED)
On 8 November 2013 the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director received awards 
under the LTIP. These awards were in line with the policy table set out in the Policy 
Report and details of these awards are set out below.

The LTIP awards were structured as nil-cost options and the quantum of shares awarded 
was calculated using a share price of 55p. The performance condition for these awards is 
set out below:
Performance condition % of award Targets % of award 
  subject to condition  which will vest

EPS will be measured over the financial year ending 31 December 2016 and was 
adjusted in the reporting period to reflect the sale of the Perfect Information business, 
in accordance with the rules of the LTIP. TSR element will only vest if there has been 
sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance over the 
performance period.
Details of Mark Kerswell’s awards in September 2013 under the SELTIP are detailed in 
the remuneration table on page 78.
Further, Andria Vidler purchased 1,233 shares during the period under the Share 
Incentive Plan.  The company matched these shares on a 1 for 2 basis, resulting in 616 
matching shares being awarded in the period.
BOARD CHANGES AND PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE (AUDITED)
No Executive Director left office in the reporting period and accordingly no compensation 
for loss of office was paid. As disclosed in the 2013 Remuneration Report, Geoff Wilmot’s 
contract terminated on 30 June 2013 (Mr Wilmot having stepped down from the Board on 
24 May 2013) and he received £384,630 in payments due under contract notice provisions 
and compensation for loss of office. Colin Morrison retired from the Board as a non-
executive director on 13 November 2013.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS (AUDITED)
As disclosed in the 2013 Remuneration Report, Geoff Wilmot stepped down from the 
Board on 24 May 2013 and his 301,218 SELTIP awards vested on cessation as per the 
plan rules.  These awards were exercised on 29 October 2013 and the pre-tax value of 
the awards at the date of exercise was £165,670.  The 587,333 awards held under the 
2004 Option Plan lapsed on 31 December 2013.  No other payments were made to Geoff 
Wilmot in the reporting period. GOVERNANCE

DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING AND SHARE INTERESTS (AUDITED)
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our executives with the interests of 
shareholders.  The Executive Directors are expected to build up and maintain a 100% of 
salary shareholding in the company.  Where an executive does not meet this guideline 
then they are required to retain at least 50% of the net of tax, vested shares under the 
company’s LTIP until the guideline is met. 
The tables below set out details Executive Directors outstanding share awards (which 
will vest in future years subject to performance and / or continued service). Under each 
scheme the exercise price is nil.

EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS
The Executive Directors did not have any external directorships in the reporting period.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for monitoring, reviewing and making 
recommendations to the Board at least annually on the broad policy for the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and Company Secretary. It also determines 
their individual remuneration packages, including pension arrangements, bonuses and 
all incentive schemes and the determination of targets for any performance-related 
pay schemes operated by the group – asking the Board, when appropriate, to seek 
shareholder approval for any long-term incentive arrangements, bonuses, incentive 
payments and any compensation payments and share option entitlements. In addition  
the Committee monitors and recommends the level and structure of remuneration for 
senior management.
During the reporting period, the Committee consisted of the following Non-Executive 
Directors: Rebecca Miskin (Chair from 13 November 2013), Colin Morrison (previous 
Chairman), Robert Boyle (from 13 November 2013) and Chris Satterthwaite.  The 
Remuneration Committee meets at least twice each year and met 8 times during the 
reporting period. Minutes of the Committee are circulated to the Board once they have 
been approved by the Committee.
EXTERNAL ADVISORS
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it 
appropriate.  The Committee seeks advice relating to executive remuneration from New 
Bridge Street (NBS), part of Aon plc.  
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by NBS in relation to executive 
remuneration matters during the reporting period under review was objective and 
independent.  NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by 
the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be 
objective and impartial.  The fees paid to NBS for providing advice in relation to executive 
remuneration over the 18 months under review was £44,375.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.  Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss of the group for that 
period.  In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 •  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 •  Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 •  State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 •  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess a company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors 
summary on page 44, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
 •  The group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the group; and
 •  The Operational Review and Financial Review, contained in the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report contained in the Governance Report, include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITORS
The Directors confirm that, so far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware, and the Directors have taken 
all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
s418 of the Companies Act 2006.

10 March 2015 OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Overview
  Overall group materiality: £0.5 million (2013: £0.4 million) which represents 5% of profit before 
adjusting items and tax.
  The group has a centralised function in the UK which is responsible for the accounting and financial 
reporting of the whole group and our audit was carried out there, covering all group entities and  
the consolidation. 
   Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment;
   Accounting for profit on disposal of Perfect Information Limited; and
   Classification and measurement of adjusting items.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked 
at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering 
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as “areas of 
focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address 
these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Report on the financial statements
OUR OPINION
In our opinion:
   Centaur Media Plc’s group financial statements and company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the 
group’s profit and the group’s and the company’s cash flows for the period 
then ended;
   the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union;
   the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
   the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
Centaur Media Plc’s financial statements comprise:
   the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets as at 31 December 2014;
   the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 18 month 
period ended 31 December 2014;
   the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity for the period 
then ended;
   the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements for the period then 
ended;
   the accounting policies; and
   the notes to the financial statements, which include other explanatory 
information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, 
rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced 
from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the company financial statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

MATERIALITY
AUDIT SCOPE
AREA OF FOCUS AREA OF FOCUS
Accounting for profit on disposal of Perfect Information Limited
Refer to page 59 (Audit Committee Report), page 109 (Key accounting assumptions, 
estimates and judgements) and page 137 (Note 25).
In May 2014 the group disposed of the Perfect Information group resulting in a 
gain on the disposal of the subsidiary of £14.7m, which was recorded in the income 
statement. We focused on this area due to the materiality of the amounts involved 
and to check that the gain on disposal was accurately calculated.  This included 
testing that the costs captured within the computation of the gain on the disposal 
were all directly attributable costs.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We checked that the value of the consideration for the sale included in the 
computations was consistent with the terms of the Sale & Purchase Agreement 
(‘SPA’) and the amount of cash subsequently received.
We also tested directly attributable transaction costs to supporting invoices and 
agreements with advisors to verify these were directly attributable to the disposal. 
In respect of the net assets disposed of we confirmed that these and other 
subsequent adjustments were consistent with the SPA and other supporting 
documents. We also tested the apportionment of goodwill to the business that  
was disposed of.
From the evidence obtained, we concluded the computation of profit on disposal 
was accurately determined.
AREA OF FOCUS
Classification and measurement of adjusting items
Refer to page 59 (Audit Committee Report), page 109 (Key accounting assumptions, 
estimates and judgements) and page 115 (Note 3).
Adjusting items are presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and include non-recurring exceptional items and a number 
of other items which recur . Together, these items are not regarded by management 
as relevant to the assessment of the quality of the group’s underlying earnings. 
The exceptional items related mainly to the accrual of earn-out provisions based 
on management’s latest estimates of expected pay outs (£5.0m expense) and 
redundancy costs as part of the finalisation of the group’s restructuring plans  
(£0.9m expense).
Other adjusting items included:
  Amortisation of acquired intangibles (£3.4m) – relating to the continued 
amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisitions. 
  Exceptional finance costs (£2.9m) – relating to discounting of the E-Consultancy 
earn-out which was settled during the period. 
 Share based payment expense (£0.5m).
We focused on whether items were properly classified as exceptional (and therefore 
adjusting) and also on whether the other items which were presented as adjusting 
items were consistent with prior periods. We also checked the accuracy of all the 
adjusting items.   
As set out further above, the group disposed of Perfect Information during the period 
resulting in a profit on disposal of £14.7m.  Given the quantum and non-recurring 
nature of this amount there was limited judgement required in determining whether 
this item should be classified as an adjusting item.
AREA OF FOCUS
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment
Refer to page 59 (Audit Committee Report), page 109 (Key accounting assumptions, 
estimates and judgements) and page 120 (Note 8).
Whilst no impairment charge was booked for the period ended 31 December 
2014, we focused on this area in light of the impairment charge recorded against 
Goodwill in the Marketing, Professional and Financial Services segments in 2013.  
Any further unfavourable performance or downward revision of forecasts against 
the model used to determine value in use in 2013 could have resulted in further 
impairment in these segments (and the Home Interest segment) for the period 
ended 31 December 2014.  
The determination of whether or not an impairment charge for goodwill or 
intangible assets was necessary involved significant judgements about the future 
results and cash flows of the business, including future revenues and EBITDA 
margins and growth as well as the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’) 
discount factor used.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
Management aggregates cash generating units (‘CGU’s’) into segments which 
represents the level at which the performance of the businesses is monitored and 
which are used for the impairment assessment.  We verified that the allocation of 
CGU’s to segments was consistent with internal management reporting and the 
prior year.
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts for each segment, and the 
process by which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest 
Board approved budgets, and testing the underlying calculations. We found the 
forecasts and the approved budgets to be consistent.
We challenged:
– the directors’ key assumptions including revenue and EBITDA growth rates used 
in the cash flow forecasts by comparing them to historical results, and economic 
and industry forecasts; and
– the WACC discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the group and 
comparable organisations.
We found the key assumptions to be reasonable and the discount rate to be within 
our expected range.
We evaluated the results and disclosure of the sensitivity analyses performed by 
management (as set out in Note 8) which showed headroom (excess of determined 
recoverable value over the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets) in all 
scenarios. One analysis included taking into account the history of differences 
between budgets and actual results and applying this to forecasts used in the 
current period’s model.  
The Professional and Financial Services segment showed the lowest headroom. 
We performed our own sensitivity analysis over these segment and focused on 
the key drivers of the cash flow forecast (i.e. revenue and EBITDA) to ascertain the 
extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively would 
be required for the goodwill to be impaired. We considered the likelihood of such a 
movement in those key assumptions arising in the context of recent performance 
and the history of budgeting/forecasting accuracy and discussed these with 
management. We determined that such scenarios were unlikely to arise. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
88 89 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be 
able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account 
the geographic structure of the group (which is predominantly based in the UK), the 
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. 
The group operates a centralised accounting function in the UK that is responsible 
for processing transactions for all entities within the group, and for consolidated 
financial reporting.
The whole group was audited by the UK audit team at the centralised  
accounting function.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set 
certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £0.5 million (2013: £0.4 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before adjusting items and tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied  We believe that profit before adjusting items and tax provides 
us with a consistent period on period basis for determining 
materiality and reflects the presentation of the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements 
identified during our audit above £24,000 (2013: £21,000) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set 
out on page 51, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of 
accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the group and company have 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to 
do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As 
part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability to  
continue as a going concern.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We considered whether the exceptional items recorded were recurring in nature and 
recognised and presented in accordance with the group’s disclosed accounting policy.
In some cases exceptional items of the same nature had been incurred in both the 
current period and in prior years. We challenged management as to whether such  
costs were therefore non-recurring in nature. As these costs were directly linked to  
one ongoing restructuring programme, which was completed in the current period,  
we accepted these costs as non-recurring and appropriate to separate from  
underlying earnings. 
Our work in relation to each type of exceptional item is summarised below.
   Deferred contingent consideration charge - the group settled a number of earn 
outs during the period with the majority of the charge being attributable to 
the settlements of the Investment Platforms Limited and E-consultancy.com 
Limited earn outs.  We examined agreements between parties confirming the 
settlement amounts were agreed. We also checked the accuracy of management’s 
computations of adjustments required where there were differences between 
the amounts provided and those settled. At period end there was one amount of 
contingent consideration remaining. We checked that management’s estimates of 
forecast performance were consistent with the Board approved budget, and were 
satisfied that the computations of the amount payable were consistent with the 
earn-out agreement and were accurate.  
   Redundancies - we tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred, 
including checking the actual payments made to those employees.
   Other exceptional items - we considered whether these were non-recurring in 
nature, including whether such items were likely to repeat or if they had occurred 
in the past, and if so how those items had been classified. As these items were also 
material we concurred with their classification as exceptional.
In respect of other adjusting items including the amortisation of acquired intangibles and 
finance costs we checked that management’s computations of the costs were accurate 
and that the calculation of the share-based payment expense was correct.
We also assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements provide 
sufficient detail to understand the nature of these items and assumptions made.
From the evidence obtained, we concurred with management’s assessment to classify 
and disclose these items as adjusting items, in line with the disclosed accounting policy.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on 
pages 84 to 85, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and
  the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, 
to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
98 99 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial 
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to  
all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis.  The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. Further detail is included within the Report of 
the Directors on pages 48 to 57. The functional currency of the Company is pounds 
sterling (GBP) as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the group operates. These financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling (GBP).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use 
of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, the 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under section 
408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own statement of 
comprehensive income in these financial statements.
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the group:
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the 
first time for the financial period beginning 1 July 2013.
   Amendments to IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure – Offsetting 
financial assets and financial liabilities’. This amendment includes new 
disclosures to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare IFRS 
financial statements to those that prepare financial statements in accordance 
with other accounting frameworks. The application of the standard has not 
had any significant impact on the group.
   Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011. These annual improvements 
address six issues in the 2009-2011 reporting cycle. The application of these 
amendments has not had any significant impact on the group.
   IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ – IFRS establishes a single source of 
guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value 
measurements. This standard excludes share-based payments which are 
within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The application of the 
standard has not had any significant impact on the group.
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations that are potentially relevant 
to the group issued but not effective for the financial period beginning 1 July 2013 
(and in some cases not yet adopted by the EU) and not early adopted:
   IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’.
   IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’.
   IFRS 11, ‘Joint Arrangements’.
   IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’.
   Transition guidance (amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12).
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in 
future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group.

During the period, the group has changed its key reporting metric from adjusted 
EBITDA to adjusted operating profit. This is considered to be more reflective of 
the underlying profitability of each segment and also aligns with the majority of 
our peers. Accordingly certain disclosures have been amended from prior year 
to reflect adjusted operating profit. There have been no changes to the numbers 
disclosed other than as discussed above in relation to the reclassification of share-
based payments as an adjusting item. Where disclosures have been amended this 
is indicated in the note
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of 
Centaur Media plc and all its subsidiaries to 31 December, and previously to 30 
June, adjusted where appropriate to conform with Centaur’s accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control exists when the 
Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities. Consolidation of a subsidiary 
begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases 
when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the date the Company gains control until the 
date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where the group has established a joint venture through an interest in a company, 
partnership or other entity (a jointly controlled entity), the group recognises its interest 
in the entity using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the group’s share 
of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the jointly controlled entity is 
combined line by line with similar items in the group’s financial statements.
Intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealised gains or losses arising from 
these transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
When the group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal 
recognised in profit or loss is calculated as the difference between (i) the 
aggregate fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained 
interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), 
less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary 
are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to 
another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRS).
STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
PRESENTATION OF NON-STATUTORY MEASURES
The Directors believe that adjusted results and adjusted earnings per share 
provide additional useful information on the ongoing operations of the group to 
shareholders.  The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS and may not 
therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by 
other companies.  It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS 
measurements of profit.
The principal adjustments are made in respect of:
    Exceptional costs - the group considers items of income and expenses as 
exceptional items and excludes them from the adjusted results where the 
nature of the item, or its size, is likely to be material and non-recurring 
in nature so as to assist the user of the financial statements to better 
understand the results of the operations of the group.  Details of exceptional 
items are shown in note 3.
   Amortisation of acquired intangibles – the group amortises all intangible 
assets. The amortisation charge for those intangible assets recognised on the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is excluded from the adjusted results of the group 
so as to assist the user of the financial statements to better understand the 
results of the operations of the group. The amortisation of intangible software 
assets acquired other than through the acquisition of a subsidiary is included 
in the adjusted results. Details of amortisation of intangibles are shown in 
note 9.
   Share-based payments – during the current period the group has amended 
the definition of adjusting items to include share-based payments. This is to 
assist the user of the financial statements to better understand the underlying 
results of the group. 2013 comparatives have been restated to treat share-
based payments as an adjusting item. The effect of these changes on the 
comparatives for the year end 30 June 2013 is to increase adjusted operating 
profit by £0.2m from £9.8m to £10.0m and adjusted basic and diluted earnings 
per share by 0.1p from 4.5p to 4.6p. There is no change to statutory figures. 
   Profit on disposal of subsidiary - details of the profit on disposal of subsidiary 
are shown in note 25.
   Exceptional finance costs – the group discounts provisions to the net present 
value where the effects of such discounting are material. The discounting on 
provisions relating to acquisitions is excluded from adjusted results of the 
group so as to assist the user of the financial statements to better understand 
the results of the operations of the group. Details of the exceptional finance 
costs are shown in note 4.
The tax related to adjusting items is the tax effect of the items above that are 
allowable deductions for tax purposes, calculated using the standard rate of 
corporation tax. 
Further details of adjusting items are included in note 3.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
102 103 INVESTMENTS
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at 
cost less provision for impairment in value.
GOODWILL
Where the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the 
separable net assets acquired, the resulting goodwill is capitalised and allocated 
to the CGU or group of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the business combination. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is tested for 
impairment annually or where indicators imply that the carrying value is  
not recoverable.
Each brand is deemed to be a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). Goodwill is attributed to 
individual CGUs but is reviewed at the segment level for the purposes of the annual 
impairment review as this is the level that management monitor goodwill. Any 
impairment is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment 
of goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
On the disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations are 
carried at fair value as at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation. 
Computer software that is not integral to the operation of the related hardware 
is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.  Costs associated with the 
development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group 
that will probably generate economic benefits in excess of costs are recognised as 
intangible assets when the criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met. They are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost or fair value of assets on a  
straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives to the group over the  
following periods:
Computer software  - 3 - 5 years
Brands and publishing rights - 20 years
Customer relationships  - 10 years or the length of the contract if shorter
Websites and content   - 3 - 5 years
Non-compete arrangements - Over the term of the arrangement
The group’s internally generated brands represent commercially valuable 
intangibles but are not eligible for recognition as assets under IAS 38  
Intangible Assets.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. The historical cost of property, plant and 
equipment is the purchase cost together with any incidental direct costs of 
acquisition. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual 
value, of assets, on a straight line-basis over the expected useful economic lives to 
the group over the following periods:
Leasehold improvements - 10 years or the expected length of the lease if shorter
Fixtures and fittings - 10 years
Computer equipment - 3 - 5 years
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market 
rates at the balance sheet date for equivalent aged assets and depreciation rates 
adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis. A review of the estimated useful 
economic life of each asset is carried out annually to ensure depreciation rates  
are adequate.
STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.  The 
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of 
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by 
the group in exchange for control of the acquiree.  Acquisition costs incurred are 
expensed and included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any deferred consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair 
value. If the conditions attached to the consideration indicate that the payment 
forms part of the acquisition, a provision is made for the future liability at the 
acquisition date. Where the deferred consideration is contingent on the continued 
employment of the vendors, such arrangements are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the life of the 
earn-out. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 through the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable 
and represents amounts recoverable by the group for the sales of advertising 
space, subscriptions and individual publications and revenue from events provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts and value added tax.
Sales of advertising space are recognised in the period in which publication occurs. 
Sales of publications are recognised in the period in which the sale is made. Sales 
of online advertising are recognised in the period in which the advertisements are 
placed.  Revenue received in advance for events is deferred and recognised in the 
period in which the event takes place.
Revenue from subscriptions to publications and digital services is deferred  
(in ‘deferred income’) and recognised on a straight-line basis over the  
subscription period.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the period end date. Any gains or losses arising on 
exchange are reflected in the statement of comprehensive income.
The results and financial position of the group entities that have a functional 
currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
   assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the 
closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
   income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average 
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 
transactions); and
   all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component  
of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings, are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
104 105 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the 
higher of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. An asset’s value 
in use is calculated by discounting an estimate of future cash flows by the group’s 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COST
The group and Company contribute to a defined contribution pension scheme 
for the benefit of employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the group in an independently administered fund. Contributions to defined 
contribution schemes are charged to the statement of comprehensive income at 
the time that the related service is provided. The group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the 
related service is provided.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, 
under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity 
instruments (options) of the group. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount 
to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
   including any market performance conditions;
   excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an 
employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
   including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the 
requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting 
period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to 
be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of 
the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares or transfers 
shares from treasury. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees 
of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as a capital contribution. The 
fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date 
fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in 
subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is more likely than not that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for contingent deferred consideration are based on the Directors’ best 
estimate of the future liability.  Where the deferred consideration is contingent on 
the continued employment of the vendors, such arrangements are recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over 
the life of the arrangement.
Provisions for onerous property leases are recognised to reflect the aggregate 
future lease commitments, less any contracted sub-lease income, for properties no 
longer occupied and in use by the group.
STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
calculated using the first in, first out method. Work in progress comprises 
costs incurred relating to publications, exhibitions and conferences prior to the 
publication date or the date of the event. For goods for resale, cost is the purchase 
price, or, in the case of publications, the direct cost of production.
Net realisable value is based on estimated future selling price less all the further 
costs to completion and all relevant marketing, selling and distribution costs.
Inventories are reviewed regularly and full provision is made for obsolete, slow 
moving or defective stock.
TAXATION INCLUDING DEFERRED TAX
The tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs 
from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further includes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group and 
Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax accounted for in respect of temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements, and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or  
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets  
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the  
accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited to the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
LEASES
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under 
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to  
the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period  
of the lease.
The group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant 
and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the 
lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated 
between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the 
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in financial liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost 
is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the lease period so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability 
for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is 
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.

  Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
  Borrowings
  Borrowings are recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and 
carried subsequently at amortised cost.  Costs of borrowings are recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred or, where appropriate, 
across the term of the related borrowing.
  Derivative financial instruments
  Derivative financial instruments may be used to hedge interest rate and foreign 
currency exposure where these circumstances arise. Discounts and premiums 
are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income over the 
life of the asset or liability to which they relate.   Derivative financial assets and 
liabilities are stated at fair value. Changes to fair value are recognised directly 
in equity, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the financial period to 
which it relates. The group does not hold any derivative financial instruments 
either for trading purposes or designated as hedges.
KEY ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the use of certain key 
accounting assumptions and requires management to exercise its judgement and 
to make estimates. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to 
the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
i) Impairments
In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible fixed assets are impaired, 
the group uses a discounted cash flow model which includes forecast cash flow 
information and estimates of future growth.  If the results of operations in future 
periods are lower than included in the cash flow model, impairments may be 
triggered.  Further details of the assumptions and sensitivities in the discounted 
cash flow model are included in note 8.
ii) Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration related to acquisitions is dependent on the future 
performance of the acquired businesses. Judgement is required in estimating the 
magnitude of the contingent consideration and the likelihood of payment. Further 
detail related to contingent consideration is disclosed in note 19.  
iii) Valuation of intangible assets arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are identified based 
on the group’s understanding of the acquiree and previous experience of similar 
businesses.  Consistent methods of valuation for similar types of intangible asset 
are applied where possible and appropriate, using information reviewed at Board 
level where available.  Discount rates applied in calculating the values of intangible 
assets arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are calculated specifically for each 
acquisition, and adjusted to reflect the respective risk profile of each individual 
asset based on the group’s past experience of similar assets. 
STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. The excess of consideration received in 
respect of shares issued over the nominal value of those shares is held in the share 
premium account.
The Company also holds a non-distributable reserve representing the fair value of 
share options issued.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are paid or 
approved by the shareholders in the annual general meeting.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The Operating Board has 
been identified as the chief operating decision-maker, responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. During the prior 
year the company announced a refocus of its business into four market-facing 
divisions: Marketing, Financial Services (previously Financial), Professional, and 
Home Interest (previously Consumer).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The group has applied IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and IAS 39, 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, as outlined below:
  Financial assets
  The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories where 
relevant: at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; and 
available-for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired.  Management determines the classification of 
its financial assets at initial recognition.
  All of the group’s financial assets have been classified as loans and receivables. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after 
the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The group’s 
loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash 
equivalents in the balance sheet.
  Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
  Trade receivables
  Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
  A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or 
financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 
days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted 
at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within net operating 
expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against net operating expenses in the 
statement of comprehensive income.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Operating Board has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker, 
reviewing the group’s internal reporting on a monthly basis in order to assess 
performance and allocate resources. 
The group is organised around four market-facing segments: Marketing, Financial 
Services (previously described as Financial), Home Interest (previously described 
as Consumer) and Professional. Corporate costs are allocated to these segments 
on an appropriate basis depending on the nature of the cost.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible 
assets including goodwill, inventories and trade receivables. Segment liabilities 
comprise trade payables, accruals and deferred income. 
Corporate assets and liabilities comprise current and deferred tax balances, cash 
and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, 
intangible assets and includes additions resulting from acquisitions through 
business combinations.
There are no major customers that provide revenue of over 10% of a  
reportable segment.

Exceptional operating costs comprise the following:
Restructuring costs - in 2014 these comprise redundancy costs of £0.9m and product closure costs as a result of 
ongoing restructuring activities which completed during the period. Costs in 2013 comprised redundancy costs, 
accelerated amortisation of software and accelerated share-based payment costs.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
116 117 7 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.  616,373 (2013: 1,693,673) shares held in the employee 
benefit trust and 6,535,973 (2013: 7,318,291) shares held in treasury have been excluded in arriving at the weighted 
average number of shares.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.  This comprises share options (including those granted under the 
Sharesave plan) granted to Directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of 
the Company’s ordinary shares during the period.
Basic and diluted earnings per share have also been presented on an adjusted basis, as the Directors believe that this 
measure is more reflective of the underlying performance of the group.

were antidilutive for the period presented.
*2013 comparatives have been restated to treat share-based payments as an adjusting item. The effect of these 
changes on the comparatives for the year-end 30 June 2013 is to increase adjusted operating profit by £0.2m from 
£9.8m to £10.0m and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share by 0.1p from 4.5p to 4.6p. Further information is 
given in the Statement of Accounting Policies. There was no effect on statutory basic or diluted earnings per share.

The Finance Act 2013 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014. 
Accordingly the company’s profits for this accounting period will be taxed at a blended rate of 22%.
The Finance Act 2013 also included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% from 1 April 
2015. These further changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, the group’s 
deferred tax balances are recorded at 20%.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
118 119 Goodwill by segment 
Each brand is deemed to be a Cash Generating Unit (CGU), being the lowest level for which cash flows are separately 
identifiable.  Goodwill is attributed to individual CGUs but is reviewed at the segment level for the purposes of the 
annual impairment review as this is the level at which management monitors goodwill. The majority of the group’s 
goodwill arose on the acquisition of the Centaur Communications group in 2004.
Goodwill is allocated to segments as follows:

Impairment testing of goodwill and acquired intangible assets
During the period, goodwill and acquired intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.  
In assessing whether a write-down of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is required, the carrying value of the 
segment is compared with its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured based on value-in-use.
The group estimates the value-in-use of its CGUs using a discounted cash flow model, which adjusts the cash flows for 
risks associated with the assets and discounts these using a pre-tax rate of 13.2% (30 June 2013: 12.6%).  The discount 
rate used is consistent with the group’s weighted average cost of capital and is used across all segments, which all are 
based predominantly in the UK and considered to have the same risks and rewards.
The key assumptions used in calculating value-in-use are revenue growth, margin, adjusted EBITDA, discount rate and 
the terminal growth rate.  The group has used formally approved forecasts for the first three years of the calculation and 
applied a terminal growth rate of 2.25% (30 June 2013: 2.25%).  This timescale and the terminal growth rate are both 
considered appropriate given the cyclical nature of the group’s revenues.
The assumptions used in the calculations of value-in-use for each segment have been derived based on a combination 
of past experience and management’s expectations of future growth rates in the business.
No impairment was noted as a result of the impairment review (30 June 2013: £39.2m). Professional and Financial 
Services had the lowest headroom. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-calculations, holding all other variables constant, to:
(i) apply a 5% reduction to forecast EBITDA in each year of the modelled cash flows.
(ii) apply a 0.5 percentage points increase in discount rate from 13.2% to 13.7%.
(iii) reduce the terminal value growth rate from 2.25% to 2%.
For all CGUs, the value-in-use calculations comfortably exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios .

from the date of invoice or, in the case of live events related revenue, no less than 30 days before the event. All credit 
and recovery risk associated with trade receivables has been provided for in the balance sheet. The group’s policy for 
recognising an impairment loss is given in the statement of accounting policies.  Impairment losses are taken through 
administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other receivables comprise mainly employee loans and amounts receivable on a sale or return basis from one of the 
group’s agencies. On this basis the group considers these amounts to be recoverable.
The directors consider the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

Deferred Consideration
Deferred consideration at 1 July 2013 related to FEM, IPL and VBR and Econsultancy. The provision at 31 December 
2014 relates to VBR.
FEM, IPL, VBR
In all cases, the amount provided is dependent on continued employment of the former owners of the business and 
is treated as post-acquisition remuneration accruing over the period post-acquisition to the end of the performance 
period. All amounts represent the Directors’ best estimate of the amount to be paid at the balance sheet date.
FEM - The deferred consideration for Forum for Expatriate Management was settled at £2.9m during the period.
IPL - The amount of deferred contingent consideration payable with respect to the acquisition of IPL was calculated 
based on the profits generated by IPL in the year to 30 June 2014 (the performance period), subject to a maximum earn 
out payment of £4.2m. The maximum amount of £4.2m was settled in September 2014.  
VBR - The amount of deferred contingent consideration payable with respect to the acquisition of VBR is dependent on 
the profits generated by VBR in the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 (the performance period), subject to a maximum 
earn out payment of £5.0m.
Econsultancy
In the case of Econsultancy the amount provided was determined to form part of the acquisition consideration and 
a provision recognised in full on acquisition. During the period, following negotiations for the early settlement of 
the deferred contingent consideration, the provision was increased by £2.0m (year ended 30 June 2013: £nil) and all 
remaining discounting, a residual of £2.0m, unwound. The deferred consideration was settled on 12 June 2014 for 
£12.5m in cash. 
Onerous Lease 
The onerous lease provision relates to premises that are no longer occupied following the transfer of staff to existing 
group premises. The remaining balance was disposed of with the sale of Perfect Information.

years as detailed in note 22.
A Senior Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (SELTIP) was launched in 2010 and restricted shares have been awarded 
under this plan in the 18 months to December 2014 and the year to June 2013 as detailed in note 22.
Shares were granted to Executive Directors during the period under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) approved by 
shareholders in 2006. 
A new Retention Plan was launched during 2014 for senior management and grants were awarded under this plan 
during the period.
A new Bonus Plan was approved in February 2014 for all staff. No grants have yet been made under this scheme.

22 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The group operates a number of share based payment schemes.
Share Option Plan
The Share Option Plan is made up of two parts. Part I is approved by the HMRC under legislation which encourages 
employees to own shares in the group in a tax efficient manner.  Part II of the plan has not been approved by the HMRC.
The Committee had previously granted share options in 2004 under the Share Option Plan to members of senior 
management. The Board’s objective in granting options was to increase shareholder value through growth in earnings. 
All these options have now been exercised as the corporate performance targets relating to them have been met. 
Details of these targets were set out in the 2008 Report. 
There is a limit on the grant of options under the Share Option Schemes. Options may not be granted if the numbers 
of ordinary shares over which they are granted (together with any ordinary shares which are subject to options granted 
pursuant to the Rollover Plan) exceed 5 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue immediately prior to the date of grant of 
the options.
Retention Plan
As part of a review of all employee equity incentives, on 15 September 2010 the Remuneration Committee and Board 
of Directors adopted the rules of the “The Centaur Media plc 2010 Retention Plan” (the “Plan”).  The main impact 
of the adoption of the Plan was the cancellation, with the agreement of option holders, of outstanding vested share 
options granted on 9 March 2004 and 29 September 2004 under the Centaur Media plc Share Option Plan and their 
replacement with a lower number of forfeitable nil-priced options (“Retention Awards”), granted on the basis of 1 
Retention forfeitable nil-cost option for every 3 existing vested options surrendered. The Retention Awards  vested 50% 
on the second anniversary of the date of grant and the balance on the third anniversary. There were  no performance 
conditions other than continuing employment.
On 30 December 2011, a further 170,000 nil cost options were granted under the Retention Plan to Mark Kerswell, a 
Director of Centaur Media plc.  The awards vested 50% on 30 June 2013 and 50% on 30 June 2014.  The participant 
first became eligible to participate in the arrangement on his permanent appointment as Group Finance Director on 11 
October 2011.  There were no performance conditions other than continuing employment. 
All such shares have been exercised as at the period end and the scheme has been closed. The Retention Plan was not 
approved by shareholders. Awards  were satisfied using shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust. 
Senior Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (“SELTIP”)
The Centaur Media Plc 2010 Senior Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “SELTIP”) was introduced during 2011. The 
plan was described  in the 2013 Annual Report within the Directors’ Report on Remuneration. 
Awards of bonus units were made in 2011, 2012 and 2013 as summarised in the following table: 
 Financial year Threshold  PBTA Profit SELTIP Total bonus Bonus pool Number of shares 
  profit achieved growth contribution pool allocated* awarded in total**
 2011 £4.0m £6.5m £2.5m 20% £0.4m £0.4m 711,621
 2012 £6.5m £8.0m £1.5m 30% £0.4m £0.3m 788,696
 2013 £8.0m £8.6m £0.6m 30% £0.1m £0.1m 118,851
*The Remuneration Committee did not allocate the entire bonus pool in 2012 or 2013
** Awards are only made to participants with continuing employment 
2014 Retention Plan
The 2014 Retention Plan was introduced during June 2014 with the aim of incentivising and rewarding participants 
for remaining with the group. Awards vest over a period of two or three years with the only condition being continued 
employment. Awards have been granted under this scheme during the period.
Share Incentive Plan
The Share Incentive Plan is open to all employees who have been employed by the group for more than 12 months. 
Employees may invest up to £1,500 per annum (or 10% of their salary if less) in shares in the Company which are held in 
trust and can be withdrawn with tax paid at any time, or tax-free after five years. The company matches the contribution 
with a ratio of 1 share for every 2 purchased.  Other than continuing employment, there are no other performance 
conditions attached to the plan.  
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Share Incentive Plan, as are all employees of the group.  
The Share Incentive Plan is an HMRC approved plan.

expected volatility is based on historical volatility for a period commensurate with the expected terms of the options  
to the grant date. 
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on UK Gilts consistent with the option life.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share based payment plans was £0.5m (2013: £0.3m), all of which 
related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
For the SELTIP the charge was based on the estimated fair value for the reporting period and the charge finalised 
during the following period when the restricted shares were granted. No grants were made under the SELTIP during the 
current period, however, as detailed in table on page 132, the 2013 award of bonus units was finalised on 17 September 
2013 on issue of the group’s results for the year ended 30 June 2013.

The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk 
and capital risk. 
The following note describes the role that financial instruments have had during the period ended 31 December 2014  
in the management of the group’s financial risks.
Currency risk
Substantially all the group’s net assets are located, and substantially all revenue and adjusted operating profit is 
generated, in the United Kingdom and consequently foreign exchange risk is limited.  The results of the group are not 
currently sensitive to movements in currency rates. 
Interest rate risk
The group has no significant interest-bearing assets but is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at floating 
interest rates.  This risk may be managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges.  Hedging 
activities are evaluated regularly to align interest rate views and risk appetite with the hedging requirements of the 
group’s revolving credit facility. The group did not enter into any hedging transactions during the period (2013: none) 
and, as at 31 December 2014, the only floating rate to which the group is exposed is LIBOR.
The group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk section 
of this note.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and 
financial institutions, and credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. 
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted. For 
customers, the group’s risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, 
past experience and other factors. The directors consider the maximum credit risk to which the group is exposed is 
the sum of cash and cash equivalents per note 14 and the receivables balance per note note 13. The group does not 
consider it is subject to any significant concentrations of credit risk. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  Throughout 
the period ended 31 December 2014, and for the foreseeable future, the group was and is expected to be in a net 
borrowings position.  The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and working capital credit 
facilities, and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.  A summary of the undrawn facilities the group 
has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk is shown below. The total facility available to the group was reduced to 
£25m with effect from June 2014 following the disposal of Perfect Information (note 25) and the early settlement of the 
deferred consideration for Econsultancy (note 19). The £25m facility is available through to the end of the loan in March 
2016. The facility will be renegotiated during Spring 2015.

The book value of primary financial instruments approximates to fair value where the instrument is on a short maturity 
or where they bear interest at rates approximate to the market.
All trade and other payables are due in one year or less, or on demand.
Capital risk
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the group consists of net debt, which includes borrowings (note 15) and cash and cash 
equivalents (note 14), and equity attributable to owners of the parent, comprising issued share capital (note 21), other 
reserves and retained earnings.
The group continues to benefit from its banking facilities agreed during 2012 which features both a working capital 
facility, to assist in managing the group’s liquidity risk, and an acquisition facility, to support the group’s acquisition 
strategy. The facility, available until March 2016, allows for a maximum drawdown of £25.0m.  Interest is calculated on 
LIBOR plus a margin dependent on the level of outstanding drawdowns, which is re-measured quarterly in line with 
covenant testing. The facility will be renegotiated during Spring 2015.
The group’s borrowings are subject to financial covenants tested quarterly. At 31 December 2014 all of these covenants 
were achieved.

clause in the Lexington Street property was exercised during the period. The property had previously been sublet.

let to tenants.
28 PENSION SCHEMES

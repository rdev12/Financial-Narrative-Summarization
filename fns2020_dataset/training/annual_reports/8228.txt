Chairman’s
Statement 
David Bramwell
16329 22/07/2009 Proof 6
Chairman’s Statement
 Intr oduction
I am pleased to report further significant
improvement in the performance of the
Group during a year which witnessed
an unprecedented assault on the
economic and financial framework
of the industrialised world. Although we
have been by no means immune to the
global downturn, particularly in our final
quarter, we nevertheless finished the
year in line with market expectations
with underlying profit before tax at
£4.1 million, some 23% higher than
the previous financial year.
Results
Sales for the financial year increased
by 9% with the dollar rebounding to
account for £2.7 million of our year on
year growth in sales. Overall margins
held up well, with gross margins of
32% of sales (2008: 31% of sales).
The strengthening dollar contributed
to £0.5 million of the £0.8 million
improvement in underlying profit
before tax. Earnings per share from the
underlying profit of the Group improved
by 19% to 3.32p and net debt reduced
to £3.8 million, despite the strengthening
of the US dollar. This was largely due
to the record performance of Paradise
Datacom and CML, with operating profit
for both companies being 15% higher
than the previous year.
The strengthening dollar had the
opposite effect on borrowings, much of
which is denominated in dollars as a net
investment hedge. Borrowings reduced
by £0.7 million before increasing
£0.6 million for currency changes.
Paradise Datacom, our satellite amplifier
and modem business, had a successful
year, opening new engineering and
sales offices in Beijing, Bangkok and
Phoenix, Arizona. A number of significant
government product replacement
programmes were won which will benefit
Paradise Datacom for the next two to
three years. Our increased rate of new
product introduction and our extended
geographic coverage enabled Paradise
Datacom to record a further year of a
return on sales in excess of 20%.
Labtech Microwave, our microwave
components and manufacturing services
business, saw the expected reduction
in commercial telecommunication
sales offset by growth in defence and
security sales, though some of the
larger programmes we had expected
were delayed into 2009/10. Our share
of the phased array radar market has
continued to grow, with air traffic control
demand also showing promise. Our
continued reduction in exposure to the
commodity telecommunications markets
was replaced by specialist work enabling
Labtech Microwave to break even in
the year. We are still in the process of
reshaping the business to increase
intellectual property, make it more
responsive, leaner and set for growth.
This led to an exceptional restructuring
charge in the year of £0.4 million, which
includes an impairment charge for
surplus assets.
CML, our aerostructures company,
continued its run of improving operating
profit. Towards the end of the financial
year the general economic downturn
began to affect the schedules for
business and commercial jets. However,
there were positive advances being
made on the development programme
for Composites with additional orders
under the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)
programme. Repairs and overhaul, a
higher margin area of activity, was also
a successful sector for CML in the past
12 months.
Dividend
The Board considers it prudent in the
current economic climate to maintain
the final dividend at 0.30p. This brings
the total dividend for the year to 0.465p
(2008: 0.45p). If approved at the Annual
General Meeting on 11 September 2009,
the final dividend will be paid on
23 September 2009 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business
on 28 August 2009.
“Further significant improvement in performance.
Difficult commercial backdrop but we are confident of 
resilient performance in the coming financial year.”

Strategy
Our strategy is to develop our business
in the communications industry providing
technology for the transmission of voice,
video and data. Our focus is on the
defence, security, telecommunications
and broadcast sectors. We will also
continue to develop our profitable
aerostructures business. The Group
will grow organically within our chosen
markets through sound investment in
product development, capital equipment
and enhanced geographic coverage.
We will continue to encourage the
professional development of our staff,
enhanced, where necessary, by the
recruitment of key additional personnel
with complementary skills. In order to
supplement organic growth, we will
seek suitable acquisitions within our
core activity.
People
The skill, commitment and enthusiasm
of our employees are key to the ongoing
success of the Group. On behalf of the
Board, I would like to record my sincere
thanks to them for their loyalty and
valued contributions during the year.
Outlook
The extended geographic sales coverage
and the increased rate of new product
introduction will open up significant
new markets for Paradise Datacom,
though we may have to be patient
before seeing growth in the current
economic conditions. We expect some
considerable softening in commercial
satcoms in 2009/10 and will be
more reliant on winning contracts on
Government programmes, where
funding is still robust and increasing.
We are currently bidding on an extensive
range of programmes of considerable
value and will look to build on our
proven success in this area. In all, we
are projecting to maintain the sales level
following a slow start to the year which
we anticipate will gather momentum
towards the final quarter.
Labtech Microwave has seen some
strong order inflow in the first two
months of the current year and, although
activity levels will remain low in the first
six months, our restructuring should
be sufficient to enable a reasonable
profit at the half way stage. Due to the
nature of Labtech Microwave’s growing
focus on defence spend, the visibility
of programmes is much longer than it
was some two to three years ago. As a
consequence, the second six months of
the current year also look to be profitable
although the timing of order placement
on some of the defence and security
programmes, as ever, is critical.
In line with most aerospace suppliers
CML has suffered a significant reduction
of build rates in the corporate jet
market, whilst Airbus’ schedules remain
comparatively resilient. Overall, the
reduced business jet build schedule and
the investment in moving to an enlarged
composite facility will undoubtedly result
in a lowering of CML’s profits in 2009/10.
However, over the medium to long-term,
this new facility will allow us to capitalise
on significant opportunities in the
aerospace composites market, including
servicing the JSF build, the world’s
largest military jet programme.
Across the Group we have taken early
action to improve efficiency and reduce
costs against a difficult commercial
backdrop. Although CML is likely to
record a drop in revenues, we expect
Labtech Microwave to make good
progress in the current year. This,
together with the underlying strength
of Paradise Datacom and a reduction
in head office costs, gives us confidence
for a resilient performance in the coming
financial year.

Chief
Executive’s
Review 
Ian Brodie
 Chief Executive’s Review
Intelek recorded an encouraging
performance in what was a turbulent
year in terms of the global economy.
Underlying profit before tax increased by
23% on a sales increase of 9% on the
previous year. Our strategy of targeting
Government sectors, adopted across
all our three businesses after the last
downturn, has proved to be successful,
particularly so in the last twelve months.
n In satellite communications, Paradise
Datacom’s sales were 20% ahead
of last year, helped substantially
by the improved dollar exchange
rate and by Government/military
programmes that offset the global
softening of demand for commercial
telecoms. The prospects for satellite
communications remain exciting
with strong fundamental drivers:
progression towards HDTV,
increased use of the internet, a
strong demand from the defence
sector and the spread of mobile/
cellular telephony in developing
countries.
n In microwave components, Labtech
continued its strategic transformation
into a defence and air traffic control
components business, replacing
former telecommunications sales
with new orders from Government
equipment manufacturers, including
£2.3 million of orders for phased
array radar systems.
n In aerospace, CML won further
business on the world’s largest
military jet programme, the Joint
Strike Fighter, and benefited
from increased sales from our
core customer base where we
have a number of long-standing
relationships.
“An encouraging performance in a turbulent year.
The Group remains well positioned and we look to 
the future with confidence.”

Satellite
communications
Paradise Datacom 
John Restivo President
 Sales £18.3 million (2008: £15.3 million)
Operating Profit £3.6 million (2008: £3.2 million)
Paradise Datacom has a global
presence, headquartered in State
College, Pennsylvania and with
additional locations in Essex (UK),
Atlanta (Georgia), Phoenix (Arizona),
Beijing (China) and Bangkok
(Thailand), and representatives in
all other major territories. Paradise
Datacom manufactures a broad
range of products that are used in
satellite-based telecommunications
systems. Satellite communications
is a multi $billion industry. Paradise
Datacom serves the ground station
portion, supplying a market currently
estimated at $400 million.
Satellites provide a unique benefit
to telecommunications operators in
that they lack many of the obstacles
faced by terrestrial-based alternatives,
including point-to-point microwave
towers, pole-mounted copper
cables and optical fibre. With an
unobstructed view of the satellite,
a ground terminal can be installed
quickly and with relative ease allowing
links and networks the ability to “go
live” with minimal difficulty and delay.
In a point-to-multipoint scenario,
where a large area such as an entire
continent is the target recipient of a
voice, video or data service, satellite-
delivery as a broadcast medium
is virtually unchallenged. Satellites
are critical for mobile applications
such as satellite news gathering
(SNG) vehicles and military flyway
terminals. The global demand for
ever increasing volumes of data, for
example for high definition, internet
and remote monitoring and control,
drive investment in new technologies.
Paradise Datacom products cover
essential elements used in most
satellite ground stations and provide
new technological solutions with
continuous investment in research
and development.
The diverse Paradise Datacom
product portfolio is broken into
two basic categories and includes
both radio-frequency (RF) products
and satellite modems. Satellite
modems manufactured by Paradise
Datacom have been expanded into
three product lines consisting of
Evolution, Vision and the most recent
introduction, Quantum. Evolution
addresses conventional point-to-point
applications; Vision targets Digital
Television Broadcast operators;
Quantum, the Company’s most
sophisticated and versatile modem,
incorporates elements of both
Evolution and Vision as well as a host
of other unique features pioneered by
Paradise Datacom.
Since satellite lease charges can
represent up to 30% of a network
operator’s running costs, products
and technologies that provide
bandwidth savings are in great
demand. In mid 2009/10, Paradise
Datacom will begin shipping modems
with two new technologies, Sat-Abis,
an optimiser for cellular network
operators, and ViaSat’s patented
Paired Carrier Multiple Access
(PCMA) technology embedded.
PCMA allows satellite ground station
operators the potential to cut their
satellite lease costs in half, by
overlapping both the transmit and
the receive carriers to transmit data,
using echo cancellation.
Paradise Datacom’s RF product range
is one of the most extensive available
in the industry. It consists of solid
state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with
output power levels from 10 watts
to 8,000 watts, Block Upconverters
(BUCs) and low-noise amplifiers
(LNAs). Recent product innovations
include PowerMAX, vBUC, Gallium
Nitride-based SSPA module
architectures and an expanding range
of Ka-band amplifiers. These ensure
a continuation of Paradise Datacom’s
position at the forefront of technology
and developments in the satellite
amplifier market.

16329 22/07/2009 Proof 6
Sales/Head ($000)
Paradise Datacom produced another
record performance with profit up by
15%, helped by the strengthening of the
US$ where the average rate of $1.71/£
compared favourably with the prior
year average of $2.01/£. Sustained by
Government business in many countries
across the world, Paradise Datacom’s
dollar sales increased by 2% despite
the weakening commercial market.
With margins steady at 20% of sales,
2008/09 recorded an impressive financial
performance especially when taking
into account the additional investment
made in front-end sales resources and
increased engineering capability.
During the past year, as part of an
ongoing effort to increase market share
and expand brand recognition, Paradise
Datacom opened engineering and sales
offices in Thailand and China and a
service centre in India. This has resulted
in greater visibility of regional sales
opportunities and has given Paradise
Datacom access to large-scale operators
who require a local presence in order
to provide product repair, operational
training and post-sales support. As a
consequence, sales to the territories
covered by these offices increased by
£1.5 million in 2008/09.
In addition to the Asian expansion, an
engineering facility was established in
Phoenix, Arizona enabling Paradise
Datacom to capitalise on the abundance
of local engineers with skills relevant
to Paradise Datacom’s market focus.
These new facilities complement our
existing operations in State College,
Pennsylvania.
Paradise Datacom’s modem range has
been expanded and now consists of
Evolution, Vision and the most recent
introduction, Quantum. The Evolution
modem addresses conventional point-
to-point applications including open
network standards i.e. international
business services and backhaul links
such as those used in cellular networks.
The Vision modem targets Digital
Television Broadcast operators and
meets global digital video broadcasting
standards (DVB-S/DVB-S2). Quantum,
our most sophisticated and versatile
modem, incorporates elements of both
Evolution and Vision as well as a series
of integrated test and monitoring facilities
pioneered by Paradise Datacom, that are
accessible remotely via the internet.
Our facility in State College in the
USA has also broadened its range of
amplifiers to meet the ever changing
demands being placed on the satellite
communications industry by government
and commercial customers. The
introduction into operational service of
the first two Wideband Gapfiller satellites,
with the forecast of up to a dozen more,
has released what is certain to be a
significant rise in the demand for X and
Ka-band products by US and foreign
government agencies who already
account for more than 50% of Paradise
Datacom’s business.
Key Performance Indicators
Three key ratios for each of the operating companies 
have been selected to highlight performance movement 
in the last three years with brief explanatory comments 
where necessary.
(a) Sales per head reduced slightly following the next 
phase of investment in sales and engineering 
resources.
(b) The 2008 stock level was unusually low given the
demands of the industry for fast response.
Nevertheless, the 2009 level is higher than planned
and should be reduced during the first half of 2009/10.
(c) Strong margins continued the excellent record of 
return on capital employed.

Satellite
communications 
Paradise Datacom
Some of the major programmes won
by Paradise Datacom during the year
included:
n A multi-year retrofit programme for
government transportable earth
stations using C, Ku and X-band
SSPAs was perhaps the most
significant award. Approximately
$2.2 million has been shipped to date
with significant follow-on anticipated
during the course of the current
calendar year.
n A $2 million order was received at the
end of the financial year from a major
US systems integrator for the initial
phase of a large NATO programme.
n Europe’s Galileo and China’s
Compass global positioning satellite
networks placed orders for ground
control amplifiers for their satellite
constellations totalling approximately
$1 million.
n A major satellite system operator
in Asia purchased $1.5 million in
high-power solid state amplifiers to
replace ageing tube amplifiers, with
another $0.5 million pending.
n An IP network operator in Western
Canada has also begun placing
orders for Paradise Datacom SSPAs
to replace existing products, with
total orders expected to surpass
$1 million in 2009.
n In addition, two of our recently
released products, the Quantum
modem and the vBUC amplifier, are
currently undergoing evaluation for
a significant upgrade to an existing
network in Alaska.
Paradise Datacom has one of the most
extensive product offerings of any SSPA
(solid state power amplifier) and Modem
manufacturer in the industry. Recently
released product innovations should
ensure a continued increase in RF market
share. These include PowerMAX, the
highest power, most versatile SSPA on
the market, vBUC (Block Up Converters)
and the incorporation of the latest high-
power components (Gallium Nitride)
into a new range of SSPA modules. In
addition, Paradise Datacom will soon
be launching an expanded range of Low
Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) and Ka-band
SSPA product lines. On the satellite
modem side, attention will be focused
on products that optimise bandwidth,
giving customers significant cost
savings. Sat-Abis, for cellular backhaul
applications, has been released recently,
and Paired Carrier Multiple Access
(PCMA) is expected to be launched mid-
year 2009/10, under licence from ViaSat.
Paradise Datacom will continue to
update its product portfolio to meet the
needs of the customer base it serves.

the design, manufacture, assembly and
test of MMIC (monolithic microwave
integrated circuits) packages and
microwave components. Microwave
circuits and components are
manufactured in prototype and
medium to high volumes for major
defence, telecommunication, ATC
(air traffic control) and space system
customers worldwide.
Labtech Microwave’s extensively
equipped printed circuit boards
processing plant is based in a purpose-
built facility in Presteigne, Wales and its
component design and build facility is in
Milton Keynes.
Labtech Microwave’s printed circuit
board technology is focused on the
processing of high performance
PTFE (Teflon) microwave substrates
with plated through holes and high
specification wire bondable plating
finishes. Circuit layers can be bonded
together in a multilayer construction
and include precision machined metal
backing for high frequency applications
such as broadband digital radio links,
microwave power amplifiers and
phased array radar antennas. The
printed circuit board technology covers
applications from low microwave
frequencies (~1GHz) to millimetre-
wave frequencies (up to 94GHz) where
circuit feature tolerances require the
most advanced processing techniques
including laser profiling.
Labtech Microwave exploits its 20
years experience in design and
manufacture of a range of high-end
broadband microwave components
mainly for the European defence
market. Using high accuracy thin
film ceramic circuit manufacturing
capability, Labtech Microwave
produces multioctave microwave
amplifiers, switches and detector log
video amplifiers (DLVAs). In the last
3 years or so Labtech Microwave,
utilising the latest microwave circuit
technology at Presteigne, has
embarked on a plan to develop
a broad range of components to
address key market sectors. Products
including DLVAs, amplifiers and
switches have been established
and are being routinely sold into
the defence markets. Development
work started during the year to
produce a Ka-Band LNA for the
SatCom market which is being
marketed by Paradise Datacom.
The combination of precision
circuit machining (including laser
technology), advanced automatic
chemical processing and component
design, assembly and test gives
Labtech Microwave a leading world-
class capability. By integrating these
capabilities Labtech Microwave is able
to address successfully the emerging
markets of MMIC packaging and
phased array radar where the ability to
manufacture and test these advanced
microwave circuits is key.

Microwave components
and manufacturing 
services 
Labtech Microwave
During the year, Labtech Microwave
continued its transformation into a
defence and air traffic control (ATC)
components business with both these
key market segments showing significant
growth. As anticipated, sales into the
telecom radio link market reduced
by nearly 25% year on year which
resulted in overall sales reducing by
£0.6 million. The second half of the
year was progressively affected by
the worsening economic conditions,
particularly in the commercial telecoms
market. In addition, the order placement
of a large defence contract and the start
of a substantial ATC project were delayed
to the end of the year which resulted
in a break-even on trading profit
(2008: £0.15 million). The 12 month
book to bill has been maintained
at 1.06:1.
Further important contract wins in the
European AESA/Phased Array radar
market amounted to £2.3 million, of
which £1.2 million was shipped during
the year. These radars are becoming
the preferred option for military use
as they offer significant weight and
cost advantages when compared with
mechanically steered radars and provide
the very high performance capability
needed for today’s military operations.
Management estimate that the total
annual market is $2 billion and it is
forecast to grow at 20% per annum.
Labtech Microwave’s addressable
portion of this market is estimated
at £80 million. Our multilayer printed
circuit boards are manufactured at the
Presteigne site and then assembled and
tested at the Milton Keynes location.
This integrated capability has proved
to have significant market appeal with
Labtech Microwave now involved in
many key phased array programmes
throughout Europe.
Labtech Microwave has also enhanced
its position in other areas of the defence
market via its ranges of amplifiers,
specialist microwave switches and
Sales/Head (£000)
Key Performance Indicators
(a) Sales per head were affected by the continued 
reduction in volume telecommunications business.
(b) Labtech carries a relatively low level of stock, 
though this has increased as a consequence of the 
increase in defence and component sales.
(c) Break-even result for the year.

crystal polymer substrates, are now 
routinely used especially for millimetre 
wave applications (e.g. 60 and 94GHz) 
for very high capacity radio links and 
highly sensitive detectors in the security 
and industrial markets.
The business also continues to pursue 
opportunities in other microwave 
markets as it moves away from the 
commodity driven telecom business. 
During the last year, Labtech Microwave 
has substantially increased its sales of 
specialist microwave circuits into the air 
traffic control market - for both defence 
and commercial applications. Towards 
the end of the financial year, Labtech 
was awarded a contract which will lead 
to significant business growth in this 
market sector. Orders to date under 
this contract have already exceeded 
£1 million. As part of this new contract, 
Labtech Microwave has installed and 
commissioned an autoclave at its 
Presteigne facility which will enable it to 
produce multilayer antenna elements up 
to 6 feet long.
The growing high frequency Ka-Band 
SatCom market already utilises Labtech 
Microwave’s high precision circuit 
board processing capability. These 
skills, together with the design and 
manufacturing expertise of the Milton 
Keynes site, are being employed to 
develop a Ka-Band Low Noise Amplifier 
(LNA) for the SatCom market. This 
amplifier is being sold and promoted by 
Paradise Datacom in the USA.
Looking ahead, Labtech Microwave 
will continue to grow its defence and 
air traffic control business (already 
more than 50% of sales) offset in part 
by further reductions in the telecom 
business levels leaving a modest growth 
in total sales year on year. In line with 
the changing business needs, cost 
reductions were implemented at the end 
of the year and, together with a higher 
margin product mix, it is expected that 
profitability will improve as the 2009/10 
year progresses. 
Ka-band Low Noise Amplifier, designed by Labtech Microwave for Paradise Datacom
Detector Log Video Amplifiers (DLVAs). 
Currently, Labtech Microwave is 
developing new DLVAs which operate 
at higher frequencies and have faster 
response times. DLVAs are used as part 
of an electronic surveillance system 
to detect incoming threats, requiring 
nano-second response times to trigger 
defensive solutions.
The anticipated decline in Labtech 
Microwave’s telecommunication sales 
continued during the year, although 
a focus on the higher-end radio link 
market helped stabilise the decline. Sales 
reduced 25% in 2008/09 as a leading 
European OEM completed its strategy 
of sourcing from the Far East. However, 
Labtech Microwave’s capabilities 
remain in demand for the very high-end 
products and from the smaller radio link 
suppliers who value Labtech’s more 
complete service offering including 
MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated 
Circuit) packaging and assembly of the 
microwave transceivers. These high 
performance packages, utilising liquid

Aerostructures
CML 
Geoff Stewart Managing Director
 Sales £13.9 million (2008: £12.9 million)
Operating Profit £2.0 million (2008: £1.8 million)
CML Group manufactures machined, 
composite and sheet metal 
components and assemblies for 
aerostructures and aircraft systems 
and its customers include Airbus UK, 
APPH, BAe Systems, GE Aviation, 
GKN Aerospace, Hawker Beechcraft, 
Mecachrome, Senior Aerospace, and 
Westland Helicopters.
The Group has four divisions located 
on two sites in Birkenhead in the 
North West of England with a third 
site being planned to re-locate and 
expand the Group’s composite 
capability.
The Precision Machining Division is 
focused on 4 and 5-axis machining of 
aluminium and hard metals. Principal 
products, covering almost the full 
range of Airbus commercial and 
military aircraft, include interspar ribs 
and ancillary components, landing 
gear rib supports, sidestay fittings 
and links, underwing access panels, 
engine thrust fittings and aft mounting 
brackets etc. Components for military 
and rotary wing aircraft are also 
supplied to other customers.
The Composites Division specialises 
in the manufacture and repair of 
glass and carbon fibre components 
and assemblies. Products include 
various wing and fuselage fairings, 
covers, and panels, nose and tail 
cone assemblies, air-conditioning 
ducts, flooring etc. The division has a 
significant presence on a number of 
new-build programmes, particularly 
the F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike 
Fighter), the Hawker 987 business 
jet and the Future Lynx helicopter 
whilst spares and other new build 
requirements are supplied for a 
variety of civil, business and military 
aircraft programmes.
The Fabrication Division’s two 
main revenue streams are from the 
manufacture of extruded fuselage 
and wing stringers for the Hawker 
987 build programme and from its 
position as a key supplier of sheet 
metal spare parts for Airbus’ in-
service fleet. 
The Treatments Division provides 
a comprehensive in-house surface 
treatments capability not only to the 
other three Divisions but also to a 
valuable external customer base.

CML performed at record levels in 
2008/09 with an improvement in 
operating profit of 15% over the previous 
year on an increase in sales of 8%. As a 
result of the continued drive to improve 
performance and reduce waste, CML 
has increased its return on sales to 
15% (2008: 14%) delivering an excellent 
return on capital employed of 47% 
(2008: 43%).
During the last quarter of the financial 
year, we have seen a slow-down in 
order intake as a result of the global 
recession and, in particular, the business 
jet sector for which CML is a supplier 
through the Hawker Beechcraft 987 
programme. Throughout the year the 
precision machining division has seen 
levels of business for large commercial 
aircraft holding steady with forecasts 
going forward from Airbus showing build 
rates continuing at a similar level for the 
coming year. Sales for the Composites 
division were 22% up on the previous 
financial year on the back of strong 
demand from key customers Airbus, 
Hawker Beechcraft and BAe Systems. 
This included some £0.7 million of 
orders from BAe Systems on the F35 
Joint Strike Fighter programme. The 
fabrications division’s sales increased by 
30% on the previous year with the higher 
margin spares business growing by 73% 
to £0.8 million. The treatments division’s 
external sales were 10% down on the 
previous financial year as a consequence 
of the emphasis placed on supporting 
CML’s internal requirements.

Aerostructures 
CML
Health, Safety and the 
Environment
Build rates have reduced sharply for 
corporate jets and flattened off for 
commercial jets. However, the long-
term drivers for growth are expected to 
support recovery in the years ahead. 
CML will manage its cost base in the 
face of a short-term drop in demand, 
whilst developing the spares business 
and continuing to implement our strategy 
to expand the composites division to 
support the market evolution towards the 
use of lightweight composite structures. 
During 2009 a new 60,000 square foot 
composites facility is set to be opened, 
supported by grant funding through the 
North West Development Agency.
This new facility will elevate CML’s 
position in the industry, providing 
additional capacity and capability to 
support the increase in build rates on 
packages we currently manufacture for 
the Joint Strike Fighter programme and 
to develop further opportunities on UAVs 
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for which we 
took our first orders from BAe Systems 
this year. This, combined with the 
increased use of composites for the next 
generation of commercial and business 
aircraft, will put CML in a strong position 
within an aerospace industry that shows 
significant opportunities for growth in 
the long term.
The new 60,000 sq ft Composites facility, due to open towards the end of 2009
Intelek continues to invest in the training 
and development of staff at all levels and 
remains committed to the highest levels 
of husbandry of the local environment 
and care of employees. Our aim is to 
minimise waste, use valuable resources 
efficiently and prevent damage to the 
environment. Both our manufacturing 
companies which employ the use of 
chemical processes are approved to the 
international environmental standard 
ISO 14001. In addition, these two 
operating companies have been 
surveyed by the Carbon Trust and 
are implementing their energy-saving 
recommendations.

Outlook
The PowerMax, the world’s highest power solid state amplifier 
At the time of writing this report, we are 
two months into our new financial year 
and continue to experience considerable 
uncertainty in our commercial market-
place although Government-funded 
programmes, which are particularly 
important to Paradise Datacom and 
Labtech Microwave, remain resilient. 
Timing of contract wins, however, can 
be somewhat difficult to predict. Our 
aerospace division, CML, will be affected 
by the well-documented issues in the 
corporate jet market. 
Our strategy of targeting Government 
sectors continues to reap rewards and 
major defence opportunities across 
the Group are increasing. We have 
implemented cost reductions throughout 
the Group in anticipation of reduced 
commercial demand, whilst preserving 
our ability to reinstate capacity once we 
signs of recovery. Based on our first two 
months of trading, we expect our first 
half to be lower than last year. However 
the release of Paradise Datacom’s new 
modem and amplifier products, together 
with the level of enquiries being fielded 
on Government programme, indicate 
that we should see an improved second 
half to the year. The Group remains well 
positioned in its key areas of satellite 
communications and we look forward to 
the future with confidence.

 Financial 
Review
Kevin Edwards
 “Underlying PBT increased by 23%. 
Underlying EPS now 3.32p up from 1.33p in 2005.”
Results
Underlying operating profit for the 
financial year to 31 March 2009 
increased by 21% to £4.6 million 
on sales up 9%, with gross margin 
increasing to 32% from 31%. After 
a £0.1 million increase in net finance 
costs, underlying profit before tax 
increased by 23% to £4.1 million, 
10.4% of sales.
Research and development costs
R&D investment at Paradise Datacom 
increased to £2.3 million, 12% of 
sales, as in the previous year. Labtech 
Microwave also increased its R&D 
investment, from £0.2 million to 
£0.4 million.
Exchange rate
Our principal subsidiary, Paradise 
Datacom LLC, reports its results in 
US dollars and these are translated at 
average exchange rates. This year the 
rate dropped 15% from $2.01 to $1.71. 
Taken together with the increased 
cost for US$ linked materials in our 
UK-based operations, the overall 
effect was a net increase in sales 
of £2.7 million and in underlying profit 
before tax of £0.5 million. The Group 
does not hedge directly against gains 
or losses on translation of the result, 
but does maintain a large portion of 
its bank debt in US dollars as a partial 
hedge against the net assets invested in 
Paradise Datacom LLC.
Finance costs
Interest costs reduced to £0.3 million 
(2008: £0.5 million) due to lower 
prevailing interest rates and lower 
average net debt. Measured against 
underlying operating profit, interest 
cover rose to 18.8 times (2008: 8.5 
times). Pension finance costs are the 
notional charges on the Group’s defined 
benefit pension scheme, representing 
the net of the expected return on 
scheme assets and interest on scheme 
obligations. This is computed by the 
scheme actuary and can fluctuate, as 
demonstrated this year by the increase 
to £0.3 million (2008: £0.1 million). The 
net cost for 2009/10 is projected by 
the actuary to increase to £0.5 million, 
primarily due to higher discount rates 
and the lower level of scheme assets.
Exceptional operating items
The Group incurred £0.4 million in 
exceptional operating items in the year. 
The main item was the restructuring 
at Labtech Microwave, with further 
changes consequent on the decline 
of its volume telecom business. This 
included £0.4 million as an impairment 
charge for assets affected by the 
change in production requirements 
and £0.1 million for personnel costs. 
Offsetting these costs was a £0.1 million 
gain associated with a pension transfer 
project initiated during the year.
Taxation
The effective tax rate on underlying 
profit increased from 29% to 31%, 
reflecting the increasing importance of 
the Group’s US operations, which bear 
a higher local tax rate than the UK’s 
28%. We expect the effective tax rate in 
2009/10 to be in the range of 32%-34%.

Earnings per share
Basic EPS increased 7% to 2.97p. 
Underlying EPS increased 19% from 
2.78p to 3.32p, continuing the growth 
trend of the last five years. In the year to 
31 March 2005, the first year reported 
under IFRS, underlying EPS was 1.33p.
Pension
The fall in the equity markets during 
the period led to a sharp reduction in 
the Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme assets to £10.2 million 
(2008: £13.9 million), as valued at 
31 March 2009 by the scheme actuary. 
Liabilities also reduced to £16.3 million 
(2008: £19.1 million), following changes 
to the discount and inflation rates and a 
review of the membership data that 
more than offset the increase for 
updated mortality assumptions. In 
addition, we made a second offer to 
members to transfer out of the scheme 
and, by the year-end, 29 members had 
accepted, reducing the liability by £0.5 
million. The net outcome was an 
increase in the deficit to £6.1 million, 
before tax (2008: £5.2 million). The 
Company has recently agreed with the 
trustees of the scheme to maintain 
the annual contribution at £0.8 million 
for the next three years, increasing 
to £0.9 million for the seven years 
thereafter, plus, in both cases, 
contributions to cover scheme 
expenses.
Cash flow
Net debt reduced by £0.1 million to 
£3.8 million. Cash generated from 
operations of £3.2 million was down 
on the previous year’s £4.1 million, 
primarily due to investment in inventory 
at Paradise Datacom to support product 
and market development. This was 
mitigated by lower tax and interest 
payments to bring net cash from 
operating activities to £2.5 million 
(2008: £2.7 million). Capital investments 
in the business, including assets 
on finance lease, were increased to 
£1.4 million (2008: £1.1 million) in 
particular to support the new sales 
and engineering offices at Paradise 
Datacom. £0.3 million was invested 
at CML (net of £0.1 million grant), 
£0.4 million at Labtech Microwave 
and £0.7 million at Paradise Datacom, 
of which £0.2 million was for third 
party R&D.
Shareholder’s equity
In addition to the net profit for the year 
of £2.5 million, £0.9 million was credited 
direct to equity for foreign exchange 
gains made on consolidating US$ 
denominated assets, £1.4 million was 
charged for net actuarial losses on the 
defined benefit pension scheme and 
£0.4 million was charged for dividends 
paid in the year.

The results for the year are set out 
on page 33. The profit on continuing 
ordinary activities before taxation 
amounts to £3,663,000 (2008: 
£3,309,000). An interim dividend of 
0.165p (2008: 0.15p) per Ordinary Share 
was paid on 21 January 2009. A final 
dividend of 0.30p (2008: 0.30p) per 
share is recommended for approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 11 
September 2009. It is proposed that this 
should be paid on 23 September 2009 to 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 28 August 2009.
Research and development activities
The Group continued to invest in new 
product development, primarily in 
satellite communications and microwave 
components.
Key performance indicators
Key performance indicators are set 
out and explained for each business 
segment in the Chief Executive’s Review.
Principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group
The Annual Report contains certain 
forward-looking statements. These 
statements are made by the Directors 
in good faith, based on the information 
available to them up to the time of 
approval of this report. Actual results 
may differ from those expressed in such 
statements, depending on a variety of 
factors. These factors include customer 
acceptance of the Group’s products; 
changes in customer requirements 
and in levels of demand in the 
market; restrictions to market access; 
competitive pressure on pricing, delivery 
or technology; global defence spending 
levels; delays or additional cost in 
product design and launch programmes; 
fluctuations in manufacturing delivery 
performance, yields and costs; the 
loss or lack of key personnel; overall 
economic conditions.
The world is currently experiencing 
unprecedented economic events and this 
is affecting everyone to a varying degree 
and we will not be immune. 
The Group mitigates against these risks 
by the diversity of its product range and 
markets and its sizeable investment in 
products, skills and market development. 
The Group’s senior management visit 
each business regularly and monitor the 
forward performance and prospects.
As part of the Group’s risk management 
process, each business assesses the 
likelihood and potential adverse impact 
of these various risks and prepares 
action programmes prioritised to mitigate 
the overall impact. This is explained in 
more detail in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 26 to 28.
Financial instruments
The Group’s operations expose it to a 
variety of financial risks including the 
effects of changes in interest rates on 
debt, foreign currency exchange rates, 
credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s principal financial 
instruments comprise cash and bank 
deposits, bank loans and overdrafts 
and obligations under finance leases 
together with trade receivables and 
trade payables that arise directly from 
its operations.
The main risks arising from the 
Company’s financial instruments can be 
analysed as follows:
Price risk
The Group has no significant exposure 
to securities price risk, except indirectly 
through its responsibility for the Group 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed in its trading 
operations to the risk of changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. 
The main foreign currencies in which 
the Group operates are the euro 
and the US dollar. The Group has 
used derivative instruments in its 
management of this risk.
The Group holds US$825,000 forward 
foreign currency contracts at 31 March 
2009. Further description is given in 
note 32 of these financial statements in 
respect of the accounting treatment of 
these derivative instruments.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets 
are bank balances, cash, and trade 
receivables, which represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk in 
relation to financial assets.
Credit risk is managed by monitoring 
the aggregate amount and duration 
of exposure to any one customer 
depending upon their credit rating. The 
amounts presented in the balance sheet 
are net of allowances for doubtful debts, 
estimated by the Group’s management 
based on prior experience and their 
assessment of the current economic 
environment.
The Group has no significant 
concentration of credit risk, with 
exposure spread over a large number of 
customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited 
because the counterparties are banks 
with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies.

 Directors’ Report continued
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy has been to ensure 
continuity of funding through acquiring 
an element of the Group’s fixed assets 
under finance leases, and arranging 
funding for operations via medium-term 
loans and additional revolving credit 
facilities to aid short-term flexibility.
 Cash flow interest rate risk
Interest bearing assets comprise cash 
and bank deposits, all of which earn 
interest at a market rate. The interest 
rate on bank borrowings is at market 
rate and the Group’s policy is to keep 
the bank borrowings within defined limits 
such that the risk that could arise from a 
significant change in interest rates would 
not have a material impact on cash 
flows. The Group’s policy is to maintain 
other borrowings at fixed rates to fix the 
amount of future interest cash flows. 
The Directors monitor the overall level of 
borrowings and interest costs to limit any 
adverse effects on financial performance 
of the Group.
Environment
The Group’s policy with regard to 
the environment is to ensure that we 
understand and effectively manage 
the actual and potential environmental 
impact of our activities. Our operations 
are conducted such that we comply 
with all legal requirements relating to 
the environment in all areas where we 
carry out our business. During the period 
covered by this report the Group has not 
incurred any significant fines or penalties 
or been investigated for any significant 
breach of environmental regulations.
The principal business segments 
for which environmental matters are 
relevant in reviewing the Group are CML 
and Labtech, and comments in this 
respect are contained within the Chief 
Executive’s Review on page 16.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued 
share capital, together with details of the 
movements in the Company’s issued 
share capital during the year, are shown 
in note 23. The Company has one class 
of ordinary shares, which carry no right 
to fixed income. Each share carries the 
right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the 
size of a holding nor on the transfer of 
shares, which are both governed by 
the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are 
set out in note 23 and 24.
No person has any special rights over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued 
shares are fully paid.
With regard to the appointment and 
replacement of Directors and the extent 
of the powers of the Directors, the 
Company is governed by its Articles 
of Association, the Companies Acts 
and related legislation. See also the 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 
26 to 28. The power of the Directors 
to instigate the issue or buy-back of 
shares by the Company is governed 
by the Articles and the resolution of 
shareholders. The Articles may be 
amended by special resolution of the 
shareholders.
As at 10 June 2009, the Directors have 
been notified of the following interests 
amounting to 3% or more of the issued 
share capital of the Company:
Rights & Issues

shareholder, Rights & Issues Investment 
Trust plc.
There are no non-beneficial interests. 
There have been no changes in the 
above Directors’ interests in the period 
to 10 June 2009. 
The Directors’ options to subscribe for 
shares under the Executive and other 
share option schemes are set out in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 31.
Payment of creditors
The Group’s policy for the year ending 
31 March 2010, for all suppliers, is to 
fix terms of payment for each business 
transaction, to ensure that the supplier 
is aware of those terms, and to abide 
by the agreed terms of payment. The 
Company had no trade creditors.
Donations
The Group did not make any political 
or charitable donations in the year 
(2008: £Nil).
Employee involvement
During the year the Group has 
continued its policy of full involvement 
of employees wherever possible. This 
has taken place through the provision 
of information, consultation on policy 
issues where appropriate, and the 
mutual setting of objectives against 
which performance is measured. The 
16329INTELEK.indd   22 23/07/2009   13:34  www.intelek.plc.uk
16329 22/07/2009 Proof 6
23
Group takes the approach of maximising 
performance through the heightening of 
awareness of corporate objectives and 
policies.
Disabled persons
It is the Group’s policy to offer equal 
opportunities to disabled persons 
applying for vacancies, having regard 
to their abilities in relation to the job 
for which they apply. It is also Group 
practice, wherever possible, to continue 
the employment of any employees who 
become disabled during the course of 
their employment.
Special business
A resolution will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to renew the 
existing authority of the Directors, 
conferred by a resolution passed in 
September 2008, to allot unissued 
shares in the Company. The authority 
(resolution 7 in the Notice of Meeting) 
will extend until the earlier of the Annual 
General Meeting for 2010 and fifteen 
months from the date of the Annual 
General Meeting for 2009.
The Company was authorised at the 
Annual General Meeting in September 
2008 to purchase up to 10% of its 
issued Ordinary Shares, subject to 
certain restrictions. This authority has 
not yet been exercised, but the Directors 
consider that purchases by the Company 
of its Ordinary Shares for cancellation 
could in certain circumstances be 
advantageous to Shareholders, and are 
accordingly seeking the renewal of the 
authority (resolution 8 in the Notice of 
Meeting) to extend until the earlier of 
the Annual General Meeting for 2010 
and fifteen months from the date of 
the Annual General Meeting for 2009. 
This authority will only be exercised if 
to do so would result in an increase in 
earnings per share. Under the proposed 
authority, the maximum price payable 
for the purchase of shares shall not 
exceed 5% above the average of the 
middle market quotations taken from The 
London Stock Exchange Official List for 
the five business days before a purchase 
is made, and the minimum price shall be 
5p per share.
In addition, the Directors consider it 
advisable that they continue to have 
power to make allotments of Ordinary 
Shares in the Company for cash, up to a 
maximum of 4,368,804 Ordinary Shares, 
being 5% of the issued Ordinary Share 
Capital of the Company at 31 March 
2009. The authority (resolution 9 in the 
Notice of Meeting) will extend until the 
earlier of the Annual General Meeting for 
2010 and fifteen months from the date of 
the Annual General Meeting for 2009.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors 
have decided at the time of approving 
the financial statements that there 
is a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
The current economic conditions create 
uncertainty for all businesses. The 
Group’s trading and cash flow forecasts 
take into account a range of possible 
changes in trading performance and 
show that the Group should be able to 
operate within its existing cash resources 
and bank facilities. The Group has held 
discussions with its bankers about its 
future requirements and no matters have 
been drawn to its attention to suggest 
renewal may not be forthcoming on 
acceptable terms. For this reason, 
the Directors continue to prepare 
the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.
Auditor
So far as the Directors are aware, there 
is no relevant information needed by 
the Company’s auditor in connection 
with preparing their report of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware. A 
resolution to reappoint Grant Thornton 
UK LLP as auditor will be proposed at 
the forthcoming AGM.
Approval
The Report of the Directors was 
approved by the Board on 10 June 2009 
and signed on its behalf by:
K N Edwards
Director and Secretary

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
 The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements of the Group and 
the Parent Company in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare statements for each 
financial year.
The Directors have elected to prepare 
the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the EU and to prepare the financial 
statements for the Parent Company 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
The financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and of the 
Parent Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
n select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
n make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and
n for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU. 
n for the Parent Company financial 
statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice. 
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring that the Parent Company and 
the Group maintain proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Parent Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Parent Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

Corporate Governance Report
 Combined Code
As a company listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market of the London Stock 
Exchange, Intelek plc is not required to 
comply with the Combined Code (‘the 
Code’). However, the Directors have 
adopted the Code as best practice and 
seek to comply to the extent practicable 
for the size of the Company and its 
operations. A statement on how the 
Company has applied the principles 
and a statement explaining the extent 
to which it has complied with the 
provisions of the Code appear below. 
The Code contains fourteen principles of 
governance, which are divided into the 
following six areas:
1. Directors
The Company is controlled through 
a Board of Directors, which presently 
comprises three executive and two 
non-executive Directors. David Bramwell 
is non-executive Chairman, Ian Brodie 
is Chief Executive, Kevin Edwards is 
Finance Director and John Restivo is 
President of the Company’s subsidiary 
Paradise Datacom LLC. Donald Wilson 
is the Senior Independent non-executive 
Director. All Directors will submit 
themselves for re-election at least every 
three years. Appointments to the Board 
are made on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee.
The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved to it and meets at least 
eleven times a year. It is responsible 
for overall Group strategy, policy 
on corporate governance issues, 
acquisition policy, approval of major 
capital expenditure and consideration 
of significant financial and operational 
matters. It monitors the exposure to key 
business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the trading subsidiaries, their 
annual budgets and progress towards 
the achievement of those budgets and 
their investment programmes. It also 
considers legislative, environmental, 
health and safety and employment 
issues. The Board has approved a 
written statement of the division of key 
responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman leads the Board, ensuring 
that each Director is able to make an 
effective contribution. He also monitors 
the information provided to the Board to 
ensure it is sufficient, timely and clear, 
and from time to time the Board reviews 
the adequacy of this information.
The Board held twelve meetings during 
2008/09, other than those required for 
specific approvals (for example, bank 
mandates and annual accounts). The 
attendances were:
David Bramwell 12
Ian Brodie 12
Kevin Edwards 12
John Restivo (since appointment) 2
Donald Wilson 12
Two of the meetings were combined with 
visits to subsidiary Company operations 
and one included presentations by senior 
executives on their areas of responsibility. 
Individual visits to operational sites by 
non-executive Directors also occurred. In 
addition to the regular Board meetings, 
key financial information is circulated to 
Directors outside of meetings. The Chief 
Executive has regular direct contact with 
the non-executive Directors and keeps 
them informed of material developments 
between Board meetings.
All Directors have direct access to the 
Company Secretary and are able to take 
independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties if necessary. 
The Company maintains Directors’ & 
Officers’ insurance in respect of the risk 
of claims against Directors.
The Chairman held two meetings during 
the year with the non-executive Director, 
without the executive Directors being 
present. The Senior Independent Director 
held one meeting during the year with 
the other Directors, without the Chairman 
being present, to review the Chairman’s 
performance, as described in more detail 
below.
The Board has adopted an induction 
process for new Directors and this is 
facilitated by the Chief Executive and 
the Company Secretary. The Chairman 
ensures that all Directors receive 
appropriate training on appointment and 
then subsequently as needed, taking into 
account their need to update their skills 
and their knowledge of the Company’s 
business. 
The Board has established three 
standing committees, the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination 
Committee, which operate within defined 
terms of reference. Details may be 
obtained from the Company Secretary. 
The minutes of committee meetings are 
available to all the Directors. During the 
year, the Remuneration Committee met 
twice, the Audit Committee twice and 
the Nomination Committee once. All 
committee meetings were attended by 
all members of the relevant committee. 
The Board undertakes an annual 
evaluation of its performance and the 
performance of its committees and the 
individual Directors. This comprises:
n Appraisal of the other executive 
Directors by the Chief Executive
n Appraisal of the Chief Executive by 
the Senior Independent non-executive 
Director
n Appraisal of the Chairman and the 
other non-executive Directors and of 
the Board as a whole collectively by 
the Board
The appraisals focused on performance 
against objectives set for the past year, 
on establishing objectives for the new 
financial year and, for the Board, on its 
operation and effectiveness. The Board 
was satisfied that the process showed 
that the Board and its committees 
worked effectively.

Corporate Governance Report continued
2. Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee consists 
of the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent non-executive Director 
and meets at least twice a year. Its 
responsibilities include a review of the 
performance of executive Directors 
and other senior executives prior to 
determining their remuneration. The 
remuneration of the non-executive 
Directors is determined by the Board of 
Directors as a whole. No Director plays 
a part in the discussion about his own 
remuneration. 
The Remuneration Report is set out on 
pages 29 to 31. 
3. Nomination committee
The principal role of the Nomination 
Committee is to identify and nominate, 
for Board approval, candidates to fill 
Board vacancies as and when they arise. 
It is required to prepare a description of 
the role, and capabilities required, for any 
appointment, and to maintain contact 
with major shareholders about 
appointments to the Board. It also 
reviews the induction process for newly 
appointed Directors, reviews annually the 
time required of non-executive Directors, 
keeps the structure, size and composition 
of the Board under review, and considers 
Board succession planning for both 
executive and non-executive Directors. 
The committee comprises Donald Wilson 
(Chairman), David Bramwell, both 
considered to be Independent 
non-executive Directors, and 
Ian Brodie, Chief Executive. 
For Board appointments the committee 
seeks advice and recommendations from 
the Group’s lawyers, corporate finance 
advisers and auditors.
During the year, the committee reviewed 
the balance of experience on the Board 
and recommended to the Board that 
John Restivo be appointed to the Board.
The Chairman of the Nominations 
Committee will be available at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer any questions 
about the work of the committee.
4. Accountability and audit 
A review of the performance of the 
Group’s trading subsidiaries, of the 
financial position of the Group and of 
the Group’s prospects is included in 
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief 
Executive’s review and the Financial 
Review set out on pages 4 to 19. The 
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial 
statements are described on page 24. 
Internal Control
The Board of Directors is responsible for 
the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. In 
designing the system of internal control, 
consideration is given to the significant 
risks to the business, the probability 
of these risks manifesting themselves 
and the overall cost of controlling them. 
The system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failing 
to achieve business objectives and, 
therefore, can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The implementation and day-to-day 
operation of the system of internal 
controls has been delegated to executive 
Directors and senior management, 
but the effectiveness of the system 
is regularly reviewed by the Board 
in a process that accords with the 
Turnbull Report. As part of its corporate 
governance procedures, the Board has 
received regular reports on specific 
areas of risk. If appropriate, these 
reports include recommendations for 
improvement in controls or for the 
management of those risks. Furthermore, 
steps continue to be taken to integrate 
risk management procedures into the 
Group’s operations, to extend awareness 
of the importance of the management 
of risk and to ensure that recommended 
improvements brought to the attention 
of the Board are implemented. In 
conjunction with the Audit Committee, 
the Board has carried out an annual 
review of the overall effectiveness of 
the system of internal control and risk 
management procedures during the year 
and up until the date of approval of the 
annual report.
Audit committee and auditors
Role of the audit committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
n Monitoring the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group and any 
formal announcements relating to 
the Group’s financial performance, 
and reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements contained 
therein;
n Reviewing the Group’s internal 
financial controls and, unless 
expressly addressed by the Board 
itself, the Group’s internal control and 
risk management systems;
n Monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit operation;
n Making recommendations to the 
Board, for a resolution to be put to 
the shareholders for their approval 
in general meeting, in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditors 
and the approval of the remuneration 
and terms of engagement of the 
external auditors;
n Reviewing and monitoring the 
external auditors’ independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness 
of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional 
and regulatory requirements; 
n Developing and implementing a policy 
on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services, 
taking into account relevant guidance 
regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee is required to report 
its findings to the Board, identifying any 
matters in respect of which it considers 
that action or improvement is needed, 
and make recommendations as to the 
steps to be taken.

27
Composition of the audit committee
The Audit Committee comprises David 
Bramwell (Chairman) and Donald Wilson, 
both of whom served throughout the 
year. Both members of the committee 
are considered to be independent. 
David Bramwell has relevant financial 
experience.
Meetings and attendance
The committee met twice during 2008/09 
to consider, inter alia, the annual results, 
the interim results and the independence, 
objectivity and reappointment of the 
Auditors. Internal financial control 
systems were also considered at each 
meeting. The Chairman of the committee 
also invited the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director to attend each meeting 
and the internal auditor and external 
auditors to attend the meeting for the 
year’s results. During the latter meeting, 
the external auditors were given the 
opportunity to talk with the committee 
without the presence of management.
Main activities of the
committee during the year
At its meeting in May, the committee 
reviewed the annual financial statements 
of the Company and received reports 
from the internal auditors on control 
matters and from the external auditors on 
the conduct of their audit, their review of 
accounting policies, areas of judgement 
and the financial statements and their 
comments on risk and internal control. 
A similar review was undertaken at its 
November meeting when the interim 
statements were considered.
External auditors
The Company places great importance 
on the effectiveness and independence 
of its external auditors and, together with 
them, is careful to ensure their objectivity 
is not compromised. At its May meeting, 
the auditors presented to the committee 
the findings from their audit, together 
with details of how they ensure that 
their objectivity and independence are 
not compromised.
It is the role of the committee to ensure 
compliance with the Board’s policy in 
respect of services provided by, and 
fees paid to, the auditors. Audit fees are 
negotiated by the Finance Director and 
approved by the Audit Committee. For 
other services that may be provided by 
the auditors, the Company’s policy is:
Audit related services
The auditors are invited by the Company 
to undertake those services that they 
are required to and are most suited to 
perform. Such work would include AIM 
related reporting and, where appropriate, 
assistance with acquisitions.
Taxation
The external auditors assist the Group 
to meet general tax compliance 
requirements as well as providing 
advice on acquisitions and tax planning. 
Should opportunities arise for them 
to advise on special tax projects, their 
suitability is assessed at the time to 
ensure it would not compromise their 
audit independence, with the work being 
tendered where appropriate.
Consulting
To avoid any possible conflict of interest 
the Group’s policy is not to employ its 
auditors for general consulting work.
Following its May 2009 meeting, the 
committee recommended to the Board 
that a resolution be put to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting for the 
reappointment of the external auditors, 
and to authorise the Directors to fix their 
remuneration.
Internal audit
The internal audit work is contracted-out 
to Norris Small, Chartered Accountants. 
The firm has no association with the 
external auditors. As well as its reviews 
of the internal auditor’s role and 
processes, during its meeting in 2008/09, 
the committee received presentations 
from the internal auditor, the results of 
work undertaken by him and his plan for 
work in 2009. The committee considered 
the need for an internal audit function 
and decided that, in view of the size of 
the Group, a full-time resource could not 
be justified and that the service should 
continue to be contracted-out.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, 
the Audit Committee has concluded 
that it has acted in accordance with its 
terms of reference and has ensured the 
independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
will be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions about 
the work of the committee.

Corporate Governance Report continued
5. Relations with shareholders
The Company encourages two-way 
communication with both its institutional 
and private investors and responds 
promptly to all enquiries received 
orally or in writing. During the year 
the Chairman, Chief Executive and 
the Finance Director, either separately 
or together, attended a number of 
meetings with analysts, and with major 
shareholders. Written reports about the 
Company by analysts or brokers are 
circulated to all Directors.
Broker research notes, annual and 
interim reports and presentations are 
made available electronically on the 
Company’s website.
All shareholders receive at least 
twenty working days’ notice of the 
Annual General Meeting at which all 
Directors are available for questions. 
Each substantive issue is the subject 
of a separate resolution. The numbers 
of proxy votes for and against each 
resolution are announced at the meeting, 
after the voting has taken place.
6. Corporate governance 
compliance statement
The Company is pleased to report that it 
has complied throughout the year ended 
31 March 2009 with the provisions set 
out in Section 1 of the Code, except:
A2.2 The Chairman is a Director of 
Rights and Issues Investment Trust plc, 
a significant shareholder of Intelek plc. 
The Board is satisfied that this does 
not influence the Chairman in his role 
on the Board and considers him to be 
independent for the purposes of the 
Code.
A3.1 The Senior Independent Director, 
Donald Wilson, has been on the Board 
since his appointment on 14 July 1995. 
The Board considers that Don Wilson 
continues to provide independent and 
valuable input to the Board, bringing to 
bear his extensive experience as a senior 
executive at Rank Xerox and elsewhere.
D1.1 The Senior Independent Director 
does not attend meetings with major 
shareholders as a matter of routine. 
However, he is available should he be 
required and is present at the AGM. 
The Chairman attends the six-monthly 
announcements to shareholders and, 
with a 1.7% shareholding, and his 
beneficial interest in RIIT plc (a major 
Shareholder of the Company), has a 
close affinity with shareholders’ interests.

Remuneration Report
 The Dir ectors present the Remuneration 
Report for the financial year ended 
31 March 2009.
As the Company is listed on AIM, it does 
not have to comply with the requirements 
of the Remuneration Report contained in 
the listing rules. However the Directors 
have decided to disclose the information 
as best practice and seek to comply to 
the extent practicable for the size of the 
Company and its operations.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining the 
remuneration and other terms of 
employment of the executive Directors. 
No external advisers have been used. 
In determining remuneration for the 
year, the Committee has given full 
consideration to the requirements of 
the Combined Code. 
The Remuneration Committee consists 
wholly of independent non-executive 
Directors who have no day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the 
Group’s business. The following 
independent non-executive Directors 
served as members of the Remuneration 
Committee during the year and to the 
date stated:
Donald Wilson (Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee) 
(to 10 June 2009)
David Bramwell (to 10 June 2009)
Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Committee in 
determining the remuneration packages 
of executive Directors for 2009 and 
subsequent years are:
1. The recruitment, retention and 
incentivisation of Executive 
management. 
2. The alignment of Executive 
management and shareholder 
interests.
The remuneration packages of executive 
Directors comprise the following 
elements:
Basic salary and benefits
Basic annual salaries for executive 
Directors are reviewed annually having 
regard to individual performance and 
market practice. Benefits provided 
to executive Directors vary but may 
comprise the provision of a Company car 
and health insurance. 
Annual bonus
The targets for annual bonus are set each 
year by the Committee. The maximum 
bonus is 100% of basic salary.
(i) Chief Executive and Finance 
Director
The bonus is paid in cash but if the 
bonus exceeds 10% of basic salary, 
the Directors are required to apply 33% 
of the net amount in the acquisition 
of the Company’s shares. The bonus 
for 2008/09 comprised three elements 
based respectively on: (a) Underlying 
Profit Before Tax at each quarter end 
during the year; (b) Net debt at the year 
end; (c) Underlying EPS for the full year.
(ii) President of Paradise Datacom
As with all divisional heads, the bonus 
is paid 25% in shares and 75% in cash. 
The bonus is based on cumulative 
quarterly Underlying Operating Profit for 
the division.
Long-Term Incentive Plan — 
Executive Scheme
(i) Share options
The Executive Share Option Scheme 
is designed to promote long-term 
improvement in the performance of 
the Company, sustained increase in 
shareholder value and clear linkage 
between Executive reward and the 
Company’s performance. The options are 
conditional upon achieving headline EPS 
growth in the aggregate of 6% above RPI 
in the 3 years prior to exercise. No further 
grants of options can be made under this 
scheme.
(ii) Share scheme — Executive LTIP
Under this scheme, shares may be 
issued to members of the executive 
from time to time, subject to compulsory 
resale of the shares to Intelek’s ESOP 
trust at a nominal price to the extent that 
performance conditions are not satisfied. 
The shares are divided into four equal 
parts, two for each measurement period, 
3 and 5 years, and, within each period, 
one for each performance criterion, 
Underlying EPS and Shareholder Return. 
The Remuneration Committee sets 
targets for EPS. Shareholder Return 
is measured against movement in the 
techmark 100 index. If less than 80% 
of the target is reached, no shares vest; 
if 80%, 25% vest; if 120%, 100% vest; 
and pro rata in between.
(iii) Divisional LTIP — Paradise 
Datacom
The scheme was set up in 2005 and runs 
to the end of 2009/10. The President 
of Paradise Datacom is entitled to a 
percentage of the increase in Computed 
Market Value for the division above a 
benchmark. The Computed Market Value 
applies assumed interest, tax rate and 
price–earnings ratio to the Underlying 
Operating Profit of the division. The Profit 
is the higher of the actual reported for the 
year to 31 March 2010 and the average 
of the five years to that date. The bonus 
is payable 25% in shares and 75% in 
cash.
Directors’ shareholdings
These are as set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 22.
Pension contributions
The Company makes annual 
contributions to the Intelek Pension 
Schemes for the executive Directors. The 
Schemes are funded, Inland Revenue 
approved, contributory occupational 
pension schemes.
Service contracts and letters of 
appointment
The executive Directors are provided with 
service contracts, none of which exceeds 
one year.
Ian Brodie has a notice entitlement 
of one year. Kevin Edwards and John 
Restivo have a notice entitlement of six 
months. In the event of the Company 
being taken over and the Directors 
leaving the Company, the notice periods 
are as follows: Ian Brodie, two years; 
Kevin Edwards and John Restivo, one 
year. Donald Wilson and David Bramwell 
have contracts with notice entitlements 
of three months.

 Remuneration Report continued
The Committee considers the Directors’ 
notice entitlements to be appropriate as 
they are in line with the market and take 
account of the Directors’ knowledge and 
experience.
Non-executive Directors
The fees of non-executive Directors 
are determined by the full Board to an 
amount not exceeding £200,000, as set 
out in the Articles of Association. The 
non-executive Directors are not eligible 
for bonuses or pension benefits.
Performance graph
This graph shows the Company’s 
performance for the last five years, as 
measured by the Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) (with dividends reinvested), 
for equity shareholders of Intelek 
plc, compared with the TSR of the 
TechMARK 100 index.
This index was chosen as it represents 
a broad indication of performance in the 
sector in which the Company operates.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Intelek plc
 W e have audited the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements of Intelek 
plc for the year ended 31 March 2009, 
which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement and Notes 1 to 32 of the 
Group’s financial statements and the 
Company balance sheet and notes 1 
to 8 of the Parent Company financial 
statements. These financial statements 
have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s shareholders, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s shareholders 
those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s 
shareholders, as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
Directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable UK law and 
the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union, and for preparing the 
Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom law 
and Accounting Standards (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group 
financial statements in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you in our opinion as 
to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether 
the financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you if the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is inconsistent with the 
financial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ Report includes 
that specific information presented in 
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Review and the Financial 
Review that is cross-referenced from the 
Business review and principal activities 
section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition, we report to you if, in our 
opinion, the Company has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have 
not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or 
if information specified by law regarding 
Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained 
in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited 
Group financial statements. The other 
information comprises the Group 
Overview, the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Chief Executive Review, the Financial 
Review, the Directors and Senior Officers, 
the Corporate Governance Report, the 
Remuneration Report, the Director’s 
Report and the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the Group 
financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any information outside 
the Annual Report. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes the 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the Group financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by 
the Directors in the preparation of the 
financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the Group financial 
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
n The Group financial statements give a 
true and fair view in accordance with 
IFRS’s as adopted by the European 
Union, of the state of affairs of the 
Group as at 31 March 2009 and of its 
profit for the year then ended.
n The Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985.
n The Parent Company financial 
statements give a true and fair 
view in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 March 2009.
n The Parent Company’s financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985.
n The information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the financial statements.

 Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2009
 1. Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of preparation
 These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
for use in the European Union and with the Companies Act 1985. The Group financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value. The policies 
have been consistently applied for all years presented. The following accounting standards have been issued in the period but 
were not yet effective and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group. Unless stated they all become effective for 
the year ending March 2010.
n IAS 1 (Revised 2007) — “Presentation of Financial Statements”: This will require the Group to alter the format of its primary 
statements.
n IFRS 3 (Revised 2008) — “Business combinations” (first effective year ended March 2011)
n IFRS 8 “Segmental Reporting” — This will require additional disclosure, although not significantly different to the current 
disclosure provided in accordance with IAS 14.
n  IAS 27 (Revised 2008) — “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”
n IAS 23 (Amendment) — “Borrowing costs”
n IAS 32 (Amended) — “Financial instruments” 
n IFRIC 16 — “Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation” 
(b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of all 
of the Group’s subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred. Amounts reported in the financial statements 
have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
(c) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. All subsidiaries are accounted for using accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the net 
fair value of the assets being acquired. 
(d) Foreign currency
 The i ndividual financial statements for each company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated and presentational financial statements, the 
results and financial position of the Group are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency 
of the Group. 
 In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising are 
recognised in the income statement.
The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates that approximates to exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions. The assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Translation reserves are 
recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the related overseas subsidiary is disposed of.
 In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments 
(forward contracts) to hedge significant exposure on foreign exchange transactions. This is explained in the Financial instruments 
accounting policy and note 32 of these financial statements. The Group does not hedge account for forward foreign currency 
contracts. 
Exchange rate differences arising on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are hedged on the Group’s investment  
in its overseas operations are reported in the Statement of Total Recognised Income and Expense and as movement through 
Profit and Loss Reserves.
(e) Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.

1. Significant Accounting Policies continued
 Financial assets
The Company’s financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents and are classified as loans 
and receivables. They are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and measured subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for any impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal 
of impairment is recognised in the Income Statement. Interest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are 
recognised in the Income Statement when received, regardless of how the related carrying amount of financial asset is measured.
 No financial assets are classified as fair value through profit and loss or as held to maturity or available for sale. 
Impairment of financial assets
All financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is evidence that a loss event has occurred and that estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have been impacted.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets are assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, 
an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio and the average credit period, as well as observed changes in 
national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
 Cash and cash equivalents
For the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and deposits and bank overdrafts. For the 
balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, which include bank loans, overdrafts, lease finance and trade and other payables, are measured initially at 
fair value net of transaction costs under the effective interest method and thereafter at amortised cost. Finance charges are 
accounted for on an accruals basis to the Income Statement. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging arrangements
The Group has used derivative financial instruments in the current financial year to hedge its exposure to currency risk. The 
Group monitors its exposure and adopts derivative financial instruments where deemed appropriate and approved by the Board.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at their fair value at each balance sheet date, with movements reflected in the Income Statement. The Group does not use hedge 
accounting for its forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group does not use forward foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes.
(f) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
In respect of acquisitions since 1 April 2004, the date of IFRS transition, goodwill arising on consolidation represents 
the excess of cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities of 
the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. For acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its 
deemed cost. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and assessed for impairment at least annually. Impairment is assessed 
by comparing the goodwill with the discounted cash flows projected for the acquired cash-generating unit, using a pre-tax 
discount rate that management estimate to be the risk adjusted average cost of capital for the Parent Company.
(ii) Research and development
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Expenditure on a development project will be written off as incurred unless 
and until:
 (i) the project is identified as being:
 (a) for a new or substantially improved product or process;
 (b) technically feasible; and
 (c) commercially feasible, and probable that recovery will take place and 
(ii)   measurable costs can be attributed to the asset and adequate resources are available to complete the project.
For a project meeting these criteria, subsequent costs will be capitalised and amortised from the date the product or 
process is available for use on a straight-line basis over the product’s estimated life.
(iii) Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, 
provided they can be separately and reliably measured. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected 
useful lives.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use. Where assets are in the course of construction at the 
balance sheet date, they are classified separately and not depreciated.

 Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2009
1. Significant Accounting Policies continued
(g) Property, plant and equipment continued
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives using the 
straight-line method. The principal rates are as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Leasehold properties Over the lease period
Plant and equipment  7%–33%
(h) Leases
Leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classified as Finance 
Leases. Assets financed by a Finance Lease are accounted for as if they had been purchased outright, with the corresponding 
liability to the leasing company included as an obligation. The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged 
to the Income Statement, and capital, which reduces the outstanding obligation. All other leases are classified as Operating Leases 
and lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Depreciation of finance 
leased assets is consistent with that for owned assets unless there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership 
by the end of the lease term, in which case depreciation is straight-line over the period of the lease. Interest is charged to the 
Income Statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Benefits received 
and receivable as an incentive to enter into an Operating Lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(i) Impairment of non-current assets
All non-current assets are assessed annually for indications of impairment. Where impairment is likely, the fair value is measured 
and any impairment loss is charged to the Income Statement. For goodwill, an impairment review is carried out at each 
balance sheet date. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognised in the Income 
Statement. With the exception of Goodwill, an impairment charge may be reversed if the non current asset or cash generating 
unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are valued on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being 
made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Work in progress includes the cost and relevant proportion of production overhead 
assuming normal levels of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and 
selling expenses.
(k) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement 
as and when they are due.
(ii) Defined benefit plan
The Group’s net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit payable to members, discounted to present value, and deducting the fair value of the plan assets. The calculation 
is performed by a qualified actuary, with liabilities assessed using the projected unit credit method and discounted using 
the market yield on high quality corporate bonds that are nearest to matching the maturity of the scheme. Actuarial gains 
and losses are included in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. Current and past service costs, curtailments 
and settlements are recognised within operating profit. Expected return on scheme assets and interest on obligations are 
recognised as a component of financing costs.
(iii) Share-based payment transactions
Share-based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the Group’s share option and other share award 
schemes. Share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award and 
charged to operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the scheme. Options are valued using an appropriate 
pricing model (Black-Scholes). The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave 
during the performance or vesting period and where it becomes unlikely that the option or shares will vest.
(l) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event. 
The provisions are not discounted.
(i) Warranty
 Provision for warranty is made only for those customer claims in respect of which the Group expects to incur liability.
(ii) Restructuring
 A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(m) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised by the fair value of consideration receivable excluding VAT.
(i)  Sales r epr esent the invoiced value of goods, where the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to 
the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or the 
possible return of goods. The sale is recognised at the date the goods are dispatched to the customer.

1. Significant Accounting Policies continued
(m) Revenue recognition continued
(ii) Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable.
(n) Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the Balance Sheet initially as deferred income in note 20. Grants in respect of assets are 
transferred to the Income Statement as other operating income over the estimated useful life of the asset concerned. Grants to 
compensate for expenses are transferred to the Income Statement in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.
(o) Taxation
The tax charge for the year includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred taxation. The current tax charge represents 
the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the financial year and after making adjustments in 
respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are enacted or substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
(p) Equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity which is determined by the nominal value of shares that have been issued to date. When 
the Company purchases its own shares, the consideration is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are either 
cancelled or reissued. When this happens any consideration received is included in equity attributable to equity shareholders. 
The share premium account represents premiums received on the initial issuing of the Share Capital.
Other reserves comprise a S131 CA1985 merger reserve created on acquisitions in prior years. 
Retained earnings include all current and prior year results as disclosed in the income statement. The hedging and translation 
reserve show impact of foreign currency movements on consolidation.
(q) Dividend distribution
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved by shareholders, whilst interim dividends are charged in the period 
when they are paid.
(r) Exceptional operating items
Exceptional operating items are material items which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by 
virtue of their size or incidence because of their relevance to understanding the entity’s financial performance.
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Financial Risk Management
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the Directors’ Report on pages 21 and 22 of these financial 
statements.
 The Group makes estimates and assumptions about the future. The resulting accounting estimates seldom equal the related actual 
results. The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a material risk to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year are discussed below:
Defined benefit scheme
Details of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme are set out in notes 1 (k)(ii) and 5 of the financial statements. The scheme 
has been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. The main area of judgement and estimation is the valuation 
of the pension scheme liabilities, which represent the net present value of projected future pension payments. These calculations 
are performed by the scheme actuary, with whom the Directors have agreed the underlying assumptions to be applied. The key 
assumptions are rates of increase in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation and the discount rate applied to produce the net 
present value. The discount rate is derived from market rates on AA corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. Sensitivities applied 
to the key assumptions and their impact on the scheme liabilities are set out in note 5 of these financial statements.
Goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating 
unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details are set out in note 12.
Recoverability of internally generated asset — research and development
During the year, management have considered the recoverability of the carrying value of development expenditure of £0.4 million on 
its balance sheet. The projects continue to progress satisfactorily and customer reaction has confirmed management’s estimates of 
anticipated revenues from the projects. Management are confident that the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable.

2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Key Judgements applying the Group’s accounting policies
The Group’s accounting policies are set out in Note 1. The key Judgements are as follows;
Capitalisation of development cost
The criteria for capitalisation of development costs are set out in note 1 (f) above. The Director’s have to apply their Judgement in 
deciding whether any research and development costs meet these criteria.
Deferred tax
Management consider it reasonable to recognise deferred tax assets attributable to the defined benefit pension scheme deficit, 
unused tax losses, accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences based on future profit projections.
3. Business and geographical segments
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions, Satellite communications (Paradise 
Datacom), Microwave components & manufacturing services (Labtech Microwave), and Aerostructures (CML). These divisions 
are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.

5. Pension commitments
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that was closed to new members in January 2000 and ceased further service 
accrual for employees in September 2002. The scheme has a net deficit, for which the Group agreed a Schedule of Contributions 
with the Trustee in May 2009. This requires payment of £820,000 a year for 3 years and £860,000 for 7 years thereafter, plus scheme 
expenses (previously £820,000 a year to 2016). In addition, the Group has arranged a £2.4 million guarantee in favour of the scheme, 
based on certain of the Group’s assets. The scheme owns the 999 year lease of the premises occupied by Labtech Ltd, a Group 
subsidiary, at Presteigne, Powys. The premises are let under a 24 year lease expiring in 2018 at a current commercial rental of
£75,750 per annum.
In 2008/09, the Group undertook a further project involving an invitation to certain of the non-pensioner members to transfer out of
the scheme. The offer included a supplementary sum to be paid by the Group. At the end of the year, 29 members had accepted the 
offer which closed at the end of April 2009. The scheme actuary has evaluated the effect of the transactions as a net curtailment
gain of £295,000. After the Group’s expected payments of £189,000, a net credit of £106,000 has been taken to the Income 
Statement. £183,000 remains to be paid over to the members upon finalisation of the procedures for transfer.
The defined benefit scheme was valued by the scheme actuary at 31 March 2009. The key assumptions applied were:
  At 31 March At 31 March

Rate of increase in pensions in payment  2.70 3.50

31 March, less administration expenses)  5.70 6.50
Mortality: On actuarial advice, the mortality assumptions were changed to the more prudent assumptions adopted by the Trustee 
for the latest triennial valuation of the scheme.
The market value of the assets and obligations of the defined benefit scheme, and the expected rates of return, are as follows:

The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £1.06 million
Rate of inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by £0.57 million
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £0.57 million
The Group’s policy is to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately. Consequently there are no unrecognised gains or
losses. The cumulative amount recognised since 1 April 2004 is a loss of £6,076,000 (2008: £4,169,000).

change of business strategy. The financial effect was a redundancy charge in the year of £116,000 and an impairment charge 
against fixed assets of £354,000, total £470,000.
(b) The Group undertook various studies on acquisition and disposal opportunities during the year that did not come to fruition. 
There was also an exercise commenced to liquidate dormant companies owned by the Group.

 10. Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) were calculated based on the profit for the year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period, excluding those held by the Employee Share Trust and those held by Directors that remain 
subject to performance conditions. These excluded shares are accounted for as an investment in own shares (see note 26). The total 
for 2009 was 84,951,439 (2008: 84,833,409). Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the number of shares used in the basic EPS 
calculation to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares resulting from outstanding employee share plans. There were 
330,500 exercisable share options in existence at the year end (2008: 340,500) the exercise price for which is below the average fair 
value of 15.6p per share of the ordinary shares in issue during the year. These create a dilution in shares of 238,830 (2008: 232,167).
In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, the Board also monitors underlying EPS, computed as follows:
 Earnings EPS

The goodwill relates entirely to the satellite communications business segment, a cash-generating unit. No impairment has been 
recognised in either 2008 or 2009. The recoverable amount of the business segment is evaluated based on its value in use. The 
exchange adjustment arises on translation of the goodwill held in US$ for one of the investments in the business segment.
Impairment
During the year, the goodwill was tested for impairment against cash flow projections for the unit discounted at management’s 
estimate of the risk adjusted cost of capital. The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators 
that goodwill might be impaired. Management’s key assumptions for its cash flows are based on their past experience and future 
expectations of the market. The satellite communications business was acquired in 2001 and hence there is a good historical trend 
analysis on which to base expectations. The cash flows were taken from the unit’s business plan for 2010 to 2012, extended for
seven years thereafter at the projected market growth rate of 2.5%. The pre-tax discount rate applied was 11% based on the 
weighted average cost of capital based on its cost of equity and cost of debt. These assumptions reflect management’s past 
experience and are consistent with external sources of information. After applying a sensitivity analysis to the results, in particular
for presumed growth rates, management concluded that no impairment was required. Management are not aware of any other 
changes that would necessitate changes in its key estimates and sensitivities to revenues.

The impairment loss on plant and equipment arose in connection with the restructuring of Labtech Microwave (see note 7).
The carrying amount of plant and equipment includes £3,001,000 (2008: £3,303,000) in respect of assets held under finance 
leases, the depreciation charge on which amounted to £656,000 (2008: £508,000). The carrying amount of leasehold properties 
includes £216,000 (2008: £221,000) in respect of a long leasehold property and £311,000 (2008: £316,000) in respect of short 
leasehold property.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
amounting to £184,000 (2008: £190,000).

The Directors believe that there is no further impairment provision required and that the carrying amounts of trade and other 
receivables approximate to their fair values. The Group reserves its right to charge interest on overdue receivables, with each case 
being dependent on its commercial circumstances.

 24. Share-based payments
Share options
In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”, the Group has appraised share options granted after 7 November 2002. The 
only options applicable to date are those issued on 8 January 2003 at a price of 10.5p, expiring on 7 January 2013. The options were 
issued conditional upon achieving growth in earnings per share at a rate in excess of 2% a year above the retail price index over any 
consecutive three years in the ten year period from 31 March 2002. This condition was met following announcement of the results for 
the year to 31 March 2006. To date, none of the options has been exercised. The details are as follows:
 2009 2008
  Weighted  Weighted
  average  average
 No. price No. price
Outstanding at 1 April 267,500 10.5p 267,500 10.5p
Options forfeited (10,000) 10.5p — 10.5p
Outstanding and exercisable at 31 March 257,500  10.5p 267,500  10.5p
For these options, the fair value has been assessed, applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model assumed volatility 
of 39.1%, expected dividend yield of 2.8%, risk-free interest rate of 4.2%. On this basis, the fair value of the options at grant date 
was 3.8p. No accrual has been taken to the Income Statement as the amounts are not material. At 31 March 2009, a cumulative 
charge of £10,000 would have been accrued (2008: £10,000).
Long-Term Incentive Plan
In October 2006, the Group introduced a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) under which shares are issued by Intelek’s ESOP trust 
to selected senior managers at grant date, subject to compulsory sale back to the trust at a nominal price to the extent that 
performance conditions are not met. The awards are split equally into two measurement periods, 3 years and 5 years, and again 
into two categories of performance condition, EPS and Share Price. For the EPS tranches, actual adjusted EPS at the end of the 
measurement period is compared with the target EPS. For the Share Price tranches, the growth in share price is compared with the 
growth in the techmark 100 index over the measurement period. The targets are set by the Remuneration Committee. In all cases, if 
less than 80% of the target is met, none of the shares vest, if 80%, 25% vest, if 120%, 100% vest, and pro rata between 80% and 
120%. During the measurement period, the senior managers own the voting rights attaching to the shares and receive dividends. 
However, to the extent that the shares do not vest, the dividends, less tax, have to be paid over to the Trust.
The first award under the LTIP was made in October 2006 to Mr Ian Brodie and Mr Kevin Edwards, details of which are set out in 
the Remuneration Report. In total, 1,750,000 shares were issued at 12.5p a share. Under IFRS 2, the cost of this benefit is required 
to be estimated and taken over the measurement period. As the shares have already been issued, the price is known and has been 
applied to the projected number of shares that will vest. For the EPS tranches, the number of shares has been computed based 
on management projections of EPS. For the Share Price tranches, the number of shares has been computed assuming that (a) 
the share price will grow in line with EPS, modified for the market’s perception of risk, and (b) the techmark 100 index will grow 
consistent with the 3-year period 31.3.04 to 31.3.07. In 2009, a provision of £45,000 has been charged to the Income Statement 
(2008: £43,000), increasing the provision to £111,000 (2008: £66,000).

Other reserves comprise a Merger Reserve created on acquisition in prior years. The hedging reserve represents the accumulated 
net currency variations on the Group’s net investment hedge (explained in note 32). The translation reserve represents the translation 
differences on the consolidation of the US operations’ asset and liabilities.
26. Own shares
Own shares represent the cost of shares in Intelek plc purchased in the market and held by the Intelek plc Employee Share 
Ownership Plan (ESOP), and shares issued under the Executive LTIP but not yet vested.
The Intelek plc ESOP trust was established by a deed on 7 November 1991 made between the Company and EFG Reads Trustees 
Limited of Jersey. The trust was established for the benefit of the bona fide employees or former employees of the Company and 
other Group Companies (“the Beneficiaries”). The trust is a discretionary trust whose assets are shares in the Company and the 
Trustees have full authority and power to distribute such shares as they deem fit to the Beneficiaries. In addition, the Trustees may 
satisfy options granted by the Company to participants in one or more of the Group’s share option schemes should the Trustees, 
with the agreement of the Company, decide to do so.
Administration costs amount to £5,000 per annum. As of 31 March 2009, the Trust held 620,545 (2008: 690,060) Ordinary shares of 
5p each in the capital of the Company. As of 31 March 2009, 1,185,000 (2008: 1,205,000) shares of the Company are under option 
to the participants in the Group’s Share Option Schemes and the Trustees may by agreement with the Company use all or any of the 
shares in the Trust to satisfy such options. During the year, 69,515 of the shares were sold at 17p to provide shares for the executive 
bonus schemes. In addition, the Trust held signed transfer documents in respect of a further 1,750,000 shares issued under the 
Executive LTIP . These shares will be sold to the Trust for a nominal value to the extent that the LTIP performance conditions are not 
satisfied. For accounting purposes, these shares are included as part of the investment in Own Shares until vesting under the LTIP . 
The total investment in own shares is 2,370,545 (2.7% of the allotted share capital), the market value of which at 31 March 2009 was 
£338,000 (2008: £341,000), i.e. 14.3p per share (2008: 14.0p per share). Dividends on these shares have not been waived.

30. Contingent Liabilities and Assets
The Company is guarantor for the lease of the property occupied by Pascall Electronics on the Isle of Wight. The lease expires in 
2016 and is at a current rental of £273,000 per annum. As part of the disposal agreement for Pascall Electronics, the Company 
secured full indemnity for this guarantee from both the purchaser and the purchaser’s ultimate holding company. The Directors 
consider it unlikely that there will be a default that affects the Group under this guarantee. Even if there were to be a default, the 
Group would expect to be able to re-let the property and mitigate much of the liability.

Finance leases  7.3 7.2
e) Principal features of the Group’s borrowings
The Group’s borrowing facilities are secured by a debenture over the Group’s assets and unlimited cross guarantees given by the 
Company and certain subsidiary undertakings. The Group has a US$ denominated bank loan of £328,000 being repaid at £164,000 
a quarter. It will be fully repaid by September 2009. The interest rate on the loan is 1.50% above the bank’s base rate.
32. Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and various items such as trade and other 
receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these instruments is to raise finance for 
operations. The Group has entered into financial derivative instruments using forward foreign currency contracts, which are
described in more detail below. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and 
foreign currency risk. The Board’s policy on these risks is described in note 1 on significant accounting policies and in the Directors’ 
Report, which forms part of these financial statements.
Capital Risk Management 
Operations are financed through a mixture of retained profits, lease finance and bank borrowings. Other than finance leases and 
loan notes, the Board’s policy is to use variable rate borrowings. To ensure continuity of debt funding the Group’s policy is to keep a 
substantial part of debt as due in more than one year’s time. Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.

   2009 2008
   £000 £000
Forward foreign currency contracts (held in accruals at fair value through the profit and loss/account)  (8) —
Management consider the fair values to approximate to the present value of future cash flows based on market rates.
Management have appraised the sensitivity of the financial result to interest and currency movement as:
(i) a 1% increase in interest rates for variable borrowings would have reduced profit and equity by about £35,000.
(ii) a 1% strengthening in the value of sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2009 would have 
reduced profit and equity by about £40,000.
Financial risk management objectives
Management monitor and manage financial risks relating to its operations through it management and review of internal reports. The 
Group is not significantly exposed to interest, credit or liquidity risk and will enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce its
risk to currency exposure with approval from the Board.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions in US Dollar and in Euro, hence its does have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. 
Exchange rate movements are monitored within approved parameters and the Group holds certain amounts of Euro and US dollar 
as a natural hedge. During the year, management decided to take out certain forward foreign currency contracts to the value of 
US$825,000 at the year end. The Group doesn’t enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, 
for speculative purposes. Whilst the Group entered into forward foreign currency contracts during the year to mitigate currency risk, 
it does not apply hedge accounting in the financial statements, and therefore accounts for the contract at its fair value at the balance 
sheet date.
Net investment hedge
The Group has a US-based subsidiary company which can affect the sterling Group Balance Sheet as a result of movements in 
the sterling/dollar exchange rate. The Group has partly hedged the US subsidiary company’s net asset exposure at 31 March 2009 
using bank loans in US$. The net currency movements on the subsidiary net assets and the related bank loans are recognised at 
each year end and recorded through reserves. At 31 March 2009, the Group held $10 million net assets overseas and held loans of 
$4 million designated as a partial hedge against this exposure. The hedge has been tested for effectiveness at inception and at each 
reporting date.

 Notes to the Intelek plc Balance Sheet
 Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and 
United Kingdom law.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Employee benefits: Defined benefit scheme
The Company participates in the Group’s multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme. The Company is unable to identify its share of 
the underlying assets of the scheme as the assets form a single fund. Consequently, the Company accounts for the scheme by expensing 
contributions as they become due. Details of the scheme assets and liabilities are set out in the notes to the Group’s financial statements.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the asset 
over its useful estimated economic life. The principal rate applied is:
Plant and equipment 7%–33%
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, where the timing difference 
results in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future. Timing differences arise because of differences between 
the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded 
as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when 
timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow and related party transactions
The Group consolidated financial statements contain a consolidated cash flow statement and therefore the Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 not to present its own cash flow statement. Similarly, the Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption under FRS 8 not to disclose related party transactions.
Financial instruments
The Group financial statements include disclosure sufficient to satisfy FRS 25 and consequently, the Company has taken advantage of 
the exemption not to present separate financial instrument disclosures. 
Foreign currency translation
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are hedged on the Company’s investment in its 
overseas operation, are reported as movement through the Profit and Loss Reserves.
Non monetary assets, such as the long term loan included in investments, are measured at historical cost and translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
P1. Profit and loss account
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for 
the year. The loss for the year ended 31 March 2009 was (£523,000) (2008: Profit £5,000).
P2. Employees

 Notes
1 Only those members registered in the register of members of the Company as at 5.00 pm on 9 September 2009 or, in the event 
that the meeting is adjourned, in the register of members 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting shall be entitled to 
attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries in the 
register of members after 5.00 pm on 9 September 2009 or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, after 48 hours before the 
time of any adjourned meeting shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
2 A member is entitled to appoint one or more persons as proxies to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at the 
meeting. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him. To appoint more 
than one proxy, you will need to complete a separate proxy form in relation to each appointment. You may photocopy the proxy 
form if additional proxy forms are required. You will need to state clearly on each proxy form the number of shares in relation to 
which the proxy is appointed. A failure to specify the number of shares each proxy appointment relates to or specifying a number 
in excess of those held by the member may result in the proxy appointment being invalid. You can only appoint a proxy using the 
procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form. 
 The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting if he or she so wishes.
3 A form of proxy is enclosed. To be valid, it must be completed, signed and sent to the offices of the Company’s registrars, Lloyds 
TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex, BN99 6ZL, so as to arrive no later than 11.30 am on 9 September 2009 
(or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day that is not a working day) before 
the time of any adjourned meeting).
4 In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that:
(a) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote 
on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then 
on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a 
vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and 
(b) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate 
shareholder has not appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate 
representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other 
corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative.
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies 
and corporate representatives (http://www.icsa.org.uk/) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form 
of representation letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (a) above.
5 The following information is available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company 
(excluding weekends and public holidays). It will also be available for inspection at the place of the Annual General Meeting from 
9.30 am on the day of the meeting until the conclusion of the meeting:

Glossary
 Satellite Communications
Amplifier 
A device used to boost the strength of 
an electronic signal. 
Analog 
A form of transmitting information 
characterized by continuously variable 
quantities, as opposed to digital 
transmission, which is characterized 
by discrete bits of information in 
numerical steps. An analog signal is 
responsive to changes in light, sound, 
heat and pressure. 
Aperture 
A cross sectional area of the antenna 
which is exposed to the satellite signal. 
Backhaul 
A terrestrial communications channel 
linking an earth station to a local 
switching network or population centre. 
Bandwidth 
A measure of spectrum (frequency) 
use or capacity. For instance, a voice 
transmission by telephone requires a 
bandwidth of about 3,000 cycles per 
second (3kHz). A TV channel occupies 
a bandwidth of 6 million cycles per 
second (6 MHz) in terrestrial systems. 
In satellite-based systems a larger 
bandwidth of 17.5 to 72 MHz is used to 
spread or “dither” the television signal in 
order to prevent interference. 
Bit 
A single digital unit of information.
Bit Error Rate 
The fraction of a sequence of message 
bits that are in error. A bit error rate of 
10-6 means that there is an average of 
one error per million bits. 
Bit Rate 
The speed of a digital transmission, 
measured in bits per second. 
Block Down Converter 
A device used to convert the 3.7 to 
4.2 kHz signal down to UHF or lower 
frequencies (1 GHz and lower). 
C Band 
This is the band between 4 and 8 GHz 
with the 6 and 4 GHz band being 
used for satellite communications. 
Specifically, the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz satellite 
communication band is used as the 
downlink frequencies in tandem with 
the 5.925 to 6.425 GHz band that serves 
as the uplink. 
Carrier 
The basic radio, television, or telephony 
centre of frequency transmit signal. The 
carrier in an analog signal is modulated 
by manipulating its amplitude (making 
it louder or softer) or its frequency 
(shifting it up or down) in relation to the 
incoming signal. Microwave and satellite 
communications transmitters operate 
in the band from 1 to 14 GHz.
Channel 
A frequency band in which a specific 
broadcast signal is transmitted. 
Television signals require a 6 MHz 
frequency band to carry all the 
necessary picture detail.
DBS 
Direct broadcast satellite. Refers to 
service that uses satellites to broadcast 
multiple channels of television 
programming directly to home mounted 
small-dish antennas. 
Delay 
The time it takes for a signal to go 
from the sending station through the 
satellite to the receiving station. This 
transmission delay for a single hop 
satellite connection is very close to one-
quarter of a second. 
Demodulator 
A satellite receiver circuit which extracts 
or “demodulates” the “wanted” signals 
from the received carrier. 
Digital 
Conversion of information into bits of 
data for transmission through wire, 
fibre-optic cable, satellite, or over 
air techniques. Method allows 
simultaneous transmission of voice, 
data or video. 
Downlink 
The satellite to earth half of a 2-way 
telecommunications satellite link. Often 
used to describe the receive dish end 
of the link. 
Earth Station 
The combination of antenna, amplifiers, 
frequency converters and electronics 
used to transmit/receive a signal 
via satellite. Earth Station antennas 
vary in size from 2 foot to 12 foot (65 
centimetres to 3.7 metres) diameter size 
used for TV reception to as large as 100 
feet (30 metres) in diameter sometimes 
used for international communications. 
Footprint 
A map of the signal strength over 
the earth’s surface. Different satellite 
transponders on the same satellite will 
often have different footprints of the 
signal strength.
Forward Error Correction (FEC) 
Adds unique codes to the digital signal 
at the source so errors can be detected 
and corrected at the receiver. 
Frequency 
The number of times that an alternating 
current goes through its complete cycle 
in one second of time. One cycle per 
second is also referred to as one hertz.
Geostationary 
Refers to a satellite angle with zero 
inclination, so the satellite appears 
to hover over one spot on the earth’s 
equator. For a planet the size and mass 
of the earth, the satellite orbit required is 
22,237 miles above the surface.

Gigahertz (GHz) 
One billion cycles per second. Signals 
operating above 3 Gigahertz are 
known as microwaves. Above 30 GHz 
they are know as millimetre waves. 
As one moves above the millimetre 
waves signals begin to take on the 
characteristics of Iightwaves. 
Hertz (Hz) 
A measure of frequency. One cycle per 
second.
INMARSAT 
The International Maritime Satellite 
Organization operates a network of 
satellites for international transmissions 
for all types of international mobile 
services including maritime, 
aeronautical, and land mobile. 
INTELSAT 
The International Telecommunications 
Satellite Organization operates a 
network of satellites for international 
transmissions.

such as fading from airline flights, RF 
interference from adjacent channels, or 
ghosting from reflecting objects such as 
mountains and buildings. 
Ka Band 
The frequency range from 18 to 31 GHz. 
Kbps 
Kilobits per second. Refers to 
transmission speed of 1,000 bits per 
second. 
Kilohertz (kHz) 
Refers to a unit of frequency equal to 
1,000 hertz. 
Klystron 
A microwave tube which uses the 
interaction between an electron beam 
and the RF energy on microwave 
cavities to provide signal amplification. 
The klystron operates on principles of 
velocity modulation very similar to those 
in a TWT except that klystron interaction 
takes place at discrete locations along 
the electron beam. Common types 
of klystrons are the reflex klystron (an 
oscillator having only one cavity), two-
cavity klystron amplifiers and oscillators, 
and multi-cavity klystron amplifiers. 
Ku Band 
The frequency range from 10.9 to 
17 GHz. 
L-Band 
The frequency range from 0.5 to 
1.5 GHz. Also used to refer to the 950 
to 1,450 MHz used for mobile 
communications. 
Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) 
This is the preamplifier between the 
antenna and the earth station receiver. 
For maximum effectiveness, it must 
be located as near to the antenna as 
possible, and is usually attached directly 
to the antenna receive port. The LNA is 
especially designed to contribute the 
least amount of thermal noise to the 
received signal. 
Low Noise Block Downconverter 
(LNB) 
A combination Low Noise Amplifier and 
downconverter built into one device 
attached to the feed. 
Megahertz (MHz) 
Refers to a frequency equal to one 
million hertz, or cycles per second. 
Microwave 
Line-of-sight, point-to-point 
transmission of signals at high 
frequency. Many TV systems receive 
some television signals from a distant 
antenna location with the antenna and 
the system connected by microwave 
relay. Microwaves are also used for 
data, voice, and indeed all types of 
information transmission. 
Microwave Interference 
Interference which occurs when an earth 
station aimed at a distant satellite picks 
up a second, often stronger signal, from 
a local telephone terrestrial microwave 
relay transmitter. Microwave interference 
can also be produced by nearby radar 
transmitters as well as the sun itself. 
Relocating the antenna by only several 
feet will often completely eliminate the 
microwave interference. 
Modem 
Short for modulator/demodulator. A 
communications device that converts 
one form of a signal to another that 
is suitable for transmission over 
communication circuits, typically from 
digital to analog and then from analog 
to digital.
Modulation 
The process of manipulating the 
frequency or amplitude of a carrier in 
relation to an incoming video, voice or 
data signal. 
Modulator 
A device which modulates a carrier. 
Modulators are found as components 
in broadcasting transmitters and in 
satellite transponders. 
Multiplexing 
Techniques that allow a number of 
simultaneous transmissions over a 
single circuit. 
Noise 
Any unwanted and unmodulated energy 
that is always present to some extent 
within any signal. 
Rain Outage 
Loss of signal at Ku or Ka Band 
frequencies due to absorption and 
increased sky-noise temperature caused 
by heavy rainfall. 
Receiver (Rx) 
An electronic device which enables a 
particular satellite signal to be separated 
from all others being received by an 
earth station, and converts the signal 
format into a format for video, voice 
or data.

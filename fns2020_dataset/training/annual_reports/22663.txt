Chair Man’s letter
“Consort Medical has continued to 
deliver strong organic growth in the 
year and enhanced its operating 
performance”
dr peter Fellner
Consort Medical has continued to 
deliver strong organic growth in 
the year, enhanced its operating 
performance, largely completed the 
integration of Aesica, and has made 
substantial progress on its development 
and innovation pipelines.
trading
Revenue increased by £92.1m (49.8%) 
to £276.9m (FY2015: £184.8m): this 
follows FY2015 which only received a 
six month contribution from Aesica. 
eBiT before special items increased by 
47.6% to £37.0m (FY2015: £25.1m). Over 
the year, Bespak eBiT margin grew to 
170bps to 21.5%, and Aesica eBiT margin 
grew 210bps to 7.4%. Adjusted basic ePs 
increased by 20.5% to 57.6p per share 
(FY2015: 47.8p). 
eBiTdA before special items grew 
£15.1m (45.3%) to £48.3m (FY2015: 
£33.2m), and capital expenditure was 
£21.5m (FY2015: £20.7m). Working 
capital reduced £20.2m to £14.0m 
(FY2015: £34.1m) which represents 5.0% 
of sales (FY2015: 12.3%).
The Group Balance sheet closed with 
a net debt position of £97.0m (FY2015: 
£99.2m), representing gearing of 
1.92× net debt: eBiTdA, in line with our 
expectations communicated at the 
time of the Aesica acquisition of below 
2.0× by FY2016.
delivering  
acquisition integration
during the year, we substantially 
completed the integration of Aesica 
into Consort, including the transfer of 
the Formulation development activities 
from nottingham to Queenborough, 
together with various restructuring 
actions at the Aesica sites, as 
signposted a year ago.
innovation and development
The Bespak and Aesica teams are 
working closely together to leverage 
each other’s customer relationships and 
to win new combined opportunities. 
in February, we celebrated the first of 
these with the signing of a development 
and manufacturing contract with 
Precision Ocular for devices and 
formulation services on their exciting 
novel drug products and delivery system 
— a first step into ocular treatments 
for the Group. This was coupled with 
Consort committing £3.3m to Precision 
Ocular’s equity financing.
Bespak has delivered solid progress on 
its development pipeline programmes, 
and has added two further programmes 
in addition to Precision Ocular. it has 
also made substantial progress with its 
innovation pipeline, leading towards 
the commercialisation of its syrina
®
 
and lila
®
 platforms, with several early 
stage development contracts, and the 
unveiling of a 2.25ml syrina

 device.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
The Voke inhaler, the innovative 
non-electronic nicotine device, is a 
technically complex design which 
presents a number of challenges. We 
remain committed to the delivery of the 
product for successful launch, which we 
are hopeful of in the next 12 months.
in Aesica, the new Formulation 
development Centre at Queenborough 
is now operational. The semi-continuous 
processing line is now producing 
approved and launched product in the 
first major market with others expected 
to follow over the next 24 months. its 
s+Flurbiprofen has received market 
approval in Japan for the treatment of 
osteoarthritis, and launch stock is now 
being prepared.
people
i wish to thank our employees for 
their excellent contributions during 
the past year, which have been 
central to delivering the Company’s 
strong performance. i also thank our 
shareholders for their continuing support 
of the Company during this year of 
growth and acquisition consolidation.
o utlook
Consort has again delivered strong 
organic growth. in Bespak, this has 
once again been delivered through 
strong revenue growth and operating 
leverage. in its first full year under 
Consort ownership, Aesica has now 
been largely integrated, and delivered 
improved operating performance 
resulting in strong organic growth. The 
Group has achieved continued progress 
with opportunities in development and 
innovation. 
Consort’s development and innovation 
programmes are also providing a 
healthy pipeline for future organic 
growth. The new financial year has 
started well, and the Board remains 
confident of Consort meeting its growth 
expectations for the full year ending  
30 April 2017. 
dividend
The Board has reviewed the dividend 
and is proposing an increased final 
dividend of 12.56p (FY2015: 11.68p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 
19.31p (FY2015: 18.11p). The dividend 
will be paid on 21 October 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 
23 september 2016, following our AGM 
on 7 september 2016. The shares will go 
ex dividend on 22 september 2016.

Strategic Report
3 24576.04    18 July 2016 10:59 AM   PROOF 8
Consort Medical is a leading 
global contract development and 
manufacturing organisation (CdMO), 
providing advanced delivery 
technologies, formulation and 
manufacturing solutions for drugs. The 
Group’s customers include some of 
the world’s largest pharmaceutical 
companies.
the g roup comprises two 
integrated operating divisions:
Bespak (devices) — a global market 
leader in the development and 
manufacture of drug delivery devices, 
serving pharmaceutical companies with 
inhaler, auto-injector, nasal and ocular 
technologies and development and 
manufacturing services.
aesica (drugs) — a leading 
pharmaceutical CdMO serving 
pharmaceutical companies with active 
pharmaceutical ingredient (APi) and 
finished dose formulation development 
and manufacturing services.
Optimising world-class drug delivery 
device development and manufacture, 
together with drug APi and finished 
dose formulation and manufacture, 
within the Group streamlines and 
accelerates our pharmaceutical 
customers’ drug route to market.
Here are some of the key motivations for 
investment in Consort Medical plc:
1
l ong-term Contracts
Consort Medical serves pharmaceutical 
and life sciences customers with drug/
device development, formulation and 
manufacturing services, all of which, 
typically, have long life cycles. devices 
and drug manufacturing sites are 
defined and licensed as part of the 
drug master file, and hence sourcing is 
protected. Pharmaceutical customers 
invest significant resources in launching, 
marketing and building the treatment 
franchises which often have high rates 
of repeat prescription. Accordingly, 
the core business demand is typically 
stable, predictable and often recurring, 
thereby providing relatively high visibility 
of future revenues.
2
premium Quality and 
r egulatory expertise
Consort Medical operates in a highly 
regulated environment and the quality 
standards required are world class. 
Aesica has made significant investments 
in facilities and technology with the 
aim of ensuring “best in class” quality 
and reliability. Aesica’s manufacturing 
capabilities include high capacity, 
high potency and innovative semi-
continuous manufacturing. Bespak 
is one of only a handful of operators 
globally who have the process know-
how and expertise to consistently deliver 
six sigma quality on such a high volume 
of medical components and devices.
The Group leverages this significant 
process and production know-how, 
operating a dual strategy of the 
contract manufacturing of customer 
products and, through Bespak, the 
supply of its own proprietary delivery 
device technologies, the iP for which 
is heavily protected. This value delivery 
to the customer yields attractive 
margins, whilst affording protection 
from potential new market entrants. in 
many cases, Consort Medical is heavily 
embedded within the supply chains of 
its customers.
3
diversified pharma  
services o ffering and 
product development 
portfolio expertise
A key feature of Consort Medical’s 
strategy is the diversification of its 
pharmaceutical services offering. 
in Bespak’s devices arena, this 
diversification strategy has taken the 
business from respiratory into injectables, 
nasal, ocular and point-of-care (POC) 
diagnostics (horizontal). The acquisition 
of Aesica in 2014 extended the Group’s 
pharmaceutical services offering 
into the highly complementary areas 
of drug formulation, manufacture, 
handling and packaging (vertical). 
This deeper, integrated, single source 
pharmaceutical services offering allows 
the Group to capture greater value 
from the supply chain in a market where 
customers are increasing their level of 
outsourcing. such an offering is highly 
differentiated from Consort Medical’s 
competitors.

Bespak and Aesica’s commercial teams 
work closely together, enhancing each 
other’s capabilities and strengths. They 
have the joint mission to support their 
core divisional activities, to facilitate 
introductions for their sister division’s 
commercial teams to access their core 
customer relationships, and to work 
together jointly to secure combined 
formulation and device contracts.
4
high l evel of innovation
The Group remains at the leading edge 
of innovation and is committed to 
investing in patient and customer driven 
innovation with the potential to create 
new treatments, new markets and new 
opportunities.
Bespak’s innovation team in Cambridge 
continues to develop novel drug 
delivery device offerings which are 
expected to evolve into specific 
commercial opportunities. Following on 
from the launch of the first liquid gas 
powered auto-injector (syrina
®
) and 
the first dual product injector (lila
®
) in 
2013, and a new bolus injector platform 
(lapas
®
) in 2014, this financial year saw 
the unveiling of the new syrina
®
 2.25, 
one of the most compact versions of 
auto-injector available today. Based 
on Bespak’s proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 
technology, syrina
®
 2.25 utilises a 
standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe.
The innovation Centre’s novel iP-
protected product offerings are 
proceeding through commercialisation 
and present significant organic growth 
opportunities for the Group. The 
innovation pipeline contains several 
other candidates with the potential to 
create further shareholder value in  
the future.
in FY2015, Aesica concluded a product 
development programme for a 
product manufactured using the first 
semi-continuous processing line and 
technology installed at a CdMO. The 
product is now approved and  
launched in the first major market with 
others expected to follow over the next 
24 months.
5
inorganic g rowth 
o pportunities
Following the acquisition and successful 
integration of Aesica, the Group is 
a leading global CdMO, providing 
advanced delivery technologies, 
formulation development and 
manufacturing solutions for drugs. 
Consort Medical has a clear strategy 
for growth and whilst this will be mostly 
organic in focus, the Group can also 
develop in its chosen strategy through 
further selective, relevant and value-
enhancing acquisitions.
The management team regularly 
evaluates acquisition and investment 
opportunities in complementary 
adjacent markets and technologies 
which have the potential to leverage 
the Group’s core competencies in drug 
formulation, manufacturing and delivery 
and capture additional value in the 
drug/device supply chain.
The acquisition of Aesica, and its 
successful integration, has increased 
the scale of the Group, expanding 
its capabilities and providing further 
opportunities to facilitate growth, 
both organically and through further 
acquisitions, in the future. With a 
conservative capital structure, the 
Group has financial resources available 
to realise this.
6 strong Management team
Consort Medical’s management 
team has executed successfully the 
chosen strategy of sustained/diversified 
organic growth, selective investments 
and acquisitions, and operating 
leverage. Consort Medical has been 
transformed under this strategy, with the 
Group strengthening its base of core 
competencies and leveraging them in 
strategic growth initiatives.
The management team has significant 
M&A experience, acquiring (in 2014) 
and successfully integrating Aesica 
into the Group; realising 19.0× eBiTdA 
for the King systems disposal in 2013; 
making key equity investments into 
Atlas Genetics and Precision Ocular; 
and acquiring, and subsequently 
commercialising, injectables technology 
through the acquisition of The Medical 
House.

Bespak division
Bespak’s business model is built to 
support two principal goals: 
1. Helping our customers succeed in 
commercialising their own designs of 
drug delivery devices; and
2. developing proprietary designs of 
drug delivery devices for sale to 
blue-chip pharmaceutical and life 
sciences customers.
To this aim, Bespak has and will, 
continue its diversification of the drug 
delivery segments in which it operates, 
as well as increasing its share of the 
value-added content in the supply 
chain. 
To date, Bespak has evolved the range 
of drug delivery opportunities from its 
origins in the respiratory segment to 
that of injectables, nasal, ocular and 
POC diagnostics. Bespak has also 
further enhanced its share of the value 
added in the supply chain beyond 
that of product design, development, 
industrialisation and commercial 
manufacturing operations, and into the 
handling of drugs for the purposes of 
clinical trials and commercial market 
release on behalf of its customers.
Bespak has developed significant 
core capabilities, competencies and 
processes developed through strategic 
investments in skills, technologies and 
infrastructure that provide for the best 
long-term growth and profitability 
prospects based on the value they 
deliver to our customers, whether based 
on either customer-owned or Bespak-

Aesica’s business model has, historically, 
been built on four key pillars:
1. strategic partners;
2. Geography;
3. Technology; and 
4. Organic growth.
Aesica considers strategic partners 
to be those where there is potential 
to create significant revenues across 
the Aesica network. As the industry 
is shifting towards supply chain 
consolidation, Aesica focuses on the 
retention and formation of strong 
partnerships with global pharmaceutical 
companies, generics companies and 
regional players through new business 
development and key account 
management.
Aesica’s goal is to broaden its 
technology offering through both 
acquisition and innovation and, 
in 2012, the Aesica innovation 
Board was established to identify 
and commercialise technologies. 
Aesica’s intention is to continue to 
achieve organic growth by building 
on Aesica’s foundations of new 
business development, key account 
management, project management 
and continuous improvement.

Both Aesica and Bespak are 
pharmaceutical services businesses 
with virtually identical target customer 
bases. Whilst the divisions have several 
customers in common, currently, a 
number are exclusive to either Aesica 
or Bespak. The combination of two 
such complementary pharmaceutical 
services providers allows the Group to 
provide a significantly broader, deeper 
and more integrated drug/device 
contract manufacturing and supply 
chain solution to its customers.
As well as driving the individual Aesica 
and Bespak divisions, as a larger 
pharmaceutical services company, 
the Group’s business model is to offer 
existing and prospective new customers 
a single source supply chain solution for 
drug and delivery device development, 
formulation, manufacturing and 
packaging. Optimising drug and 
device services in a single group 
streamlines and accelerates the 
route of drugs to market and reduces 
the cost and complexity of drug/
device development for the Group’s 
pharmaceutical partners.

•	 in collaboration with a key strategic 
customer, Aesica has brought 
to market readiness a product 
manufactured using the first semi-
continuous processing line and 
technology installed at a CdMO. 
The product is now approved and 
launched in the first major market with 
others expected to follow over the 
next 24 months
4 enhancement
•	 successful integration of Aesica
•	 The acquisition, and subsequent 
successful integration, of Aesica 
allows the Group to offer 
pharmaceutical and life sciences 
customers a single source for 
drug and device development, 
formulation, manufacturing and fill/
finish — a highly differentiated offering 
compared to our competitors
•	 A core objective of the acquisition 
of Aesica was to harness, over time, 
significant cross-selling opportunities, 
and to secure development and 
manufacturing opportunities for 
combined formulation and device 
services. The Bespak and Aesica 
commercial teams are working 
closely together, enhancing each 
other’s capabilities and strengths. 
They have a joint mission to support 
their core divisional activities, to 
facilitate introductions for their sister 
division’s commercial teams to access 
their core customer relationships, 
and to work together jointly to secure 
combined formulation and device 
contracts
•	 since the acquisition, a number of 
joint Bespak and Aesica meetings 
have been held with customers, 
and the consequent reaction has 
been encouraging. in addition, 
cross-selling introductions have led to 
firm enquiries in a variety of device 
opportunities for Bespak, for both 
customer and Bespak iP platforms
•	 in FY2016, the Group was awarded 
a new strategic development and 
manufacturing agreement with retinal 
therapeutics company, Precision 
Ocular. The contract is related 
to novel ocular device and drug 
applications designed to access 
specific small spaces in the eye and 
to provide unique drug distribution 
to treat retinal diseases. This is 
the Group’s first drug and device 
development and manufacturing 
contract and will leverage both 
Bespak’s device development and 
manufacturing, as well as Aesica’s 
manufacturing and filling, capabilities
•	 This contract is an important 
demonstration of the value of Consort 
Medical’s single solution for device 
and drug combinations. A significant 
attraction for Precision Ocular was 
Consort’s ability to offer a “one stop 
shop” for development and eventual 
commercial manufacture of the final 
filled, finished and packaged product
•	 Following the signing of this new 
agreement, Consort also subscribed 
£3.3m to a £13.5m dual tranche 
equity financing by Precision Ocular. 
This investment provides the Group 
with a 13.7% shareholding following 
the second tranche
Future development
The global pharmaceutical contract 
manufacturing market was estimated 
to be valued at Us$58bn in 2014 and 
is forecast to reach Us$84bn in 2020, a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 6.4% over this period. if the trend  
towards outsourcing in the 
pharmaceutical market continues as 
expected, we believe that the demand 
for an integrated service offering from a 
single provider will increase. 
Bringing Aesica’s drug formulation, 
manufacturing and packaging 
capabilities into the same group as 
Bespak’s delivery device development 
and manufacturing has created a 
leading, global, single source drug and 
device contract manufacturing partner 
for pharmaceutical customers.
The Group can now provide a 
significantly broader, deeper and 
more integrated drug/device 
contract manufacturing and supply 
chain solution to our customers in 
this growing market. The Group’s 
strategy is to continue building on, and 
strengthening, our core Aesica and 
Bespak divisions through increased 
market reach; innovation in new 
products, processes and technologies; 
and by capturing more of the drug/
device value chain. in addition, as 
a larger pharmaceutical services 
company, we will offer existing and 
prospective new customers a single 
source supply chain solution for drug 
and delivery device development, 
formulation, manufacturing and 
packaging. 
Optimising drug and device services 
in a single group will streamline and 
accelerate the route of drugs to market 
and reduce the cost and complexity 
of drug/device development for the 
Group’s pharmaceutical partners. We 
believe that such an offering is highly 
differentiated from Consort Medical’s 
current competitors.

Strategic Report

The estimated value of the global 
inhaled drug delivery devices market 
was Us$27.10bn in 2013 and is expected 
to grow with a CAGR of 12.20% to reach 
Us$48.20bn by 2018.
The respiratory sector is one of the 
most highly regulated, resulting in 
high barriers to entry. A number of key 
drugs are shortly coming “off patent”, 
resulting in a number of new generic 
entrants and associated opportunities 
for Bespak to supply both metered dose 
inhaler (Mdi) and dry powder inhaler 
(dPi) devices. Although sales remain 
relatively flat in the traditional Western 
economies, significant volume growth 
is being seen in emerging markets, 
with the Brazilian, Russian, indian and 
Chinese (BRiC) markets becoming more 
important to Bespak.
Strategy
The Group intends to increase its share 
of the respiratory market through 
the development of new drug 
delivery devices; selling into new and 
developing geographical markets; 
and offering customers finished dose 
formulation and manufacturing 
services as well as integrated drug/
device development, formulation and 
manufacturing services. The Group 
intends to maintain its competitive 
position by continuing to leverage 
continuous improvement activities as 
products move into the mature stage of 
their product life cycle.
The global injectable drug delivery 
devices market is forecast to increase 
from around U$11.6bn in 2013 to around 
Us$17.5bn in 2018. self-injection devices 
are forecast to grow at the highest 
growth rate of 16.1% with conventional 
injection devices forecast to grow at 
7.4% over this period. Growth is being 
driven by a large number of new drugs 
coming to the market for the first time 
that require delivery by injection. Whilst 
Bespak currently has a negligible share 
of this market, it is estimated that c.40% 
of all new drugs in development will 
be delivered parenterally and may, 
therefore, require some form of  
auto-injector. 
Many of these new “large molecule” 
biologic drugs are highly viscous and 
require specialist devices to enable 
them to be effectively administered, 
often by patients themselves in a non-
clinical environment. The continued 
drive to greater self-administration 
with the associated improvements to 
patient compliance, patient outcomes 
and healthcare economics will create 
significant opportunities for the Group 
to develop and manufacture auto-
injectors to meet these needs. 
in 2013, Consort Medical commercially 
unveiled the syrina
®
, Vapoursoft
®
 and 
lila
®
 injection technology ranges. in 
2014, Consort Medical commercially 
unveiled lapas
®
, a new range of 
innovative wearable bolus injection 
devices powered by Vapoursoft
®
. 
in FY2016, Bespak unveiled its latest 
addition to the syrina
®
 range of 
auto-injectors. The new syrina
®
 2.25 is 
one of the most compact versions of 
auto-injector available today utilising 
a standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe, 
and is based on Bespak’s proprietary 
Vapoursoft
®
 technology.
All of these technologies leverage 
Bespak’s expertise and iP in gas 
propulsion and, using iP acquired 
through the acquisition of The 
Medical House, combine them into a 
family of innovative next-generation 
auto-injectors. These innovative 
drug delivery devices demonstrate 
Bespak’s capabilities from device 
feasibility, concept and initial design 
through device development and 
also demonstrate the ability of the 
innovation team to deliver product 
diversification opportunities in the drug 
delivery sector.
Strategy
Consort Medical’s syrina
®
, lila
®
 and 
lapas
®
 range of auto-injectors positions 
the Group well to participate in this 
growing market. Our strategy is focused 
on the commercialisation of the 
existing pipeline in conjunction with 
the development of further iP and the 
exploitation of “innovation on demand” 
opportunities through the growing 
innovation team in Cambridge. Consort 
Medical intends to continue to move 
up the value chain by offering assembly 
and drug handling and will continue to 
look for additional, selective acquisitions 
in this area.

The global nasal drug delivery market 
was estimated to be valued at Us$8.9bn 
in 2013, and is forecast to reach 
Us$15.0bn by 2018, a CAGR of 8.60% 
over this period. Growth is being 
delivered from two main areas. Firstly, a 
number of existing branded drugs are 
coming off patent leading to generic 
entrants, all requiring their own delivery 
system as the original device associated 
with the branded drug is normally 
unavailable to them. secondly, the 
nasal drug delivery route is extremely 
effective and a number of existing and 
new drugs are being reformulated to 
enable delivery in this way, increasing 
demand for this type of drug delivery 
product. This is now a strategic market 
for Consort Medical and it currently has 
two firm development pipeline 
opportunities.

Strategy
The Group’s strategy for the nasal 
market is focused on the delivery of 
Bespak’s existing development 
programmes plus further exploitation of 
the Group’s growing iP portfolio via a 
number of “innovation on demand” 
opportunities. in addition, the Group

The global ophthalmic drugs 
market was estimated to be valued 
at Us$16bn in 2012 and is forecast to 
reach a valuation of Us$21.6bn in 
2018, a CAGR of 5.20% over this period. 
The global ophthalmic drugs market 
is driven by key factors such as rising 
prevalence of ocular disorders such 
as diabetic retinopathy and macular 
degeneration, largely driven by the 
rising percentage of ageing population 
in the world. 
Strategy
in FY2016, the Group was awarded 
a new strategic development and 
manufacturing agreement with retinal 
therapeutics company, Precision 
Ocular. The contract is related to novel 
ocular device and drug applications 
designed to access specific small 
spaces in the eye and to provide 
unique drug distribution to treat retinal 
diseases. As well as representing 
the Group’s first combined device/ 
formulation contract, it also extends the 
Group’s competencies into the ocular 
therapeutic area, in line with our stated 
strategy.
Aesica’s oral delivery capabilities and 
drug formulation and manufacturing 
services are highly complementary 
to Bespak’s business. The global oral 
drug delivery market was estimated 
to be valued at Us$64.3bn in 2013 
and is forecast to reach Us$100.8bn 
in 2018, a CAGR of 9.40% over this 
period, reflecting an increase in 
demand for innovative oral drugs. 
The implementation of different 
technologies for oral drug delivery is 
changing the market scenario, with this 
area receiving high levels of attention 
from pharmaceutical companies due 
to the advantages that research can 
provide, such as reformulations, which 
can reposition drugs and delay patent 
expiry.
Strategy
The Group’s strategy is to continue 
to drive organic growth in oral drug 
formulation and manufacture by 
building on Aesica’s foundations of new 
business development, key account 
management, project management 
and continuous improvement.
Although the non-tobacco nicotine 
delivery market is relatively new and 
fragmented and, therefore, difficult 
to analyse in terms of market size and 
market value, there is a consensus that 
it is a rapidly growing and dynamic 
market. The key drivers for this growth 
are the consumer and regulatory 
appetite for safer alternatives to 
tobacco smoking, coupled with 
the associated public health and 
healthcare economic benefits.
Strategy
Consort Medical’s approach to the 
nicotine delivery sector is to successfully 
industrialise and commercialise 
nicovations’ Voke
®
 device, and then to 
increase the value add content, and 
exploit wider geographic opportunities 
as the business and market develop.
The global point of care diagnostics 
market is forecast to grow at a CAGR 
of 9.3% from 2013 to 2018, to reach 
an estimated value of Us$27.5bn in 
2018. Market growth is being driven by 
the combined benefits of increased 
patient compliance, improved patient 
outcomes and lower cost of provision. 
Pharmaceutical companies are looking 
to exploit POC systems as part of a 
companion diagnostics strategy where 
drugs and tests are sold as combined 
“test and treat” packages.
Strategy
The Group’s POC diagnostics strategy 
is focused on the commercialisation of 
the Atlas Genetics device as a first stage 
penetration of the market. substantial 
progress has been made in the last 
year in the POC card development, 
in conjunction with Bespak who 
separately provide development and 
manufacturing services to Atlas, and 
with the development of the card 
reader and assay tests. in FY2016, 
Atlas announced that it had received 
approval to Ce Mark its Chlamydia 
trachomatis (CT) test to be launched 
on the Group’s io
®
 platform. By meeting 
the requirements of the iVd directive 
(98/79/eC), the CT test is now cleared 
for sale within the european Union.
Following a successful outcome to this 
programme, Consort Medical intends 
to leverage the Group’s development, 
manufacturing and regulatory know-
how in order to grow its market share, 
possibly in conjunction with additional 
selective investments or acquisitions.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
eBiT before special items increased by 
47.6% to £37.0m (FY2015: £25.1m). This 
included 20.4% growth from Bespak 
to £25.2m (FY2015: £20.9m), which 
continues to deliver strong operating 
leverage from higher revenues. Bespak 
eBiT margin increased by 170bps to 
21.5%. Aesica eBiT increased 185.0% to 
£11.8m, with eBiT margin growing 210bps 
to 7.4% reflecting strong organic growth 
from volume and improved operating 
performance of £2.7m (64.9%), and 
acquisition growth of £5.0m (121.5%) at 
constant exchange rates.
special items amounted to £21.0m 
in the year (FY2015: £17.2m): this 
comprises amortisation of intangibles, 
Aesica integration reorganisation costs, 
advisory and acquisition costs. 
Finance costs grew 99.4% to £4.7m 
(FY2015: £2.4m), reflecting the first 
full year of borrowings following the 
acquisition of Aesica. Group earnings 
before tax and special items increased 
by 42.2% to £32.3m (FY2015: £22.7m).

(FY2015: 12.3%). Capital expenditure 
of £21.5m (FY2015: £20.7m) included 
£12.7m from Bespak (FY2015: £16.9m),  
as expenditure on the significant 
planned investments in facilities and 
production capacity for deV200 and 
deV610 neared completion, and £8.8m 
from Aesica in its first full year within 
Consort.
The Group balance sheet closed with 
a net debt position of £97.0m (FY2015: 
£99.2m), representing gearing of 1.92×  
net debt: eBiTdA, comfortably within the 
 banking facility covenant (maximum  
3.0×) and in line with our expectations  
communicated at the time of the  
Aesica acquisition of below 2.0×. 
interest cover was 13.8× against 
a covenant minimum of 3.0×. The 
Group has comfortable cash resource 
availability, with total committed 
facilities of £161.2m.
The Board is proposing an increased 
final dividend of 12.56p (FY2015: 11.68p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 
19.31p (FY2015: 18.11p). 
Further commentary on the financial 
results is contained in the Bespak and 
Aesica business reviews below and 
within the Financial Review.
j oint Bespak/aesica 
Commercial activities
A core objective of the acquisition 
of Aesica was to harness, over time, 
significant cross-selling opportunities, 
and to secure development and 
manufacturing opportunities for 
combined drug and device services. 
The Bespak and Aesica commercial 
teams have continued working closely 
together in a joint mission, to facilitate 
introductions for their sister division’s 
commercial teams to access their core 
customer relationships, and to work 
together jointly to secure combined 
formulation and device contracts.
since the acquisition, a number of 
joint Bespak and Aesica meetings 
have been held with customers and 
the consequent reaction has been 
encouraging.
in addition, cross-selling introductions 
have led to firm enquiries in a variety 
of device opportunities for Bespak, for 
both customer and Bespak iP platforms.
in October 2015, the Group launched 
its new branding at the CPHi exhibition 
in Madrid. This is the largest global trade 
event for the pharma services industry 
and Bespak and Aesica exhibited 
together on the same stand drawing a 
significant amount of new and existing 
customer interest and enquiries.
in February 2016, the Group won its 
first combined Bespak and Aesica 
opportunity, securing an important 
development and supply agreement, 
covering both device development/
manufacturing and fill/finish services 
with Precision Ocular for their novel 
ocular device and drug applications. 
This exciting new partnership will 
draw on the skills and expertise of 
both Bespak and Aesica, and is an 
important demonstration of the value 
of our single solution for device and 
drug combinations. in addition, it 
extends our competencies into the 
ocular therapeutic area in line with our 
stated strategy. A significant attraction 
for Precision Ocular was Consort’s 
ability to offer a “one stop shop” for 
development and eventual commercial 
manufacture of the final filled, finished 
and packaged product.
investment in precision o cular
Following the signing of a development 
agreement with Precision Ocular for the 
development and manufacturing of 
the novel delivery device technology 
and fill finish, Consort subscribed to an 
equity financing completed by Precision 
Ocular. The financing will raise a total 
of £13.5m. investors include imperial 
innovations, Hovione, neoMed and 
Consort. Of the £13.5m equity raise, 
Consort’s investment is expected to 
be a total of £3.3m, of which the first 
tranche was £2.0m, giving the Group a 
12.2% shareholding, rising to 13.7% after 
the second tranche. Consort Medical 
also has a Board seat at Precision 
Ocular. 
We believe Precision Ocular’s 
proprietary drug products and drug 
delivery system has the potential to 
be a platform technology with broad 
applicability. Precision Ocular’s novel 
drug products and drug delivery 
system is designed to access specific 
small spaces in the eye and to provide 
unique drug distribution to tissues 
specifically involved in retinal diseases. 
This unique approach effectively 
optimizes the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of both existing 
and new ophthalmic therapeutic 
agents. it may also increase therapeutic 
effectiveness, reduce side effects and 
minimize the frequency of treatment for 
certain patient groups.
Consort is a leading company in 
innovation and our participation in 
Precision Ocular’s equity financing 
once again highlights our commitment 
to investing in companies that are at 
the forefront of the development of 
new treatments, new markets and new 
opportunities.

Bespak has a well-established and 
diverse core business of products in 
volume manufacturing. Once again, 
the business performed strongly in 
the year with the production of the 
2 billionth HFA pMdi valve, as well 
as winning two new development 
contracts.
Revenue grew 10.8% to £117.2m with 
growth in all segments. Mdi produced a 
particularly strong revenue performance 
with 7.1% growth, especially in valve 
sales. dPi grew revenue 1.6% with 
continuing growth from the Chiesi 
nexThaler. Other sales continued this 
trend with growth of 49.3%, including a 
doubling of sales in injectables. included 
in these segments, service revenue 
also continued its strong contribution 
given the growing development and 
innovation pipelines.
Overall, with all segments growing, 
the positive diversification trend has 
continued, with the proportion of sales 
by segment for Mdi at 51.1% (FY2015: 
52.9%), dPi at 31.2% (FY2015: 34.0%), and 
Other 17.7% (FY2015: 13.2%). in 2012, 
Other sales were just 8.0% of Bespak’s 
total sales, and have therefore more 
than doubled in the last four years, 
delivering on our diversification strategy.
The strong revenue performance 
significantly translated to eBiT growth, 
which increased 20.4% to £25.2m, 
delivering strong operating leverage 
from the increased volume and 
further benefits driven from continuous 
improvement initiatives as eBiT margin 
increased 170bps to 21.5%.
Product Development
in line with our strategy, we have 
assembled a full and broad product 
development pipeline of organic 
growth opportunities, which will add to 
the strength of the core business going 
forwards. successful conversion of these 
opportunities will provide progressive 
revenue and profit growth, in both 
contract manufacturing and products 
with our own proprietary iP and across 
a range of therapeutic areas, including 
commercial drug handling.
Our published development portfolio 
provides an update on the key business 
development projects in the business. 
We guide that for inclusion in the 
published portfolio, projects must have 
a reasonable expectation of success, 
though timescales are difficult to 
predict, and be expected to produce 
peak annual sales of at least £3m  
per annum. 
in the period, we successfully added 
two new projects to our development 
pipeline. These include one respiratory 
project and one ocular, which is 
Bespak’s first project in this therapeutic 
area:
•	 VAl050 is a significant new 
development and supply agreement 
for our proprietary pMdi valve and 
actuator technology for Aeropharm 
GmbH, a sandoz company
•	 OCU050 is a development contract 
for Precision Ocular for their novel 
drug products and drug delivery 
system, which is designed to access 
specific small spaces in the eye and 
to provide unique drug distribution to 
tissues specifically involved in retinal 
diseases

in november 2015, Bespak unveiled 
its latest addition to the syrina

 range 
of auto-injectors at the PdA europe 
2015 exhibition/conference. The new 
syrina
®
 2.25 is one of the most compact 
auto-injectors available today, utilising 
a standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe, 
and based on Bespak’s proprietary 
Vapoursoft
®
 technology. 
its benefits include:
•	 self-administration, which reduces the 
treatment cost to the health system as 
the patient does not need to attend 
a clinic and
•	 simple adaptability of dose size/
power source dependent on drug 
and viscosity, providing lower 
configurability/adaptability risk and 
a simple delivery mechanism for 
pharma clients
The target drug market includes 
biologics, where the viscosity and 
volume of some drugs means that there 
is significant benefit from powered 
injection. The platform incorporates our 
proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 technology to 
“power” the injection for large dosage 
volumes and a very wide range of 
viscosities.

FY2016 saw Aesica’s first full year within 
Consort. in order to provide a means of 
monitoring Aesica’s development on a 
like-for-like basis, a bridge of FY2016 to 
FY2015 is provided in the table above, 
showing organic and acquisition growth 
and currency exchange rate effects. 
Aesica was acquired by Consort in 
november 2014, hence FY2015 only 
consolidated six months of Aesica’s 
financial performance.
Aesica revenue grew 102.1% to 
£159.7m, which included organic 
growth of £1.4m (1.8%) and acquisition 
growth of £80.1m (101.4%) at constant 
exchange rates. Aesica has grown 
its business in anaesthetics during the 
year, with both customer and product 
diversity, mainly from its Queenborough 
facility.
Aesica has made solid progress in 
the year in improving its operating 
performance into increased eBiT and 
eBiT margin. eBiT in FY2016 grew by 
185.0% to £11.8m, with eBiT margin 
growing 210bps to 7.4%, reflecting 
strong organic growth from volume 
and improved operating performance 
of £2.7m (64.9%) and acquisition 
growth of £5.0m (121.5%), at constant 
exchange rates. This follows sustained 
and growing improvements in 
operational performance across the 
network from upgrades to teams and 
processes, as well as a continued focus 
on the elimination and management 
of low margin products. in addition, 
restructuring actions (see below) have 
begun to deliver operational savings in 
the current year, with further benefits to 
be received in the forthcoming year. 
This has propelled the eBiT margin to 
7.4% in FY2016, an increase of 210bps 
over the prior year (FY2015: 5.3%).
Post-acquisition integration restructuring 
actions signposted 12 months ago have 
been completed at a cost of £6.5m – 
within the previously communicated 
budget of £7.7m:
•	 The newcastle corporate office has 
been closed, with the remaining 
shared service functions moved to 
smaller local facilities
•	 The restructuring in Germany has 
completed, with consolidation of 
warehousing and a move to cell 
based manufacturing
•	 The nottingham site has closed and 
the Finished dose development 
activities have been relocated to 
existing refurbished facilities at the 
Queenborough site

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Aesica has maintained a solid 
regulatory track record during the 
year with successful FdA and MHRA 
audits at some of its sites, as well as 
ongoing customer audits. A large 
pharmaceutical company and major 
customer awarded Aesica an external 
supplier Award, reflecting Aesica’s 
strong focus on reliability, service and 
quality. 
Business Development  
and Innovation
Following the closure and relocation of 
the Finished dose development Centre 
from nottingham to Queenborough, 
it has received its first new contract 
at the newly recommissioned facilities 
and has generated a high level of 
interest and site visits from both large 
pharmaceutical and small “virtual” 
pharmaceutical customers. its initial 
business focus will be on Potents and 
other high demand areas.
in FY2015, Aesica concluded a product 
development programme for a 
product manufactured using the first 
semi-continuous processing line and 
technology installed at a CdMO. The 
product is now approved and launched 
in the first major market, with others 
expected to follow over the next 24 
months. 
Aesica has been working with a leading 
Japanese pharmaceutical company 
to provide the active ingredient for 
an anti-inflammatory formulation 
containing s+flurbiprofen. The patch 
has received market approval from the 
Ministry of Health, labour and Welfare in 
Japan for the indication of osteoarthritis. 
Aesica is in the process of supplying 
APi materials for launch stock under 
a new long term supply agreement, 
with demand for the new formulation 
expected to grow steadily from 2016.
Aesica provides an integrated supply 
chain management service to some of 
its customers and has announced the 
extension of this service. in addition to 
providing its finished dose, packaging 
and release operations to the 
customer, the service model provides 
management of product supply chains 
of upstream and downstream processes 
at third party suppliers on the customer’s 
behalf. This additional service enables 
the customer to reduce the overall 
number of CdMO partners it deals with. 
Aesica has been routinely offering this 
service to two of its customers and 
market feedback clearly points to other 
opportunities with existing and new 
customers.
during the year, the business has 
identified a number of attractive 
business development opportunities 
from investment in additional 
capabilities, or upgrade and expansion 
of existing ones. These incremental 
capex programmes will take place over 
the next 24 months.
Pipeline
Aesica is primarily focused on two pools 
of business development: development 
services and manufacturing services, 
with some overlap between the two. 
•	 development services applies 
know-how in APi/formulation 
development to a wide range of 
project opportunities for a wide range 
of customers at different stages of the 
clinical trial cycle
•	 Manufacturing services revenue 
mainly comes from the application 
of its process technology and know-
how to specific APi and drug product 
manufacturing opportunities, many 
of which may be different from 
those APi/formulation development 
opportunities
The Aesica commercial team is 
focused on a growing pipeline of 
APi/formulation development and 
manufacturing opportunities. There is 
significant contractual and commercial 
confidentiality as to the identity of 
specific projects and contracts.

Consort has again delivered strong 
financial performance in FY2016, as 
material organic revenue growth 
produced significant operating 
leverage and eBiT growth, with margin 
expansion in both businesses. The Group 
has reduced net debt whilst continuing 
its elevated level of capital expenditure 
to support future development pipeline 
opportunities, and coupled with growth 
in eBiTdA has reduced its net debt to 
eBiTdA covenant to below 2.0×, as 
predicted and to the schedule given at 
the time of the Aesica acquisition.
income statement
Group revenue grew by £92.1m 
(49.8%) to £276.9m (FY2015: £184.8m), 
from organic growth in Bespak and 
from organic and acquisition growth 
in Aesica. eBiT before special items 
increased by £11.9m (47.6%) to £37.0m 
(FY2015: £25.1m), from organic volume 
and productivity growth in both 
businesses, with eBiT margin of 13.4% 
(FY2015: 13.6%). 
Further analysis of Bespak and Aesica 
Revenue, eBiTdA, eBiT and margins is 
provided in the Business Reviews within 
the Chief executive’s Review.
With a full year of utilisation of the 
Group’s borrowing facilities following 
the acquisition of Aesica in november 
2014 (about halfway through FY2015), 
Finance costs increased to £4.7m 
(FY2015: £2.4m). The net effect of the 
increased eBiT and the increased 
Finance costs was an increase in 
earnings before tax before special  
items of £9.6m (42.2%) to £32.3m  
(FY2015: £22.7m). 
earnings before tax after special items 
also increased by £5.7m (104%) to 
£11.2m (FY2015: £5.5m). earnings after

the year was £1.2m in its cash tax 
(FY2015: £1.1m).
The Group’s effective tax rate (eTR) 
has fallen from 14.4% to 13.0%. This has 
been contributed to by a combination 
of factors, including the Patent Box, 
prior year tax adjustments, increased 
capital allowances, utilisation of brought 
forward losses in The Medical House. 
some of the prior year tax adjustments 
and utilisation of brought forward losses 
are not expected to repeat in FY2017, 
and the eTR is expected to increase 
to c.18%, subject to the mix of Bespak 
sales (iP and non iP protected), and 
the mix of the Aesica sales between UK, 
Germany and italy.
The Group’s Tax strategy continues to 
follow the commercial development of 
the business, whilst taking advantage 
of government tax incentive policies 
where available in the jurisdictions within 
which it operates. The Group continues 
to be rated low risk by HMRC.
dividend
The Board has reviewed the dividend 
and is proposing an increased final 
dividend of 12.56p (FY2015: 11.68p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 
19.31p (FY2015: 18.11p). The dividend 
will be paid on 21 October 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at  
23 september 2016, following our AGM 
on 7 september 2016. The shares will 
go ex dividend on 22 september 2016. 
dividend cover, based on earnings 
before special items, was 3.0 times 
(FY2015: 2.6 times) (see note 12).
special items from  
Continuing o perations
special items are those items which the 
Group considers to be non-repetitive 
or are not a part of the underlying 
performance of the business, and often 
where a material income statement 
cost or credit is incurred in one year 
to deliver a future benefit. in FY2016, 
special items amounted to £21.0m 
(FY2015: £17.2m). This comprises 
Amortisation of intangibles of £13.1m, 
Aesica integration reorganisation of 
£6.5m, advisory and acquisition costs of 
£1.4m (see note 6).
discontinued o perations
On 15 February 2013, Consort 
completed the sale of King systems 
to Ambu A/s, the results of which are 
reported within discontinued operations. 
At the time of sale, contingent 
consideration mechanisms were agreed 
as a central element of the value 
realisation from the disposal. The first 
of these was a £5.9m (Us$10.0m) lump 
sum payment upon the launch of the 
King Vision next generation blade. This 
was received in May 2014 following 
a successful product launch. Further 
amounts of Us$2.3m and Us$2.5m were 
received on 4 June 2014 and 18 June 
2015 respectively, representing the 
amounts due in respect of the FY2014 
and FY2015 King Vision sales. 
King Vision sales by Ambu in FY2016 
were insufficient to trigger a further 
contingent consideration payment to 
Consort Medical. As the contingent 
consideration mechanisms of the 
disposal agreement have now 
expired, the remaining contingent 
consideration debtor balance of £1.0m 
has been charged to the income 
statement through special items within 
discontinued Operations. 
acquisition of aesica
On 12 november 2014, the Group 
acquired the entire issued share capital 
of Aesica Holdco ltd for £226.6m. 
The transaction was approved by 
shareholders on 16 October 2014.
Following the acquisition, an integration 
programme was initiated. The costs of 
this programme incurred in FY2015 were 
£1.9m and were charged as special 
items in that year. Further integration 
programme costs of c.£7.7m were 
anticipated at 16 June 2015 in relation 
to integration actions announced since 
30 April 2015. These actions have been 
completed on schedule at a cost of 
only £6.5m, which has been charged to 
special items in the period.

Strategic Report 24576.04    18 July 2016 10:59 AM   PROOF 8
during the year ended 30 April 2016, the 
Group completed the initial accounting 
for the acquisition as disclosed in the 
30 April 2015 annual report and 
accounts. The goodwill balance as at 
30 April 2016 in relation to Aesica is 
£106.8m (FY2015 restated: £101.9m). 
This resulted in retrospective adjustments 
to the provisional fair values of the 
identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed as at the date of 
acquisition as at 30 April 2015. The 
significant adjustments to fair values 
made in the year are as follows:
•	 Property, plant and equipment — 
decrease of £5.7m as a result of 
concluding a detailed review and 
valuation exercise
•	 Trade receivables — decrease of 
£1.3m to increase provisions against 
old debtor balances and credit notes
•	 Accruals, deferred income, provisions 
and other payables — decrease 
of £1.0m mainly as a result of new 
information obtained which reflects 
circumstances in existence at the 
acquisition date
•	 Current tax — decrease of £1.6m to 
record additional provisions
•	 deferred tax — increase of £2.1m on 
the non-tax related opening balance 
sheet adjustments above
•	 deferred tax — since 31 October 
2015, a deferred tax asset of £1.9m 
has been recognised, as the amount 
of spend treated as qualifying 
for capital allowances has been 
reduced by customer contributions 
in Aesica which were received pre-
acquisition. The impact of this change 
has been to decrease goodwill by the 
same amount.
investment in atlas g enetics ltd
Consort has invested a total of £6.3m in 
Atlas Genetics ltd, as set out in note 16 
to the financial statements. The other 
equity partners include novartis Venture 
Funds, Johnson & Johnson development 
Corporation, life science Partners and 
BB Biotech Ventures, and RMi Partners 
(see note 16).
substantial progress has been made 
in the last year in the POC card 
development — in conjunction with 
Bespak who separately provides 
development and manufacturing 
services to Atlas — and with the 
development of the card reader 
and assay tests. On 8 February 2016 
Atlas announced that it had received 
approval to Ce Mark its Chlamydia 
trachomatis (CT) test to be launched on 
the Company’s io
®
 platform. By meeting 
the requirements of the iVd directive 
(98/79/eC), the CT test is now cleared 
for sale within the european Union. 
More information about Atlas Genetics 
is available via their website www.
atlasgenetics.com. 
The Group will continue to account 
for Atlas as an equity investment in the 
accounts of Consort.
investment in precision  
o cular ltd
On 22 February 2016, Consort 
subscribed to an equity financing 
completed by Precision Ocular, a retinal 
therapeutics company. The financing 
will raise a total of £13.5m. investors 
included imperial innovations, Hovione, 
neoMed and Consort. Of the £13.5m 
equity raise, Consort’s investment is 
expected to be a total of £3.3m, of 
which the first tranche was £2.0m, 
giving the Group a 12.2% shareholding. 
The second tranche of £1.3m — which 
is subject to certain conditions — will 
take Consort’s overall shareholding 
to13.7%. Consort also has a Board seat 
at Precision Ocular.
separately, the Group entered 
into a strategic development and 
manufacturing agreement with 
Precision Ocular. The agreement 
will leverage both Bespak’s device 
development and manufacturing 
capability, as well as Aesica’s 
manufacturing and filling capabilities 
on Precision Ocular’s novel ocular drug 
products and drug delivery system.
The Group will account for Precision 
Ocular as an equity investment in the 
accounts of Consort.

Consort MediCal plC 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Balance sheet
The Group has net debt of £97.0m at 
the year end (FY2015: net debt £99.2m). 
At 30 April 2016 it had drawn £114.5m 
of its committed revolving credit facility, 
leaving undrawn facilities of £46.6m. 
in addition, it has a further £65.0m 
available under the accordion facility. 
Gross assets were £445.8m (FY2015 
restated: £468.8m). The pension deficit 
increased to £27.2m (FY2015: £21.1m) 
and is reviewed separately below. 
Provisions at 30 April 2016 were £6.2m 
(30 April 2015 restated: £5.9m).
Cash Flow, Financing  
and l iquidity
1
Cash generated from operations 
increased by £25.7m to £54.1m (FY2015: 
£28.4m). eBiTdA before special items 
increased by £15.1m (45.3%) to £48.3m 
(FY2015: £33.2m). Working capital
2
 
decreased by £20.2m to £14.0m 
(FY2015: £34.1m).
Capital expenditure of £21.5m (FY2015: 
£20.7m) was higher than the previous 
year as Bespak continued to make 
significant planned investments in 
facilities and production capacity to 
fulfil its development pipeline contracts, 
and a full year of capital expenditure in 
Aesica. 
As part of the acquisition of Aesica 
Holdco limited, the Group created a 
new bank facility and cancelled the 
previous facility with Royal Bank of 
scotland (RBs) and HsBC. The current 
facility is a £160m five-year multi-
currency revolving credit facility with 
Barclays, lloyds, RBs and santander. 
The facility expires in september 2019. 
Margins are between 1.25% and 2.2% 
over liBOR depending upon the ratio 
of net debt to eBiTdA prevailing at the 
time. A non-utilisation fee of 40% of the 
interest margin on the undrawn balance 
applies. 
The facility has two covenants: net debt 
to eBiTdA less than 3.0× in April 2016; 
and interest Cover over eBiTdA being 
greater than three times. The Group 
remains comfortably within both its 
headroom and its covenants at 30 April 
2016: net debt to eBiTdA was at 1.92, 
and interest Cover was 13.8 times. 
Under the terms of the refinancing, the 
Group also has a £65m “accordion” 
facility, by which further facilities may 
be made available by the participating 
banks under the current terms to 
support significant investment or 
acquisition opportunities which may 
arise. 
The Group maintains levels of sterling 
cash sufficient to meet imminent 
obligations and to be a reserve in case 
of an adverse event. These funds are 
invested with a range of reputable 
financial institutions approved by the 
Board. 
Whilst the multi-year revolving 
committed credit facility does not 
expire for more than three years, the 
debt within this is disclosed as less than 
one year on the balance sheet, as it is 
drawn for one-month periods, and then 
redrawn as appropriate to minimise the 
amount of debt drawn relative to the 
Group’s needs to minimise the interest 
payable, as assumed in its Viability 
statement considerations (see note 23).
Foreign Currency exposure
The Group monitors its foreign currency 
exposures carefully and seeks to 
mitigate all material transactional 
exposures. Bespak currently has low 
exposure to movements in the euro and 
Us dollar. Aesica has wider exposure 
to the euro. Where appropriate we 
buy or sell forward currency to protect 
transaction margin exposure. 
As a result of the Group’s German and 
italian euro denominated operations, 
foreign currency translation sensitivity 
for the euro is such that a €1c change 
in the euro: GBP exchange rate impacts 
revenue by £0.6m and eBiT by £0.1m. 
pensions
The iAs19 pension valuation at  
30 April 2016 was a total deficit of 
£27.2m (30 April 2015: £21.1m). The 
defined benefit pension obligations of 
the Group comprise both Bespak and 
Aesica schemes.
Bespak Scheme
in 2002, the Bespak Retirement Benefits 
scheme (a defined benefit pension 
scheme) was closed to new members. 
during the period, the Group carried 
out consultations with the Trustees and 
active members of the scheme on a 
proposal to close it to further accrual. 
Following the consultations, the scheme 
was closed with effect from 31 March 
2016 via a deed of amendment 
between the Group and the Trust. 
Following the scheme closure, all former 
active members became deferred 
members, and the provision of pension 
benefits was migrated to a defined 
contribution pension scheme which is 
also available to new employees (see 
note 21). The costs of the professional 
services to support the closure have 
been charged to special items. 
As at 30 April 2016, the Bespak iAs 
19 deficit was £23.4m compared 
with £17.8m as at 30 April 2015. The 
movement was primarily as a result of 
lower return on plan assets. The last 
triennial actuarial valuation of the 
pension scheme was at 30 April 2014; in 
september 2015, the Company and the 
Trustees agreed the actuarial valuation 
at a deficit of £13.8m. As part of that 
agreement, the Company agreed to 
make deficit recovery contributions 
at the rate of £1.5m per annum until 
2028. since the last triennial valuation, 
prevailing discount rates have worsened 
further, and it is expected that this in 
particular may have a material effect 
on the updated valuation.
Aesica Schemes
Aesica operates a number of different 
pension schemes, which are outlined 
in note 21 to the accounts including 
defined benefit schemes in italy and 
Germany with a net iAs 19 deficit of 
£3.8m (see note 21).
r isk Management
The Group considers effective risk 
management to be a high priority. 
We are pleased to report that the 
Group incurred no material financial or 
business losses in the period.

in the period, we successfully added two new projects to Bespak’s development pipeline. These were a 
significant new development and supply agreement for our proprietary pMdi valve and actuator technology 
for Aeropharm GmbH, a sandoz company; and a new strategic development and manufacturing agreement

in FY2016, the Group was awarded a new strategic development and manufacturing agreement with Precision 
Ocular. This is the Group’s first drug and device development and manufacturing contract and will leverage both 
Bespak’s device development and manufacturing, as well as Aesica’s manufacturing and filling, capabilities.
Aesica has been working with a leading Japanese pharma company to provide the active ingredient for an anti-
inflammatory formulation containing s+flurbiprofen. Aesica is a leading supplier of the active ingredient flurbiprofen 
and the modified s+flurbiprofen and demand for the new formulation is expected to grow steadily from 2016.

prin Cipal r isks & u n Certainties
The Group’s performance and prospects may be affected by risks and 
uncertainties relating to our business and operating environment.
risk Controls and Mitigating actions trend
reliance upon key customers/products: Both 
Aesica and Bespak have a degree of reliance 
on a relatively small number of key customers/
products and the loss of one such customer/
product could lead to a significant reduction in 
revenues.
The Group has significant intellectual Property with 
associated barriers to entry. Regulatory licensing reduces 
customers’ ability to transfer business elsewhere, so a loss 
of business once approved on a customer programme 
is unusual. The Group maintains a close dialogue with all 
of its customers and seeks to enter into long term supply 
agreements where appropriate. The Group’s strategy 
of diversification has opened up a broader range of 
products and customers, and is progressively diluting 
customer/product concentration.
Major operational incident: A major incident 
(e.g. fire) at a manufacturing site may result in 
the closure of a site causing disruption to key 
supply chain and loss of assets, revenues and 
profit.
Where possible, manufacturing is split into discrete 
buildings for separate operations providing some level 
of isolation for certain products. The Group carries out 
critical plant risk and remediation assessments at each of 
its manufacturing sites. High-profile near-miss reporting is 
performed to raise awareness of potential risks. Business 
continuity plans are also in place at major sites.
growth risk: The Group’s growth strategy is 
achieved through four key elements: sustained 
organic revenue growth, operating leverage, 
innovation and enhancing acquisitions/
investments. delivery of growth carries the risk 
of execution due to allocation of resources and 
new areas of expertise.
The Group has well-honed programme planning and 
management processes. These provide good visibility 
of resource requirements, whether capital, space, 
equipment or people, and enable timely fulfilment on 
multiple parallel programmes. Programme management 
techniques are risk based and highlight risks and 
challenges for increased management focus.
acquisition risk: Failure to successfully execute 
or attain strategic objectives from the Group’s 
acquisitions may adversely affect the Group’s 
financial performance and position. despite 
due diligence, changes in circumstances could 
mean that initial expectations are not met in 
whole or in part.
The Group uses a clear set of criteria for making 
acquisition decisions while also engaging a long 
standing set of advisors who provide advice throughout 
an acquisition process. Appropriate due diligence is 
performed on all potential mergers and acquisitions. All 
acquisition plans are reviewed and sanctioned by the 
Board. Warranties and indemnities are also sought from 
the seller, which act to further reduce risk/exposure in 
certain areas.
legal risk: As an international enterprise, the 
Group must comply with differing laws in 
different jurisdictions. This can result in a wide 
range of risks relating to contract, competition, 
trademark, patent and anti-bribery/corruption 
laws. significant penalties, such as fines, the 
requirement to comply with monitoring or self-
reporting obligations could materially adversely 
affect our reputation, business or financial 
performance.
The Group limits such risks by means of review by the 
legal department and, where appropriate, by consulting 
external specialists on national laws in the jurisdictions 
concerned. There is a specific anti-corruption and anti-
bribery policy which all employees are required to comply 
with and confirm their understanding. There is also a 
whistle blowing policy in place and Bribery Act training is 
given to employees. The Group is not aware of any risks 
from legal disputes that could have a significant impact 
on its financial results or net assets.
political/socio-economic risk: The Group has 
operations and customers in a number of 
countries worldwide. As a result it is subject to 
political and socio-economic risks both globally 
and in individual countries. Political or economic 
instability may impact the performance of our 
business both operationally and financially.
The Group maintains open relationships with its customers 
and suppliers to ensure that we are up to date on any 
political/economic conditions which may impact the 
business. The Group continually reviews any economic 
policy changes in both the UK and Global markets and 
assesses if there is any impact on the business.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Our internal controls include risk management processes to identify key risks and, where possible, to manage those risks through 
systems and processes and by implementing specific mitigation strategies. The most significant risks identified through our 
progressive review of the risk register that could materially affect the Group’s ability to achieve its financial and operating 
objectives are summarised in this section. Other risks are either unknown or deemed less material.
risk Controls and Mitigating actions trend
development risk: Bespak is developing a 
range of medical device products. Aesica is 
providing pharmaceutical product formulation 
development, analytics and manufacturing 
services to pharmaceutical and biotech 
companies. At any time, any of the products 
may fail in clinical trials, be withdrawn by the 
customer or may not become commercially 
successful once launched. 
The Group follows rigorous processes for the development 
of new products. Where possible, Bespak is developing its 
device technology as a platform for multiple programmes 
to reduce the exposure to any individual trial. Aesica’s 
development services are on a fee per project basis, 
with the large majority of its revenues coming from 
manufacturing services.
product quality failure: The Group operates 
in highly regulated markets with strict quality 
requirements. Any quality failure involving 
the Group’s products could lead to loss of 
reputation, reduction in revenues, recall costs or 
sanction by the regulators.
The Group has rigorous quality management and 
assurance systems and processes. incoming raw materials 
are analysed, production processes are controlled and 
products are sampled for testing prior to release.
Corporate social responsibility: Our 
manufactured products or other activities/
decisions of the Group may not be judged by 
the public, governments or other stakeholders 
as being socially responsible, leading to 
reputational harm.
The Group continually reviews and explores ways 
to ensure that its business operates in a responsible 
manner across the key focus areas of: health and 
safety, environmental management, our people, ethical 
business practices and how it interacts and supports local 
communities. The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
meet regularly and is responsible for reviewing the 
divisions’ new programmes, assisting with resourcing and 
ensuring alignment to the overall Group strategy.
regulatory risk: The operations of the Group 
are subject to various stringent regulatory 
requirements which carry an element of 
compliance risk (e.g. environmental, health & 
safety).
A strong regulatory compliance regime is in place and 
the Group has invested heavily in ensuring compliance 
with health, safety and regulatory requirements. Regular 
reviews and audits take place, not only by regulatory 
bodies such as the FdA and MHRA but also by customers. 
Bespak is isO 13485 accredited and operates sAP in all 
its main processes. Aesica’s APi facilities are inspected 
and approved by the FdA and all manufacturing sites 
are approved by the MHRA and comply with cGMP 
manufacturing standards and requirements.
it/Cyber risk: The Group is dependent on 
information technology: its systems and 
infrastructure face certain risks, including service 
disruptions and the loss or theft of sensitive 
or confidential information. Cyber crime is 
increasing in sophistication, consequences and 
incidence, with risks including virus “infection”, 
unauthorised access (hacking), and email-
based phishing frauds.
The Group adopts a risk based approach in responding 
to Cyber risks. The Group has a dedicated iT department 
who monitor and review access security, ensure that 
there are regular back-ups of confidential information 
and data, perform disaster recovery procedures when 
required and manage investment in the Group’s iT 
infrastructure. Continuous vigilance and training are 
required to mitigate Cyber security risks, as perpetrators 
are creative and dynamic on a wide spectrum of 
strategies.

risk Controls and Mitigating actions trend
human resources: The Group relies heavily on 
recruiting and retaining talented employees 
with a diverse range of skills and capabilities to 
meet its strategic objectives. A lack of training, 
recruitment, securing the long term loyalty 
of sufficient numbers of qualified personnel, 
demographic change and any resulting skills 
shortages could have a considerable impact 
on our success.
Remuneration packages are reviewed on an annual 
basis in order to ensure that the Group can continue to 
attract, retain, incentivise and motivate its employees. 
The Group is also committed to working on improving 
drivers of engagement, such as increasing our employees’ 
understanding of our strategy, performance and core 
values.
Currency risk: As the Group is headquartered 
in the UK, its functional currency is pounds 
sterling. As the Group conducts a large part of 
its business in europe (euro) and also contracts 
in other currencies including Usd and Japanese 
Yen, exchange rate fluctuations can have an 
impact on earnings.
Currency exposures are reviewed on a monthly basis. The 
Group has a currency hedging strategy in place to cover 
known transactional currency exposures. The Group’s 
european operations are naturally hedged whereas 
its UK operations hedge contracted non-GBP Fx flows. 
The Group hedges its Balance sheet Fx exposure by 
structuring its debt currency composition in line with the 
base currency of its assets.
interest rate risk: The Group is subject to interest 
rate risk on its revolving credit facility which 
is currently based on liBOR/eURiBOR plus a 
margin.
The terms of the facility are reviewed by the Board on a 
regular basis. in the current low interest rate environment, 
the Group has decided not to hedge its floating rate debt 
into fixed rate for the time being. However, the Group 
actively monitors interest rates and debt markets and 
will manage any floating rate interest rate exposure, as 
appropriate.
liquidity and leverage risk: Whilst the Group 
has comfortable borrowing facilities and strong 
cash flows, there is a risk of unforeseen short 
term working capital fluctuations which it may 
not be able to meet, or which may breach 
covenants on its borrowing facilities.
The Group has strong cash flows, and good earnings 
visibility ensuring that its margins are sufficient to exceed 
normal operating costs. The business is cash-generative, 
and there are well-embedded cash and working capital 
management processes. Current borrowing levels and 
financial covenants can be supported comfortably 
by forecast profit and cash flows. Covenant tests 
are performed bi-annually to determine whether the 
covenant tests are being met. Committed facilities are in 
place until september 2019.
pension risk: The Group operates a number of 
defined benefit pension schemes which are 
valued based upon a number of actuarial 
assumptions. Fluctuations as well as errors or 
misstatements in these assumptions may result 
in the pension schemes being underfunded or 
valued incorrectly.
The Group works closely with the Pension Trustees to 
ensure that the defined Benefit schemes are adequately 
funded and that the assets are invested appropriately. 
The Bespak scheme was closed to future accrual in 
March 2016 and has been closed to new members since 
2002. The total deficit on the Bespak pension scheme was 
£23.4m at 30 April 2016. Aesica has four defined benefit 
schemes in Germany and italy, two of which are closed 
to new members. The total deficit on the Aesica pension 
schemes was £3.8m at 30 April 2016 (see note 21).

stakeholder engagement 
We continue to enhance our 
performance through active 
engagement with our key stakeholders. 
This includes working with our employees 
to integrate responsible business 
practices into everyday business 
activity, encouraging innovative 
solutions and a shared ownership 
of this agenda. We also extend this 
engagement out to our customers, 
suppliers and communities to ensure 
we maintain a two-way dialogue which 
feeds back into building a sustainable 
future for our business.
o ur performance 
We see year-on-year progress in the 
way we manage our key responsibilities 
and have moved our focus from the 
low hanging fruit to the more complex 
challenges of running a responsible 
business. This has been supported by 
an appropriate level of governance 
and number of challenging targets 
which are reported at each of our CR 
Committee meetings. A summary of 
performance against each of our focus 
areas is highlighted below.
health and safety
The safety and well-being of our staff 
and all visitors to our facilities remains a 
priority for everyone within the business. 
We continue to focus on all aspects 
of health and safety, with a special 
emphasis on those areas with the 
potential to cause serious harm. 
The number of RiddORs (Reportable 
incident leading to seven day lost Time 
Accident) reported across the Group 
totalled nine, against a target of seven. 
Whilst it is regrettable that any 
employee suffers an injury at work, we 
endeavour to create a safe working 
environment for all our personnel. Our 
commitment to near miss reporting, 
hazard evaluation, risk assessment and 
control will remain a key feature of 
our improvement programmes across 
both Aesica and Bespak in FY2017 and 
beyond.
Activity to provide for a safe working 
environment at both Aesica and Bespak 
facilities has been highlighted below:
Bespak
Bespak has implemented an improved 
accident investigation process which 
provides a more structured root cause 
analysis of accidents. The benefits of 
this improved process have seen an 
extended collaboration in accident 
investigations resulting in corrective 
and improvement actions being 
implemented in areas beyond only 
those where the accident occurred. 
Accident trending has not identified 
any specific process related trends; 
however many are preventable and 
therefore have pointed towards being 
behavioural related.  To validate this 
theory, Bespak has undertaken its first 
Behavioural safety Culture survey 
with the aim of using the feedback 
to shape the safety objectives for the 
organisation for FY2017 and beyond.
in parallel, the prevention system of 
“near miss” reporting continues to 
show a positive increase in proactive 
reporting of potential hazards that could 
cause harm. This continued success can 
be attributed to management and eHs 
team walks, tiered accountability and 
active resolution of issues.

significant focus this year has been 
given to processes which Bespak 
considers to be the highest risk to safety. 
This risk assessed approach includes 
construction programmes as well as 
manufacturing activities with particular 
reference to age, complexity and non-
standard nature of operations. 
Aesica
Beyond the daily management of 
upholding high standards of safety 
management Aesica has focused 
activity on environment, Health and 
safety messaging and in January 2016 
launched a communications campaign 
— “eHs, it’s as easy as ABC”. The aim of 
the campaign is to provide employees 
with a clear reminder of the often 
complex manufacturing environments 
within which they work, focusing on:
•	 Awareness: identifying hazards, 
leading to elimination or setting 
controls and ongoing checking
•	 Behaviour: everyone taking personal 
responsibility for their own behaviour 
and
•	 Commitment: becoming committed 
and passionate about doing eHs well
like Bespak, Aesica has significantly 
increased the focus on near miss 
reporting across all sites with improved 
visibility of issues which could cause 
an injury or incident, with appropriate 
actions being taken to prevent or 
control the hazardous situations 
identified.
Aesica activities planned for FY2017 
include further improvement to the near 
miss reporting rates. employees will be 
encouraged to participate through 
initiatives such as “that’s not right!” 
a near miss recording booklet and a 
“Take five” on the job risk assessment 
booklet.
environment
Activity to reduce our environmental 
impact across the Group is focused on 
environmental management, energy 
reduction, minimisation of waste, 
diversion of waste from landfill and 
water conservation. The environmental 
Management system isO14001 
enables effective management of 
these impacts with all Bespak sites 
and Aesica’s two UK manufacturing 
sites and Pianezza, italy certified to this 
standard. 
For the first year we have set combined 
Group targets for energy and waste 
reduction, whilst also resetting the 
baseline year to FY2016. This creates the 
necessary accountability at Group level 
and benchmarks performance against 
more recent baseline data.

energy
Both Bespak and Aesica met the 
requirements of the energy saving 
Opportunity scheme (esOs) by 
submitting energy data and completing 
site based audits to identify potential 
energy saving opportunities before the 
Government’s deadline of 5 december 
2015. This helped to reconfirm 
opportunities to reduce energy 
consumption and support the range of 
activities highlighted below.
Bespak
Bespak’s energy consumption as 
measured in KWh/£000 sales has 
decreased from 403 reported in FY2015 
to 383 in FY2016. This represents a 
decrease of 13.0% against the FY2011 
baseline falling below the previous 
year’s target of 14.5% owing to phasing 
of start-up and new expansion projects.
specific energy reduction activities 
have continued through FY16 as follows: 
•	 improvements to existing Building 
Management systems including 
advanced control strategies and 
retrofit to inverters
•	 Replacement of inefficient 
transformers
•	 improved compressed air 
management
•	 Replacement and optimisation of 
steam generation and distribution at 
the nelson facility and
•	 improved factory heating at the 
nelson facility
These activities will be completed and 
monitored over the course of FY2017 in 
order to identify future opportunities.
The following chart illustrates Bespak’s 
performance in reducing energy 
consumption from the FY2011 baseline:

Aesica has collected more robust 
performance data across the year 
and therefore has now been able to 
contribute towards a Group target 
of 4% reduction for FY2017 against a 
FY2016 baseline. This target will help 
to focus efforts on energy reduction 
projects and provide a reporting 
mechanism for review throughout the 
period. Current activity around energy 
reduction includes:
•	 Changes to the Queenborough site’s 
High Capacity Manufacturing Facility 
steam generation process, leading to 
a 20% reduction in gas consumption 
and
•	 Commencement of work on the

waste
The Group has set a combined target 
of increasing the quantity of waste 
diverted from landfill/ incineration to 
97.5% against a FY2016 baseline.
Bespak
Bespak continues to increase the 
quantity of waste diverted from landfill/
incineration, and from the FY2011 
baseline has increased the diverted 
amount to more than 97% of total waste 
generated, which meets the previous 
year’s target and shows ongoing 
progress from the prior year (where 
the diverted amount was 95.7%). The 
business continues to focus efforts on 
waste segregation at source and waste 
minimisation activities delivered through 
a number of quality management 
initiatives. initiatives at the King’s lynn 
site, in conjunction with the business’s 
waste management company Veolia, 
have resulted in achieving almost zero

Opportunities are being explored to 
divert hazardous waste to energy 
reclaiming incineration. it should, 
however, be acknowledged that the 
potential to improve this measure 
significantly in future is limited which is 
reflected in the target for FY2017.
The chart above right illustrates Bespak’s 
waste management performance. The 
bar chart illustrates the increase in the 
reuse/recycling of the waste generated 
at Bespak since FY2011.
Aesica 
Aesica has made significant progress 
during the year in diverting waste 
from landfill. This has in large been 
achieved across the plant, processes 
and cleaning activities. Focus will 
remain strong on avoidance of waste, 
recycling, segregation and optimising 
the disposal routes for the complex 
waste streams that arise across the 
business. 
water
Bespak 
Bespak’s water reduction opportunities 
are most significant at the nelson site, 
which accounts for more than 90% 
of all water consumed. improved 
performance at the nelson site has been 
achieved through process improvements 
in anodisation.
in addition, significant savings have been 
achieved at the King’s lynn site through 
the course of the year from upgrades 
and optimisation of plant associated 
with the ethanol extraction process used 
in the manufacture of Mdi valves.
since initiating a programme of water 
reduction in FY2012, Bespak has 
exceeded the 37% reduction target set 
for FY2016 in terms of cubic metres per 
£’000 sales vs. the FY2011 baseline. The 
chart above left illustrates performance 
in water consumption reduction from the 
FY2011 baseline.
Aesica 
Aesica continues to explore opportunities 
to reduce water consumption. during 
FY2016, there has been a focus on daily 
use checks to identify consumption 
issues and on repairs to services where 
these have been identified. Aesica has 
adopted a stand-alone target of 5% 
reduction against a FY2016 baseline. This 
will be achieved by more detailed water 
use mapping, identifying and delivering 
a range of improvement opportunities.
employees
The Group remains focused on 
supporting and developing people 
through training and development, 
communications and two-way 
engagement channels.
Training and Development 
Bespak has delivered a total of 4,458 
training days during the year, equating 
to seven days per employee and 
exceeding the target of 3,000 days. This 
training includes: project management; 
forklift training; pharmaceutical 
legislation update; root cause analysis; 
introduction to our values; personal 
resilience; absence management; 
equality, diversity and inclusion; how to 
audit data integrity; pharmaceutical 
auditing; fundamentals of injection 
moulding.
Aesica currently captures “external” 
training days, and for the year this 
equated to 821 days which is equivalent 
to 1.3 days per employee. The aim for 
FY2017 is to increase the number of 
external training days per site by 10%.
Bespak Management  
Development Programme 
This programme provides line managers 
with the skills, knowledge and behaviours 
required to deliver the business strategy, 
goals and objectives and manage 
their teams. seventy-one line managers 
have commenced the programme 
since september 2014, with the first 
group of 24 completing the programme 
in december 2015. The qualification 
ilM level 3 Award in leadership and 
Management has been offered to all 
employees completing the Management 
development Programme. Twenty-two 
of the overall participants decided to 
complete the qualification, with the 
first seven achieving the qualification in 
January 2016. Bespak will continue to 
deliver the programme to new starters 
with direct reports.
The Aesica Academy 
The Aesica Academy is an internal 
employee development programme 
that teaches individuals about each 
of the functional areas of the business 
and how they interlink. every year 
employees can apply to participate 
in the nine-month programme and 
this is open to all disciplines and levels. 
There are 28 employees undertaking 
the 2015 programme which is due to 
be completed in July 2016. The content 
of the programme is reviewed and 
refreshed on an annual basis and the 
2016 scheme will be launched in the 
autumn.
Behavioural Skills Matrix 
Bespak’s Human Resources team 
have been working across the 
business to define the behavioural 
and management skills required by 
managers to successfully deliver 
the business strategy and ensure 
the business becomes a Values led 
organisation. This has resulted in the 
completion of a Bespak Behavioural 
skills Matrix which will now be used 
to define Bespak’s learning and 
development strategy and contents for 
programmes and workshops.
Mentoring
in september 2015, Bespak launched 
a mentoring programme to share 
knowledge and experiences to support 
the growth of individuals across the 
business. nine mentoring relationships 
have been supported for a period of six 
months, with eight mentees working at 
various levels of seniority across Bespak; 
and one further mentee working in 
Aesica.
An Aesica mentoring programme was 
subsequently launched in March 2016 
and will be piloted by 11 mentors and 
mentees. The scheme will run for a 
period of 6 to 12 months and Aesica is 
dedicated to continuously supporting 
this scheme moving forward.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Apprenticeship Scheme 
Currently Bespak has 18 apprentices on 
the Apprenticeship Training Programme, 
which exceeds the target of 16 which 
was set at the beginning of the financial 
year. Three new apprentices have 
joined the programme since August 
2015, in the areas of engineering 
technical support, quality control 
and business administration. The 
Apprenticeship Qualification is also 
offered as an internal development 
programme, with nine individuals 
provided with the opportunity to grow 
their skills and knowledge further. This 
has effectively increased the overall 
number of apprentices at Bespak to 27.
during the year, Bespak has received 
recognition from Cambridge Regional 
College for its outstanding commitment 
to Apprentices, including the standard 
of apprentices and the mentoring 
support given throughout the training 
programme.
Aesica currently has 11 apprentices on 
an Apprenticeship Training Programme, 
representing an increase of two from 
the previous year and predominantly 
within the areas of engineering and 
the laboratory. We did not meet the 
target of 16 but we are pleased with the 
progress made. We are continuing to 
review and improve our apprenticeship 
programme within the UK, the aim of 
which is to provide a scheme which is 
best in class. 
Staff Engagement
All Consort Medical Group staff 
participate in a regular employee 
survey undertaken every three years. 
This took place in May 2016. The results 
are being compiled and collated 
and the intent is to share the results 
and then host focus groups across 
departments locally to follow up on the 
key themes of feedback. The aim is to 
continuously improve in every aspect of 
our operations, not least in terms of the 
way we engage with our staff, so this is 
a particularly important project across 
the Group as a whole. 
Bespak Staff Celebration 
in July 2015, Bespak hosted a staff 
celebration event at north Wootton 
Rugby Club in King’s lynn.  This was 
an opportunity to say thank you to 
everyone for their hard work and 
commitment to the business and it was 
also a chance for staff to celebrate 
recent successes, alongside their 
families. Approximately 200 colleagues 
attended along with their partners 
and children (nearly 450 in total on the 
day) with everyone enjoying the day’s 
entertainment.
A raffle was held at the event, which 
raised £1,000 for Bespak’s FY2016 charity 
of the year, nelson’s Journey. 
Bespak plans to follow up on its 2015 
staff Celebration event with a further 
staff event in 2016. 
human r ights
We are committed to supporting human 
rights through our compliance with the 
laws and regulations of the countries 
that we operate in and through our 
internal policies. Our Code of Business 
ethics and associated policies require 
respect and equal and fair treatment of 
all persons we come into contact with.
i started my apprenticeship in August 2012 with 
Bespak after completing a year of sixth form 
and gaining my As levels. i decided to leave 
sixth form after realising that completing an 
apprenticeship had many more advantages. 
in year one i was given the opportunity to 
develop my skills at a specialist engineering 
training provider called eAGiT. 
during my time at eAGiT i developed practical 
skills in a number of engineering disciplines. i 
also attended norwich City College one day a 
week to learn the theory side of engineering. 
Upon returning to Bespak in my second 
year i was given the opportunity to 
broaden my understanding of Bespak 
and its manufacturing methods through 
short allocations in each manufacturing 
area. Once a basic understanding of 
Bespak was achieved i was then placed in 
longer allocations more specific to my end 
role, this included time in Manufacturing 
systems, Market Product support, Product 
development and Moulding & Metrology. 
during my time in these allocations i was 
placed with a mentor who i would work 
alongside to gain an understanding of the 
work they complete.
Once i had completed the rounds of all the 
engineering based allocations i was then 
asked to advise on which areas i enjoyed 
the most and where i would most like to work 
should a full time role became available. 
The outcome of this discussion was for me to 
specialise in the Moulding department which 
is where i currently reside. As a part of the 
moulding team i am currently working on the 
Prometheus project where i am working on the 
installations and validations of the moulding 
machines and the associated ancillary 
equipment.
i am coming to the end of my apprenticeship 
where i am hoping to be offered a permanent 
role within the Moulding team. Although i had 
doubts during my time at Bespak whether this 
was the right route for me to take, i am now 
completely happy with the route i took and 
would highly recommend an apprenticeship 
to anyone.

employee diversity
We are committed to actively 
encouraging a more inclusive and 
diverse workforce and look for 
opportunities to embed this where 
appropriate. We hire on merit but when 
recruiting externally we aim to include 
a female candidate on shortlists. The 
female representation on the Board and 
across the Group as at the year end is 
shown here: 
o ur g roup values are:
Customer Focus:  
strive to exceed the expectations of your internal and  
external customers
results driven:  
Maximise your performance through drive and determination
teamwork:  
Work together to achieve a shared objective
respect:  
Treat people as you expect to be treated
integrity:  
Be clear and consistent in your actions
FY2016 has seen real progress with 
embedding the values Group-wide. 
Workshops have been refreshed 
and run across the business and the 
executive Committee held a session 
on their importance to the culture 
of the business with progress now 
being reported bi-annually to senior 
management. employees are 
measured on how they live the values 
through their performance reviews and 
360 feedback is being introduced at a 
leadership level to provide objective 
feedback on employees behaviour 
relating to our core values. Aesica is 
appointing Values champions to make 
them meaningful for their departments 
and Bespak has Values Boards across 
its sites, highlighting employees who 
have excelled on one or more of the 
values. At a recent Bespak staff event, 
a guest speaker was invited to talk to 
the importance of values at the highest 
level of sport and Aesica based the 
theme for its recent leadership event 
on these core values.   
The intent is to build a culture 
underpinned by these values where 
employees know what behaviour is 
expected of them and their leaders 
and this becomes the norm. The 
employee survey will give us feedback 
as to how we are performing in 
this area and the Company has 
committed to respond accordingly.

helps to attract top talent and raise 
the profile of our business within the

Bespak continues to offer work 
experience placements for schools, 
colleges and university students, offering 
two placements in FY2016. We plan to 
increase this offering for FY2017.

Charitable Support
Consort Medical’s charities policy aims 
to promote education and opportunity 
and encourage the involvement 
of employees in community and 
charitable activities and organisations. 
Consort Medical has supported the 
national Autistic society (Hertfordshire 
branch) which supports people 
with autism throughout their lives, 
during the year with a donation of 
£30,000. Gaddesden Place Riding 
for the disabled, a charity based in 
Hertfordshire has been selected as the 
corporate charity for the forthcoming 
year with a donation of £30,000.
Bespak’s Charity steering Group 
continues to raise the profile of 
fundraising events within the business, 
supporting numerous charities and 
employee sponsorship activities 
including: Macmillan, West norfolk 
Carers and Wear it Pink for Breast 
Cancer.
Bespak’s chosen charity, nelson’s 
Journey, has benefited from funding 
and employee involvement during the 
year. The total amount raised for this 
charity through donation and internal 
fundraising for FY2016 is £11,465. 
A total of £29,541 has been given to a 
number of charities over the course of 
this year through either direct donations 
or internal fundraising. Aside from 
nelson’s Journey, eACH, West norfolk 
Carers, local scout/guide, schools and 
national charities such as Macmillan 
have also benefited. 
Bespak’s Charity of the Year for FY2017 
is Friends of the stroke Unit, founded 
in 2005 by Mr Paul Brandon, with the 
aim of improving facilities on the West 
Raynham Ward, Queen elizabeth 
Hospital King’s lynn for the benefit of 
patients, their families and staff.  
Over the years, the charity has made 
many resources available to the ward 
and ongoing fundraising provides a 
continuing improvement to the ward’s 
facilities for patients and staff. 
stroke is often a devastating event 
and has no consideration for age, 
gender or ethnic origin. With this in 
mind the committee are dedicated to 
establishing a transient ischemic attack 
(TiA) Clinic on West Raynham Ward 
aimed at helping patients to act and 
prevent a major stroke from occurring.
each Aesica site has established or is 
in the process of establishing a charity 
committee to select a site based charity 
for FY2017. As part of this process, 
each site will have a dedicated charity 
budget and a number of employee “off 
site” days have been agreed to allow 
employees to be involved in supporting 
the chosen site charity during working 
hours.
ethical standards
We emphasise the importance 
of operating a business in both a 
responsible and ethical manner. Bespak 
and Aesica have set appropriate 
standards and policies to uphold all 
laws relevant to prevention of bribery 
and corruption in all jurisdictions in 
which we operate. The Group has 
in place policies and procedures 
covering Anti-Corruption and Bribery; 
Gifts and Hospitality; Business ethics and

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Chairman’s introduction
The Board acknowledges its key role in establishing the 
culture, values and ethics of the Company. We believe that 
it is important that the Board sets the correct “tone from 
the top” and that directors should lead by example and 
ensure that good standards of behaviour are embedded 
throughout all levels of the organisation. during the year we 
have made progress with embedding our values Group-wide, 
further details of which can be found within the Corporate 
Responsibility Report.
As a Board, we are responsible for determining the strategy 
of the Group and for ensuring we have the best team in 
place to achieve this. Following the appointment of a 
new non-executive director last year, Charlotta Ginman, 
we have further strengthened our Board and ensured we 
have significant experience in finance, manufacturing, 
pharmaceuticals, business development and mergers and 
acquisitions, all of which are key areas within our business. 
Our team has been further enhanced with the appointment 
of John ilett as Group General Counsel and Company 
secretary. 
As mentioned in last year’s report and following the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’s recommendation to put the 
external audit contract out to tender at least every ten years, 
the Audit Committee conducted a tender process and in 
november 2015 we announced the appointment of KPMG 
llP as the Group’s auditors for the financial year commencing 
on 1 May 2015. A resolution to confirm this appointment will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
The changes in the Financial Reporting Council’s updated UK 
Corporate Governance Code are effective for 2015/16. We 
report against these new requirements in the following pages.
Our AGM will be held on 7 september 2016, and as always we 
are pleased to receive feedback from our shareholders and  
i encourage you to attend our AGM.
Finally, as we move into the coming financial year i believe 
that the Board has the right range and mix of skills and 
experience to fully discharge its duties and responsibilities and 
to keep delivering and developing our strategy.

a tailored induction comprising site visits, background 
information on the operation and activities of the Group, 
the role of the Board and its committees and those matters 
reserved for the Board’s decision, and the latest financial 
information on the Group. Training and development needs 
of directors are reviewed regularly. The directors are kept 
apprised of developments in legal, regulatory and financial 
matters affecting the Group from the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Company secretary, and the Group’s external auditors 
and advisors. 
information and support
Board members are provided with all relevant documentation 
in advance of each Board and committee meeting. senior 
executives are invited to attend Board meetings periodically 
for the purpose of making presentations on their areas of 
responsibility. in addition to formal Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Chief executive meet frequently and make 
regular contact with other Board members. The Board and 
the senior executives meet formally once during each 
financial year to discuss corporate strategy.
independent professional advice
The Board has approved a procedure whereby directors 
may consult the Company’s advisers and, if necessary, take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
although not in respect of a director’s personal interests. 
Before seeking advice, the director concerned must notify the 
Chairman, or in his absence, the senior independent director. 
no such advice was sought by any director during the year.
Company secretary
Board members have access to the Company secretary, who 
attends all Board meetings. The appointment and removal 
of the Company secretary is subject to the approval of the 
Board.
The Group General Counsel and Company secretary, John 
ilett, joined the Company on 2 november 2015.
Board evaluation
A Board evaluation was carried out during the year ended 30 
April 2016. A rigorous and formal review required completion 
of a questionnaire relating to the performance of the Board 
and its committees and with regard to compliance with the 
Code. The evaluation was wide ranging and focused on the 
various aspects of the Code. The results of the questionnaire 
were reported to the Board in a manner that did not identify 
any individual responses. The evaluation concluded that 
there were no areas of significant weakness and that overall 
the Board and its Committees were operating effectively.

retire and submit themselves for re-election at the first AGM 
after appointment and thereafter at least every three years.

re-election.
Meetings of non-executive directors
led by the senior independent director, the non-executive 
directors meet informally, without the Chairman being 
present, principally to appraise the Chairman’s performance 
and to review his remuneration. The Chairman holds meetings

accountability
Internal Controls Review
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Board has received regular 
reports on areas of any significant risk and on the related 
internal controls. The Board reviews the framework of internal 
controls annually and has reviewed the effectiveness of its 
internal systems of control as they have been operated within 
the year in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance, updated 
by the FRC in 2005. This system has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The review covers all material controls including financial and 
financial reporting processes, operational, compliance and 
risk management systems.
Controls over the financial reporting process and preparation 
of the consolidated accounts consist of extensive reviews 
by qualified and experienced individuals that ensure that 
all elements of the financial statements and appropriate 
disclosure are considered and accurately stated.
Risk Management
The Board accepts responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives.
There is an ongoing internal process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing significant risks faced by the Company that 
is regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee, the executive 
Committee and then by the Board. This process has been in 
place throughout the year and up to the date of this report.
The Risk Committee is responsible for advising the executive 
Committee on the co-ordination and prioritisation of risk 
management issues throughout the Group and developing a 
risk management strategy; ensuring that the Board’s risk policy 
is implemented throughout the Group through effective 
development and review of risk registers, mitigation plans and 
insurance policies; and promoting risk awareness at all levels.
A risk management strategy encompassing risk assessment 
and risk treatment has been adopted with the key objective 
to ensure that risk management is an integral part of the 
strategic and operational management decision-making, 
planning and implementation process. Risk appetite and 
tolerance has been reviewed and agreed by the Board and 
will be considered annually and monitored as appropriate.
The Company’s strategic plan is reviewed annually at an 
off-site meeting involving the Board and the executive 
Committee. An annual budget is prepared by each of the 
operating divisions of the Company and this is consolidated 
into a Group Plan, which is reviewed and approved by  
the Board.
Further information on how we manage our business risks is set 
out in the Risk section on pages 26 to 28, which contains a list 
of the principal risks and uncertainties.
Control Procedures
Progress against budget is monitored at operating business 
and Group levels throughout the Company via monthly 
reporting of actual financial performance against budget 
and prior period actual results. The executive Committee also 
reviews the key measures of operating performance.
The Group has clear authority limits deriving from the list of 
matters reserved for decision by the Board, including capital 
expenditure approval procedures.
v iability statement
in accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the directors have assessed the viability 
of the Company over the three year period to 30 April 2019. 
The directors have determined that a three year period to  
30 April 2019 constitutes an appropriate period over which to 
provide its viability statement as this is the period focused on 
during the strategic planning process (see Risk Management 
section above for further details). The Group’s strategic plan 
considers the Group’s profit and loss, cash flows, debt and 
other key financial ratios over the period. 
A robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company 
as well as the controls and mitigating actions to address 
these are set out in the Risk section on pages 26 to 28. 
The viability assessment takes into account the potential 
impact of each of these principal risks arising over the 
assessment period. Furthermore, it’s considered severe but 
plausible scenarios which illustrate the potential impact of a 
combination of these risks crystallising during the period. A 
number of reasonable assumptions are included within these 
assessments including:
•	 the assumption that funding facilities will continue to be 
available and that the facility which expires in september 
2019 will be renewed on the same or a similar basis 
•	 the assumption that in the event of several risks occurring 
simultaneously and having a severe impact on the Group, 
all potential mitigating actions including adjusting capital 
management to preserve cash would be taken on a timely 
basis and
•	 the assumption that implausible scenarios where multiple 
risks occur all at the same time or are unable to be 
appropriately mitigated do not occur

Corporate g overnan Ce
COn TinUed
The result of this analysis has allowed the directors to 
reasonably conclude that the risk to the Group’s viability  
is low. 
Therefore, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due in the three-year period of 
assessment to 30 April 2019.
Financial r eporting
The directors’ responsibility for preparing the accounts is set 
out in the directors’ Report on page 74.
g oing Concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future as the Group 
has net debt of £97.0m at 30 April 2016 (2015 £99.2m) and 
total banking facilities (including available overdrafts and 
using year end exchange rates) of £161.2m of which £46.7m 
is undrawn as at 30 April 2016 and available up to september 
2019. The Company has therefore adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
r emuneration
Our Remuneration Report, which describes the level and 
components of the remuneration of the directors, is set out on 
pages 52 to 59.
r elations with shareholders
The Board regards relationships with shareholders as very 
important and it aims to encourage open dialogue with 
them through regular meetings with the Group’s institutional 
shareholders, including regular meetings following the 
announcement of the Company’s interim and annual 
results. Meetings are also held at other times with institutional 
investors and other shareholders at their request. shareholders 
may meet with any new non-executive director if they wish. 
The Chairman ensures that views expressed at these meetings 
are reported to the Board as a whole. The Company’s brokers 
also attend Board meetings at the request of the Chairman to 
provide feedback on shareholder opinion.
Presentations given to analysts are available on the 
Company’s website.
The senior independent director is available to meet with 
shareholders as required.
the annual g eneral Meeting
All shareholders have the opportunity of discussing the 
Group’s performance and development at its AGM, which 
provides a forum for shareholders to raise issues with the 
Board. Members of the Remuneration, nomination, Audit and 
Corporate Responsibility Committees will also be available at 
the AGM so that shareholders may discuss any queries they 
may have.
Our previous AGM was held at the offices of FTi Consulting 
in london on 3 september 2015 and the full voting results on 
each of the resolutions are published on our website. Our 2016

key developments in accounting, Corporate 
reporting and t axation
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing, on behalf of 
the Board, the Group’s financial and reporting practices and 
disclosures, reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, 
the Group’s system of internal controls, the work of the 
external auditors and the Group’s compliance with financial 
policies, laws and regulations. The Audit Committee's terms of 
reference may be obtained from the Company’s website.
The annual and half-yearly financial reports are reviewed by 
the Committee through a process which includes discussion 
with the Chief Financial Officer and the external auditors. 
The external auditors prepare reports to the Committee on 
significant accounting policies and issues and judgements 
applied in the preparation of the financial reports. The 
Audit Committee gives its recommendation to the Board 
concerning the adoption and publication of all financial 
reports to shareholders.
in addition to the Board, the Audit Committee has conducted 
its annual review of the system of internal controls based on a 
review of significant risks identified, internal reviews, external 
audits and reports from management.
Financial r eporting and  
significant Financial Matters
in carrying out its duties, the Committee is required to assess 
whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted 
and to challenge the robustness of significant management 
judgements reflected in the financial results. This process 
involves reviewing relevant papers prepared by management 
in support of the policies adopted and judgements made. 
These papers are discussed with management and the 
external auditors. in addition, the Committee reviews the year 
end report to the Audit Committee from the external auditors 
based upon its work performed and findings from the annual 
audit.
The significant accounting issues considered by the 
Committee during the year were areas where management  
is required to use significant judgement. These issues are  
listed below:
Goodwill Impairment
The value of goodwill is supported by a value in use model 
prepared by management. This is based on cash flows 
extracted from the Group’s budget and strategic plan, which 
have both been approved by the Board. The Committee 
debated the performance of the operating segments, 
considered the cash flow models in the Group’s strategic 
plan, and evaluated sensitivities in relation to that plan.
Contingent Consideration on the Disposal of King 
Systems
The contingent consideration due on the disposal of King 
systems is recorded at fair value, a calculation which 
previously required judgements around the level of expected 
sales of the King Vision product for three years post disposal. 
since the current year marks the end of this three year 
period, there is little judgement in calculating the fair value 
calculation as at 30 April 2016. 
The Treatment of Special Items and their Presentation 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements
special items have been separately disclosed within the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. The Committee 
has reviewed papers prepared by management showing 
how these costs have been identified and calculated. it 
has challenged both the quantum of the charge and its 
presentation in the consolidated income statement and is 
satisfied that these costs have been treated appropriately. 
The Committee specifically evaluated the appropriateness of 
the treatment of those items relating to the Aesica acquisition 
and considered the adequacy of the related disclosures.

Revenue Recognition
The Group’s policy for revenue recognition is set out in note 1 
to the financial statements. Management prepares a paper 
for the Committee setting out any key judgements applied 
in respect of revenue recognition and in the accounting for 
major manufacturing contracts. The Committee has reviewed 
the papers presented and challenged management on the 
judgements applied ensuring they are in line with the Group's 
policy.
Acquisition Accounting
Accounting standards require that all assets and liabilities 
acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair 
values on acquisition. during the financial year, the Group 
completed the initial accounting for the Aesica acquisition 
which was included in the annual report and accounts to  
30 April 2015. The key judgements in completing the 
accounting for the Aesica acquisition were:
•	 determination of the fair value of acquired assets and 
liabilities including the recognition of any provisions to fulfil 
customer obligations and other costs and 
•	 finalisation of the goodwill associated with the transaction 
as result of the above
Management prepared a paper for the Committee setting 
out the key judgements applied in respect of the completion 
of the accounting for the Aesica acquisition during the 
lookback period. The Committee reviewed these papers and 
the papers prepared by the external auditors, understood the 
basis for the valuation and discussed the key judgements with 
management and the external auditors. 
Based upon its review and discussions with both management 
and the Group’s external and internal auditors, the 
Committee is satisfied that, after raising appropriate 
challenge, the judgements outlined above are reasonable 
and that the appropriate disclosures have been included in 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Taxation
during the course of the year, the Committee received 
updates from management on tax matters affecting the 
Group. 
The Committee also reviewed the corporate tax rate for 
the financial year of 13.0%, discussed the key risks in respect 
of corporate tax and considered KPMG’s audit work and 
conclusions in this respect.
n on-audit services
in accordance with its policy on non-audit services provided 
by the Company’s auditors, the Committee reviews and 
approves the award of any such work. The Audit Committee 
refers to the Board for approval of any non-audit services 
where the fees for such work may represent a significant 
proportion of the annual audit fee.
PricewaterhouseCoopers llP, during their remaining tenure 
as auditors of the Aesica subsidiaries in the year, completed 
an agreed upon procedures engagement related to the 
completion of the acquisition accounting noted above.  
There were no non-audit services provided by KPMG llP 
during the year. 
details of non-audit services provided to the Company by 
the external auditors are shown in note 3 to the financial 
statements.
auditor independence
during the year, the Audit Committee conducted a 
tender process and in november 2015 we announced the 
appointment of KPMG llP as the Group’s auditors for the 
financial year which commenced on 1 May 2015.
internal audit
The Audit Committee has from time to time considered the 
need for a separate dedicated internal audit activity. Having 
previously determined that this was not required, the Group 
has now determined that the scale and nature of the Group’s 
operations are now sufficiently large and complex that such 
a dedicated resource would be required. Additional Group 
resource has been appointed and this is being supplemented 
as and where appropriate through the engagement of 
internal audit services from suitable qualified external 
providers. The Audit Committee keeps this under review.
whistleblowing
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the 
internal procedures whereby employees can raise concerns 
about possible financial or other irregularities. The policy 
gives guidance on the type of matters that staff may wish 
to disclose, and a means of doing so via an independent 
organisation in the event that any staff member feels that he 
or she cannot make a disclosure via the usual management 
channels.
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness, 
integrity and accountability and the prevention of bribery 
and corruption. As noted above, the Group operates 
a whistleblowing policy so that employees can report 
confidentially any matter giving rise to concerns about the 
operation of the Group’s business.

Consort MediCal plC 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, i am pleased to present Consort 
Medical’s FY2016 directors’ Remuneration Report. 
This report details the remuneration outcomes in respect of 
FY2016 and outlines how we intend to apply the remuneration 
policy in FY2017.
shareholder consultation on remuneration 
during Fy2016
The Remuneration Committee values shareholder 
engagement and is mindful of investors’ views when 
designing and implementing the Company’s remuneration 
policy. 
The voting outcome at the 2015 AGM indicated that, overall, 
shareholders remained supportive of our remuneration 
structure – this was demonstrated by the voting in respect 
of our future Remuneration Policy and new Performance 
share Plan which received 94% and 98% support respectively. 
Although the majority of our shareholders also voted in favour 
of our Annual Remuneration Report, selected shareholders 
voiced unease regarding certain elements of the package. 
during the year, the Remuneration Committee undertook 
an engagement exercise to fully understand shareholders’ 
concerns. The Committee has sought to actively respond to 
shareholder feedback and subsequently two key changes 
have been approved by the Committee. 
Firstly, this year’s report sets out enhanced disclosure in 
respect of the annual bonus outcome for FY2016, providing 
full retrospective disclosure regarding the financial targets set 
at the start of the year. This disclosure is intended to provide 
greater transparency regarding the basis of awards. 
secondly, selected shareholders raised concerns in relation 
to the methodology used to assess TsR performance for the 
Company’s long-term incentives. Previously, full vesting for the 
TsR element required the Company to outperform the lower 
of: (i) the mean annualised comparator TsR +7%; and (ii) 
upper-quartile annualised comparator TsR. 
in response to shareholder feedback, the Committee has 
determined that for future awards TsR will be assessed 
on a simpler and more conventional basis. For the 2016 
award, threshold vesting (25% of the element) will occur 
for performance in line with the median of the comparator 
group, with full vesting requiring upper-quartile performance.
i hope that the changes set out above clearly demonstrate 
how the Committee has taken on board feedback from 
investors and how we continue to value the support of our 
major shareholders.
Fy2016 incentive payouts
The business has once again performed very well during the 
year, and has made good progress against a number of key 
strategic priorities. Further details are set out in the strategic 
Report. Profit performance was strong and the Company 
delivered profit before tax and special items of £32.3m. Taking 
into account performance against the targets set at the start 
of the year, the Committee determined that outcomes under 
the annual incentive scheme for the executive directors 
would be between target and maximum.
Over the past three years, the Company’s TsR performance 
has been very strong, with significant outperformance of 
the market. For the 2013 award, the current expectation 
is that Consort Medical’s TsR performance is likely to 
significantly outperform the comparator group. in addition, 
strong financial performance over the period has resulted in 
outperformance of the ePs targets. subsequently, this award  
is expected to vest in full. Further details are provided on 
page 53.
in the context of sustained strong company and share price 
performance, the Committee is satisfied that the outcomes 
are fully deserved.
approach for the coming year
The overall remuneration structure continues to provide an 
effective link between pay, performance and the experience 
of shareholders. The changes made this year have provided 
additional simplicity and transparency to our approach. 
subsequently, no major changes to the package have been 
proposed for the coming year:
•	 salaries for executive directors will be increased by 2.5% in 
line with employees in the wider organisation 
•	 in response to changes in the taxation of pensions in the 
United Kingdom, pension allowances in future years may  
be paid in the form of a cash allowance. The maximum 
value of the pension allowance will remain unchanged 
from prior years
•	 Maximum incentive opportunities for the annual and long-
term incentives will remain unchanged
•	 The 2016 awards under the Performance share Plan will 
continue to be based on relative TsR and ePs performance
i trust you will find this report informative, and i look forward to 
receiving your support.

n otes to the table
The following paragraphs set out details of how the numbers included in the single figure table above have been prepared.
Base Salary 
The CeO and CFO’s salaries (with effect from 1 August 2015) were £472,450 and £307,000 respectively. 
Benefits
Benefits include a car allowance, life assurance, private medical insurance and personal health insurance. The CeO also 
received a fuel card. 
Annual Bonus 
The following section summarises the annual bonuses paid to the CeO and CFO based on performance delivered in FY2016.  
in response to shareholder feedback, this year the Committee has sought to provide expanded retrospective disclosure of 
bonus targets.
The annual bonus opportunity for the CeO and CFO is split between cash and deferred shares, as set out in the table below.
Cash element — 
maximum opportunity (% of salary)
deferred share element —  
maximum opportunity (% of salary)
CeO 100% 50%
CFO 75% 35%
For 80% of the cash element of the annual bonus, the payout is based on the Company’s Profit before Tax (“PBT”) performance 
during the financial year. The remaining 20% of the cash element and 100% of the deferred share element depend on the 
Committee’s assessment of individual performance against strategically important goals at a corporate and personal level.
in addition, for the deferred share element, the following PBT hurdles must be achieved before shares are awarded.

As the PBT outcome exceeded the target level, a maximum 
up to 50% of salary for the CeO and 35% for the CFO could be 
awarded for the deferred share element.
For FY2016, the CeO’s objectives were to continue the 
development of the innovation pipeline, ensure production 
facilities were ready for key product launches in both 
Bespak and Aesica and ensure the integration of the Aesica 
acquisition was completed with particular focus on the 
business development pipeline of both stand alone and joint 
opportunities. The CFO’s objectives were focused on financial 
management including treasury, cash and working capital. 
Assessing and ensuring adequate financial controls in Aesica 
and management of the closure of the defined benefit 
pension scheme. during the year, the Group achieved the 
following strategic goals: award of two new development 
contracts, one being a combined Bespak/Aesica contract; 
progress in delivery of development and innovation pipelines; 
operational delivery around key product launches and 
products; and completion of the integration of Aesica. The 
Committee assessed performance against these metrics and 
determined the following outcomes: personal portion of the 
cash element — 100% of element (CeO) and 75% of element 
(CFO); and deferred share element — 76% of maximum (CeO) 
and 75% of maximum (CFO).
The total bonuses awarded to executive directors were

long Term incentive Plan (“lTiP”) awards granted in 2013 
were subject to earnings Per share (“ePs”) performance (50%

Adjusted to reflect the acquisition of Aesica. For full details see the 
FY2015 Annual Remuneration Report.
Cumulative ePs performance delivered over the period was 
147.7p, which exceeds the stretch hurdle required for full 
vesting. As the performance period for the TsR element runs 
until 18 June 2016, the final level of vesting has not yet been 
determined. However, based on annualised TsR performance 
to date of c.19% p.a., the TsR element is also expected to 
vest in full. Although this award is currently expected to vest 
at 100% of maximum, this may vary based on actual TsR 
performance at the end of the performance period.
For the purpose of the single figure table, the value of the 
awards have been estimated based on the three month 
average share price during the final quarter of the financial 
year (£10.16).

The face value of lTiP awards and deferred shares is calculated using the average price of the three days prior to the date of grant of £9.257 
(16 June (£9.47), 17 June (£9.17) and 18 June (£9.13)).

On 10 september 2015, under the terms of the relevant plan rules, the lTiP awards granted on 19 June 2015 rolled over into an award of shares 
under the new PsP so that they became subject to the terms approved by shareholders at the AGM on 10 september 2015. The PsP awards 
are over the same number of shares and subject to the same performance conditions as the original lTiP awards. subject to performance, 
these awards will vest in June 2018. Awards continue to be 50% subject to TsR performance compared to the FTse smallCap, excluding 
investment trusts, finance, property and insurance companies; and 50% subject to ePs performance. For threshold performance, 25% of the 
award may vest. 
5 
deferred share awards are not subject to any further performance conditions and vest in June 2018. 
6 
This award, granted to Jonathan Glenn on 10 september 2015, relates to adjustments to the 2011 lTiP and 2011 dBP awards vesting in respect 
of 2015 as disclosed in the FY2015 Annual Remuneration Report.
how the remuneration p olicy will be applied to 
executive directors in Fy2017 (unaudited)
Salary and Benefits 
it is expected that with effect from 1 August 2016, salaries 
will be increased by 2.5%, which is in line with the increases 
awarded to other employees within the Group. salaries will 
therefore be as follows: CeO (Jonathan Glenn) — £484,260 
and CFO (Richard Cotton) — £314,675.
Benefits for FY2017 will remain unchanged. Following changes 
to the taxation of pensions in the UK, the retirement benefit 
for both executive directors can be delivered as a cash 
supplement.
Annual bonus 
The maximum opportunities (as a percentage of base salary) 
for the executive directors will be the same as the prior year:
•	 For the cash portion of the bonus, 80% will continue to be 
based on underlying PBT (before special items) and 20% 
will be based on the Committee’s assessment of success 
against personal strategic objectives. Awards under the 
deferred share element will continue to be subject to 
the Committee’s assessment of performance against the 
Group’s strategic goals, but subject to the achievement of 
underlying PBT (before special items) performance hurdles. 
•	 The strategic measures for the bonus have been selected 
on the basis that they represent areas that are important for 
the long-term success of the Group.
The Committee considers that this combination of measures 
provides an appropriate balance of focus on improving 
financial performance and wider business strategic goals. 
The Committee considers that when taken together, the 
cash and deferred elements strengthen the alignment 
between shareholders’ and executive directors’ interests, 
and encourage a longer-term focus on shareholder value, 
by requiring a three-year deferral of a portion of the annual 
bonus which is payable in shares.
note: The performance targets for the FY2017 annual bonus 
have not been disclosed on a prospective basis as they are 
considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they 
could reveal details of our budgeting and our strategic goals 
to competitors. The Committee will seek to provide expanded 
retrospective disclosure in due course.
Long-term Incentives — Performance Share Plan
Awards to executive directors will remain unchanged at 
100% of salary. The awards will continue to be subject to TsR 
performance (50%) and ePs performance (50%).
TsR will be measured against the TsR performance 
compared to the FTse smallCap, excluding investment trusts, 
finance, property and insurance companies. in response to 
shareholder feedback, for 2016 onwards, the Committee has 
simplified the TsR performance condition so that performance 
is assessed on a more conventional basis.

The Committee believes this combination of measures 
continues to provide an appropriate balance between 
measuring performance against the Company’s peers and 
incentivising management to grow earnings for shareholders 
over the long-term.
exceptionally, the Committee may make adjustments to 
the calculation of performance measures (e.g. following 
a transaction or for currency movements) to ensure 
performance is measured on a fair and consistent basis.
Clawback
in line with best practice, the Committee has determined that 
from FY2016, variable incentives will be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions, as described in the Policy Report.
external appointments 
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, 
executive directors may accept external appointments as 
non-executive directors of other companies. The directors are 
entitled to keep the fees from external appointments. 
during the year, Jonathan Glenn accepted the role of non-
executive director for Tissue Regenix Group PlC and his pro-
rated fees for the year to 30 April 2016 were £6,250.
statement of directors’ shareholding and share 
interests (audited section)
executive directors are expected to accumulate and 
maintain a significant shareholding. The vesting of awards 
from the Company’s various equity related incentive 
arrangements can provide a means to develop this 
shareholding. Only ordinary shares that are beneficially held 
by the executive director (or their spouses, civil partners, 
children and stepchildren) count towards the shareholding 
guideline.
Previously, the expected shareholding was equivalent to 
one times basic salary, to be built up over a five-year period. 
Following the 2015 AGM, the shareholding requirement for the 
CeO has been increased to two times base salary. The CeO 
and CFO have met their respective shareholding guidelines.

As set out on page 54, 2015 awards were originally granted in June 2015 under the terms of the 2005 lTiP. Following shareholder approval of the 
2015 PsP, they were replaced with equivalent awards under the new plan. The PsP awards are over the same number of shares and subject 
to the same performance conditions as the original lTiP awards. The share price is therefore the three day average prior to the original date of 
grant (19 June 2015).

Certain awards were adjusted following the rights issue to fund the acquisition of Aesica. Full disclosure is provided in the FY2015 Annual 
Remuneration Report.

The table below illustrates the percentage change in salary,

other Group employees (including other senior executives) 
between FY2015 and FY2016 on a consistent basis. To remove 
the impact of the acquisition of Aesica, only employees who 
were employed by the Group in FY2015 and FY2016 have 
been included in the calculation.

The majority of the increase granted to the CeO at the time of the 
Aesica acquisition in december 2014 falls into the FY2016 period, 
due to the timing of the award and the year end of the Company. 
The actual annual increase given in FY2016 was 3.5% (which moved 
the base salary from £456,450 to £472,450 as disclosed in the FY2015 
Annual Remuneration Report), which was in line with the average for 
the rest of the Group’s employees for FY2016.

dr Andrew Hosty Member (since 14 July 2014)
Advisers
The Chairman, the CeO, the director of Human Resources, 
and the Company secretary were invited to attend some 
or all of the meetings to provide advice to the Committee. 
They did not attend when any matter related to their own 
remuneration was discussed.
during the period, the Committee has received advice 
from its independent remuneration advisers, deloitte llP 
(“deloitte”). deloitte were appointed by the Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that the advice 
provided by deloitte is objective and independent. deloitte is 
a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and adheres to its Code in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK. The Committee is comfortable that the 
deloitte llP engagement partner and team that provide 
remuneration advice to the Committee do not have 
connections with Consort Medical that may impair their 
independence. 
separate teams within deloitte also provided the Company 
with advice on the valuation of share awards for iFRs2 
purposes and in connection with the Company’s risks and 
controls. Total fees for advice provided to the Committee 
during the year under review amounted to £36,600.
The Committee also received advice in relation to its share 
schemes from the Company’s lawyers, eversheds llP.

The voting at the AGM indicated that, overall, shareholders 
remained supportive of our overall remuneration structure —
this was demonstrated by the voting in respect of our future 
Remuneration Policy and new Performance share Plan which 
received 94% and 98% support respectively. Although the 
majority of our shareholders also voted in favour of our Annual 
Remuneration Report, selected shareholders voiced unease 
regarding certain elements, in particular annual bonus target 
disclosure and the operation of the TsR performance measure 
of the PsP. The Committee actively responded to both of 
these points and the actions taken are discussed in greater 
detail in the Chairman’s letter on page 51 of this report.
The Annual Remuneration Report was approved by the Board 
and signed on its behalf.

The following sets out a summary of our directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”). The Remuneration Policy 
was last approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. The full 
policy is available on the Company’s website  
(www.consortmedical.com). 
subsequent to obtaining shareholder approval and within 
the terms of the approved Policy, the Committee has made 
a minor amendment regarding the delivery of the pension 
benefit in response to recent changes to the taxation of 
pension in the United Kingdom. The maximum value of the 
pension benefit remains unchanged. Further details are 
provided in the policy table below.
Consort Medical’s executive remuneration 
principles 
Our key principle remains to provide remuneration packages 
for executive directors which:
•	 are sufficiently attractive to enable the Company to recruit 
and retain talented individuals with the necessary skills and 
expertise to support the development of Consort Medical 
and grow long-term value for our shareholders
•	 contain levels of performance-related variable pay such 
that they are aligned with the long-term interests of our 
shareholders and
•	 provide appropriate motivation for executives to execute 
the strategy agreed by the Board and to develop and 
grow the Company and shareholder value, whilst taking 
account of internal and external risks
The following outlines the Company’s remuneration policy, 
which the Committee believes achieves this objective. The 
key features are:
•	 providing a remuneration opportunity that is market 
competitive compared to relevant peers reflecting 
individuals’ experience, performance and responsibilities
•	 operating an annual bonus, with a long-term deferred 
share element to align interests with shareholders over 
the longer term, where annual performance targets are 
aligned with business strategy and financial performance
•	 offering participation in a long-term incentive plan which 
rewards executives for delivering shareholder value 
creation and achievement of long-term objectives and
•	 expecting executive directors to build up and maintain a 
holding of Company shares, thus promoting alignment of 
directors’ interests with those of shareholders

Base salary The core element 
of a competitive 
remuneration 
package.
The Committee sets base salary taking 
into account:
•	 the individual’s experience, 
responsibility and performance
•	 salary levels at relevant comparators 
and at companies of a similar size 
and complexity
•	 remuneration of different groups of 
employees within the Company
Where appropriate, it is the policy of 
the Committee to pay upper quartile 
base salaries where the incumbent 
is of a proven calibre, along with 
demonstrable and sustained success 
in the role.
Base salary is normally reviewed 
annually with changes effective 
from 1 August although salaries 
may be reviewed more frequently 
or at different times of the year if 
the Committee determines this is 
appropriate.
in determining salary 
increases the Committee 
considers the factors 
outlined in the “operation” 
column. While there 
is no maximum salary 
level, salary increases 
will normally be in-line 
with the typical level of 
increase awarded to other 
employees in the Group. 
However, the Committee 
retains the discretion to 
make increases above 
this level in certain 
circumstances, for 
example, but not limited 
to: an increase in the 
individual’s scope of 
responsibilities; in the case 
of new executive directors 
who are positioned on a 
lower initial salary whilst 
they gain experience 
in the role; where the 
Company has significantly 
increased in size; or 
where the Committee 
considers that the current 
salary does not reflect 
the Company’s policy 
of upper quartile salary 
positioning for experienced 
executives.

annual 
incentive 
scheme
To motivate and 
reward superior 
performance 
measured against 
annual financial, 
strategic and 
operational goals 
of the Company 
which reflect critical 
success factors.
The deferred share 
award element of 
the annual bonus 
ensures that part 
of the value of 
payments earned 
remains tied to the 
Company’s share 
price for a three 
year period, thus 
embedding long-
term alignment with 
the interests of our 
shareholders within 
the annual bonus 
plan.
The Committee 
considers that when 
taken together, the 
cash and deferred 
share elements 
strengthen the 
alignment between 
shareholders’ 
and executive 
directors’ interests 
and encourages a 
longer-term focus on 
shareholder value.
The Committee determines the 
maximum incentive opportunity 
taking into account the responsibilities 
of the role and market practice at 
comparable companies.
Performance is assessed over a 
financial year.
The Committee determines the level 
of bonus paid at its discretion taking 
into account performance against 
targets, the underlying performance of 
the business and executive directors’ 
management of, and performance 
in, all of the business issues that arose 
during the year.
The Annual incentive scheme 
incorporates malus and clawback 
provisions. Further details are set out 
below.
Deferred share element:
The deferred share element may be 
structured as a nil-cost option or a 
conditional award of shares. Awards 
structured as nil-cost options may 
normally be exercised within 40 days 
of vesting.
The deferred share awards will normally 
vest three years from award (unless the 
Committee determines an alternative 
vesting period is appropriate).
The vesting of deferred share awards 
will normally be subject to continued 
employment.
dividend equivalents may be awarded 
during the vesting period. dividend 
equivalents may be determined by the 
Committee on a cumulative basis and 
may assume reinvestment of dividends 
in the Company’s shares.
CeO — Maximum 
opportunity of up to 150% 
of base salary (100% cash, 
50% deferred into shares).
CFO — Maximum 
opportunity of up to 110% 
of base salary (75% cash, 
35% deferred into shares).
For the cash element 
of the bonus, payments 
start being earned for 
entry level performance 
from 25% of maximum 
if targeted levels of 
performance are 
delivered, with the full 
incentive being paid for 
delivering maximum levels 
of performance.
For the deferred share 
element, the Committee 
determines the level of 
pay taking into account 
performance in the round.
Cash element:
The cash element of the 
bonus is determined based 
on performance against 
financial performance 
metrics and personal 
objectives.
Currently 80% of the 
bonus is based on 
financial measures with 
20% based on individual 
personal objectives. The 
Committee may adjust this 
weighting in future years 
to ensure executives are 
appropriately incentivised 
to deliver key strategic 
goals. in any year financial 
performance metrics will 
always account for at least 
70% of the bonus.
The Committee sets targets 
each year to ensure that 
they are appropriately 
stretching in the context of 
the business plan.
Deferred share element:
The award of the deferred 
shares is subject to the 
Committee’s assessment 
of performance against 
the strategic goals of 
the Group. The deferred 
share element will not 
be awarded unless the 
Committee is satisfied 
that a minimum level of 
financial performance has 
been achieved. 
The strategic measures for 
the bonus are assessed 
each year and represent 
areas that are important 
for the long-term success 
of the Company, 
including but not limited 
to matters such as growth, 
new value creation, 
broadening the depth 
and range of products 
portfolios, innovation 
and diversification into 
adjacent markets while 
keeping a tight control on 
costs.

long-term share awards prior to the 
2015 AGM were granted under the 
2005 long-Term incentive Plan (lTiP). 
Awards after the 2015 AGM are made 
under the 2015 Performance share 
Plan.
Under the plan rules, 
awards can be made up 
to 150% of salary.
For 2016, awards for the 
CeO and CFO will continue 
to be up to 100% of salary.
in future years, where the 
Committee determines 
there are circumstances 
which merit varying 
current award levels, 
the Committee would 
appropriately consult with 
shareholders.
Any shares subject to an 
HMRC-approved option 
do not count towards 
these limits.
Awards currently vest 
based on relative total 
shareholder return and 
earnings performance 
measures. These measures 
will normally be equally 
weighted but the 
Committee may determine 
that an alternative 
weighting is appropriate. it 
is currently envisaged that 
either measure will have no 
less than a 25% weighting.
For threshold levels of 
performance up to 25% of 
the award vests, increasing 
to 100% of the award for 
maximum performance. 
There is straight-line vest 
of awards between these 
points.
The Committee determines 
targets each year to 
ensure that targets 
are stretching and 
represent value creation 
for shareholders while 
remaining motivational 
for management. Where 
appropriate, alternative 
metrics may be used for 
future awards to ensure 
they remain aligned with 
the corporate strategy.
if events happen which 
cause the Committee 
to consider that a 
performance condition 
has become unfair 
or impractical, it may 
amend that performance 
condition provided that the 
amended performance 
condition is not materially 
less difficult to satisfy.

The Company may provide executive 
directors with a pension benefit 
through participation in the Group 
Personal Pension Plan and/or a taxable 
cash payment. Within the remit of the 
policy approved by shareholders at 
the 2015 AGM, the Committee has 
made a minor amendment to extend 
the circumstances in which a cash 
payment may be made in lieu of an 
employer pension contribution. This 
change has been made in response 
to recent changes to the taxation 
of pensions in the United Kingdom. 
The maximum opportunity remains 
unchanged.
The Committee may determine that 
alternative pension provisions will

the Board will give regard to the cost 
of the arrangements, market practice 
and the pension arrangements

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Further detail
The Company also operates a shareholding guideline — 
details of this policy can be found on page 55 of the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy 
set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that 
amendment. Awards granted under the Company’s share 
plans will be operated in accordance with the relevant plan 
rules. The Committee may adjust awards only in accordance 
with the provisions of the relevant plan rules. This includes 
making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off corporate 
events, such as a change in the Group’s capital structure. 
Where possible under the plan rules, awards may be settled in 
cash rather than shares, where the Committee considers this 
appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make 
any remuneration payments and payments for loss of 
office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms 
of the payment were agreed: (i) before 4 september 2014 
(the date the Company’s first directors’ remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders came into effect); (ii) before the 
policy set out above came into effect, provided that the 
terms of the payment were consistent with the directors’ 
remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed; or 
(iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a director of the Company. For these 
purposes “payments” includes the Remuneration Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation 
to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 
“agreed” at the time the award is granted.
Malus and Clawback
The Annual incentive scheme and Performance share Plan 
incorporate malus and clawback provisions. 
For deferred share awards granted since 1 June 2013, in 
the event of a material misstatement in Consort Medical’s 
financial results the Committee may, at its discretion, apply 
malus to outstanding awards. The Committee may reduce 
the number of outstanding shares to reflect the number of 
shares that would have vested if the misstatement had not 
occurred. 
For Annual incentive scheme awards granted in respect 
of FY2016 and subsequent years, in the event of (i) a 
material misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial results; 
or (ii) serious reputational damage to the Company, the 
Committee may:
•	 apply malus to reduce an award before the award is paid 
to the participant; or
•	 clawback payments for up to two years following the end 
of the relevant performance period
For lTiP awards granted since 1 June 2013, in the event 
of a material misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial 
results, the Committee may, at its discretion, apply malus to 
outstanding share awards. The Committee may reduce the 
number of outstanding shares to reflect the number of shares 
that would have vested if the misstatement had not occurred. 
For long-term incentive awards granted from FY2016 onwards, 
in the event of (i) a material misstatement in Consort 
Medical’s financial results; or (ii) serious reputational damage 
to the Company, the Committee may:
•	 apply malus to an unvested award; or
•	 clawback a vested or exercised award or equivalent value 
at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of grant
selection of performance Measures
The annual bonus contains two elements — the cash element 
and the deferred share element. The cash portion is based 
on financial performance and personal objectives for the 
individual executive directors. The Committee selected these 
measures to ensure continued focus on delivery of financial 
performance compared to budget and the achievement of 
key personal goals which are considered important to drive 
the performance of the business in the long-term. The level of 
a deferred share award is based on the achievement of key 
strategic milestones. in a business such as ours it is important 
that there is a constant focus on innovation, development 
and meeting strategic objectives today which will deliver 
value for shareholders in the future. 
The Committee considers that the combination of measures 
used for the cash and deferred share element provides an 
appropriate balance of focus on financial and wider business 
and strategic goals.
since 2013, the long-term share awards have been based 
on total shareholder return and earnings performance. 
Total shareholder return measures share price improvement 
and dividend returns and therefore is a direct measure of 
the value we have returned to shareholders compared 
to the wider market. The earnings measures incentivise 
management to grow earnings for shareholders over the 
long-term.

remuneration a rrangements throughout  
the g roup
The Committee generally considers pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering pay 
for executive directors and senior management. When 
considering base salary increases, the Committee reviews 
overall levels of base pay increases offered to other 
employees in the Group.
When assessing remuneration, the Committee takes care 
to ensure that individuals are not overpaid in relation to 
their roles and responsibilities, and that packages for senior 
individuals are appropriate in comparison to the remuneration 
of other employees within the Company. Remuneration policy 
throughout the organisation is based on the same principles 
— that reward should be sufficient to retain and motivate 
individuals of a sufficient calibre without paying more than is 
necessary and should encourage individuals to deliver their 
own objectives and ultimately create value for shareholders. 
At Consort Medical our employees have a variety of different 
roles and responsibilities and therefore the reward opportunity 
and structure of reward necessarily is different to reflect this.
senior executives who are members of the Group executive 
Committee participate in the same reward structure as the 
executive directors. 
Managers across the Group participate in the bonus plan with 
the most senior and key employees participating in the same 
PsP as the executive directors. The majority of employees are 
eligible to earn a bonus each year based on their site specific 
performance. We also offer employees the opportunity to 
save and buy shares through the sharesave Plan, thus giving 
them the opportunity to be shareholders.

remuneration p olicy for non-executive directors
The Board is responsible for determining the policy on remuneration of non-executive directors. The Company aims to attract 
non-executive directors who, through their experience, can further the interests of the Company and make an effective 
contribution to its strategic development.
approach to setting fees Basis of fees other items
The fees of the non-executive directors 
are agreed by the Board. 
The fee for the Chairman is agreed by 
the Committee.
Fees are normally reviewed every 
two years but may be reviewed more 
or less frequently if it is considered 
appropriate.
Fees are set taking into account 
the level of responsibility, relevant 
experience and specialist knowledge 
of each non-executive director and 
fees at other companies of a similar 
size and complexity. 
non-executive directors are paid a 
basic fee for membership of the Board 
with additional fees being paid for 
being the senior independent director 
or Chairman of a Board committee 
to take into account the additional 
responsibilities and workload. 
Additional fees may also be paid for 
other Board responsibilities or roles if this 
is considered appropriate.
•	 The non-executive Chairman 
receives an all-inclusive fee for the 
role.
•	 Fees are paid in cash.
Annual bonuses or share-based 
incentives are not awarded to non-
executive directors, but they are 
encouraged to hold shares in the 
Company.
non-executive directors do not 
currently receive any benefits. 
However, benefits may be provided in 
the future if, in the view of the Board 
(for non-executive directors, or the 
Committee for the Chairman), this is 
considered appropriate.
Travel and other reasonable expenses 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties and any associated 
taxes) incurred in the course of 
performing their duties are reimbursed 
to non-executive directors.
non-executive directors are included 
on the directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity insurance.

The non-executive directors have appointment letters, the 
terms of which recognise that their appointments are subject 
to the Company’s Articles of Association and their services 
are at the direction of the shareholders.
All non-executive directors submit themselves for election 
at the AGM following their appointment and at subsequent 
intervals of no more than three years.
non-executive directors are not entitled to any payment in 
lieu of notice. The letters of appointment are available for 
shareholders to view from the Company secretary upon 
request. 
remuneration p olicy for n ew hires
When determining the remuneration package for a newly 
appointed executive director, the Committee would seek to 
apply the following principles: 
•	 The package should be market competitive to facilitate the 
recruitment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the 
business. At the same time, the Committee would intend 
to pay no more than it believes is necessary to secure the 
required talent
•	 The structure of the ongoing remuneration package would 
normally include the components set out in the policy table 
for executive directors
•	 in addition, the Committee has discretion to include any 
other remuneration component or award which it feels is 
appropriate taking into account the specific commercial 
circumstances, and subject to the limit on variable 
remuneration set out below. The key terms and rationale for 
any such component would be appropriately disclosed
•	 Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable pay 
opportunities or contractual rights at a previous employer 
as a result of appointment, the Committee may offer 
compensatory payments or awards, in such form as the 
Committee considers appropriate taking into account all 
relevant factors including the form of awards, expected 
value and vesting timeframe of forfeited opportunities. 
When determining such “buy-out” the guiding principle 
would be that awards would generally be on a “like for like” 
basis unless not appropriate
•	 Consistent with the policy table, the maximum level of 
variable remuneration which may be awarded (excluding 
any compensatory payments or awards referred to 
above) is 300% of salary (this reflects the current maximum 
opportunity for the CeO i.e. a bonus of 150% of base salary 
and a PsP award of 150% of base salary). This maximum 
level of variable remuneration includes awards made as 
part of the ongoing package. As noted in the policy table, 
the current intention is to grant PsP awards of 100% of salary
•	 Where an executive director is required to relocate from 
their home location to take up their role the Committee 
may provide reasonable assistance with relocation (either 
via one-off or ongoing payments or benefits)
•	 in the event that an internal candidate was promoted to 
the Board, legacy terms and conditions would normally 
be honoured, including pension entitlements and any 
outstanding incentive awards
To facilitate buy-out awards outlined above, in the event 
of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new 
executive director under listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the 
granting of awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, 
the recruitment of an executive director, without seeking 
prior shareholder approval or under any other appropriate 
Company incentive plan (including the 2015 Performance 
share Plan).
The remuneration package for a newly appointed non-
executive director would normally be in line with the structure 
set out in the policy table for non-executive directors. 
Remuneration for newly appointed non-executive directors 
may be paid in the form of cash or shares.

executive director service Contracts and policy on payment for l oss of o ffice
When determining leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee takes into account any contractual 
agreements including the provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and 
conduct of the individual.
The service agreements are available to shareholders to view on request from the Company secretary. 
notice 
period
executive directors have service contracts with the Company which can be terminated on 12 months’ notice by the 
Company and six months’ notice by the executive directors. 
Jonathan Glenn was appointed on 26 July 2006 and Richard Cotton was appointed on 25 June 2012.
Payment in 
lieu of notice
The Company may at its discretion terminate any executive director’s contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal 
to the base salary, and benefits which would have been received during the notice period. The current executive directors 
are also entitled to an amount in respect of bonus for their notice period (or remainder of the notice period). The Committee 
has the discretion to determine the level of such bonus. Previously, when directors have left the business the Committee 
determined that no bonus should be due for the notice period. The Committee’s policy going forward is that when new 
contracts are agreed with new executive directors that any entitlement to bonus as part of any payment in lieu of notice will 
be removed. executive directors are also entitled to a payment in respect of any accrued but untaken holiday at the time of 
termination of employment. if such a payment were to be made to Mr Cotton, it may be made in instalments over the notice 
period. 
Annual 
incentives
The executive director may, at the discretion of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an annual bonus for the financial 
year in which they ceased employment. such Annual incentive scheme awards will be determined by the Committee taking 
into account time in employment and performance.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with iFRss as adopted by 
the eU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. in 
preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently 
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent 
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with iFRss as adopted by the eU and 
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a strategic Report, directors’ Report, 
directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
responsibility statement of the directors in 
respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole and
•	 the strategic and directors’ reports include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face
We consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

Consort MediCal plC 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
g eneral information
Consort Medical plc is a public limited company listed on the 
london stock exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
under the laws of england and Wales, registered number 
406711. The address of the registered office is given on  
page 134. The nature of the Group’s operations and its 
principal activities are set out in the operating review on 
pages 14 to 19.
1. presentation of the financial statements and 
accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies 
reporting under iFRs, Article 4 of the iAs Regulation and 
international Accounting standards and international 
Financial Reporting standards (collectively referred to as 
“iFRs”) and related interpretations, as adopted for use in the 
european Union in all cases.
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared using the 
historical cost convention, as modified by certain financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value. The specific accounting policies adopted, which 
have been approved by the Board and which have been 
applied consistently in all years presented, are described 
within this note.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.
Consolidation
The financial statements include the financial statements 
of the Company and all the subsidiaries during the years 
reported for the periods during which they were members of 
the Consort Medical plc group (“the Group”).
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s 
business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations that has been disposed of 
or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with 
a view to resale. Classification of a discontinued operation 
occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation 
is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative 
income statement is presented as if the operation had 
discontinued from the start of the prior year. 
Segmental reporting
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to 
be the executive Committee. This committee is responsible 
for the executive management of the Group and comprises 
the Chief executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Company secretary/Group General Counsel, the General 
Managers of the Group’s Bespak and Aesica businesses and 
the director of Human Resources. The executive Committee 
meets regularly to make decisions on operational and 
strategic matters, other than those reserved for the Board, 
including allocation of resources and assessment of the 
performance of the Group. The Group’s operating segments 
are determined with reference to the information that is 
supplied to the executive Committee in order for it to allocate 
the Group’s resources and to monitor the performance of the 
Group. Following the acquisition of Aesica Holdco limited 
(“Aesica”) on 12 november 2014, the executive Committee 
focuses on the operations of the Group by the Bespak and 
Aesica divisions as individual operating segments and, as a 
result, the Group has two reportable segments at the end of 
the current financial year.
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial 
statements of the parent Company and all its subsidiaries 
made up to 30 April 2016. subsidiaries are entities which are 
directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
to direct the activities of the entity. subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used 
to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the 
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of completion. identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. if the cost of 
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly 
in the income statement. Costs of acquisition are charged 
to the income statement in the period in which they are 
incurred.

1. presentation of the financial statements and 
accounting policies continued
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group 
is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in 
accordance with iAs 39 either in profit or loss or as a change 
in other comprehensive income. inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions 
between Group undertakings are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment 
indicator of the asset transferred. Uniform accounting policies 
have been adopted across the Group.
in the parent Company financial statements, investments in 
subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any provision for 
impairment.
Investments
equity investments in entities that are neither associates nor 
subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Foreign currencies
items included in the financial statements of each of Consort 
Medical plc’s entities are measured using that entity’s 
functional currency, which is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates. The 
consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the parent Company’s functional and presentation 
currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation at period-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash 
flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of all Group undertakings 
that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency with (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance 
sheet; (ii) income and expenses for each income statement 
translated at average exchange rates for the period; and 
(iii) all resulting exchange differences recognised as a 
component of other comprehensive income. in the case 
of subsidiaries acquired during the prior year, the average 
exchange rate takes into account the period of ownership 
only.
exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such 
investments, are recognised in the translation reserve within 
other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The principal exchange rates applied in the preparation of 
the financial statements were as follows: 
 2016  2015
GBP : eUR at the end of year 1.28 1.39
GBP : Usd at the end of year 1.46 1.54
GBP : eUR average for the year 1.36  1.29 
GBP : Usd average for the year 1.50  1.60 
GBP : eUR average from 12 
november 2014 n/a 1.32
GBP : eUR at 12 november 2014 n/a 1.27
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for the sale of goods and services. 
Revenue from sales of products is recognised when the 
risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, and 
is stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes. 
The point at which risk and reward is transferred is usually 
determined from shipping terms, which vary from customer 
to customer. Revenue from sales of services is recognised in 
the period in which the related chargeable costs are incurred 
or when revenue is earned under contractual obligations. 
Revenue from sales of tooling is recognised on a net basis, 
having regard to the transfer of risks and rewards. Revenue 
is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Advance payments received from customers are credited to 
deferred income and the related revenue is released to the 
income statement in accordance with the recognition criteria 
described above.
Where a manufacturing contract includes variable 
consideration (such as a minimum order guarantee), the 
transaction price includes management’s best estimate of 
the variable consideration receivable at the balance sheet 
date.
On occasions, the Group receives cash in advance of 
delivering goods and services to customers to compensate for 
costs incurred in design and development activities including 
the acquisition of development assets. Where such amounts 
are received and the risk and rewards of ownership over the 
development assets remain with the customer, the amounts 
received are deferred on the balance sheet (in “customer 
advances and deferred income”) and taken to revenue as 
the Group delivers products or services to the customer in 
accordance with its contractual obligations.

1. presentation of the financial statements and 
accounting policies continued
Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. Grants received are revenue 
related and are credited to the income statement, within 
operating profit, so as to match them with the expenditure 
to which they relate to the extent that it is probable that all 
conditions have been complied with. 
Post-employment benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, 
including both defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension plans.
(a) Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay 
further contributions once the contributions have been 
paid. The Group pays contributions to publicly and privately 
administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense when they 
are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined 
contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an 
amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive 
on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors 
such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability 
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value 
of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be 
paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the 
terms of the related pension obligation. in countries where 
there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates 
on government bonds are used. Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-
service costs are recognised immediately in income.
(b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is 
terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, 
or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy 
in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises 
termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) 
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those 
benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of iAs 37 and involves the 
payment of termination benefits. in the case of an offer made 
to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits 
are measured based on the number of employees expected 
to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months 
after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their 
present value.
(c) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses 
and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into 
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s 
shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises 
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a 
past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for equity instruments 
(options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted:
•	 including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price)
•	 excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the 
entity over a specified time period) and
•	 including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for 
example, the requirement for employees to save)
non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, 
which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting 
period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. it recognises the impact of the revision 
to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.

1. presentation of the financial statements and 
accounting policies continued
The grant by the Company of options over its equity 
instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the 
Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of 
employee services received, measured by reference to the 
grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as 
an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost including any 
incidental costs of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Assets acquired through 
business combinations are initially recognised at their fair 
value. depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost 
of property, plant and equipment (less the current expected 
residual value) on a straight-line basis over their expected 
useful lives as follows:
•	 ·Freehold buildings and leasehold buildings with original 
lease terms over 50 years — 50 years
•	 leasehold buildings with original lease terms less than  
50 years — Remaining period of lease
•	 Cleanrooms — 20 years
•	 Building services — 10–20 years
•	 Mould and assembly machines — Utilisation basis
•	 Plant, equipment and vehicles — 3–10 years
Cleanrooms and building services are categorised within 
plant and equipment. land is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
in the income statement. From 1 november 2014, the method 
of depreciation for mould and assembly machines was 
changed from a time basis of 3 to 10 years to a utilisation 
basis reflecting the amount a machine is used during an 
accounting period. This method is considered to better reflect 
the economic consumption of the value attributable to these 
machines.
Assets which have been transferred from or funded by a 
customer are not capitalised if the Group does not obtain 
control of these assets. if the Group has obtained control of 
an asset that has been contributed or funded by a customer, 
then the asset is recognised and the contribution released 
to income over an appropriate term in accordance with the 
Group’s policy on revenue recognition.
Assets under construction
The costs of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as 
incurred and are not depreciated until such time as the assets 
are commissioned, when the total costs are transferred to the 
appropriate asset category.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as 
an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition 
date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of:
•	 the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of 
the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the 
entity over 
•	 the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances 
give indicators of an impairment. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. if the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent 
period.
Internally generated intangible assets — research 
and development expenditure
expenditure on research activities is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the 
Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the 
following conditions are met:
•	 An asset is created that can be identified
•	 it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits 
•	 it is technically feasible that the intangible asset can be 
completed so that it will be available for use or sale and 
there are sufficient available resources to complete it and
•	 The development cost of the asset can be  
measured reliably
Where a product requires regulatory approval prior to launch, 
it is presumed that there is insufficient certainty over the 
product’s technical feasibility to recognise an intangible asset 
prior to that approval being obtained.
internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful 
economic life of capitalised development costs is 5 to 10 
years. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be 
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred.

Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, including purchased patents, know-
how, trademarks, software licences, customer contracts and 
relationships and distribution rights are capitalised at cost 
and amortised on a straight-line basis or sum of digits basis 
over their estimated useful economic lives through operating 
expenses. The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets 
are as follows:
•	 Computer software: 4 years
•	 Patented and unpatented technology and know-how:  
10 years
•	 Trademarks and trade names: 10 years
•	 Customer contracts and relationships: 
 – 11 to 13 years on a sum of digits method (Aesica related)
 – 5 to 10 years on a straight line basis (other)
•	 licences and distribution agreements: 2 to 11 years
The amortisation method applied to the Aesica intangible 
assets on acquisition is deemed to better reflect the pattern 
in which the future economic benefits are expected to be 
consumed.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. if any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment 
loss. Where it is not possible to identify separate cash flows 
relating to individual assets, Consort Medical plc estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
it belongs. Where tangible and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill have suffered an impairment, they are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Leasing commitments
leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease.
leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially 
all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated 
as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are 
recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if 
lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance 
sheet as a finance lease obligation. lease payments are 
apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability.
Inventories
inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of 
standard cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises the 
direct cost of production and the attributable portion of 
overheads based on normal operating capacity appropriate 
to location and condition. Cost is determined on a first in, 
first out basis. net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs 
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is 
made if necessary for any slow-moving, obsolete or defective 
inventory. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
in the consolidated and Company statements of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, 
and bank overdrafts. in the consolidated and Company 
balance sheets, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings 
in current liabilities.
Finance income and costs
interest receivable and payable on bank deposits and 
borrowings is credited or charged to finance income and 
expenses as it falls due. 
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the income statement 
net of any reimbursement. if the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as other finance expenses.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an 
obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where 
the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with 
reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, 
but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is 
probable.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
and subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables.

Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
fair value, net of direct issue costs and subsequently stated 
at amortised cost. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income 
statement and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period 
in which they arise. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are 
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down. in this case, the fee is deferred until drawdown 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee 
is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Dividends
dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the 
period in which they are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. interim dividends are recorded in the period in 
which they are approved and paid.
Taxation
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for 
the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or 
disallowed. it is calculated using rates that have been 
enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet 
date. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
relevant taxation authorities.
Tax that relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income or in equity is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or equity respectively.
deferred taxation is accounted for in full using the balance 
sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences 
arising from differences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit.
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences except in respect of investments 
in subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised. Their carrying 
amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same 
basis.
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. 
it is recognised in the consolidated income statement except 
when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income 
taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis.
Research and development expenditure Credit (“RdeC”) 
has been available to UK companies on qualifying 
expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013 and is of the nature of 
a government grant. Where UK companies expect to elect 
for RdeC the amount receivable is recorded as income and 
is included in profit before tax, netted against research and 
development expenses.
Share capital, share premium and share issue costs
share issue costs are incremental costs directly attributable 
to the issue of new shares or options and are shown as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any excess of the 
net proceeds over the nominal value of any shares issued is 
credited to the share premium account.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital (“treasury shares”), the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled 
or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently 
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
activities
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at 
each reporting date. Any gain or loss on remeasurement is 
recognised in the income statement.

Net investment hedges
Where the Group has entered into borrowings which form 
part of a net investment in a foreign operation, including 
a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part 
of the net investment, these are accounted for in a way 
similar to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are 
recognised in OCi while any gains or losses relating to the 
ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement 
through profit or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, 
the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in 
equity is transferred to profit or loss.
The Group uses a loan as a hedge of its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Refer to 
note 26 for more details.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
in the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which 
are described in this note, the directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
Judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), 
that the directors have made in the process of applying 
the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements.
A. impairment of goodwill 
The Group tests, at least annually, whether goodwill has 
suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting 
policy above. Goodwill recognised as part of the Aesica  
and The Medical House acquisitions have been subject to an 
impairment test in the current year. The recoverable amounts 
are determined based on value in use calculations. The use of 
this method requires the estimation of future cash flows  
and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of these cash flows. Actual 
outcomes could vary.
B. income taxes
There are many transactions and calculations for which the 
ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for 
anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome 
of these matters is different from the amounts that were 
initially recorded, such differences will impact the income 
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such 
determination is made. in the current year this included an 
evaluation of the provisions of the UK Government’s Patent 
Box regime and its potential applicability to the Bespak 
business (see note 10).
C. equity investments
The Group makes investments in certain early stage, start-up 
entities and has taken an equity stake in those entities (see 
note 16). in assessing these investments, the directors are 
required to assess whether they are able to exert significant 
influence as well as the carrying value of these investments 
with reference to their stage of development and progress 
against key milestones.
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year are discussed below.
A. Post-employment benefits 
The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit 
obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes 
depends on the selection of certain assumptions which 
include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, 
mortality and expected return on scheme assets. differences 
arising from actual experiences or future changes in 
assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods 
(see note 21).
B. impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review 
for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is 
determined based on value in use calculations prepared on 
the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
C. Provisions and related assets
in determining the amount to recognise for any provision or 
related asset, management consults with suitably qualified 
and experienced Group personnel, considers the Group’s 
experience of similar matters and communications with 
potential counterparties and the Group’s legal advisers.

d Accounting for acquisition-related intangibles 
The accounting for the identification and valuation of 
intangibles acquired from Aesica in the prior year was 
undertaken by management based on expert advice 
received from corporate finance specialists. estimation was 
applied in identifying and valuing the £82.3m of acquired 
intangible assets, being the Aesica customer relationships 
in accordance with the principles of iFRs 3’Business 
Combinations’ and expectations of future economic benefits. 
There was also estimation applied in determining the most 
appropriate amortisation method for these intangible assets.
Special items and other non-GAAP performance 
measures
The directors believe that the ‘adjusted’ profit and earnings 
per share measures provide additional useful information for 
shareholders on the underlying performance of the business. 
These measures are consistent with how business performance 
is measured internally. The adjusted profit before tax measure 
is not a recognised profit measure under iFRs and may not be 
directly comparable with ‘adjusted’ profit measures used by 
other companies. 
Further detail on the special items in the year can be 
found in note 6. The directors also refer to eBiTdA (earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) as a 
performance indicator. eBiTdA also adds back any profit or 
loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new standards and amendments have been 
applied for the first time during the year commencing 1 May 
2015 but are not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group:
Amendments to iAs 19: employee Benefits
Annual improvements (2010-2012 cycle): Amendments to iFRs 
2, iFRs 3, iFRs 8, iAs 16, iAs 24, iAs 38 
Annual improvements (2011-2013 cycle): Amendments to iFRs 
3, iFRs 13, iAs 40 
Annual improvements (2012-2014 cycle): Amendments to iFRs 
5, iFRs 7, iAs 9, iAs 34
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases have not yet been adopted by 
the eU):
iFRs 9: Financial instruments (2014) 
iFRs 14: Regulatory deferral Accounts 
iFRs 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
iFRs 16: leases 
Amendment to iFRs 11: Joint Arrangements 
Amendments to iAs 12: income Taxes 
Amendments to iAs 7: statement of Cash Flows  
(disclosure initiative) 
Amendments to iAs 27: separate Financial statements 
Amendments to iFRs 7 and iAs 32: Financial instruments on 
Asset and liability Offsetting 
Amendments to iAs 16 and iAs 38:Property, Plant and 
equipment, and intangible Assets
The following accounting standards relevant to the Group 
have not been early adopted as the Group carries out an 
assessment of their potential impact:
•	 iFRs 9: Financial instruments (2014)
•	 iFRs 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Parent Company financial statements
The financial statements of the parent Company, Consort 
Medical plc, have been prepared in accordance with iFRs 
as adopted for use in the european Union in all cases. On 
publishing the parent Company financial statements together 
with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking 
advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement or 
statement of comprehensive income and related notes that 
form a part of these approved financial statements.

2. segmental information
The Group’s operating segments are determined with reference to the information which is supplied to the executive 
Committee in order for it to allocate the Group’s resources and to monitor the performance of the Group. Following the 
acquisition of Aesica on 12 november 2014, that information analyses the Group between two divisions, Bespak and Aesica. 
Prior to this acquisition, the Group only had one operating segment. The executive Committee assesses the performance of 
the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted operating profit which excludes the impact of special items from the 
operating segments. special items are analysed in note 6.
Consequently, the segment information provided to the executive Committee for both of these reportable segments for the 
year ended 30 April 2016 is as follows:

•	 integration costs are in relation to restructuring activity following the completion of the integration programme at Aesica; 
mainly employee and property or move related in nature.
•	 Advisory and acquisition costs include advisory costs in respect of the closure of the Bespak pension scheme and in 
evaluation of potential transactions. in the prior year to 30 April 2015, these are primarily the fees associated with the 
acquisition of Aesica other than those related to the equity raised and the new debt funding arrangement.
•	 Other acquisition-related items in the prior year include the unwinding of the uplift in the book value of inventory held by 
Aesica on acquisition, as required by accounting standards.
•	 Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets represents the charge for other intangible assets within Aesica (acquired 
in 2014) of £12.3m and £0.8m in relation to The Medical House acquired in 2009.
•	 A special tax item of £1.3m arose in the prior year in respect of the recognition of Patent Box benefits relating to the year, 
ended 30 April 2014.
•	 A special tax item of £1.1m has been recognised in the current period as a result of the recognition of deferred tax on capital 
losses which are available for offset against deferred tax liabilities arising from the upward revaluation of land.
•	 A special tax item of £1.0m was recognised in the year as a capital allowance review which was carried out in the year 
which resulted in assets being reclassified from non-qualifying to qualifying.
•	 A special tax item of £0.5m was recognised in the year as the impact of a number of prior year adjustments made.
•	 A special tax item of £1.1m also arises in the current period in respect of a significant tax credit as the Group’s deferred tax 
assets and liabilities were recalculated using the lower rate of UK Corporate Tax of 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 
2020 (reduced from 20%).
special items from discontinued operations are described in note 29.

Reconciliation between tax expense and the Group’s profit on ordinary activities before taxation
The reconciliation of the UK statutory tax charge to the Group’s profit on ordinary activities before taxation is as follows:
 2016 
£000 
 2015
£000 
Profit before tax from continuing operations 11,241  5,512 
Taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 20% (2015: 20.9%) 2,248  1,152 
Adjustments in respect of prior periods (3,099) (1,693)
Tax effect of non-deductible or non-taxable items (1,487) 131 
Adjustments in respect of foreign tax rates (502) (65)
deferred tax on share-based payments (157) (50)
Movement in unprovided deferred tax (593) (225)
special tax item — rate change adjustment (1,137) – 
(4,727) (750)
Factors affecting future tax charge
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the UK profits 
for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 20%. Further reductions in the standard rate to 19% with effect from 
1 April 2017 and 18% with effect from 1 April 2020 were enacted during the year and any deferred tax balances have been 
stated at the rate at which they are expected to reverse. The Budget in March 2016 announced that the standard rate will fall 
further to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. As this rate was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, it has not 
been reflected in these financial statements.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £21,921,000 (2015: £27,313,000) that are available for offset against 
future chargeable gains in the UK group. deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not 
reasonably foreseeable that these will be utilised.
deferred tax assets of £3,409,997(2015: £4,318,730) in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to 
insufficient certainty over their recoverability. deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal 
authority.

The amount of deferred tax liability likely to be settled within 12 months is £3.5m (2015: £3.5m).
deferred tax assets in the Company are recognised on the basis that their reversal in the future will generate current year losses 
which will be surrendered to subsidiary undertakings in exchange for payment at the prevailing tax rate.

11. earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust, which are 
treated as cancelled.
diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share 
options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares 
during the year and contingently issuable shares under the long-Term incentive Plan.

The carrying value of goodwill is made up of balances arising on acquisition of The Medical House and Aesica.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to The Medical House and Aesica CGUs (cash-generating units) 
for impairment testing. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are utilised to 
calculate the recoverable amounts. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected, risk-adjusted, pre-tax 
cash flows of the cash-generating unit in which the goodwill is contained.
The discount rate applied comprises the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted to reflect the 
impact of the time value of money, tax effects and risks associated with the CGUs. This was calculated at 7.5% (2015: 9.5%) 
in respect of The Medical House and 7.5% (2015: 7.5%) in respect of Aesica. This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount 
to pre-tax cash flows. The movement in the discount rate applied to The Medical House reflects the impact of changes in 
the year to the risks relevant to that CGU. The value in use calculations for each CGU were based on the Group’s strategic 
plan incorporating three years from FY2017 to FY2019, which was approved by the Board and takes into account both past 
performance and expectations for future market development. Cash flows beyond this period were extrapolated using an 
annual growth rate of approximately 2% (FY2015: 2%), which was selected as prudently below the Group’s estimate of the 
long-term average growth rate in the UK and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the sectors in which the 
CGUs operate. 
in respect of The Medical House, the key assumptions include product sales from existing customers in FY2017, product 
launches and revenues from as yet unidentified customers from 2018. in respect of Aesica, the key assumptions include product 
sales from existing customers and contingencies to reflect risks in the cash flows. 
The directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to other key assumptions would result in an impairment of 
goodwill and are confident that the amount of goodwill carried for The Medical House and Aesica as well as the assumptions 
used in estimating their fair values are appropriate. 
Critical judgements around goodwill impairment are disclosed in note 1.

during the year, the Group operated five pension schemes: one in the UK, one in italy and three in Germany. Pension benefits 
are provided by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration 
and length of service, and by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds 
arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme, the Bespak plc staff Retirement Benefits scheme (“Bespak”) was closed to 
new entrants with effect from 30 June 2002. As at 30 April 2016, the iAs 19 ‘employee Benefits’ deficit was £23.4m compared 
with £17.8m as at 30 April 2015. The movement was primarily due to lower return on plan assets and a review of other actuarial 
assumptions. The scheme was closed with effect from 31 March 2016 via a deed of amendment between the Group and 
the Trust. Following the scheme closure, all former active members became deferred members, and the provision of pension 
benefits was migrated to a defined contribution pension scheme which is also available to new employees. The accrued 
pension for active members will remain linked to their future salary, and so the closure did not have any impact on the accrued 
benefit obligation. The incremental costs of £0.3m in relation to the closure of the scheme have been classified as special items.
The Group also operated four additional defined benefit pension schemes during the year, three of which were operated 
by Aesica Pharmaceuticals GmbH in Germany and one which was operated by Aesica Pharmaceuticals srl in italy. The four 
schemes are the Retirement Benefit Obligations scheme (the “RBO”), the early Retirement scheme (the “ATZ”), the long Term 
service scheme (the “Jubilee”) and the Aesica italy scheme. The ATZ scheme is now closed as there are no further liabilities. 
The RBO scheme is closed to new members whereas the Jubilee scheme continues to be open to all employees of Aesica 
Pharmaceuticals GmbH. The Aesica italy scheme is open to all employees of Aesica Pharmaceuticals srl and Consort Medical 
srl. These schemes had a total net iAs 19 deficit of £3.8m at 30 April 2016.
in relation to Bespak, increases to pensions in payment and in deferment in respect of future service are capped at 2.5% p.a. 
The members’ share of the cost of the scheme is 8% of pensionable salaries, which is generally paid via a “salary sacrifice” 
arrangement. The Group meets the full cost of accrual, but members receive a reduction in their salary equal to their share of 
the cost of the scheme. Members have the right to opt out of this arrangement if they wish to receive their full salary and not 
contribute to the scheme, in which case the Group’s contributions to the scheme are reduced.

Contributions to each of the Group’s defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of an 
independent, professionally qualified actuary. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been 
assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected unit credit method. liabilities are assessed 
annually in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary. Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Group’s 
defined benefit scheme are undertaken, normally every three years.

Explanation of the relationship between Consort Medical plc and the trustees of the schemes
The assets of each scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and 
present employees. The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. The 
Bespak scheme has a policy that one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the scheme, whilst there is no 
such provision for the Aesica GmbH or italy schemes.

* Applies to the RBO scheme only.
The iAs 19 accounting standard ‘employee Benefits’ requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to 
market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality fixed income investments. The currency and term of these should be 
consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
Bespak
The discount rate has been developed from a spot yield curve based on UK Government bonds, adjusted to reflect the credit 
spread between AA-rated corporate bonds and Government bonds.
The expected rate of inflation is an important building block for the salary growth and pension increase assumption. A rate of 
inflation is “implied” by the difference between the yields on fixed-interest and index-linked Government bonds.
For the majority of members, pension accrued before 6 April 1997 does not receive any guaranteed increases and it is assumed 
that no discretionary increases will be awarded. Pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 receives increases in 
line with inflation subject to a maximum of 5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.1% 
per annum). some members receive fixed increases of 3% per annum on pension accrued before 6 April 1997 and increases 
in line with inflation subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum on pension accrued between 6 
April 1997 and 30 April 2009 (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.5% per annum). For all members, 
pension accrued after 1 May 2009 receives increases in line with inflation subject to a maximum of 2.5% per annum (for which 
the Company has assumed future increases will be 2.2% per annum).

One of the key assumptions made in valuing the pension scheme’s liabilities is the mortality rates used to assess how long 
pensions will be paid for. The mortality rates used to calculate the scheme’s liabilities were updated as part of the scheme’s 
actuarial valuation in 2014 to reflect the results of surveys. These mortality tables are referred to as 95% (males)/85% (females) 
of the s2PA tables with improvements assumed to be in line with the CMi_2013 model with a 1.25% p.a. long-term rate of 
improvement.
The current life expectancies (in years) underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the Bespak scheme are:

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Bespak and Aesica scheme liabilities
The sensitivity of each scheme’s liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated 
below. The illustrations consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. in practice, 
changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption (this is not always the case).
The Group liability is the difference between the schemes’ liabilities and the schemes’ assets. Certain changes in the 
assumptions will be as a result of changes in market yields. Where this is the case, the market value of schemes’ assets may 
change simultaneously, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions. For example, a fall in interest rates will 
increase each scheme’s liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of assets so that the net effect 
on the Group liability is reduced.

How the liabilities arising from the Bespak scheme are measured
The Group provides retirement benefits via the Bespak scheme to some of its former employees and approximately 30% 
of current UK employees. The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the final three years of 
employment and period of service as a scheme member.
The projected liabilities of the scheme are apportioned between members’ past and future service using the projected unit 
actuarial cost method. The deficit in the consolidated balance sheet is the difference between the projected liability allocated 
to past service (the defined benefit obligation) and the market value of the assets of the scheme. The defined benefit 
obligation makes allowance for future earnings growth. 
An alternative measure of liability is the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer. This 
amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than 
the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme. The latest estimate of the amount required to settle the 
scheme’s liabilities was calculated as part of the triennial valuation at 30 April 2014. This indicated that the amount required 
was £66.3m in excess of the assets held by the scheme.
Future funding obligations in relation to the Bespak scheme
The trustees have selected a funding target based on the scheme being closed to new members, with the link to final salaries 
being maintained. The agreed funding objective is to reach, and then maintain, assets equal to 100% of the value of the 
projected past service liabilities, assessed on an ongoing basis, allowing for future salary increases for active members.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by an independent actuary for the 
trustees of the scheme and was carried out as at 30 April 2014. in september 2015, the Company and the Trustees agreed the 
actuarial valuation deficit of £13.8m. As part of that agreement, the Company agreed to make deficit recovery contributions 
at the rate of £1.5m per annum until 2028.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 24 years (2015: 24 years). The next triennial valuation is 
expected to take place with an effective date no later than 30 April 2017.
Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the Bespak scheme
The expected return on the scheme’s assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial year for returns 
over the life of the related obligation. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly 
from their market value. some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government and the risk of default on these 
is very small. The trustees also hold bond investments issued by public companies. There is a more significant risk of default 
on these which is assessed by various rating agencies. The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity and hedge fund 
investments, with a target of 60% of the scheme’s assets being invested in these funds. The investment return related to these 
is variable, and they are generally considered much “riskier” investments. it is generally accepted that the yield on these 
investments will contain a premium (“the equity risk premium”) to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this 
type of investment. There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
The majority of the equities held by the scheme are in international blue-chip entities. The aim is to hold a globally diversified 
portfolio of equities, with a target of 22% of equities being held in the UK, 27% in the rest of europe, 20% in north American 
equities, 10% in each of Japanese and Pacific Basin equities and 11% in emerging markets.
As part of the investment strategy review, the trustees, in conjunction with the Group, have carried out an asset-liability 
review for the scheme. These studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group in determining the optimal long-term asset 
allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the scheme. The results of the study are used to assist the trustees in 
managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the scheme’s deficit 
by providing information used to determine the pension scheme’s investment strategy.

in the prior year, the Group cancelled its $56m multicurrency revolving facility and £40m multicurrency revolving facility and 
signed a new £160m multicurrency revolving facility. The Group now also has a £65m “accordion” facility by which further 
facilities may be made available by Barclays, lloyds, RBs and santander under the current terms to support significant 
investment or acquisition opportunities which may arise. The existing revolving credit facilities expire in september 2019. Whilst 
the multi-year revolving committed credit facility does not expire for more than three years, the debt within this is disclosed as 
less than one year on the balance sheet, as it is drawn for one-month periods, and then redrawn as appropriate to minimise 
the amount of debt drawn relative to the Group’s needs to minimise the interest payable, as assumed in its Viability statement 
considerations. The undrawn facilities are unsecured. The bank loans and overdrafts are subject to cross-guarantees between 
Group undertakings. interest on the multicurrency revolving credit facility is charged at liBOR plus a margin of between 1.65% 
and 1.90%, depending upon the ratio of net debt to eBiTdA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and 
on UK overdrafts at 1.75% above UK base rate.
in the prior year, it was necessary to make a short-term borrowing of £37.6m on the Group’s banking facilities, which was repaid 
on 5 May 2015. This borrowing had no impact on the Group’s net debt at 30 April 2015, as it was represented by cash within 
Group subsidiaries. This explains the inflated cash position at 30 April 2015.

26. Financial instruments and related disclosures
Financial risk management
Consort Medical plc reports in sterling and pays dividends out of sterling profits. The Group manages and monitors the Group’s 
external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of Group corporate objectives. Treasury activities are 
governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Group.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and liquidity

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to reduce the cost of capital.
in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
selling margins are sufficient to cover normal operating costs and the Group’s operating subsidiaries are cash-generative. 
none of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Operating cash flow is used to fund 
investment in new product development as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and 
repayment of maturing debt.
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. net 
debt is calculated as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as total equity as shown in the 
consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
As at 30 April 2016, the Group is in a net debt position of £97.0m (30 April 2015: £99.2m); see note 23.
The Group has historically monitored two widely used ratios to measure the ability to service debt, being net debt/eBiTdA and 
eBiTdA interest cover. These measures were ahead of target throughout FY2016.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The table entitled “Fair value of financial assets and liabilities” presents the carrying amount and the fair values of the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities under iFRs. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where 
market values are not available, fair values are determined using the prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
•	 Currency exchange contracts – based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date and
•	 Contingent consideration – the discounted value of anticipated future receipts
The fair value of other assets and liabilities approximates to the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet.
Fair value and cash flow hedging activities
All derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement unless they are designated as fair value hedging instruments and tested 
to be effective under iAs 39 ‘Financial instruments – Recognition and Measurement’, in which case the element of gains and 
losses that fulfil the hedge effectiveness criteria are taken directly to equity.
Consort Medical plc’s hedging strategy is unchanged in respect of covering the transactional risk of foreign currency sales and 
purchases. in respect of the translational risk on the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, the Group has utilised a hedge of net 
investments in foreign operations. The Group uses a euro loan, which had a carrying value of £32.1m at the year end (2015: 
£29.5m), as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus potentially exposing the Group to interest rate risk, against which, 
in the past, the Group has sought to protect itself through interest rate swaps. Although the Group/Company are currently in 
a net debt position, no interest rate swaps are held as the Group was not subject to any significant movements in these rates 
during the period. This will continue to be kept under review over time.
Foreign exchange risk management
The Group’s principal currency exposure is movement between sterling and the euro and the movement between sterling and 
the Us dollar.

26. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued
Transactional exposure
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge a proportion of forecast foreign currency transactional exposure generally 
extending up to 12 months. At 30 April 2016, the Group held forward contracts to hedge the equivalent of £12.5m of forecast 
foreign currency transaction exposures (2015: £3.6m). The fair value of the forward exchange contracts was a liability of 
£256,593 at 30 April 2016 (2015: liability £117,000). The Group currently does not designate these forward contracts as cash flow 
hedges and so gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
The primary transactional exposures in the UK and european business are transactions denominated in the Us dollar and the 
euro. A 10% decline in sterling against the Us dollar and the euro (which is considered reasonably possible) would increase 
operating profit and equity by £0.5m (2015: £0.5m). A 10% increase in the value of sterling (which is considered reasonably 
possible) would have a similar but opposite effect.
Translational exposure
Following the acquisition of Aesica in the prior year, the Group also now has exposure in the retranslation of the German and 
italian operations into sterling. The foreign currency translation sensitivity for the euro for the full year FY2016 was such that a 
change in the rate of €0.01: £1 would have impacted revenue by £0.6m and eBiT by £0.1m.
Committed facilities
As explained in note 23, the Group has committed facilities available at floating rates which expire in september 2019 and an 
overdraft facility that expires within one year.
Market risk of financial assets
The Group invests centrally managed liquid assets in short-term investments with banks at floating interest rates. These 
investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of its major customers such that, if one or more of them is 
affected by financial difficulty, it could materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial results. However, the Group 
generally does not expect its customers to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group does not believe that it is exposed to major concentrations of credit risk on other classes of financial instruments. The 
Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does 
not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group applies Board-approved limits to the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and employs strict 
minimum creditworthiness criteria as to the choice of counterparty. 
Liquidity risk
The Group operates internationally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group 
trades. selling margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and the Group’s main operating subsidiaries are cash-
generative.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the research and development of new products as well as routine outflows 
of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt. The Group may, from time to time, have additional 
demands for finance, such as acquisitions.

Hedge of net investments in foreign operations — included in loans at 30 April 2016 was a borrowing of £32.1m which has been 
designated as a hedge of the net investments in the two subsidiaries in italy and Germany, Aesica Pharmaceuticals GmbH and 
Aesica Pharmaceuticals sRl. This borrowing is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the euro foreign exchange risk on 
these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to OCi to offset any gains or losses on 
translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries. There is no ineffectiveness in the year ended 30 April 2016.
The equity investments in Atlas Genetics limited and Precision Ocular limited are unquoted investments and are therefore held 
at cost, less any provision for impairment as their fair values cannot be measured reliably in the absence of an active market.
The following tables categorise the Group’s and Company’s financial assets and liabilities held at fair value by the valuation 
methodology applied in determining fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (level 1). Where such 
prices are not available, the asset or liability is classified as level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model are 
based on observable market data. in other cases the instrument is classified as level 3. The Company has no financial assets 
held at fair value through profit or loss.

Under the terms of the disposal of King systems, completed on 15 February 2013, the purchaser, Ambu A/s, was due to pay 
amounts of consideration contingent upon the performance of King following disposal. This comprised:
•	 a milestone payment of Us$10m upon completion of the first commercial sale of a video laryngoscope currently under 
development by King with a reusable display and an adaptor containing reusable optics and a disposable blade and
•	 payments with a potential maximum value of Us$40m related to the sales of King Vision products for the three years ended 
30 April 2016
The fair value of contingent consideration at 30 April 2016 is £nil (30 April 2015: £2.5m), with the reduction primarily due to: 
•	 An amount of £1.5m (FY2015 : £2.8m) was received during the year, which related to contigent consideration based on sales 
of King Vision products.
•	 King Vision sales by Ambu in FY2016 were insufficient to trigger a further contingent consideration payment to Consort 
Medical; therefore the remaining contingent consideration has been reduced to £nil.
The contingent consideration of £1.6m recognised in the prior year was in relation to contingent consideration on acquisition of 
Aesica (see note 28).

27. employee share scheme
Share options
The Group operates share award schemes whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares in Consort Medical 
plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of certain specified performance targets. it also offers savings-related 
share option schemes. Following the formal approval of the Performance share Plan 2015 (“PsP”) at the Annual General 
Meeting in september 2015, no further awards will be made under the 2005 long Term incentive Plan (“lTiP”). in June, August 
and september 2015, awards were made under the PsP.
Grants of share options are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting/performance period. Grants under 
savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years’ saving. Grants under share option schemes 
are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. Options under the share option schemes are 
normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant. The majority of options under the savings-related share option 
schemes are now granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
share options awarded to the directors are subject to performance criteria as laid out in the Remuneration Report.

Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based compensation charge, the Black–scholes option pricing model 
has been used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
sAYe 
scheme 
2016
Risk-free interest rate 0.9%
dividend yield 2.1%
Volatility 26.0%
expected lives of options granted under:
savings-related share option schemes 3 years
Weighted average share price for grants in the year:
savings-related share option schemes — market and option price 908p 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected 
period to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the 
assumed option life.

in June 2013, share options were granted under the Company share Option Plan (“CsOP”) in tandem with grants under 
the lTiP. The cumulative economic effect of these awards for both participants and the Company is identical to that for 
performance shares, and as such the fair value of these awards has been calculated on the same basis. see below for further 
details on performance share plans.
Performance Share Plan (LTIP)
The Group operates Performance share Plans whereby awards are granted to directors and senior management at no cost. 
The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three-year measurement 
period.

Performance shares are issued at nil cost to the employee. There were no performance shares exercisable at the end of the 
year (2015: nil). The weighted average remaining contractual life of the performance shares in issue was 18 months  
(2015: 18 months).
The majority of the awards granted in the year were made in the form of an award of performance shares. 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
The Group operates a deferred Bonus Plan whereby awards are granted to directors and senior management at no cost. The 
percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three-year measurement period.

end of the year (2015: nil). The weighted average remaining contractual life of the performance shares in issue was 18 months 
(2015: 18 months).
during the year awards under the lTiP and dBP were granted to a number of employees. The fair value per share under award 
at grant has been calculated using a Monte Carlo share pricing model. The assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
number of shares issuable FY2016
share price at grant date 872.5p
shares under option 349,218 
Vesting period 3 years
Volatility 26.0%
Risk-free rate 0.90%

Fair value per performance share — ePs criteria 490.0p
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected 
period to exercise.

28. acquisition of subsidiary
On 12 november 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Aesica Holdco limited, obtaining control of 
Aesica Holdco limited (“Aesica”). The goodwill balance as at 30 April 2016 in relation to Aesica is £106.8m (FY2015 restated: 
£101.9m).
during the year ended 30 April 2016, the Group completed the initial accounting for the acquisition as disclosed in the 30 April 
2015 annual report and accounts. Therefore, as set out in the table below, the 30 April 2015 comparative information has been 
adjusted retrospectively to amend the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as at the 
date of acquisition.
The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as at the date of acquisition were as set out in the

total consideration 226,629 – 226,629
As disclosed in the prior year accounts, total consideration consists of cash, equity and contingent consideration.
The significant adjustments to fair values made in the year are as follows:
•	 Property, plant and equipment — decrease of £5.7m as a result of concluding a detailed review and valuation exercise
•	 Trade receivables — decrease of £1.3m to increase provisions against old debtor balances and credit notes
•	 Accruals, deferred income and provisions and other payables — decrease of £1.0m mainly as a result of new information 
obtained which reflects circumstances in existence at the acquisition date
•	 Current tax — decrease of £1.6m to record additional provisions
•	 deferred tax — increase of £2.1m on the non-tax related opening balance sheet adjustments above 
•	 deferred tax — since 31 October 2015, a deferred tax asset of £1.9m has been recognised as the amount of spend treated 
as qualifying for capital allowances has been reduced by customer contributions in Aesica which were received pre-
acquisition. The impact of this change has been to decrease goodwill by the same amount. The directors have not restated 
the income statement for the year ended 30 April 2015 for the effect of this restatement as it was not material.
in the prior year, Aesica entered into an option agreement with a third party to purchase a parcel of land which it then owned 
for consideration of £1.9m. during the current year, this option was exercised and the Group was required to pay the proceeds 
of £1.6m as consideration. This was recognised as contingent consideration on acquisition in the prior year.

Consort MediCal plC 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
o pinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is 
unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Consort Medical 
plc for the year ended 30 April 2016 set out on pages 75 to 130.
in our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 30 April 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year then 
ended
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with international Financial 
Reporting standards as adopted by the european Union 
(iFRss as adopted by the eU)
•	 the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with iFRss as adopted by 
the eU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 
4 of the iAs Regulation
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
in arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, were as follows:
Valuation of goodwill (£122.6m) and intangible assets 
(£67.3m)
Refer to page 49, page 86 and page 104.
•	 the risk — Goodwill and intangible assets are assessed 
for impairment using a discounted cash flow model to 
calculate a value in use. due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, 
this is one of the key judgemental areas on which our audit 
focused.
•	 our response — We challenged the forecasts contained 
within the discounted cash flow model by assessing the 
Group’s budgeting procedures upon which the forecasts 
are based and comparing the assumptions to externally 
derived data as well as our own assessments. We used 
our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the 
key assumptions, including the long-term growth rate and 
the discount rate as well as performing sensitivity analysis 
over these. We tested the principles and integrity of the 
Group’s discounted cash flow model. We also assessed 
the forecasting accuracy of the Group in previous periods. 
We assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
(see note 14) in respect of impairment testing and 
considered whether the disclosures about the sensitivity of 
the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in 
key assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Revenue recognition (£276.9m)
Refer to page 50, page 84 and pages 91 to 93.
•	 the risk — The Group’s revenue is mainly derived from 
long-term manufacturing contracts. The contracts vary 
from customer to customer in terms of minimum order 
quantities, performance obligations, payment mechanisms 
and contributions to capital expenditure for assets required 
in production. Given the variety of individual contract 
terms, and that revenue is a material figure in the financial 
statements, we consider a significant risk exists in relation to 
the timing and quantum of revenue to be recognised.
•	 our response — Our audit procedures included 
documenting and performing walk-through tests of the 
controls over the delivery of products to customers and 
the presentation of these deliveries and the revenue 
recognised in respect of them in the financial statements. 
We read a sample of revenue contracts to determine 
whether the policy for recognising and measuring revenue 
with respect to those contracts was in line with the 
contractual terms and relevant accounting literature. With 
respect to revenue recognised in the year, we inspected 
a sample of significant contracts and evaluated the 
revenue recognised against the terms of those contracts 
and products delivered in the year. We obtained a sample 
of invoices raised around the year end and traced them 
to appropriate delivery documentation to assess whether 
revenue had been recorded in an appropriate period with 
respect to those invoices. We examined credit notes raised 
after the period end to determine whether revenue had 
been recorded in an appropriate accounting period with 
respect to those items.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £1m, determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before tax, normalised for special items 
(excluding amortisation), as disclosed on the face of the 
income statement, of which it represents 5%. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £50k, in 
addition to other identified misstatements that we believe 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 27 components, we subjected 15 to audits 
for Group reporting purposes. These accounted for over 
94% of the Group’s revenues, 99% profit before taxation, 
and over 96% of the Group’s total assets. For the remaining 
components, we performed analysis at an aggregated 
Group level to reexamine our assessment that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement with these. 
The Group audit team instructed the component auditor as 
to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.

The component materialities ranged from £2k to £730k, 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the 
Group across the components. The work on one of the 15 
components was performed by component auditors and 
the rest by the Group team. The Group team performed 
procedures on the items excluded from normalised Group 
profit before tax. 
The Group team held telephone conference meetings with 
the overseas Group reporting component auditor, and also 
attended the audit clearance meeting. At these meetings, 
the audit approach, findings and observations reported to 
the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and 
any further work required by the Group audit team was then 
performed by the component auditor.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
in our opinion:
•	 the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and
•	 the information given in the strategic Report and the 
directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to:
•	 the directors’ statement of Viability on pages 47 and 48, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the directors’ assessment and expectations 
of the Group’s continuing in operation over the next three 
years to 2019 or
•	 the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statement 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under isAs (UK and ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the Annual Report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading.
in particular, we are required to report to you if:
•	 we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy or
•	 the section of the Annual Report on page 49 does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us or
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit
Under the listing Rules we are required to review:
•	 the directors’ statements, set out on pages 47 and 48, in 
relation to going concern and longer-term viability and
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance statement on page 
41 relating to the Company’s compliance with the eleven 
provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.
scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the directors’ Responsibilities 
statement set out on page 74, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for  
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A 
description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is

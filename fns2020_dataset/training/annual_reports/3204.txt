Chairman’s statement
During 2002, Centrica continued to
make progress towards our vision
of ‘taking care of the essentials’ for
customers in our chosen markets.
We have done this by concentrating
on what our customers want. This
has led to top-line growth across
our business units and helped drive
adjusted earnings per share up
26% (before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation).
We took significant steps to
ensure that British Gas remains
the market leader in residential
energy and continues to improve
its performance in other home
services. The AA had a year
of solid performance as we
repositioned the AA brand to
increase awareness of the wide
range of products and services
available to motorists. Our North
American business has made
progress despite a challenging
regulatory environment.
Centrica remains
well placed
to compete in
an increasingly
international energy
marketplace where
we expect further
consolidation.
In the UK, the measures to
underpin a competitive energy
market enable us to continue
to deliver benefits to customers.
In the wider European context,
good progress was made
towards agreeing a framework 
for introducing competition
to the entire energy market.
In addition a number of important
improvements were made to the
competitive conditions in the UK
telecoms market but there is still
further work to be done.
Dividend
The board of directors is proposing
a final dividend of 2.6 pence per
share to be paid in June 2003.
When combined with the interim
dividend of 1 .4 pence per share
paid in November 2002, the
total dividend for 2002 would
be 4.0 pence per share. This
represents an increase of 29%
on the previous year and reflects
our positive medium term outlook
for both earnings and cash flow.
The board of directors
We announced a number of
changes to the board during the
year. Sir Sydney Lipworth retired
at the annual general meeting
in May and we are most grateful
for the significant contribution
he made to the development
of Centrica. In September we
announced the appointment
of Helen Alexander and in
October the appointment of
Robert T obin as non-executive
directors with effect from 
1 January 2003. I am delighted 
that Helen and Robert have joined
us. Their considerable experience
will further strengthen the board. 
Corporate responsibility
We recognise that creating
sustainable shareholder value
depends on a full understanding
of our impact on society and
the responsible management
of our business in a manner
consistent with our values
and principles. T o this end,
we established a corporate
responsibility committee 
which sets the framework for
developing and reporting our 
efforts in this area. Our approach
was recognised by our inclusion 
in the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones
Sustainability indices. 
We recognise
that creating
sustainable
shareholder value
depends on a
full understanding
of our impact
on society.
The future
Centrica remains well placed 
to compete in an increasingly
international energy marketplace
where we expect further
consolidation. Our strong brands,
enhanced customer insight and
asset management expertise,
combined with our financial and
operational scale, will continue
to enable us to create value for
customers and shareholders alike.
The collective efforts of all Centrica
employees have ensured that
we have made further progress
towards our vision during 2002. 
I would like to thank them for their
commitment and I look forward 
to working with them to deliver the
business performance, which will
provide our customers with the
service that they want and reward
our shareholders appropriately.
Sir Michael Perry GBE
Chairman
Our strong brands, enhanced customer insight and
asset management expertise will continue to enable
us to create value for customers and shareholders. Chief executive’s review
We have a strong business with leading market positions
and I am confident that our strategy will continue
to deliver value for our shareholders.
Centrica plc report 2002 05
In 2002 the group continued
its strong overall financial
performance, in particular from 
our leading UK energy operations,
where improvement in margins 
and growth were accompanied 
by new momentum in our services
to business customers and
expansion of our upstream
energy asset portfolio.
Our AA roadside and personal
finance operations continue
to deliver solid underlying profit
growth. Despite slow regulatory
progress in our UK telecoms and
North American energy markets,
we are expanding in both
businesses. Goldfish brand
development continues with
a more focused product line.
Our reinvestment in growth
areas is proceeding selectively,
with a constant focus on
economic value creation.
Global energy markets were 
hit in 2002 by turbulence and 
the retrenchment or exit of 
certain market participants, 
and the UK was no exception.
Positive underlying progress 
in the transparency and
competitiveness of the UK
wholesale electricity market
resulted in financial pressure
on some asset owners, and
poor performance for those
market participants that had
not anticipated the fundamental 
impact on wholesale pricing.
However, the wholesale gas and
electricity markets are resilient,
with ample commodity supply
enabling British Gas to benefit
from both retail brand leadership
and the hedging effect of our
energy asset management.
The value strategies that we are
pursuing in both the upstream
and downstream markets within
the UK continue to afford the
group a competitive advantage.
Turnover and profitability
Group turnover (excluding Accord
trading revenue) was £10 billion
in 2002, up 11% from the prior-
year period. Higher sales to our
business customers – through
Centrica Business Services –
were complemented by an
increase in residential electricity
sales as well as growth in North
America, the AA’s roadside and
personal finance units, home
services and One. T el. UK gas sales
volumes were lower, largely due to
unusually warm weather in the first
and fourth quarters of the year.
Group operating profit (including
joint ventures and associates,
before exceptionals and goodwill
amortisation) of £932 million was
up 37% from £679 million in 2001,
with improved performance across
most brand units, particularly
British Gas. Aggregate group
gross and operating margins
(excluding Accord) were 30%
and 9%, up from 26% and 7%
respectively in 2001 .
Customer service
We maintained our focus on
improving customer service
levels across all of our brands.
We are now placing greater
importance on qualitative
and value-based measures
of customer service which are
built into a scorecard evaluation
and reflected in the remuneration
of staff at all levels.
As testament to our focus on
these areas, we continue to be
highly rated by external agencies. 
In particular, the AA won the 
JD Power & Associates 2002
UK Roadside Assistance Study
award for customer satisfaction
for the third time in five years.
Further accolades include Which?
magazine naming the AA as the
UK’s best motoring organisation,
and www.house.co.uk winning 
the 2002 Customer Management
National E-commerce Customer
Service Award.
Outlook
Whilst the economic outlook
remains uncertain, we are moving
from a period of considerable
investment in growth opportunities
and strategic market entries,
to a period of delivery from
these investments, underpinned
by new customer relationship
management (CRM) platforms 
and common competencies
in securing value from deeper
customer relationships.
For British Gas, we expect
continuing recovery in residential
gas gross margins and further
electricity growth to generate
further profit improvement,
partially offset by the higher
costs of the government’s Energy
Efficiency Commitment and peak
CRM system implementation
expenses through to 2004.
Annual CRM cost synergies will
drive further medium term growth
in British Gas operating margins.
In the UK retail energy sector
competition remains tough,
although we believe that the
transaction prices paid recently
by acquirers should result in
retail pricing consistent with
positive supply margins. In
addition, reduced doorstep
selling in the industry appears
to be leading to lower churn

Chief executive’s review continued
rates. While we expect the result
of this reduced industry churn to
be slower growth in our residential
electricity customer base than
we had previously anticipated,
reduced customer acquisition
expenses should contribute
to better electricity profits.
We expect to increase market
share and profitability in the
UK commercial energy sector.
The launch of Centrica Business
Services has resulted in increased
management focus and growing
product portfolios in this unit.
It is anticipated that output volumes
from our Morecambe Bay gas
production facilities will decrease
by around 10% per year, offset
over time by greater output from
other currently held gas assets and
future acquisitions. We expect our
cash petroleum revenue tax (PRT)
payments to decline significantly
over the next few years.
Profitability of the AA is expected
to continue to improve, and
expenditure in information
technology will peak in 2003.
For One. T el, we expect that
regulatory improvements will
warrant renewed organic
investment in brand and product
marketing at the same time as
developing our growing mobile and
internet businesses. For Goldfish,
significant improvement to credit
card and loans contributions are
expected in 2003 and with a more
focused rollout of new products,
breakeven will occur towards the
end of the year. 
North America continues to
offer a significant value creation
opportunity, given our focus on
the marketing and service elements
of deregulated energy supply.
We continue to lobby regulators 
to maintain legal frameworks and
incumbent pricing levels which
allow sufficient and stable gross
margin headroom to attract new
market entrants. Without this
regulatory commitment to proper
competitive markets, current
organic growth prospects and
customer renewals are being
negatively affected. In this
environment, we expect to focus
in 2003 primarily on the integration
of our existing customer bases and
on profitability. We will maintain
a flexible approach to customer
acquisition, seeking to acquire
incumbent supplier customer
bases and playing a key role
in markets at early stages of
deregulation. Our organic growth
will be focused in a few larger state
and provincial markets which offer
sufficient scale for successfully
marketing our energy and related
services. As a result of this industry
environment and our strategic
focus, the timing for achievement
of our broader ambition in North
America will depend upon the
availability and pace of key
acquisition opportunities.
Our strategy in continental Europe
is to build a significant customer
base in the medium term. Although
the pace of deregulation varies
across the individual markets
there are now clear timetables
for commercial and residential
market openings. The whole of the
European Union household energy
market is expected to be liberalised
by mid 2007 . We are focusing on
those countries where the speed
of market opening and legal and
political conditions, including
unbundling and independent
regulation, are more advanced.
Employees
Our employees are central to the
delivery of our strategy and we
need to continue to attract and
retain high quality, highly motivated
people. I am pleased that we have
recruited some excellent people
over the last year to complement
our existing team. We are also
developing programmes
to ensure that we have the
leadership capability to
drive our strategy forward.
I am committed to making
Centrica an employer of choice
and the recent accreditation of
our AA brand unit as ‘Investors
in People’ is one indication that
we are developing the highest
standards of employment policies
and practices. Increased scores
in our satisfaction survey in 2002
demonstrate that our employees
share our vision and are committed
to delivering our strategy. I would
like to join the chairman in thanking
them all for their ongoing and
valued commitment.
Conclusion
T o sum up, we have a strong
business with leading market
positions. Our core businesses
are growing and are strongly cash
generative and our investment
in new businesses is proceeding
as market opportunities emerge. 
I am therefore confident that our
strategy will continue to deliver
value for shareholders.

British Gas residential
Improved gas margins
and growth in electricity
and services
2002 has seen progression in
the performance of British Gas
residential, driven by improved
gas margins, continuing growth in
electricity and home services and
reduced losses in communications.
Aggregate turnover was up 2.3%
in 2002, at £6 billion with operating
profit at £244 million (2001: loss 
of £46 million), despite warmer
weather. Our energy and home
services operations have been
integrated to reflect our vision
of enhancing customer loyalty
through greater understanding
and to realise higher revenue
and cost synergies. Our
investment in the British Gas
brand continues to support our
leading position in the residential
energy and services sectors
and allows us to continue
to build further multi-product
customer relationships, with
the aim of becoming Britain’s
leading home services provider.
Our operations will be further
supported by our investment in
customer relationship management
(CRM) infrastructure, enabling
improved service levels, a lower
cost to serve and lower costs to
acquire new product relationships.
At British Gas we’re making
investments to enhance the
quality of service we provide
to millions of customers every
day. We are now significantly
increasing the number of
engineers and developing a
range of skills and expertise to
sustain our competitive edge in
the market. Continued investment
in development of our employees
so that they are able to provide
ever improving service standards
will lead to durable and profitable
customer relationships.
British Gas strongly believes
that selling practices across the
energy industry must continue
to be improved. It has taken a
leading position driving the new
code of sales practice, removing
commission-only sales agents
and implementing an independent
compliance regime.
At 40%, British Gas’s share of
the aggregate residential energy
customer base in Britain remained
steady against the same time last
year. Net losses in gas customers
were in line with 2001 but reflect
a longer term trend of stabilising
market share with losses occurring
primarily during the few months
following retail price increases.
Second half losses were 186,000
compared with 426,000 in the
first half. Electricity sales growth
was reduced by the withdrawal
of commission-only sales agents.
Churn rates declined in the second
half of the year, with the market
showing signs of lower switching
rates overall. We believe that
our premium British Gas brand,
improving customer service
and breadth of branded home
service offerings will continue
to afford us competitive
advantages in our sectors.
Increases in residential energy
gross profits were partially offset
by the £26 million expensed
investment in CRM infrastructure
(2001: £9 million). We expect
this will begin to improve our
operating profit by reducing the
costs to acquire and serve our
customers from 2004. We also
capitalised £154 million of CRM
expenditure during the year
(2001: £60 million). General
and administrative expenses
were higher as a result of higher
manpower costs (largely to
support a growing home services
engineering workforce), higher
debtor provisions (£20 million)
and increased spending (£25 million)
to meet our obligations under
the government’s Energy
Efficiency Commitment. 
Most of this spend was
incorporated in our ‘here to HELP’
programme. This programme,
created by British Gas, is the
country’s biggest independent
initiative to tackle household
poverty. In alliance with local
housing providers and seven
leading charities, this programme
will provide help to 500,000
households over the next three
years. This will take the form of
energy efficiency measures, benefit
checks and a range of services
provided by our charity partners.
British Gas’s home management
website, www.house.co.uk, gives
customers online access to British
Gas 24 hours a day, every day
of the week. Research shows that
the site has averaged around 28%
of all utility related web traffic in

on the old British Gas site.
Residential gas
Turnover decreased by 6% to
£3.81 billion. Higher average selling
prices were offset by a reduction
in sales volumes, reflecting warmer
UK weather (operating profit
impact £42 million) and the net
loss of around 600,000 customer
accounts. We believe that our
brand and the scale of service
we provide support our average
revenue per customer being above
the average of the competition.
Gross margins recovered to 20%
(2001: 12%). The recovery was
driven by the increase in average
selling prices and a reduction in
transportation and metering costs
of £252 million compared with
2001, due to lower volume and
timing differences. A large portion
of the lower costs arose in the early
part of the year reflecting a reversal
of the over-recovery by Transco 
in 2001 of National Transmission
System (NTS) entry fees with a
year-on-year impact of £98 million. 
In 2002 we withdrew from the
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
business in line with our strategy
of focusing on direct customer
relationships as a large portion
of the LPG business operated
through third party retailers.
Residential electricity
Turnover increased by 23% to
£1 .38 billion. Our weighted average
retail price was slightly higher, as
the full year effect of a reduction
in prices in 2001 was offset by a
shift in our customer mix following
growth in the prepayment segment,
which operates on higher tariffs
given related administrative costs.
Average consumption was broadly
flat year on year. We believe that
our average retail pricing is
approximately 8% below the
average of the incumbent suppliers
and we estimate our market share
at year end was 22% (2001: 21%).
Gross profit grew by 21% due
to higher volumes, while our
gross margin fell one percentage
point to 26% due to increased
transportation and metering
costs being only partially offset
by lower commodity costs.
Home services
British Gas home services
continued to report strong growth
in the year. Turnover increased by
12% to £810 million. Higher central
heating volumes, augmented by the
impact of our T rolhurst acquisition
in late 2001 , were complemented
by good contributions from our
newer products, in particular home
electrical care. We are the only major
service supplier providing bundled
service products under our own
brand, using our own people. This
integrated offering gives competitive
advantage over outsourced products
and services marketed by other
suppliers and is a strong tool for
the retention of energy customers.
A £64 million improvement in
gross profit resulted from an
increase in volume and average
order value along with a higher
gross margin due to product mix,
increased productivity and the
lower price of materials. This
was partly offset by increased
operating costs, mainly due
to higher manpower and home
services marketing expenses.
The resulting growth of 69%
in operating profit illustrated
the continuing scalability of our
home services business model
as we increased both customer
numbers and product penetration. 
Our engineering staff numbers
(including installation engineers)
grew by 13%. Securing access
to skilled engineering staff is a
key challenge and during the first
half of the year we announced
our intention to recruit and train
approximately 5,000 engineers over
the next five years: this is already
well under way. T o this end British
Gas has set up its own engineering
academy which will co-ordinate
all engineering recruitment,
skills training and apprentice
development across the company.
It will also liaise with external bodies
including government and the wider
industry to promote training and
to reduce skills shortages.

Turnover in 2002 was up 41%
at £52 million (2001: £37 million),
due primarily to a higher average
number of customers over the 
12 month period. Our gross margin

take advantage of the lowest cost
routing for each individual call.
The business continues to operate
at a loss, mainly due to underlying
infrastructure costs and the cost
of customer acquisition in an

using this method. Initial results

Centrica Business Services
Profit up 48% with
organic growth
supported by acquisitions
Centrica Business Services
established itself as the number one
supplier of energy to the commercial
sector in the UK by maintaining its
position in the gas market and by
achieving strong organic growth in
the electricity sector, supplemented
by the acquisition of Electricity
Direct. The organic growth
accounted for almost half of the 53%
growth in the electricity customer
base since the beginning of the year .
Enron Direct has been successfully
integrated, increasing overall
business profitability, giving
enhanced sales capability across
the market and improving service
to larger multi-site customers.
Turnover has increased by 67% to 
£971 million as a result of organic
growth as well as a full year’s results
from Enron Direct and five months’
contribution from Electricity Direct.
Overall gross margin increased
by 3 percentage points to 17%
following price rises in gas.
Centrica Business Services has
increased its UK commercial
energy market share to 27%
(2001: 22%, measured by share
of supply points), comprising 51%
of the gas market and 20% of the
electricity market. In gas we seek
to defend our market position
through focusing on customer
service and a value proposition
rather than acquiring market share.
In electricity, due to the acquisition
activity and better targeted organic
growth, average consumption per
customer has increased by 39%.
We believe our pricing is
approximately in line with
other major branded suppliers.
CEMG
Upstream gas assets
portfolio being enhanced
The Centrica energy management
group (CEMG) consists of gas
production operations, the newly
acquired Rough gas storage
facilities, electricity generation
(managed for British Gas residential
and Centrica Business Services),
large volume industrial and
wholesale gas sales, and our
energy procurement, optimisation
and scheduling operations. This
unit is fundamental – through its
provision of competitively priced
energy supplies – to the success
of the customer facing operations
that are at the core of Centrica’s
consumer marketing business. 
Gas production
Upstream gas profits were
adversely affected by the reduction
in wholesale prices compared with
last year, reducing the average
unit sales price (which is linked to
market) by 5% in 2002. Production
volumes, which represented 27%
of our downstream demand, were
5% lower than last year due in
part to warm weather in the first
and last quarter. Unit production
costs increased as a percentage
of turnover given the higher volume
taken from those fields which attract
higher unit depreciation charges
and the overall reduction in turnover
to cover our fixed cost base.
During the year, a number of
upstream gas transactions were
concluded in line with our strategy
of increasing gas equity ownership
beyond the Morecambe fields.
In the first, Centrica undertook
a strategic swap with Agip in which
Centrica acquired uncontracted
gas and equity in the large
Goldeneye development, and built
its equity in the Armada complex
in the Central North Sea, together
with other small equity parcels
and cash. In return, Agip acquired
Centrica’s equity in the Liverpool
Bay development, where the gas
is not contracted to British Gas.
Subsequently, an 18% stake in the
Seymour development, adjacent
to Armada, was acquired from BP .
This well, which was drilled late in
the year and contains significant
quantities of gas and liquids, should
be in production in the first quarter
of 2003. At the end of the year,
Centrica entered into a contract
to acquire the remaining 60%
equity and overall operatorship
in the Rose gas development
in the Southern North Sea.
The development is expected
to deliver its first gas in 2004.
Finally, agreement was reached for
the sale to T alisman of the R Block

In total an estimated 135 billion

of gas was acquired.
We have also focused on making
best use of our asset infrastructure
in the East Irish Sea. In November,
the Centrica operated Bains field
came on stream and now links
into our South Morecambe
infrastructure. During the year,
an innovative drilling project
in our South Morecambe field
added a small amount of
additional reserves to the
portfolio. This technique is now
being evaluated for future use at
our other East Irish Sea assets
and offers us the potential of
adding reserves cost effectively.
Storage
In November Centrica acquired
the Rough gas storage facilities
in the North Sea. During the period
of Centrica’s ownership, turnover
was £9 million with an operating
profit of £1 million. The Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry
has to decide whether to clear
the acquisition, refer it to the
Competition Commission for
further investigation or accept
undertakings in lieu of a reference.
Industrial sales and wholesaling
Sales volumes were down by
8% against 2001 due to reduced
takes under long term interruptible
contracts with power stations,
and the termination of one
European contract. However,
better gross margins, a profit
of £9 million recognised in the
first half of 2002 in connection
with the early termination of
a gas supply contract, and 
one-off losses on the termination
of other contracts in 2001
contributed to increased
profits relative to last year.
Electricity generation
We currently have interests in 
four power stations with peak
capacity of 1 .7 GW as well as
a 0.9 GW tolling agreement
with Intergen for the entire
output capacity of its Spalding
plant, where operations are
expected to commence by
the end of 2004. The volume
of production at our generation
plants was 7 ,662 GWh, an
increase of 160% on last year
due mainly to the addition of
Glanford Brigg and the full
period use of the King’s Lynn
and Peterborough plants. Our
stations provided 22% of our
annual downstream demand,
and 20% of peak requirements.
The main value of our plants
remains in their flexible mid-merit
and peak generation capacity
in a less liquid market for peak
supplies. However, they also
provide strategic upside potential
in the event of higher wholesale
prices, with the option to increase
generation volumes as it becomes
more profitable.
Accord Energy
Our Accord trading operations
continued to support our strategic
procurement requirements and take
additional trading positions within
strictly controlled limits based on
our wholesale market outlook. 
Accord broke even on the year,
a drop of £16 million on 2001.
After a positive first half,
we experienced gas trading losses
during the unplanned shutdown
of the continental European
interconnector. Given Centrica’s
trading positions in Europe, this
led to Accord having to procure
gas at short notice to meet its
obligations, which would have
been fulfilled by exports from the
UK. Accord’s performance also
suffered in the power markets
through the highly publicised
problems of TXU and British
Energy, which contributed
to high volatility. Accord also
provided for a one-off loss
of £6 million when TXU went
into administration late in 2002.
Physical volumes traded during
2002 were equal to 1.4 times the
gas and 2.2 times the electricity
volumes supplied to our
downstream customers. 
The AA
Core business growth
in roadside and
personal finance
2002 saw further progress in the
development of the underlying
profitability of the AA’s core
roadside and personal finance
operations. Key to the AA’s future
growth is the ongoing investment
in brand repositioning which was
launched in May. The ‘JustAAsk’
message focuses consumer
attention on the product range
offered by the AA and has
increased product awareness
beyond roadside assistance from
33% to 43%. Turnover grew 10%
to £760 million. Operating profit
increased by 1.4% to £73 million
with increases in roadside services
and personal finance offset by
start-up losses for the AA Service
Centres. This repositioning of
the AA brand will support the
AA’s continued drive towards 
end-to-end motoring services
to members and cross-sales
of the whole product range.
The energy management group sources the
energy needed by our customer facing
operations.
We now have interests in four power stations
across the country.

In addition, the AA is investing
in a major CRM infrastructure
programme over three years.
In 2002, £30 million of expenditure
was incurred (of which £26 million
was capitalised). This investment
is central to developing the AA’s
cross-selling potential and at
the same time achieving cost
efficiencies across the business.
The AA’s website continues
to attract new customers to buy
AA products and services online.
Judged to be the UK’s most
popular automotive related site
in 2002, the website also brought
the AA the award for e-business
strategy of the year at the National
Business Awards. TheAA.com
supplied 16 million route maps
in 2002 and was accessed
by 21 million visitors.
The AA continues to act as the
independent voice of the motorist.
Highlights included February’s
launch of EuroRAP , a system to
give a safety star rating to Europe’s
roads, and the Chancellor’s budget
commitment not to make any
further fuel tax increases.
AA roadside services
Turnover increased by 5% to
£476 million, driven primarily by
membership growth, and whilst
our overall share of the personal
and business market marginally
increased to 31%, the average
price per customer fell by 0.6%
due to a change in product mix. 
Operating profits increased by
23% to £54 million, as higher
turnover was accompanied by
tight management controls and
initiatives to contain the roadside
breakdown costs and increase
patrol utilisation.
Investment in roadside assistance
continues with the provision of new
vehicles, GPS route guidance and
improved management systems.
The growth in roadside assistance
membership has continued and
with increased productivity of
the 3,600 patrols, customer
satisfaction has improved from
66% to 68%. The AA won the
JD Power & Associates UK
Roadside Assistance Study
award for customer satisfaction
and was named the UK’s best
motoring organisation in a
Which? magazine survey.
Also, the first tranche of
specialised all weather, portable
computer systems with fault
diagnostic capability were
deployed to AA patrols to help
maintain their ability to fix faults
at the roadside. All patrols will be
similarly equipped during 2003.
In the year the AA continued to
train patrols and Service Centre
technicians at its dedicated training
college. Some 125 new patrol
recruits were trained during 2002. 
AA personal finance
Turnover in personal finance
grew by 1 1 % to £172 million.
Supported by the ‘JustAAsk’
campaign, over 70,000 car
and personal loans were taken
out during the year which,
after renewals, left a year end
portfolio of approximately
1 17 ,000 fixed term personal
loans (2001: 77 ,000) provided
through the AA joint venture.
At the year end, the fixed term
loan book had increased by 54%
to stand at a record £661 million
(2001: £428 million) with provision
levels decreasing by 1 % to
below 3%. Continued product
improvements coupled with
specific advertising, emphasised
the benefits of getting ‘car loans
from car people’.
Motor and home insurance
commissions grew by 9%
on higher policy volume
(up to £93 million), with customer
renewal rates rising to 78%
(2001: 74%). The average annual
premium rose by 2% to £261 ,
reflecting general pricing
conditions in the industry.
Operating profits increased
by 17% to £47 million. Turnover
growth of 11% was augmented
by close control of support
costs with increased efficiency
improving the ratio of employees
to insurance policy levels.
A tailored motor insurance
policy specifically for AA
personal members was
launched in 2002 and sales
of 6,000 have been achieved
in its first year. Breakdown history
is one of the major factors that
form part of the premiums
assessment. The number of
policyholders of the AA’s new
insurance product for parts and
labour repairs grew from 3,000
in December 2001, following
its launch in May to 130,000
by December 2002.
Other AA services
Turnover is up 37% at £112 million,
including a full year of turnover
from the AA’s network of 129
garages acquired from Halfords
in September 2001 . In 2002

The ‘JustAAsk’ campaign launched in May
has helped broaden awareness of the
AA product range.
Our network of Service Centres has now been
fully rebranded. AA Service Centres to provide
a retail presence for AA members
and customers. As a further step
towards providing a complete
motoring service it also purchased
T yreserve and expanded its own
mobile tyre replacement service,
which now gives private and fleet
customers access to a network
of more than 3,000 AA approved
fixed and mobile tyre centres.
Other AA services incurred
operating losses of £28 million.
£4.5 million of this came from
the closure of AA workshops,
with the Service Centres
producing an operating loss
of £15 million. £7 million of
investment in infrastructure
and rebranding of the Service
Centres was expensed.
We are carrying out various
initiatives such as a cost reduction
programme, advertising
campaigns and offers to the
current membership base to
increase utilisation and rapidly
reduce the ongoing loss.
The AA in the Republic of Ireland
contributed a profit of nearly
£2 million, an increase of over
80% on 2001 , due to growth
in both insurance and roadside
assistance membership, thereby
remaining the leading roadside
assistance and personal insurance
provider in the country.
Publishing, car data check, the
driving school and roadside signs
made positive contributions which
were offset by start-up investments
in T yreserve and costs in AABuyacar
and information services.

Improving sector outlook
Our focus for this year has been
on increasing the value of the
existing One. T el customer base
through enhanced product
offerings and operational
efficiencies. In the medium term,
we believe that this positioning
provides us with a sound platform
to develop in the UK, assuming
recent regulatory proposals are
implemented quickly and fully.
In the second half of the year
turnover grew by 20% over the
second half of 2001 to £78 million,
as a result of further growth in the
customer base. Our variable gross
margin increased by 5% to 52%
as we took advantage of
opportunities to negotiate
improved transmission charges
with our carriers. Our switched
reseller business model relies
on the use of the networks of
a variety of infrastructure owners
(13 as at 31 December 2002),
mitigating the risks associated
with network failure or carrier
financial distress. Operating
profit for the year was £2.1 million
reflecting the investment in new

fourth quarter to raise awareness

the second half (full year:
£22 million) supporting full year
growth in the customer base
of 23% from 2001. ARPU
increased by 1% against the
second half of 2001 . With
the implementation of the
revised industry process for
carrier pre-selection (CPS)
in July, the level of our new
landline sales using this
connection method increased
to 37% in December. 
Mobile sales have been very
encouraging with more than
35,000 contracts sold since
the launch in July, supported
by attractive pricing and
expanded retail distribution.
The migration of our broadband
customers onto the One. T el

Goldfish Bank
Credit card growth from
renewed brand building
Goldfish Bank has continued
to make progress. Following
a review of product strategy
by the Goldfish management
team, we are focusing increasingly
on brand performance through
a smaller range of more capital
efficient products. 
The credit card business was
migrated to Goldfish’s new
infrastructure in November. This
was a significant and complex
process involving more than one
million cards in issue and their
associated loyalty points records.
The new platform is operating well
and customer service, through the
new contact centre in Glasgow,
has improved significantly.
Independent research indicates
that brand awareness has
remained high in the credit card
market and strengthened in the
overall financial services business.
The key objective has been to
generate awareness of Goldfish
as a financial services provider,
rather than simply a credit card.
Spontaneous awareness improved
from 6% at the end of 2001 to
12% at the end of 2002, which
puts Goldfish towards the top end
of non traditional banking brands.
Credit card recruitment
performance has strengthened
throughout the year following
changes to the channel mix and
customer management approach.
T otal card net interest income
was up 9% at £36 million despite
lower margins prevailing within the
industry and higher utilisation of
interest free promotional balance
transfers. Fee income rose 6%
to £54 million, primarily due to
higher levels of customer spend.
Credit losses remained low at
3% of outstanding balances.

The number of cards in force has
increased by 6% to 1.08 million
(2001: 1.02 million). During the
year 77,000 new accounts were
opened (2001: 27,600), with
attrition low at 4.5%. The average
monthly spend on the Goldfish
card increased by 14% against
2001, making it among the highest
in the UK market. The credit card
profit contribution of £9 million
was £3 million lower than 2001
due to a £4.5 million increase in
customer acquisition costs and
a £3 million cost relating to the
migration to Goldfish’s new
infrastructure in November.
In the autumn Goldfish entered
the personal loan market,
focusing initially on generating
a high quality applicant pool.
The product proposition was
based on flexibility featuring
no redemption penalties for
early settlement. At the year
end approximately 1,800 personal
loans had been drawn down
with total outstanding balances
of £14 million. Increased
awareness, response and 
take-up rates will be sought
in 2003. Goldfish customers
purchased 104,000 additional
Goldfish branded products
including travel insurance, home
insurance and personal accident
insurance. This is 69% up on 2001
and is an encouraging indicator
of future cross-sales potential.
The profit contribution from all
non-credit card products
was negative: a net loss of
£2 million due to the investment
of £5 million in customer
acquisition during the period.
Goldfish successfully launched
its internet based savings
account and began active
marketing in the autumn.
This has proved to have strong
appeal with £286 million
in deposits and over 11,000
accounts opened of which
approximately 50% were
customers new to Goldfish.
Savings will continue to form part
of a diversified funding strategy.
The overall operating loss
was £40 million with operating
expenses at Goldfish, consisting
of brand marketing, banking
systems and product development,
up 7% at £47 million. A further
£46 million investment was
capitalised in the development
of the IT systems platform.
As this nears completion,
we expect significantly lower
investment in 2003.
Centrica North America
Acquisitions of incumbent
positions but slower
organic growth
T otal North American turnover was
£1,118 million in 2002, an increase
of 46% over 2001 driven largely
by our entry into the Ontario and
T exas electricity markets, our entry
into the Ontario services market
through the acquisition of Enbridge
Services Inc and the addition of
over 300,000 gas customers
through the acquisitions of
Enbridge Services Inc and
parts of NewPower Company’s
customer base.
Operating profit fell by 7%, as
profits from our home services
businesses (£23 million) and
reduced losses in our electricity
business ( by £5 million) were
offset by lower profits (by
£4 million) in our gas business.
Included within the retail energy
results are the increase in the
cost base (£10 million) due to the
development of the infrastructure
to support future growth and
£21 million of expensed costs
incurred in acquiring customers
organically. Upstream profits
were lower as wholesale prices
fell and favourable forward contract
prices expired. These results
include the adverse currency
movements (£4 million), with a 6%
decline in the average Canadian
dollar exchange rate during the year .
The pace of organic growth slowed
in 2002 owing to a combination
of slow emergence of competitive
markets, restrictive legislative
and political developments
affecting sales activities, and
large fluctuations in wholesale
natural gas prices. We are
continuing our efforts with
governments and regulators
at state, provincial and federal
levels in support of market
liberalisation. We remain of the
view that momentum will be
regained in the regions that are
important to our future, but the
timing remains uncertain.
Retail energy
Turnover for the residential gas
supply business increased by 12%,
driven primarily by higher selling
prices and acquisitions. Our
Ontario residential gas market
share was approximately 26% at
year end. In our US gas markets,
slower growth caused by high rates
of customer churn was offset by the
acquisition in August of 212,000
customers in Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania from the NewPower
Company. We continue to manage
our portfolio of US gas customers
closely, and will focus our efforts 
on maximising the value from our
current position.
In our first year of operating in the
electricity business in Ontario (from
May) and T exas, turnover was
£189 million with an operating loss
of £10 million. Based on operating
experience this year, we estimate
that average annual consumption for
our residential electricity customers
would be 11,000 kWh, broadly in line
with our expectations and more than
twice our UK customer average.
The T exas residential electricity
market continues to support a
positive competitive environment,
with the presence of a pricing
regime that affords reasonable,
sustainable gross margin prospects
to both incumbents and new
market entrants. Following our
entry into this market in January,
we served 890,000 retail energy
customers by the year end,
consisting of both acquired
positions (810,000 customers)
in southern and western T exas
(for which our transaction closed
in late December 2002) and organic
programmes mainly in the Houston
and Dallas/Fort Worth regions.

A new internet based savings account was
launched during the year. 14 Centrica plc report 2002 
Our retail energy supply gross
profit grew by 14% to £95 million.
Our gross margin decreased
to 14%. Our current gross
margins (other than for our
acquired incumbent positions)
are largely driven by our historic
hedging activities in each local
market, through which we have
procured the energy commodity
at a fixed forward cost, achieving
a margin on the quantities
supplied to our fixed price retail
customers over a contracted
period. There are risks to these
margins from the complexities
involved in accurately forecasting
total commodity requirement,
linked to rates of consumption,
customer acquisition and retention.
We are now the third largest
electricity retailer in T exas.
Volatility in wholesale gas spot
prices remained high, as benchmark
gas contract prices moved between
US$10/mmbtu and US$2/mmbtu.
In markets where we compete
against utilities flowing through gas
or electricity to customers at
wholesale spot cost, this made
winning new forward curve-based
business extremely challenging and
also led to high levels of churn
among customers signed up to
what became relatively high priced
programmes. This cyclical pattern
will continue to be a feature of our
organic growth. In the latter part of
the year, prices returned to levels
that we believe are more
sustainable in the long term (US$4-
5/mmbtu) and conducive to the
development of our customer base.
Gross margins for our recently
acquired customers in T exas are
based upon prices approved by
the T exas Public Utility Commission
under the ‘Price T o Beat’ structure,
which we can apply to have
modified twice in any year to
reflect changes in gas feedstock
costs. Under the acquisition
arrangement, Centrica has an
economic interest in the profitability
of these businesses with effect
from 1 September 2002 through
to completion on 24 December
2002. These amounts will be
credited against amounts
payable, under the acquisition
agreement, in respect of the
sharing of earnings over the
next four years. All such payments
will be treated as deferred
purchase consideration. With
effect from 24 December 2002
the full profits have been
recognised in the accounts.
Market entry costs this year for
Ontario and T exas of £20 million
have been expensed. Organic
customer acquisition costs
were lower, following high levels
of Ontario electricity customer
acquisition in 2001 and due to
slower organic growth in the
US market. This, along with
the growth in turnover meant
that sales and marketing costs
as a percentage of turnover
reduced by 2 percentage points. 
We entered the Ontario electricity
market when it opened in May,
and successfully converted
over 500,000 contracts signed 
pre-opening to flowing customers.
We now have 15% of the residential
electricity market. On 11 November,
the Ontario government announced
that it would cap residential and
small business electricity
prices at below market rates,
to be subsidised by government,
effectively suspending competition
until 2006. Under this legislation,
Centrica remains entitled to
receive the market pricing
mitigation agreement payment,
amounting to £16 million relating
to 2002. Margins on residential
retail contracts already written
are protected, at least to 2006.
The regulations regarding
business customers are still
formative. This electricity
customer base of over 500,000
will continue to retain value and
be used for cross-selling gas
and home services products, but
further organic electricity growth
is unlikely to be possible until this
new legislation expires in 2006. 
We continue to seek opportunities
to acquire incumbent customer
positions from utilities seeking
to exit the retail function. Our
agreement in December, which is
subject to legislative changes and
regulatory consents, to purchase
the incumbent retail energy
business of ATCO Group in Alberta
– which currently consists of
approximately 820,000 gas
and 160,000 electricity customers –
will give us an 80% share of the gas
market and 14% of the electricity
market. We will maintain growth
momentum into 2003 as we migrate
customers to unregulated
energy and services packages.
Home and business services
As part of our strategy to gain
competitive advantage and
operating leverage from an
energy and home services 
cross-selling platform, the
acquisition of Enbridge Services
Inc for C$1 billion (£438 million)
was completed in May 2002.

Operating and financial review continued 
The integration of Enbridge Services Inc
has allowed us to broaden the range
of products we offer. Centrica plc report 2002 15
raised some C$744 million
(£303 million) through selling
down 58% of our interest
in the waterheater assets
acquired as part of the
transaction by way of the launch
of The Consumers’ Waterheater
Income Fund. Our remaining 42%
retained interest had a value
of C$218 million (£89 million)
at 31December, which we
intend to continue to sell
down in 2003. Centrica
remains the exclusive installer
and provider of maintenance
and repair services for our
customers’ waterheaters
and, accordingly, without legal
ownership of these assets, retains
relationships with approximately
1 .3 million households.
In the group’s balance sheet
the waterheaters are included
in fixed assets and the debt
financing raised (C$500 million),
for which there is no recourse
to Centrica, is included in loans,
net of expenses. The profit and
loss account includes the entire
rental income and related costs,
including depreciation and
interest on the income fund’s
debt financing from the date
of launch of the fund in
December. The income fund
unit holders’ share of profit
is reflected in a non-equity
minority interest in the profit
and loss account. The balance
sheet non-equity minority
interest includes amounts
raised from the sale of units.
The value of the retained
businesses together with the
cash receipts for the divested
assets has created major value
for Centrica shareholders.
We also remain a leading installer
of heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning (HVAC) equipment
in Ontario, which has a profitable
associated financing business
and, in addition, some 330,000
of households have contracted
with us for HVAC maintenance and
protection plans. We now have
around 50% share of this home
services market and increasing
this share is a key objective of
2003. Beginning in 2003 we
intend to manage services for our
business customers separately. 
Upstream gas
Development of our gas
fields in Alberta continues.
We drilled, completed and
began production at 218 wells
during 2002, compared with
307 in 2001. Production volumes
were up slightly at 356 million
therms, representing 24% of
our North American downstream
gas sales. Operating profit fell
by 47%, primarily as a result
of a lower wholesale market
which led to a 23% decline
in our average sales price
and the expiry of higher priced
forward sales contracts.
Europe
In developing our strategy
for Europe, we are focusing
on those countries where the
speed of market opening and
legal and political conditions,
including unbundling and
independent regulation,
are more advanced.
Through Luminus, our joint
venture in Belgium, we now
have approximately 18% of the
electricity market above 1 GWh
in Flanders which opened in
January 2002. The broader
commercial energy market
opening in early 2003 will
be followed closely by the
residential market opening
in July 2003 for both electricity
and gas. Luminus is positioned
as the number two player in
the Flemish market. When the
residential market opens the
business expects to have over
600,000 residential electricity
customers and nearly 200,000
residential gas customers.
Our second move in Europe is
in Spain, where our initial aim
is to enter the small and medium
sized business sector of the
market and to build a business
organically which utilises the
skills we have developed in
other markets. We are currently
testing our proposition with a
view to opening for business
in the second quarter of 2003. 
The operating loss in 2002 was
£7 million, reflecting start-up
costs in Belgium and Spain.
Note: All current financial results listed
are for the year ended 31 December 2002.

A major advertising campaign launched
Luminus in Belgium. 16 Centrica plc report 2002 
Centrica’s aim is to achieve a total
shareholder return (TSR) ranking
in the first quartile of UK FTSE 1 00
companies, taking account of
share price growth and dividends
received and reinvested over
a sustained period. Centrica
promotes continuing growth
in earnings and cash flow and
seeks to maximise the return
on capital it achieves within
a prudent risk management
framework. The remuneration
report on pages 25 to 30
summarises our TSR performance
over recent years against our
FTSE 100 comparator group.
The company’s closing share
price on 31 December 2002 was
1 71 pence (31 December 2001:
222 pence), resulting in a market
capitalisation of £7 .3 billion
(2001 : £8.9 billion). World stock
markets continued to fall in 2002,
the FTSE 100 index dropping by
24.5%. The company’s share price
still out performed the FTSE 100
by 3. 1 % (2001 : 2. 1%) and since
demerger to the end of 2002 we
out performed the index by 1 87%.
Earnings
Earnings increased by £155 million
to £478 million in 2002. This
reflected improved operating
profits* up £253 million and lower
exceptional charges offset by
taxation up from £155 million to
£250 million and higher goodwill
amortisation, up by £35 million
to £123 million.
Earnings before exceptional
charges and goodwill amortisation
were up 32% to £636 million.
This represents a return on
capital employed over the year
of 32% or 7 .9% on our average
market capitalisation.
Operating profit
Operating profit* was £932 million
(2001: £679 million). Most of the
improvement came from our
UK residential gas supply
business, and growth in our
business services and home
services operations. 
Exceptional charges and
goodwill amortisation
During the year, non-operating
exceptional charges arose
of £26 million net of tax
(2001: £71million operating
exceptionals net of tax). These
related to changes in our Golf
England operation and disposal
of our LPG cylinder business.
In addition, a £9 million (2001: £ nil)
exceptional tax charge arose
(see T axation below). The goodwill
amortisation charge for the year
was £123 million (2001: £88 million),
in line with our programme of
continuing acquisitions.
Net interest
Net interest charged to the profit
and loss account was £62 million
compared with £43 million in 2001
and was covered 15 times by
operating profit* compared with 
16 times a year earlier. The increase
in interest payable was due to
higher average indebtedness
mainly as a result of acquisitions,
offset by lower interest rates and
the net proceeds of the share
placement during the year. 
Taxation
The ongoing taxation charge of
£243 million for 2002 represents 
a 28% rate on profits adjusted 
for goodwill amortisation and
exceptionals (2001 comparative
rate: 26%). The increase in the
effective rate is principally due 
to the introduction of a 10%
corporation tax surcharge on UK
offshore gas production, with effect
from 17 April 2002. This surcharge
increased the tax charge for the
year by £12 million and resulted
in a restatement of the deferred
tax liability of £9 million, which
has been treated as exceptional.
The overall charge is still less than
the UK 30% statutory rate, primarily
because previously unrecognised
deferred tax assets of £35 million
have been utilised during 2002.
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic earnings per share grew
from 8. 1 pence to 1 1 .4 pence and
adjusted earnings per share from
12. 1 pence to 1 5.2 pence. Over
the last three years the adjusted
performance measure has grown
by an average compound growth
rate of 24% and facilitated a
progressive dividend policy. 
We are proposing a final dividend
of 2.6 pence giving a total of
4.0 pence (2001: 3.1 pence),
an increase of 29%.
Cash flow
Group operating cash flow
(including dividends from joint
ventures and associates, from
continuing operations before
exceptional payments) was 
£790 million for 2002, compared
with £885 million in 2001 . An
increase of £299 million in operating
profit* before depreciation and
amortisation of investments was
more than offset by changes in
working capital, including growth
in trade debtors, the timing of
gas transportation payments,
petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and
gas production royalty payments.
T otal capital expenditure was 
£449 million this year, up from 
£312 million in 2001 . This
includes £180 million of costs
capitalised for information systems
investments associated with
our new customer relationship
management (CRM) infrastructure.
Acquisition expenditures (net
of cash and overdrafts acquired)
were £989 million in 2002
(2001: £1 ,204 million), consisting
primarily of our purchases of the
Brigg power plant and Rough
Group financial review
We aim to grow our earnings and cash flow within a prudent
risk management framework. During the year our share price
out performed the FTSE 100 by 3. 1% and since demerger in
February 1 997 to the end of 2002 we out performed the index
by 1 87%.

The group’s net cash outflow
before liquid resources

£918 million, against a net
outflow of £342 million in 2001 .
Balance sheet
The net assets of the group
increased during the year from
£1 ,536 million to £2,402 million. 
Fixed assets
Net intangible fixed assets of
£1 ,813 million (2001 : £1 ,524 million)
represented goodwill, which
has arisen on acquisitions.
During the year, £466 million
(2001: £314 million) was added,
including £193 million for the
acquisition of Enbridge Services
Inc, £167 million for WTU Retail
Energy LP and CPL Retail Energy
LP and £80 million for Electricity
Direct. Goodwill is amortised by
way of charges against profits over
periods ranging from 5 to 20 years.
T angible fixed assets, mainly
comprising gas field assets
and power stations, had a net
book value of £2,763 million
(2001: £2,058 million). During
the year gas field assets, including
the Rough gas storage facilities,
and power stations totalling
£590 million were acquired.
At the year end, the proven and
probable gas reserves represented
by our field interests amounted
to 2,846 billion cubic feet (bcf)
(2001: 3,232 bcf), which included
404 bcf (2001: 446 bcf) in North
America. At the year end, hardware
and software costs relating to our
major investments in CRM had
a net book value of £237 million.
The group’s investment in joint
ventures stood at £74 million
(2001: £112 million), comprising
its share of gross assets of
£810 million and share of gross
liabilities of £736 million, of which
£629 million related to borrowings.
These investments related principally
to the investments in 60% of
Humber Power Limited, 50%
interest in the AA’s joint ventures
with HBOS and 50% of Luminus NV .
Working capital
Current assets less current
liabilities, excluding net
indebtedness and Goldfish
funding amounted to a deficit
of £243 million (2001: deficit of
£625 million). Excluding Goldfish,
growth in trade debtors and
accrued energy income has
given rise to a net increase of
£565 million in working capital.
Goldfish Bank
Goldfish Bank debtors, mainly
in respect of credit card balances
receivable, were £792 million
(2001: £ 673 million), offset
by customer savings account
balances of £286 million
(2001: £ nil). Goldfish Bank
borrowings amounted to
£430 million (2001: £610 million).
Net debt
Net debt (excluding the Goldfish
Bank facility of £430 million and
the £196 million of non-recourse
debt raised on the water heater
assets acquired with Enbridge
Services Inc) increased to
£529 million at 31 December 2002
from £433 million at the previous
year end.
Issue of share capital
In February 2002 £426 million, net
of expenses, was raised via the
issue of 232 million ordinary shares.
Provisions and other creditors
due after more than one year
T ogether these increased during
the year to £1 ,384 million
(2001 : £1 ,218 million). Increases
in respect of decommissioning
costs, mainly from acquisitions,
and deferred corporation tax have
more than offset the decrease
in provisions for deferred PRT .
Financial risk management
The board has established
objectives and policies for
managing financial risks, to enable
Centrica to achieve its long term
shareholder value growth targets
within a prudent risk management
framework. These objectives and
policies are regularly reviewed.
Currency, interest rate, liquidity
and counterparty risks are
managed centrally by a treasury
and risk management team, within
parameters set by the board.
This team is also responsible for
managing the relationships with
the agencies setting the company’s
credit ratings and managing the
cost of its debt capital. Energy
market price and weather risks
are managed by business led
energy and risk management teams
operating within group established
policies. Where appropriate,
financial instruments are used
to manage financial risks as
explained below and in note 29
on pages 59 to 62. Goldfish Bank
interest rate risks are managed by
a treasury team with Lloyds TSB
Bank plc within parameters set
by the Goldfish Bank board.
Credit rating
The company’s credit ratings from
Moody’s Investors Service/Standard
& Poor’s remain unchanged at A2/A
(long term) and P1/A-1 (short term)
and with a stable outlook.
Currency risk
Through wholly-owned US and
Canadian subsidiaries, the group
has operational exposure in
Canadian and US dollars. Canadian
dollar translation exposure is
hedged by maintaining a portfolio
of Canadian dollar financial
liabilities, which approximate
to the net asset value of the
Canadian operations. US dollar
exposure has been hedged by
borrowing on a short term basis
through a combination of US
commercial paper programme and
currency instruments. In addition
there is an element of exposure to
the euro through the 50% interest
in Luminus, which has been
hedged by selling euro forward
on a rolling basis. Exposures to
foreign currency movements from
operating activities are also hedged
through the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts. All debt raised
in US dollars through the US
commercial paper programme,
apart from that hedging the US
translation exposure, is either
swapped into sterling or another
functional currency as part of the
translation hedging operations
described above.
Interest rate risk
Throughout the year, the group’s
policy has been to maintain
approximately 50% of long term
borrowings at a fixed rate of
interest. This is achieved by using
derivative financial instruments,
such as interest rate swaps, to
adjust the interest basis of the
portfolio of long term debt (see
note 29 on pages 59 to 62). At the
year end debt has been raised on
both a fixed and floating rate basis.
Liquidity
Cash forecasts identifying the
liquidity requirements of the
group are produced frequently.
These are reviewed regularly
by the board to ensure that
sufficient financial headroom
exists for at least a 12 month
period. The group policy includes
maintaining a minimum level of
committed facilities and an
objective that a proportion of debt
should be long term, spread over a

range of maturities. Details of
the maturity profile of borrowings
are given in note 29 on pages 59
to 62. At 31 December 2002,
the group had undrawn
committed facilities of £1billion
(2001: £935 million), which were
used as a backstop for the US
commercial paper programme.
Counterparty risk
The board’s policy is to limit
counterparty exposures by setting
credit limits for each counterparty,
where possible by reference
to published credit ratings.
Exposures are measured in
relation to the nature, market
value and maturity of each contract
or financial instrument. Surplus
cash is invested in short term
financial instruments and only
deposited with counterparties
with a minimum credit rating
of A3/A- or P1/A-1 in Moody’s
Investors Service/ Standard &
Poor’s long term and short term
ratings respectively. Energy
trading activities are undertaken
with counterparties for whom
specific credit limits are set.
All contracted and potential
exposures are reported to the
financial risk management
committee of the board.
Commodity price risk
The key commodity price risks
facing the group are first, natural
gas and electricity prices both
in the short term market and in
respect of long term contracts
and, secondly, escalation indices
on long term gas contracts, of
which the most influential are
oil product prices and general
price inflation.
The group’s policy is to hedge
a proportion of the exposure
for a number of years ahead
matched to the underlying sale
and purchase risk profiles.
The group aims to manage
its risk by using financial
instruments such as oil and gas
swaps and gas derivatives and
bilateral agreements for gas and
power, as well as asset ownership.
The financial risk management
committee regularly monitors the
extent of the group’s commodity
price exposure and the level of
hedging activity alongside the
availability of forward prices
and market liquidity.
The acquisition of the Glanford
Brigg power station has further
contributed to the company’s
target to cover around a quarter
of its electricity requirement
from its own sources in 2002.
Weather risk
Gas sales volumes, and to a 
lesser extent electricity volumes,
are influenced by temperature and
other weather factors. In Britain,
the weather derivatives market
remains relatively immature.
We again entered into a number
of weather derivative transactions
for the winter period October 2002
to March 2003 in order to hedge
part of the group’ s weather exposure.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies
remain unchanged over last year
and are described in note 1 to the
financial statements on pages 35
to 37 . Where appropriate, wording
has been expanded to more fully
explain policies, particularly in
relation to financial instruments,
and energy trading activities.
In keeping with many other major
companies, adoption of FRS 1 7
Retirement Benefits, has been
deferred in line with the revised
timetable announced by the
Accounting Standards Board.
Accordingly, the group has
continued to report under SSAP 24
Accounting for Pension Costs.
In accordance with FRS 1 7 ,
additional disclosures are
contained in note 26 on pages
55 and 56. If the standard had
been fully adopted in 2002,
profit would have been reduced
by £47 million (2001: £16 million)
and net assets would have
been reduced by £507 million
(2001: £117 million). Full adoption
is not mandatory until 2005, but
the group will continue to keep
this under review.

Corporate responsibility
Our businesses are focused on
delivering essential products and
services to millions of people every
day. Continued and sustainable
success requires that we accept
and respond to our social
responsibilities. By understanding
our impact on society, the economy
and the wider environment, we can
develop positive relationships with
stakeholders to benefit both
business and the community.
Corporate responsibility is integral
to all our activities. Our framework
is set and co-ordinated by the
Centrica corporate responsibility
committee that was formed
in 2002. Detailed information
about our range of corporate
responsibility activities is available at
www.centrica.com/responsibility.
The effectiveness of our
approach was illustrated by
Centrica’s inclusion in the 2002
FTSE4Good Index and, for the
first time, in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Indexes for 2003. 
We are aware not only of the
positive business potential of
demonstrating our commitment
to corporate responsibility, but
also of the negative impact of
poor performance in this area.
Corporate responsibility concerns
have been fully integrated into
the group’s risk management
structures. These address the
financial impact on the business
of social and environmental threats
as well as the potential impact on
the reputation of our brands. 
Our corporate responsibility activities
fall into four main categories:
Environment
Our prime responsibility is
managing the impact of our
operations on the environment. 
We also have a responsibility for
its launch in September 2002 and
the end of the year, employees

In North America, we launched
‘Direct in the Community’.
The programme seeks to play
a leadership role in fostering,
supporting and encouraging
charitable initiatives that provide
services related to safe and
affordable housing, especially
for adults, families, older people
and people with disabilities.
The British Gas partnership with
Help the Aged continues to support
some of Britain’s most vulnerable
older people. Since its launch in
1999, British Gas has provided
Help the Aged with more than
£5.4 million of support and to
date there have been 1.6 million
beneficiaries of partnership
initiatives. The partnership
received the Business in the
Community Excellence Award
for cause related marketing in July.
We have enjoyed a successful
association with Carers UK since
1996. In 2002 we sought to identify
‘hidden’ carers and guide them to
information, advice and support.
Promotion, including a bill message
to more than two million customers,
also generated awareness among
our employees about Centrica’s
carer friendly employment
policies. Our chief executive
is president of the charity.
The AA Accessible Hotel of the Y ear
Awards highlight the importance
of ensuring equal access for
people with disabilities to hotels
and guest accommodation in the
lead up to the next phase of the
Disability Discrimination Act
in 2004. During 2002, AA hotel
inspectors assessed 60 hotels
and guest houses selected from the
results of a detailed questionnaire
returned from more than 300 of the
We published our second
environment report in March 2002. 
We also promoted environmental
good practice in the home through
our ‘Think Energy’ education
programme for schools. T o date,
more than 14,000 primary and
secondary schools in Britain have
signed up for the programme,
involving an estimated one million
school children between the ages
of 7 to 14. The programme will be
extended to include 14 to 16 year
olds from 2003. During 2002, ‘Think
Energy’ won a British Commitment
to the Environment Premier Award.
Community
Our community programme
addresses issues relevant to our
business and, where possible,
we also support our employees’
volunteering activities.
Communities will benefit most
from our investment if there is a
sound business case for it, since
this provides the best foundation
for sustained involvement.
We contributed £5.66 million
to community causes in 2002
as measured by the London
Benchmarking Group model, 
which includes both cash and 
in-kind support.
Our UK charity of the year initiative
enables employees across the
group to raise funds for a charity
chosen by a panel of employees.
From April 2001 until July 2002, our
partner was the Cystic Fibrosis T rust
and our employees raised more
than £475,000 to fund vital research
and treatment for the UK’s most
common life threatening inherited
disease. The partnership received
an Institute of Public Relations
Sword of Excellence award in July.
We hope for similar success
with our new chosen charity,
the Meningitis Trust. Between

informed decisions about using
our products and services in a
way that minimises any negative
impact on the environment. British
Gas plays a leading role in helping
to achieve the government’s fuel
poverty and climate change
targets through the provision
of free or subsidised energy
efficiency products. During our
Energy Efficiency Standards of
Performance (EESoP) programme,
which finished in April 2002, British
Gas provided 1 . 4 million energy
efficient products to 585,000
households throughout Britain,
in total saving 5,250 GWh of energy.
From April 2002, EESoP was
replaced by the Energy Efficiency
Commitment, a three year
programme with an energy saving
target of around 27 ,000 GWh.
British Gas is on target to deliver
these savings. Key to this success
has been our ability to engage
customers through new product
innovation and groundbreaking
customer propositions. Through our
Warm-A-Life programme, more than
70,000 disadvantaged customers
have received a range of benefits
including free insulation products,
benefits assessment to ensure that
they are claiming everything that
they are entitled to and discounts
on British Gas energy bills.
In 2002, we worked hard on
delivering our environmental
programme. Notable improvements
included increasing the recycling
in our offices from 18% to 34% and
improving their energy efficiency by
implementing projects that saved
more than 4.5 million kWh per
annum. In terms of environmental
management, sites that were
certified to ISO14001 have
completed their reassessment 
and the British Gas Service Centres
and AA Service Centres achieved
certification for the first time.

Marketplace
We try to take a responsible
approach to the marketing
and selling of our products
and services. We take care of
our customers’ daily essentials and
provide the necessary access
and expertise to ensure they benefit
fully from the products and services
we offer. For example, we currently
provide over 500 communications
each day to customers who are
blind or visually impaired in the
format they require, which includes
Braille, large print and audio.
Some of our customers have
specific needs. Current services
include the Home Energy Care
Register, the password scheme,
providing information in alternative
formats and using access
technology such as text phones. 
We have developed our own website
accessibility guidelines based on
internationally recognised standards
and intend that all our business
websites will meet and exceed
these standards in the near future.

Energy programme, chaired by
Centrica’s chief executive, to
address an anticipated shortage of
skilled and qualified gas engineers. 
We are delighted that, in
recognition of its commitment
to the development and training
of its employees, the AA has
received corporate Investors
in People accreditation.
Nearly three quarters of our
employees took part in the annual
global employee satisfaction survey
in 2002, up from under two thirds in
2000. The survey measures four
key improvement drivers –
customer focus, performance
and development, management
impact and working life. Part of
the performance related element
of directors’ remuneration is linked
to this survey.
The health and safety of our
employees is of paramount
importance. Our performance is
targeted and monitored through
key performance indicators.
In 2002, the amount of time lost
to injuries or occupational ill health
was low. Injuries have been
attributable mainly to slips,
trips and falls, and our accident
prevention programmes focus
on the underlying causes of these
and other near miss events.
We have also taken steps to
protect employees who may
encounter violence while they
do their jobs, for example gas
engineers, roadside patrols
and debt collectors. We have
launched an occupational
road risk programme to manage
the risks to employees who
drive in the course of their
employment. Good practice
workshops share new safety
techniques and opportunities
for performance improvement.
how we expect our employees
to act in a variety of situations.
This is being disseminated in 2003.
The growing diversity among
our customers and employees
presents us with opportunities
for change. In an increasingly
competitive environment, it is
essential that we recognise
the importance of operating as
an inclusive organisation,
through embracing diversity
in the workforce and selecting
the very best employees from
a wide and varied choice of
applicants. We work with a number
of partners to achieve this goal
including the Employers’ Forum
on Disability, an organisation
chaired by our chief executive. 
Diversity modules form part of
the training for all our customer
facing employees and a disability
awareness training package has
also been developed. More than
29,000 booklets giving practical
advice on how best to serve
disabled people have been
issued throughout the business.
We have created employment
opportunities for individuals
from disadvantaged backgrounds.
More than 180 individuals have
been employed through targeted
recruitment in our contact centres.
In July 2002 we received a Business
in the Community award for our
investment in disabled people
as employees and customers.
British Gas has committed to
recruiting 200 gas engineers,
targeting the long term unemployed
and those who have trouble finding
a career that fits in with their

a part-time option aimed at single

The British Gas ‘here to HELP’
initiative was launched in 2002
to help tackle household poverty
in the most deprived communities
in Britain. From a package
of £150 million, British Gas’s
investment of more than £70 million
is supported by additional
government and social housing
provider funding. Over the next
three years, 500,000 homes will
be supported in urban, suburban
and rural areas through a network
of local authorities, housing
associations and charity
organisations. Households are
offered energy efficiency measures
and advice along with other services
delivered by our charity partners.
Workplace
Relationships with all our
employees are based on trust
and respect for the individual.
We aim to attract, develop,
reward and retain high quality
people who are motivated to
achieve our business objectives.
Our employment policies seek
to create an environment that
motivates and engages all our
employees, rewards performance,
and satisfies material needs whilst
supporting equality of opportunity
for all. This is achieved through
policies such as family leave,
carers, personal development
and supporting employees to find
a successful balance between
work and personal life. A new guide
to sound business practice was
developed in 2002, setting out

The group is committed to pursuing equality and diversity
in all its employment activities, with particular emphasis on

and promotion. By supporting and encouraging the diversity of
our people, we aim to increase employee motivation and provide
better service to our diverse customer base in the community
at large. This approach is reflected in our employee policies
and procedures and we are proud to offer a range of benefits
that go beyond the requirements of legislation. For example,
we have a comprehensive ‘carers policy’, which enables
employees to balance the demands of long term caring
commitments with the requirements of their job.
The group continues to support the Government’s New
Deal for people with disabilities, the aim of which is to recruit

committed to implementing them through a programme
of equal pay audits.

views are also taken into account by means of local
consultative bodies. The group continues to be a strong
supporter of Investors in People.

resolution to appoint the new firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP , as auditors to the company will be proposed at the AGM.
Authority to purchase shares
The directors were authorised at the 2002 AGM to purchase
the company’s own shares, within certain limits and as permitted
by the Articles of Association. Although no such purchases have
been made to date pursuant to this authority, the directors will
seek to renew the authority at the 2003 AGM.
Corporate governance
The group is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. Following the recommendations in the
reports on the Role and Effectiveness of Non-Executive
Directors (the Higgs Report) and Audit Committees
(the Smith Report), the board is reviewing its governance
arrangements and will consider making changes as necessary
and appropriate. Throughout the year, the company fully
complied with the provisions of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (the Code) and applied the
principles of the Code as follows:
The board
An effective board of directors leads and controls the group.
The board, which meets at least 10 times a year, has a schedule
of matters reserved for its approval. One of its meetings each
year is substantially devoted to the development of strategy.
During 2002, there was full attendance at board and audit,
remuneration and nominations committee meetings, other
than by one director who missed one board meeting.
Comprehensive briefing papers including management
accounts are circulated to each director one week prior to
board meetings. A procedure is in place to enable all directors
to obtain independent professional advice in respect of their
duties. They also have access to the advice and services
of the company secretary.
The names of the directors and their biographical details
including committee memberships appear on page 21.
Throughout the year, the chairman and the other non-executive
directors were independent of management and the senior
independent director , as required by the Code, was Patricia Mann.
The non-executive directors, including the chairman, meet
independently of management on a regular basis.
All directors joining the board are required to submit
themselves for election at the next AGM. They are subject 
to re-election every third year thereafter. The non-executive
directors are initially appointed for a three year term and,
subject to review and re-election, can serve up to a maximum
of three such terms.
The board has delegated authority to a number of
committees to deal with specific aspects of the management
and control of the group. These committees have specific
terms of reference and meet on a regular basis. The minutes
of the meetings of these committees are made available
to all the directors on a timely basis.
Executive committee
The executive committee, chaired by Sir Roy Gardner, meets
weekly. It oversees the management of the group and is the
decision making body for those matters not reserved to the
board and within the limits set out in the group’s delegated
authority and expenditure control policies.
There are five sub-committees of the executive committee:
the group risk management committee; the group financial
risk management committee; the corporate responsibility
committee; the health, safety and environment committee;
and the business continuity steering group. 24 Centrica plc report 2002
Directors’ report  continued
Audit committee
The audit committee, which meets four times a year, consists
entirely of independent non-executive directors. It was chaired
throughout the year by Roger Carr.
The audit committee considers the nature and scope of the
audit process and its cost effectiveness. It reviews the internal
audit programme, matters brought to its attention by both the
internal and external auditors and the annual and interim financial
statements before submission to the board. It also reviews the
system of internal control and reports its findings to the board.
The audit committee also monitors the independence of the
external auditors. Note 4 to the financial statements on page 40,
sets out the group’s policy to seek competitive tenders for all
major consultancies and advisory projects.
From the beginning of 2002, in recognition of increasing
public concern over the effect of consulting services on auditors’
independence, this policy was strengthened such that the
external auditors’ consulting arm, PwC Consulting, would
not be invited to tender for any further general consultancy
work unless their proprietary skill base was uniquely valuable.
In addition, the external auditors may still be used in respect
of taxation advice and financial due diligence on transactions.
All such assignments are reported to the audit committee
on a quarterly basis, along with a full breakdown of all
non-audit fees incurred during the year.
As a matter of best practice and in accordance with auditing
standard 610, our external auditors have held discussions with
the audit committee on the subject of audit independence and
have confirmed their independence in writing.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee, which meets four times a year,
consists entirely of independent non-executive directors.
It is chaired by Patricia Mann. The role of this committee and
details of how the company applies the principles of the Code
in respect of directors’ remuneration are set out on pages 25 to 30.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee, chaired by Sir Michael Perry,
makes recommendations to the board for appointments
of replacement or additional directors. It met formally
on two occasions during the year.
Customer service committee
This committee, which determines and monitors customer
service targets, is one of the key drivers of the long term
success of the group. It was chaired by Sir Sydney Lipworth
until his retirement from the board on 13 May 2002.
From then until January 2003, it was chaired by Mark Clare.
Helen Alexander was appointed chairman of this committee
with effect from February 2003.
AA motoring policy committee
This committee, chaired by Sir Brian Shaw, acted as an
advocate on public policy issues affecting motorists. With effect
from January 2003, this committee was disbanded and its work
has been carried out by the independent AA Motoring Trust.
Relations with shareholders
The company has a programme of communication with its
shareholders. As well as share price information, news releases
and the annual report, the Centrica website includes speeches
from the AGM, presentations to the investment community
and a section for shareholder services.
The board believes that the AGM presents a useful
opportunity for dialogue with private shareholders, many of
whom are also customers. At the AGM, the chief executive
presents a review of the businesses of the group.
Representatives from the group’s brand units are available for
discussion in the exhibition area both before and after the
meeting. Centrica also holds regular meetings with its major
institutional shareholders.
All shareholders have the opportunity to cast their votes
at the AGM by proxy, by post or via the internet. Shareholders
can register to receive all their communications online,
benefiting both themselves and the company.
Internal control
The board of directors is responsible for the group’s system
of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives
and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Identification, assessment and management of risks
The company places great importance on internal control
and risk management. A risk aware and control conscious
environment is fostered throughout the group. The board,
directly or through its committees, sets objectives, performance
targets and policies for management of key risks facing
the group. These include strategic planning, acquisitions,
investments, expenditure control, treasury, environment,
health and safety, trading and customer service.
Across the group, each business has a risk management
committee that seeks to identify, assess and advise on the
management of operational risks. In addition, the group risk
management committee considers the risks which might
affect the company at group level.
The processes of newly acquired companies are
integrated with those of the group.
Assurance
The business assurance function undertakes internal audit
reviews according to an annual plan approved by the audit
committee. The results of their work is reported to the audit
committee on a quarterly basis.
The board’s review of the system of internal control
The board of directors, with the advice of the audit committee,
has reviewed the effectiveness of the internal control system
operated (as described above) throughout the period
1 January 2002 to the date of this report and is satisfied
that the group complies with the guidance contained
in the Turnbull Committee report on Internal Control.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the board has a reasonable
expectation that the company has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, we continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the financial statements, which are shown on
pages 32 to 67 .

Remuneration report 
Composition and role of the remuneration committee
The board has established a remuneration committee,
which is chaired by Patricia Mann. The other members of
the committee in 2002 were Roger Carr, Sir Sydney Lipworth
(until his retirement on 13 May 2002), Sir Michael Perry and
Sir Brian Shaw. Helen Alexander and Robert T obin became
members of the committee when they joined the board
on 1 January 2003. All of the members of the committee
are independent non-executive directors.
The committee makes recommendations to the
board, within formal terms of reference, on the policy
and framework of executive remuneration and its cost
to the company. The committee is also responsible
for the implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages for each
of the executive directors. The committee has access
to advice provided by the group head of reward
(Mike New), the group human resources director
(Anne Minto), the company secretary (Grant Dawson),
the chief executive (Sir Roy Gardner) and external
consultants. During 2002, the committee consulted,
but did not formally appoint, T owers Perrin, who provided
survey and other information on executive compensation
to assist in the formulation of the committee’s
recommendations. T owers Perrin also provided advice
to the group on retirement benefits and change management
processes during the year.
This report explains how the company has applied the
principles in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
that relate to directors’ remuneration. It will be submitted
to the forthcoming AGM for approval. No director votes
on any matter relating to his or her own remuneration.
Framework and policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The group’s remuneration policy is designed to provide
competitive rewards for its executive directors and other
senior executives, taking into account the company’s
performance, the markets in which the group operates
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the group.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the
committee aims to achieve a balance between fixed and
variable compensation for each director. Accordingly,
a significant proportion of the remuneration package
depends on the attainment of demanding performance
objectives, both short and long term. In agreeing the level
of base salaries and the annual performance bonus scheme,
the committee takes into consideration the total remuneration
that executives could receive. The committee reviews the
packages and varies individual elements when appropriate
from year to year.
The current practice is to make conditional awards each
year under both the executive share option scheme (ESOS)
and the long term incentive scheme (LTIS). These schemes
are designed to align the interests of executive directors and
other senior executives with the longer term interests of
shareholders by rewarding them for delivering increased
shareholder value.
As a matter of policy, all executive directors and certain
senior executives are expected to retain a minimum
shareholding in the company at least equal in value
to the executive’s base salary.
The committee believes that these arrangements, which
are further explained below, are important in providing a
potential remuneration package that will attract, retain and
continue to motivate executive directors and senior executives
in a marketplace that is increasingly challenging and competitive
in both commercial and human resource terms. It is intended
that the current remuneration policy, which has previously
been approved by shareholders, will continue for 2003 and
succeeding years.
In 2002, the total compensation of the executive directors,
detailed on page 27, consisted of components in the
following proportions:
Note: Salary and benefits are amounts received during 2002; pension is the increase
in transfer value less director’s contributions during 2002; performance bonus is that
paid in respect of 2002; and ESOS and L TIS is the estimated value of the awards made
in 2002 based on a Black Scholes model, provided that all performance conditions
are met, at the end of the relevant performance periods.
Components of remuneration
Base salary
The committee seeks to establish a base salary for each
executive director determined by individual performance and
external market data from independent sources, in particular
salary levels for similar positions in comparable companies.
Base salaries are reviewed annually. Base salary is the only
element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Annual performance bonus
T o recognise performance against agreed objectives, the
committee has put in place an annual bonus scheme for
executive directors similar to that applying to other senior
executives in the group. Annual bonuses for executive
directors are determined by the achievement of demanding
individual, business and corporate objectives. The scheme
provided the potential for a maximum bonus payment of 60%
of base salary should every element of every objective be
achieved in full. Annual bonus objectives and targets are
approved by the committee and, in 2002, related to financial
performance, customer and employee satisfaction and
personal performance, each at 20% of base salary.
For executive directors with business unit responsibilities,
the scheme is structured to reflect the performance of their
business unit as well as that of the group. No bonus at all
is payable to an individual if their agreed minimum
personal performance target is not met.
Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options granted under the ESOS only become exercisable
if and to the extent that performance conditions are satisfied
three years after the date of grant. If exercisable, they remain
so until the tenth anniversary of grant. Performance conditions
are based on the extent to which growth in the company’s
earnings per share (EPS growth) exceeds growth in the Retail
Prices Index (RPI growth) over a three year performance
period. EPS is calculated as fully-diluted earnings per share
adjusted for exceptional charges and goodwill amortisation.
The committee believes that this method of calculating EPS
provides an independent and verifiable measure of the
company’s performance.
In respect of each grant of options, the committee has
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, EPS
growth must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage points or
more over the three year performance period. No part of the
option grant will be exercisable if EPS growth fails to exceed
RPI growth by at least 9 percentage points over the performance
period. The proportion of the option grant exercisable by the

executive will increase on a sliding scale between 40%
and 100% if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between
9 and 18 percentage points over the performance period.
The company’s EPS growth may be re-measured
annually for a further two years, but always from the date
of grant of the options, with the performance conditions
increasing proportionately. The committee believes that,
in relation to the ESOS, EPS growth in excess of RPI
growth is the most appropriate measure for determining
the increase in value delivered to shareholders by the
company’s executive directors and senior executives.
The committee reviews the appropriateness of the
performance measure and the specific targets set
when considering each new grant of options.
In April 2002, options were granted to each executive
director equal to twice his base salary and, at the same or
lower rates, to certain other senior executives. Details of
options granted to executive directors are shown on page
30. It is the company’s intention that new shares be issued,
subject to institutional guidelines, to satisfy the exercise
of options granted under the ESOS.
Three of the executive directors hold options under
the restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS).
The RESOS was put in place to replace options which
executives had previously held over British Gas plc
shares and which were cancelled at demerger. There
are no performance conditions attaching to options
under the RESOS. Further details are given on page 30.
Long term incentive scheme (L TIS)
Allocations of shares are made annually to executive directors
and other senior executives under the LTIS. These awards are
subject to challenging performance conditions based on the
company’s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the returns
of a comparator group, since this ensures that the executives
are not rewarded unless the company has outperformed its
peers in creating shareholder value. The committee has
determined that, in the absence of a meaningful ‘natural’
comparator group for the company, the companies comprising
the FTSE 100 at the start of the relevant performance period
(the LTIS comparator group) constitute the most appropriate
comparator group for the purpose of the LTIS. The committee
reviews the appropriateness of the performance measure and
the specific target set when considering each new allocation
of shares under the LTIS. In assessing the extent of satisfaction
of the performance condition, the committee uses data
provided by Hoare Govett.
Allocations made prior to May 2001 are subject to
a performance period of either three or four years (at the
participant’s choice), followed by a retention period of two
years. Changes to these arrangements were approved at
the 2001 AGM. Allocations made from May 2001 will be
released to the participant under normal circumstances
after the three year performance period, provided the
performance conditions have been met.
The actual number of shares eventually released to the
participant depends on the company’s TSR over the entire
performance period relative to the LTIS comparator group.
The maximum annual allocation of shares only vests and
is released to the executive if the company’s TSR over the
performance period is ranked in 25th position or above
relative to the 99 other companies in the LTIS comparator
group. No shares vest if the TSR over the performance period
is ranked below 50th position in the LTIS comparator group.
Between 25th and 50th position, shares vest on a sliding
scale from 100% to 40%.
In April 2002, LTIS allocations equal to three quarters
of base salary were awarded to executive directors and,
at the same or lower rates, to certain other senior executives.
The maximum number of shares that could eventually be
transferred to each executive director upon satisfaction
of the performance criteria appears on page 29.
Prior to 2002, the trustee bought shares in the market
to match the likely future requirements for shares under
LTIS releases. Any shortfall will be satisfied by the issue
of new shares.
TSR: Centrica and FTSE 100: 1997 to 2002
The following table shows graphs of the company’s TSR
performance and that of the FTSE 100 index. As required by
the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this uses
a rolling definition of the FTSE 100, whereas the definition used
for the purposes of the LTIS is the FTSE 100 as constituted at
the beginning of the period. In order to demonstrate the delivery
of shareholder value during the respective performance periods,
TSR graphs for LTIS awards that vested in March and October
2002 are shown in the tables on page 29.
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management, executive directors
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a contributory, final
salary pension (see pages 27 and 28), a company car, life
assurance, private medical insurance and a financial counselling
scheme. They are also eligible, on the same basis as other
employees, to participate in the company’s Inland Revenue-
approved sharesave and share incentive plans. These are open
to all eligible employees and provide a long term savings and
investment opportunity.
Service contracts
It is the company’s policy for the notice period in executive
directors’ service contracts not to exceed one year. The
committee retains a level of flexibility in order to offer
contracts to new executive directors that contain an initial
notice period in excess of one year, provided that after the
first such period the notice period reduces to one year. 
The executive directors’ service contracts have no
fixed term but provide that either the director or the company
may terminate the employment by giving one year’s written
notice and that the company may pay compensation
in lieu of notice. Phillip Bentley’s contract provides for
an initial notice period of two years, which reverted in
November 2002 to one year on the same basis as the other
executive directors. The dates of the executive directors’
service contracts are disclosed in the table on page 27 .
Upon Mike Alexander’s retirement from the board on
28 February 2003, he will forfeit all of the options granted
to him under the ESOS (see the table on page 30) and the
conditional allocations of shares made to him under the
LTIS on 2 October 2000, 1 October 2001 and 2 April 2002
(see the table on page 29). The performance targets in
respect of the allocations of shares made to him under the
LTIS on 1 October 1998 and 7 October 1999 have previously
been achieved and those shares will be released to him at
the end of the retention periods on 30 September 2003 and
30 September 2004, respectively. Mike Alexander will not
receive any payments other than his pension, the details
of which are disclosed on pages 27 and 28.

External appointments of executive directors
The board believes that experience of other companies’ practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal development
of its executive directors and for the company. It is therefore the company’s policy to allow each executive director to accept one 
non-executive directorship of another company, although the board retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees are retained by
the individual director. Details of individual directors’ external appointments are given in their biographies on page 21.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts. The dates of their appointment are shown in the table below. Their
appointment is subject to the articles of association. Their fees are determined having regard to the need to attract individuals 
of the right calibre and experience, the time and responsibilities entailed and the fees paid by other companies. Their fees are
approved by the board, upon the recommendation of the executive committee, whose members are the executive directors listed 
in the table below, together with Grant Dawson, general counsel and company secretary. The executive committee received survey
and other information from the remuneration consultants, T owers Perrin. The non-executive directors, including the chairman,
do not participate in any of the company’s share schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes.
In addition to their fees as non-executive directors of the company, Sir Brian Shaw received fees for consultancy services to the
AA Motoring Policy Unit and Sir Sydney Lipworth received fees for services as a non-executive director of Goldfish Bank Limited.
The remuneration report from page 25 to page 27 up to this statement has not been audited. From this point until the end of the report
on page 30, the disclosures, with the exception of the two line graphs on page 29, have been audited.

Directors’ pensions
The pension arrangements for the executive directors, who are all members of the Centrica staff pension scheme, are shown below.
The staff pension scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue-approved, final salary, occupational pension scheme. Its rules provide for the
following main features:
• normal retirement at age 65;
• right to an immediate, unreduced pension on retirement at age 60;
• right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 55, subject to 10 years’ service and company consent;
• right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service on reorganisation or for redundancy after age 50;
• life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary;
• spouse’s pension on death in service payable at the rate of two thirds of the member’s prospective pension and, on death after
retirement, two thirds of accrued pension. Children’s pensions are also payable;
• members’ contributions payable at the rate of 4% of pensionable earnings;
• pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health;
• pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI; and
• no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 28 Centrica plc report 2002
Remuneration report continued
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. Where such limitation is due to the earnings ‘cap’, benefits are increased to the level
that would otherwise have been paid and are provided via the Centrica unapproved pension scheme. This scheme is unfunded but
the benefits are secured by a charge over Centrica’s assets to give security equivalent to the pensions provided to other employees.
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the company’s balance sheet.

(vii) The pension for Phillip Bentley accrues at the rate of 2.31% (approximately 
1
/ 43 ) of pensionable salary for each year
of pensionable service.

(i) At the end of the respective performance periods (2 March 2000 and 30 September 2000), the company ranked in sixth and fourth
positions respectively in the relevant LTIS comparator groups. Accordingly, 100% of the allocations were released on the vesting
dates (4 March 2002 and 1 October 2002 respectively) following the expiry of the two year retention period. These shares were
subject to income tax at the individual’s marginal rate, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income
tax liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the directors only received the net number of shares
following disposal, which is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2002 in the second table on page 28.
(ii) At the end of the respective performance periods (30 September 2001 and 30 September 2002), the company ranked fourth
in the relevant LTIS comparator groups. Accordingly, 100% of the allocations are being held in trust for a further two years
at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustee’s discretion.
(iii) The performance period relating to this allocation will end on 1 October 2003. If and to the extent that the performance
condition is met, the relevant number of shares will then be held in trust for two years, at the end of which time they will
be released to the directors at the trustee’s discretion.
(iv) The respective performance periods relating to these allocations will end on 30 September 2004 and 1 April 2005.
If and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the allocations will vest and the relevant number
of shares will be released to the directors, at the trustee’s discretion.
(v) The end of the qualifying period is the date on which it is judged whether or not the qualifying conditions
(see LTIS section on page 26) have been fulfilled.
(vi) The vesting date was the next business day after the end of the qualifying period.

(i) Restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS)
Options granted to company employees under the British Gas plc executive share option scheme prior to February 1997 were
cancelled and replaced at demerger by non-Inland Revenue-approved options to acquire Centrica shares. The replacement
options were granted on the same terms as British Gas executive share options, with the same exercise date and aggregate
exercise price per share, and the number of shares placed under option was adjusted to take account of the demerger.
No further options have been or will be granted under this scheme.
(ii) Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options were granted to executives under the terms of the Centrica executive share option scheme on 31 May 2001
and 2 April 2002. For details of the operation of this scheme see page 25.
(iii) Sharesave scheme
The company operates an Inland Revenue-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme. The scheme
is designed to provide a long term savings and investment opportunity for employees and is described on page 22.
(iv) Exercise of share options
Options were exercised at the following dates and prices: (a) 5 April 2002 at 225 pence; (b) 5 June 2002 at 207.5 pence; and 
(c) 1 July 2002 at 202.75 pence.
No director’s options lapsed during the year.
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2002 (31 December) was 171 pence. The range during
the year was 239 pence (high) and 150 pence (low).

Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Centrica plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise
the profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the cash flow
statement, the statement of total recognised gains and losses
and the related notes which have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and the accounting policies set
out in the principal accounting policies note. We have also
audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A
to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors’
remuneration report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report,
the directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. This report including the opinion has been prepared for
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or in to whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report
and consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. The other information comprises
only the directors’ report, the unaudited part of the directors’
remuneration report, the chairman’s statement, the chief
executive’s statement, the operating and financial review,
the group financial review, the statement of corporate
responsibility, the corporate governance statement and
the gas and liquids reserves.
We review whether the corporate governance statement
reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions
of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it
does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
or group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk
and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements and the auditable part of
the directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain
all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the company and the group
at 31 December 2002 and of the profit and cash flows
of the group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required
by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985.
The maintenance and integrity of the Centrica plc website is 
the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and,
accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred to the financial statements
since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
for preparing the financial statements
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to
prepare financial statements for each year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the

loss for the financial year.
The directors consider that, in preparing the financial
statements on pages 32 to 67 , the company has used appropriate
accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and
that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the
company keeps accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy the financial position of the company
and the group and which enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of
the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. Financial statements

The accounting policies, where applicable, are materially
in accordance with the SORP issued by the Oil Industry
Accounting Committee entitled Accounting for Oil and
Gas Exploration, Development, Production and
Decommissioning Activities.
Basis of preparation
The group financial statements comprise a consolidation
of the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiary
undertakings and incorporate the results of its share of
all joint ventures and associates. The results of undertakings
acquired are consolidated from the date the group gains control.
No profit and loss account is presented for the company
as permitted by Section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985.
An associated undertaking (associate) is an entity in which
the group has a long term equity interest and over which it
exercises significant influence. The consolidated financial
statements include the group portion of the operating profit
or loss, exceptional items, interest, taxation and net assets 
of associates (the equity method).
A joint venture is an entity in which the group has a long
term interest and shares control with one or more co-venturers.
The consolidated financial statements include the group portion
of turnover, operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest,
taxation, gross assets and gross liabilities of the joint venture
(the gross equity method).
Under FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions,
the Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund has been
consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, net
of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Energy supply: Turnover for energy supply activities
includes an assessment of energy supplies to customers
between the date of the last meter reading and the year
end (unread). Unread gas and electricity is estimated using
historical consumption patterns and is included in accrued
energy income within debtors.
Home services: Where the group has an ongoing obligation
to provide services, revenues are apportioned on a time basis,
and amounts billed in advance are treated as deferred
income and excluded from current turnover.
AA road services: Membership subscriptions are
apportioned on a time basis over the period of the membership.
Financial services: T urnover includes interest receivable, fees
and commissions receivable from financial services activities.
T elecommunications: Turnover is recognised on the
basis of telephony services actually provided to customers
in the financial period.
Cost of sales
Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced
and purchased, and related transportation and royalty costs,
bought in materials and services, and direct labour and related
overheads on installation works, repairs and service contracts.
Gas production costs include petroleum revenue taxes (PRT),
calculated on a unit of production basis, with changes in
estimates dealt with prospectively over the remaining lives
of gas fields. Financial services cost of sales also includes
finance charges on working capital facilities used to finance
banking receivables, and interest payable on customer deposits.
Employee share schemes
The group has a number of employee share schemes,
detailed in the directors’ report on pages 22 and 23.
As permitted by UITF Abstract 17 , the group does not
recognise the difference between market value and option
price to employees in relation to the UK sharesave
scheme within the profit and loss account, on the basis that
the scheme is UK Inland Revenue-approved. Upon vesting,
the difference between market value and the option price
is taken directly to reserves. The cost of potential share awards
under the group’s long term incentive schemes is charged
to the profit and loss account over the period to which the
performance criteria of each allocation relates. Cost is defined
as the difference between the contribution receivable from
employees and the market value at the date of grant, or the
actual cost of shares where market purchases are made at, or
around, grant date. Cost also includes provision for employer’s
National Insurance charges expected to arise at exercise dates.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development expenditure is charged
to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint
ventures are translated into sterling at average rates of
exchange for the relevant period. Differences resulting from
the retranslation of the opening net investment in overseas
subsidiary undertakings and from the retranslation of the
opening net assets and the results of these entities for
the year are taken to reserves, and are reported in the
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities
are taken to the profit and loss account, except that exchange
differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance or
hedge foreign currency net investments in overseas subsidiary
undertakings and joint ventures are taken directly to reserves
and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains
and losses. All other exchange movements are dealt with
through the profit and loss account.
Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business acquired
after 1 January 1998 is included in the balance sheet at
cost, less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for
impairment. On the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking
(including unincorporated businesses), joint venture or
associate, fair values are attributed to the assets and liabilities
acquired. Goodwill, which represents the difference between
the purchase consideration and the fair values of those net
assets, is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis
over a period which represents the directors’ estimate of its
useful economic life. Goodwill which arose on acquisitions
after 1 January 1998 is being amortised over periods ranging
from 5 to 20 years. Goodwill which arose prior to 1998
was written off directly to the profit and loss reserve. If an
undertaking is subsequently disposed, the appropriate
unamortised goodwill or goodwill written off to reserves
is dealt with through the profit and loss account in the
period of disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
T angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet at cost,
less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Notes to the financial statements 36 Centrica plc report 2002
Notes to the financial statements continued
1 Principal accounting policies continued
In the case of investments in customer relationship
management (CRM) and other technology infrastructure, cost
includes contractors’ charges, payments on account, materials,
direct labour and directly attributable overheads. Capitalisation
begins when expenditures for the asset are being incurred 
and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for
use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the
activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use
are complete. Depreciation commences at the point of
commercial deployment.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible fixed assets,
except exploration and production assets, are depreciated
on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write-off the cost, 
less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their
estimated useful lives. The depreciation periods for the principal
categories of assets are as follows:
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years
Plant 5 to 20 years
Power stations 20 years
Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years
Storage up to 30 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the
shorter of the lease term or their useful economic life.
Exploration and production assets are capitalised using
the successful efforts method and depreciated from the
commencement of production in the fields concerned, using
the unit of production method, based on all of the proven and
probable developed reserves of those fields. Changes in these
estimates are dealt with prospectively. The net carrying value
of fields in production is compared on a field-by-field basis with
the likely future net revenues to be derived from the estimated
remaining commercial reserves. A provision is made where it
is considered that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully
recovered from the net present value of future net revenues.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in
tangible fixed assets at cost. The obligations relating to finance
leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are
included within borrowings. The interest element of the rental
obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease
term to reflect the constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the obligation for each accounting period. Rentals
under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss
account as incurred.
Asset impairments
Intangible and tangible fixed assets are reviewed for
impairments if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for
impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed
by reference to the net present value of expected future cash
flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value,
if higher. If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce
the carrying amount to its estimated recoverable amount.
Investments
Other fixed asset investments are included in the balance
sheet at cost, less accumulated provisions for amortisation
and any impairment.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower
of cost and net realisable value.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net
realisable value.
‘T ake or Pay’ contracts
Where payments are made to external suppliers under
‘T ake or Pay’ obligations for gas not taken, they are treated
as prepayments and are included within debtors.
Decommissioning costs
Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated
cost of decommissioning gas production facilities at the end
of the producing lives of fields, and decommissioning storage
facilities at the end of the useful life of storage facilities based
on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.
When this provision gives access to future economic benefits,
an asset is recognised. Decommissioning assets are amortised
using the unit of production method, based on proven and
probable reserves, except for decommissioning assets relating
to storage facilities, which are amortised on a straight-line basis
over the useful economic life of the storage facilities. The
unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in the
profit and loss account within the net interest charge.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits
Pensions and other post retirement benefits are accounted
for in accordance with SSAP 24 Pension Costs. Additional
disclosures are also made in the notes to the financial
statements as required under the transitional arrangements
set out in FRS 17 Retirement Benefits. The cost of providing
retirement pensions and other benefits is charged to the profit
and loss account over the periods benefiting from employees’
service. The difference between the charge to the profit and loss
account and the contributions paid to the pension schemes is
shown as a provision in the balance sheet. The regular pension
cost, variations from the regular pension cost and interest are all
charged within employee costs, and the straight-line method
is applied for amortising surpluses and interest.
Long term sales contracts
Provision is made for the net present cost, using a risk free
discount rate, of any expected losses on long term sales
contracts. The provision is based on the difference between
the contracted sales price and the expected weighted
average cost of gas.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay
more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have
occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the group’s taxable profits and its results
as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion
of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal
of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are
revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding
agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss
expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial
statements. Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed
assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable
gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when
the replacement assets are sold. Centrica plc report 2002 37
1 Principal accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained
earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the
extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been
accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute
past earnings in the future has been entered into by the
subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Financial instruments
a) Debt instruments
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds
received after deduction of issue costs, adjusted to amortise
any discount or premium evenly over the term of the debt.
b) Derivative financial instruments
The group uses a range of derivative financial instruments
for both trading purposes and to manage (hedge) exposures
to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and
energy price risks arising in the normal course of business. 
The accounting treatment for these instruments is dependent 
on whether they are entered into for trading or non-trading
(hedging) purposes. A derivative instrument is considered
to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile
of an underlying exposure of the group in line with the group’s
risk management policies. In addition, there must be a
demonstrable link to an underlying transaction, pool of
transactions or specified future transaction or transactions.
Specified future transactions must be reasonably certain
to arise for the derivative to be accounted for as a hedge.
A discussion on how the group manages its financial risks
is included in the group financial review on pages 17 and 18.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as follows:
Energy trading activities
The group engages in swaps, futures, forwards and options in
gas, electricity and weather, for trading purposes. Open financial
and physical trading positions are marked to market using
externally derived market prices. Marked to market gains and
losses are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account,
within cost of sales. This is a departure from the Companies Act
1985 as disclosed within note 2. The corresponding fair value
debtors or creditors are included within the balance sheet.
Energy hedging activities
The group engages in gas, electricity, oil and weather derivatives
to hedge against price exposures arising within the energy
supply, procurement and retail operations. The derivatives are
matched to the specific exposures they are designed to reduce,
with gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account
in the same period as the income and costs of the underlying
hedged transactions.
Treasury hedging activities
The group uses interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements,
foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts to
manage exposures to interest rates arising on underlying
debt and cash positions or probable future commitments
and foreign exchange risks arising on foreign currency assets
and borrowings, foreign currency forecasted transactions and
the retranslation of overseas net investments. All instruments
are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile on existing
underlying exposures and probable future commitments in line
with the group’s risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps
and forward rate agreements are recognised as adjustments
to the net interest charge over the term of the contracts.
Currency swap agreements and forward exchange
contracts are retranslated at the rates ruling in the agreements
and contracts. Resulting gains or losses are offset against
foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowings
or, where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future
transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs. Where
used to hedge overseas net investments, gains or losses are
recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses,
with interest recorded in the profit and loss account.
Where derivatives used to manage interest rate risk or
to hedge other anticipated cash flows are terminated before
the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs,
the resulting gain or loss is recognised on a basis that matches
the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying debt
or hedged transaction. When an anticipated transaction
is no longer likely to occur or finance debt is terminated
before maturity, any deferred gain or loss that has arisen
on the related derivative is recognised in the profit and loss
account, together with any gain or loss on the terminated item.
2 Accounting policy for energy trading activities
Energy trading financial derivatives and open positions on
physical energy trading contracts are marked to market using
externally derived market prices. This is not in accordance
with the general provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies
Act 1985, which requires that these contracts be stated at
the lower of cost and net realisable value or that, if revalued,
any revaluation difference be taken to a revaluation reserve.
However, the directors consider that these requirements would
fail to provide a true and fair view of the profit for the year since
the marketability of energy trading contracts enables decisions
to be taken continually whether to hold or sell them. Accordingly
the measure of profit in any period is properly made by reference
to market values. The effect of the departure on the financial
statements is an increase in profit for the year amounting to
£7 million (2001: £2 million) and an increase in net assets at
31 December 2002 amounting to £9 million (2001: £2 million). 38 Centrica plc report 2002

(i) The tax credit arising on exceptional items related to those costs identified as exceptional in note 5.
(ii) The exceptional tax charge in 2002 comprised an increase in deferred tax provisions arising from the supplementary charge
applicable to profits on ‘ring-fenced’ offshore gas production.
b) Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK
corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows:
2002 2001
£m £m
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 719 468

Supplementary charge applicable to upstream profits 12 –
Overseas losses or taxation not available for credit 17 –
Group current tax charge for the year 179 109
c) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate
for UK corporation tax, currently 30%. Fair values are attributed to fixed assets on acquisition of businesses and companies and
amortisation or depreciation is subsequently provided based upon those amounts. Were the assets to be sold at the book values
at the balance sheet date without the benefit of tax planning arrangements, the amount of tax that would be payable is estimated
in aggregate to be £168 million of which £146 million is provided in the balance sheet as deferred tax. There is, however, no intention
to sell any of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the crystallisation of the above tax charge is considered to be remote. Centrica plc report 2002 43

10 Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings for the financial year of £478 million (2001: £323 million) by
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 4, 181 million (2001: 3,984 million). The number of shares
excluded 27 million ordinary shares (2001: 34 million), being the weighted average number of the company’s own shares recorded
on the group balance sheet during the year in accordance with UITF Abstract 13 ESOP Trusts.
The directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per
ordinary share adjusted for exceptional charges and goodwill amortisation, assists with understanding the underlying
performance of the group. The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows:
2002 2001
Pence per Pence per
ordinary ordinary
£m share £m share
Earnings – basic 478 11.4 323 8.1
Exceptional items net of tax 35 0.9 71 1.8
Goodwill amortisation 123 2.9 88 2.2
Earnings – adjusted basic 636 15.2 482 12.1
Earnings – diluted 478 11.3 323 8.0
In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation, there are no adjustments to the reported earnings for either 2002 or 2001, but the weighted average number
of shares used as the denominator is adjusted. The adjustments relate mainly to notional share awards made to employees under the
long term incentive scheme and the share options granted to employees under the savings-related share option scheme, as follows:
2002 2001
million million

Weighted average number of shares in issue 4,181 3,984

(i) The group’s share of net assets of associates was £2 million (2001: £3 million). The group’s share of joint ventures’ gross assets and
gross liabilities principally comprised its interests in Humber Power Limited (a power station), Centrica Personal Finance Limited
(AA and British Gas personal loans activities), AA Financial Services (AA credit card activities) and Luminus NV (energy supply).
The group’s share of joint ventures’ gross liabilities included loans payable to the group amounting to £4 million (2001: £12 million).
The share of Humber Power Limited’s gross liabilities includes £269 million (2001: £270 million) of lease finance, of which
£254 million (2001: £258 million) is repayable after more than five years. Although the group holds a majority of the voting rights
in Humber Power Limited, it is restricted in its ability to exercise these rights under an agreement with the other shareholder.
Consequently the investment has not been consolidated but has been accounted for as a joint venture.

Decommissioning costs
Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production facilities at the end of their
producing lives. The estimate has been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance
sheet date. The timing of decommissioning payments are dependent on the lives of a number of fields but are anticipated 
to occur between 2005 and 2042. The revision in the year is due to an increase in the estimate for gas field abandonment 
costs. The profit and loss charge represents £4 million of notional interest (2001: £3 million).
Deferred petroleum revenue tax
The provision for tax on gas and oil activities has been calculated on a unit of production basis.
Deferred corporation tax
A deferred tax provision has been made in respect of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences, 
net of recognised deferred tax assets.
Pension and other retirement benefits
This provision included the difference between charges to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid
to the pension schemes in respect of retirement pensions and other related benefits.
Restructuring costs
The provision represented costs relating to surplus properties, redundancy and other costs relating to reorganisations.
Surplus properties arose mainly following the closure of retail operations in both British Gas Energy Centres and in the AA.
The provision relating to surplus properties was calculated as the lower of the difference between rental costs and sublet
income over the remainder of the leases and the potential cost to surrender those leases. The provision for redundancy costs
reflected announced restructuring plans. The majority of these sums were expected to be spent between 2004 and 2005. 48 Centrica plc report 2002
Notes to the financial statements continued
19 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
Sales contract loss and renegotiation provisions
The sales contract loss provision represented the net present cost, using a risk free discount rate, of expected losses on onerous long term
sales contracts, based on the difference between the contracted sales price and the expected weighted average cost of gas. These
contracts terminate between 2005 and 2006. The profit and loss charge included £14 million of notional interest (2001: £15 million).
In previous years, the group renegotiated certain long term ‘T ake or Pay’ contracts which would have resulted in commitments
to pay for gas that would be excess to requirements and/or at prices above likely market rates. The provision represented the net
present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the renegotiations, which are due for settlement
between 2003 and 2008.
Other
Other provisions principally cover estimated liabilities in respect of claims reflected in the group’s insurance subsidiaries, Goldfish
credit card loyalty points, outstanding litigation, and provision for National Insurance payable in respect of long term incentive scheme
liabilities. The National Insurance provision was based on a share price of 171 pence at 31 December 2002 (2001: 222 pence).

The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on 31 December 2002 was 171 pence (2001: 222 pence).
Long term incentive scheme
At 31 December 2002, 34 million shares (2001: 40 million) were outstanding in respect of allocations made under the long term
incentive scheme, which includes allocations of 23 million shares (2001: 23 million) that are subject to performance conditions
and allocations of 11 million shares (2001: 17 million) that have reached the conclusion of the performance period but are subject
to a two year retention period. Details of the operation of the long term incentive scheme, in which the executive directors
participate, can be found in the remuneration report on page 26.
The Centrica Employees Share Trusts were established to acquire ordinary shares in the company, by subscription or purchase,
with funds provided by way of interest free loans from the company to satisfy rights to shares on the vesting of allocations made
under the company’s long term incentive arrangements.
Since the beginning of 2002, no further shares have been acquired by the trust. Any future shortfall will be satisfied by the
allotment and issue of new shares.
At 31 December 2002, the trusts held 27 million (2001: 39 million) ordinary shares in the company which had a market value
of £47 million (2001: 39 million ordinary shares with a market value of £88 million). Dividends due on shares held in trust are waived
in accordance with the trust deeds. All administration costs are borne by the group. Centrica plc report 2002 49

(i) Cumulative goodwill taken directly to the profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2002 amounted to £85 million (2001: £85 million).
This goodwill had been taken to reserves as a matter of accounting policy and will be charged in the profit and loss account
should there be a subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
(ii) Exchange gains of £84 million (2001: £18 million) on foreign currency borrowings have been offset in full in reserves against
exchange losses of £92 million (2001: £18 million) on the net investment in overseas undertakings.
(iii) The share issue movement in the group profit and loss account represented the difference between the share issue prices
(being the market prices on the date of exercise of options) and the share option prices. This difference was funded by the
company and its subsidiaries. Shares were allotted to a qualifying share ownership trust, for subsequent transfer to eligible
employees, who have exercised options.
(iv) Centrica intends to fund certain of its long term incentive schemes through the issue of new shares when these schemes vest.

26 Pensions
Substantially all of the group’s UK employees at 31 December 2002 were members of one of the four main schemes in the group:
the Centrica Staff Pension Scheme, the Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme, the Centrica Management Pension Scheme and the
AA Staff Pension Scheme. They are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified
actuary certifies the rate of employers’ contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees
and proceeds from the schemes’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees
whose benefits under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the ‘earnings cap’.
Independent actuarial valuations for Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP) 24 purposes at 31 March 2001
showed aggregate actuarial asset values and those values relative to benefits due to members, (calculated on the basis
of pensionable earnings and services on an ongoing basis using the projected unit method) as follows:

(i) The group has a commitment to provide post retirement private medical insurance cover for certain AA current and past
employees. The triennial independent actuarial valuation undertaken at 31 December 2001 , assuming a 2.5% per annum real
increase in premiums disclosed a liability of £27 million. The provision under this scheme as recognised under SSAP 24 was 
£21 million (2001: £18 million). The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was £3 million (2001: £3 million).
(ii) The group has a commitment to provide certain pension and other post retirement benefits to employees of Direct Energy Marketing
Limited (Canada). The Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan was established on 1 March 2002 and an independent
actuarial valuation carried out on 7 May 2002, which disclosed a surplus in respect of pension benefits of £6 million and a deficit
in respect of non-pension post retirement benefits of £4 million, resulting in a net surplus of £2 million. The net cost to the group
of retirement benefits under this scheme was £1 million and the net surplus recognised at 31 December 2002 was £1 million.
The total net cost to the group of other retirement benefits on a SSAP 24 basis was £4 million (2001: £3 million).
Additional disclosures regarding the group’s defined benefit pension schemes, the unapproved pension arrangement and the post
retirement medical plan are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17Retirement Benefits. The disclosures provide
information which will be necessary for the full implementation of FRS 17 in due course.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2001 ,
the unapproved pension scheme at 6 April 2002, the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 7 May 2002 and the post
retirement medical liability at 31 December 2001 . These have been updated to 31 December 2002 for the purposes of meeting
the requirements of FRS 17 . Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at market value.

27 Commitments and contingencies
a) Acquisitions
On 10 December 2002 the group reached agreement to acquire the retail gas and electricity supply businesses of the ATCO Group
in Alberta, Canada for consideration of approximately £52 million, payable over two years.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the
promulgation of legislation that reflects the market refinements announced by the Minister of Energy in August 2002. It is expected
that the Alberta Legislature will consider these legislative changes in the spring of 2003. Completion is expected by mid to late 2003.
b) Capital expenditure
At 31 December 2002, the group had placed contracts for capital expenditure amounting to £106 million (2001: £31 million) of which
£72 million relates to the investment in customer relationship management (CRM) infrastructure (2001: £nil).
c) Decommissioning costs
The company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide security to BG International
Limited, which, as original licence holder for the Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the
Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully discharged by the group. The security is to be provided when the estimated future
net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields falls below 150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning. The nature
of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force unless and until the costs of such decommissioning
have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of Trade and Industry decommissioning notice in respect
of the Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.
d) Lease commitments
Land and buildings Other
At 31 December non-cancellable operating lease commitments of the group
2002 2001 2002 2001
for the following year were: £m £m £m £m

Between one and five years 7 5 24 23
After five years 38 42 3 10
49 47 28 36
There were no commitments at 31 December 2002 under finance leases entered into, but for which inception occurs after
31 December 2002 (2001: £nil).
e) Litigation
The group has a number of outstanding disputes arising out of its normal activities, for which appropriate provisions have been made,
in accordance with FRS12.
f ) Guarantees and indemnities
The company has £1 billion of bilateral credit facilities (2001: £935 million). Hydrocarbon Resources Limited and British Gas Trading
Limited have guaranteed, jointly and severally, to pay on demand any sum which the company does not pay in accordance with
the facility agreements.
The group and BG Group plc have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify each other against certain actual and
contingent liabilities associated with their respective businesses.
In relation to the sale and leaseback of the Morecambe gas field tangible fixed assets recorded in these financial statements,
the group has given guarantees amounting to £92 million (2001: £116 million).
The group has given guarantees in connection with the finance lease obligations relating to Humber Power Limited referred
to in note 13. A fixed collateral payment amounting to £225 million (2001: £225 million) is required in the event of Centrica plc
failing to retain at least one credit rating which is not on credit watch above the BBB+/Baa1 level, and further collateral
of £75 million is required if the credit rating falls further.
The group has given guarantees and indemnities to various counterparties in relation to wholesale energy trading
and procurement activities, and to third parties in respect of gas production and energy transportation liabilities.
In connection with their energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain group companies have entered into
contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant
deterioration in credit worthiness. The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the
point of deterioration.
Following the closure of the British Gas Energy Centres Limited (Energy Centres) operations in July 1999, guarantees
have been signed on certain former Energy Centres’ properties as a result of reassignment of leases. 58 Centrica plc report 2002
Notes to the financial statements continued
27 Commitments and contingencies continued
g) Gas purchase contracts
The group is contracted to purchase 65 billion therms of gas (2001: 46 billion therms) in Great Britain under long term contracts.
The significant increase on last year is largely due to a number of contracts that have recently been entered into where the price
is linked to the market price for gas. A proportion of this gas (37 billion therms) however relates to legacy contracts at prices, mainly
determined by various baskets of indices including oil prices and general inflation, which may exceed market gas prices from time
to time. Whilst there remains uncertainty regarding future prices and market share, in the opinion of the directors, no general provision
for onerous contract losses is required.
The total volume of gas to be taken under these long term contracts depends upon a number of factors, including the actual
reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis. Based upon the minimum volume of gas
that the group is contracted to pay for in any year, the profile of the contract commitments is estimated as follows:
2002 2001
million million
therms therms
Within five years 45,900 29,900
After five years 19,200 15,900
65,100 45,800
The directors do not consider it feasible to estimate reliably the actual future cost of committed gas purchase as the group’s
weighted average cost of gas from these contracts is subject to a variety of indexation bases. The group’s average cost of gas
from its long term contracts for the year ended 31 December 2002 was 19.6 pence per therm (for the year ended 31 December 2001:
19.9 pence per therm. This compares to 20.8 pence per therm being the weighted average cost for the three month period ending
31 December 2001 which was used to estimate the financial commitment in 2001). Applying this value would imply a group financial
commitment of approximately £12.7 billion (2001: £9.5 billion as previously stated).
2002 2001
The commitment profile on this same basis is set out below: £m £m
Within one year 1,900 1,900
Between one and five years 7,000 4,300
After five years 3,800 3,300
12,700 9,500
In addition, the group has entered into two new contracts to purchase significant additional volumes of gas at market prices from
Statoil (17 billion therms over 10 years from 1 July 2005) and Gasunie (27 billion therms over 10 years from 1 April 2005).
Both of these contracts remain conditional at this stage and so are excluded from the numbers above.

With the exception of uncleared items, floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based upon LIBOR for periods of one day

(i) Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid include £108 million relating to non-equity minority interests. Non-equity minority
interests relate to a 58.1% economic interest in the Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund, represented by units listed on the
T oronto Stock Exchange, for which no maturity date is specified.
b) Currency risk
Sterling, Canadian and US dollars were the functional currencies for all material operations in 2002 and 2001. There were no
material monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than these functional currencies, except for £9 million of monetary
assets denominated in euros (2001: £16 million) and £7 million (2001: £69 million) of monetary assets denominated in US dollars.
The euro assets represent short term cash flow timing differences on European gas trading. The US assets represent margin
deposits placed in respect of energy trading positions. In the UK the cost of gas under long term purchase contracts is dependent
upon indices, which in part are influenced by US dollar denominated oil prices. An element of the foreign (US$) exchange risk
so arising was hedged using forward foreign currency contracts (note 29g).

d) Borrowing facilities
At 31 December 2002, the group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in which all conditions precedent had been met at that
date, of £1 billion (2001: £935 million). Of these facilities, 50% mature during 2003, whilst the remainder do not mature until 2006. 
In addition the group has access to a number of uncommitted facilities.
The principal debt facilities in use by the group at 31 December 2002 were a US commercial paper programme of US$2 billion
(2001: US$2 billion) and a euro medium term note (EMTN) programme of US$2 billion (2001: US$2 billion). At 31 December 2002,
US$374 million (£237 million) had been issued under the commercial paper programme (2001: US$446 million) and bonds totalling
£525 million (2001: £500 million) had been issued under the EMTN programme. Of the commercial paper issued, US$299 million
had been swapped into sterling, and the remainder was held in US dollars. In relation to the bonds, 24% mature between two
and five years and 76% mature after five years.
Goldfish Bank also has a £850 million (2001: £850 million) borrowing facility from Lloyds TSB Bank plc, from which £430 million
(2001: £610 million) was drawn down at 31 December 2002.

of that market. Where there is no organised market and/or the market is illiquid, the market price is based upon
management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors.
f) Gains and losses on financial instruments held for trading
There was no net gain or loss from trading in energy derivatives included in the group profit and loss account for the year 
ended 31 December 2002 (2001: gain of £6 million). Energy derivatives used for this purpose comprised energy swaps,
futures, forwards and options. As permitted by FRS 13, physical contracts are not cash-settled commodity contracts
and have accordingly been excluded. The average fair value of instruments held during the year ended 31 December 2002
did not materially differ from the year end position. The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading
at 31 December 2002 amounted to £14 million and £9 million respectively. Centrica plc report 2002 61

As part of the arrangements to launch the Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund in Canada in December 2002, the Fund issued 
C$500 million of Floating Rate Notes. On 22 January 2003 these Notes were refinanced through the issuance of two series of senior
notes, pursuant to a prospectus filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The series A-1 Notes have an expected 
final payment date of five years and legal maturity of 11 years, and were issued at par with a coupon of 4. 700%. The series A-2 Notes
have an expected final payment date of seven years and legal maturity of 13 years and were issued at par with a coupon of 5.245%.
Both series are non-recourse to the Centrica group, and are rated AAA by Standard & Poors and the Dominion Bond Rating Service.
On 7 February 2003 the group announced a series of four year electricity purchase contracts entered into by its wholly-owned
subsidiary British Gas Trading Limited with British Energy Power and Energy Trading Limited, a subsidiary of British Energy plc,
for the purchase of 38TWh of power, amounting to 20% of the group’s electricity requirements over the period. More than half
of the electricity purchased will be at a fixed price the remainder being linked to future electricity market prices.
On 11 February 2003 the group confirmed that it had acquired the full legal title to the King’s Lynn power station for a consideration
of £1, previously held under a finance lease (note 12(ii)). This followed the acquisition of the legal title to the Peterborough Power Station
for a consideration of £1 announced on 23 December 2002.

62 Centrica plc report 2002 32 Summary financial information for the Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund (the Fund)
In the context of the short period of operation of the Fund which was inadequate to demonstrate its independent operation
in practice, and Centrica’s retained interest in the Fund, directors have concluded that it is appropriate to consolidate the Fund
as a quasi-subsidiary in accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions. A summary of the financial information

The Fund commenced operating on 17 December 2002 and accordingly no comparative information is available.
The initial public offering of units in the Fund closed on the T oronto Stock Exchange on 17 December 2002. At 31 December 2002
Centrica held a 42% interest in the Fund, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Enbridge Services Inc, who hold 100% of the Class B
Exchangeable units in Waterheater Holding Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Fund.
(iii)
(i) Creditors (amounts due after more than one year) include bonds of C$500 million gross of issue costs of C$2 million.
The bonds bear a floating rate of interest and are repayable after four years. The bonds were issued by the Consumers’
Waterheater Operating Trust (the Trust), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund. The debt is secured solely on the assets
of the Fund and its subsidiaries, without recourse to the Centrica group.
(ii) As disclosed in note 30, on 22 January 2003 the Trust issued C$500m of bonds, the proceeds of which have been applied
to repay the bonds in place at 31 December 2002. The bonds carry interest at a fixed rate and an expected final repayment
date of between five and seven years. The issuer, guarantor and holders of this debt have acknowledged in writing that the
notes do not represent obligations (as to principal or interest) of any person other than the issuer and each of the guarantors.
Accordingly there is no recourse to the Centrica group.
(iii) Class B Exchangeable Units attract comparable voting rights to Units in the Fund, and are exchangeable into Units of the Fund.
The Class B units are held by Enbridge Services Inc, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Centrica group.
(iv) The goodwill balance eliminates on consolidation with the Centrica group. The summary financial information above has been
prepared under UK generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP). Class A units in the Fund are traded on the T oronto stock
exchange, and accordingly its full financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in Canada. Under Canadian GAAP
the Fund does not recognise a goodwill balance, and adjustments have been made under the purchase method of accounting, 
to allocate the excess consideration raised through the unit and debt offering to the fair value of the assets acquired by the Fund 
from Enbridge Services Inc.
(v) Creditors (amounts falling due within one year) include £11 million due to Enbridge Services Inc which eliminates
on consolidation with the group.

(i) Investments comprise £1 ,023 million (2001: £788 million) of investments in subsidiary undertakings, being shares in subsidiaries
of £222 million (2001: £222 million) and loans of £801 million (2001: £566 million), and own shares at cost of £51 million 
(2001 as restated: £65 million) to the Centrica Employees Share Trust.
(ii) An investment of £434 million was made during the year in Enbridge Services Inc. Following the establishment of the Consumers’
Waterheater Income Fund, a repayment of part of the original investment of £283 million was made (note 32). Additional
investments were also made in Centrica America Limited and Centrica Finance US Limited during the year.
(iii) The Centrica Employees Share Trust held 27 million (2001: 39 million) ordinary shares in the company. This represented 0.64%
of the called up ordinary share capital (2001: 1 %), which had a market value at 31 December 2002 of £47 million and a nominal
value of £2 million (2001: £88 million and £2 million respectively). During the year 12,213,398 shares were transferred from the
trust with respect to awards held by employees of the company and its subsidiaries.
(iv) In 2001 the company balance sheet showed the loan to the Centrica Employees Share Trust (£69 million) within fixed asset
investments. This year the balance sheet has been restated to reflect the substance of the arrangements with the trust, whereby
Centrica shares are held by the trust for the purpose of fulfilling awards to employees of Centrica plc and its subsidiaries under
the long term incentive scheme. The balance sheet of the trust has therefore been consolidated with that of the company. This
treatment is consistent with UITF 13 ESOP Trusts. £18 million of the amortisation carried forward has not been charged through
the profit and loss account, but is included in amounts owed by group undertakings in note 35, as it reflects amounts recoverable
from subsidiaries for awards due to their employees. At 31 December 2001, the amount owed by group undertakings relating 
to amortisation was £27 million, of which £16 million was due after more than one year. Debtors have been restated accordingly 
in note 35. Provisions have also been restated in note 39, reducing the 31 December 2001 balance by £13 million. Amounts
previously included within provisions related to long term incentive scheme costs for company employees. These have now been
included above within amortisation brought forward. The operation of the long term incentive scheme is described more fully in
the remuneration report on page 26.

Our strong brands, enhanced customer insight and
asset management expertise will continue to enable
us to create value for customers and shareholders.
Chairman’s statement
During 2002, Centrica continued to
make progress towards our vision
of ‘taking care of the essentials’ for
customers in our chosen markets.
We have done this by concentrating
on what our customers want. This
has led to top-line growth across
our business units and helped drive
adjusted earnings per share up
26% (before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation).
We took significant steps to
ensure that British Gas remains
the market leader in residential
energy and continues to improve
its performance in other home
services. The AA had a year
of solid performance as we
repositioned the AA brand to
increase awareness of the wide
range of products and services
available to motorists. Our North
American business has made
progress despite a challenging
regulatory environment.
Centrica remains
well placed
to compete in
an increasingly
international energy
marketplace where
we expect further
consolidation.
In the UK, the measures to
underpin a competitive energy
market enable us to continue
to deliver benefits to customers.
In the wider European context,
good progress was made
towards agreeing a framework 
for introducing competition
to the entire energy market.
In addition a number of important
improvements were made to the
competitive conditions in the UK
telecoms market but there is still
further work to be done.
Dividend
The board of directors is proposing
a final dividend of 2.6 pence per
share to be paid in June 2003.
When combined with the interim
dividend of 1 .4 pence per share
paid in November 2002, the
total dividend for 2002 would
be 4.0 pence per share. This
represents an increase of 29%
on the previous year and reflects
our positive medium term outlook
for both earnings and cash flow.
The board of directors
We announced a number of
changes to the board during the
year. Sir Sydney Lipworth retired
at the annual general meeting
in May and we are most grateful
for the significant contribution
he made to the development
of Centrica. In September we
announced the appointment
of Helen Alexander and in
October the appointment of
Robert T obin as non-executive
directors with effect from 
1 January 2003. I am delighted 
that Helen and Robert have joined
us. Their considerable experience
will further strengthen the board. 
Corporate responsibility
We recognise that creating
sustainable shareholder value
depends on a full understanding
of our impact on society and
the responsible management
of our business in a manner
consistent with our values
and principles. T o this end,
we established a corporate
responsibility committee 
which sets the framework for
developing and reporting our 
efforts in this area. Our approach
was recognised by our inclusion 
in the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones
Sustainability indices. 
We recognise
that creating
sustainable
shareholder value
depends on a
full understanding
of our impact
on society.
The future
Centrica remains well placed 
to compete in an increasingly
international energy marketplace
where we expect further
consolidation. Our strong brands,
enhanced customer insight and
asset management expertise,
combined with our financial and
operational scale, will continue
to enable us to create value for
customers and shareholders alike.
The collective efforts of all Centrica
employees have ensured that
we have made further progress
towards our vision during 2002. 
I would like to thank them for their
commitment and I look forward 
to working with them to deliver the
business performance, which will
provide our customers with the
service that they want and reward
our shareholders appropriately.

Business review 
We have a strong business with leading market positions and
I am confident that our strategy will continue to deliver value
for our shareholders.
During 2002 we have continued
to see strong overall financial
performance, in particular from
our core UK energy business,
where improvement in margins
and growth were accompanied
by new momentum in our services
to business customers and
expansion of our upstream energy
asset portfolio. Our AA roadside
and personal finance operations
continue to deliver solid underlying
profit growth and at Goldfish we
are developing a more focused
product range. Despite slow
regulatory progress in our UK
telecoms and North American
energy markets, we are expanding
in both businesses.
Turnover and profitability
Group turnover (excluding Accord
trading revenue) was £10 billion
in 2002, up 11% from the previous
year. Higher sales to our business
customers – through Centrica
Business Services – were
complemented by an increase
in residential electricity sales as
well as growth in North America,
the AA’s roadside and personal
finance businesses, home services
and One. T el. UK gas sales volumes
were lower, largely due to unusually
warm weather in the first and fourth
quarters of the year.
Customer service
We maintained our focus on
improving customer service across
all of our brands. We are now placing
greater importance on qualitative
and value-based measures which
are built into a scorecard evaluation
and reflected in the remuneration
of staff at all levels.
As a result of our focus on these
areas, we continue to be highly
rated by external agencies.
In particular, the AA won the
JD Power & Associates 2002 UK
Roadside Assistance Study award
for customer satisfaction for the
third time in five years. Further
accolades include Which?
magazine naming the AA as the
UK’s best motoring organisation,
and www.house.co.uk winning 
the 2002 Customer Management
National E-commerce Customer
Service Award.
Outlook
We are now moving from a period of
considerable investment in growth
opportunities and strategic market
entries, to a period of delivery from
these investments, underpinned
by new customer relationship
management (CRM) systems and
common processes for building
deeper customer relationships.
For British Gas, we expect
continuing recovery in residential
gas margins and further electricity
growth to improve profit, although
this will be partially offset by the
higher costs of the government’s
Energy Efficiency Commitment and
peak CRM system implementation
expenses through to 2004. We
expect the benefits from CRM to
drive further medium term growth
in British Gas operating margins.
The launch of Centrica Business
Services has resulted in increased
management focus on the
commercial energy market, and
on growing product portfolios.
We expect to increase market
share and profitability in the future.
We anticipate output from our
Morecambe Bay gas production
facilities to decline by around 10%
a year. However, this will be offset
over time by gas from other assets
we currently hold, or will acquire.
We expect the profitability of 
the AA to continue to improve, 
with expenditure on information
technology peaking in 2003. For
One. T el, we expect that regulatory
improvements will warrant renewed
investment in brand and product
marketing at the same time as
developing our growing mobile and
internet businesses. For Goldfish,
significant improvement to credit
card and loans contributions are
expected in 2003 and, with a more
focused rollout of new products,
breakeven will occur towards the
end of the year.
We are now moving
from a period of
considerable
investment
in growth
opportunities and
strategic market
entries, to a period
of delivery from
these investments.
North America continues to offer
significant opportunities, given our
focus on the marketing and service
elements of deregulated energy
supply. We continue to lobby to
maintain legal frameworks and
pricing controls, which allow
sufficient headroom to attract
new market entrants. We will
build the business through either
organic growth, or through the
acquisition of customers from
existing suppliers. The timing
for achievement of our broader
scale ambition in North America
will also depend upon the
availability and pace of key
acquisition opportunities.
Our strategy in continental Europe
is to build a significant customer
base in the medium term. Although
the pace of energy deregulation
varies across individual countries
the whole of the European Union
residential energy market is
expected to be open by mid 2007.
We are focusing on those countries
where markets are opening more
quickly and regulatory and political
conditions are more favourable.
Employees
Our employees are central to the
delivery of our strategy and we
need to continue to attract and
retain high quality, highly motivated
people. I am committed to making
Centrica an employer of choice
and the recent accreditation of
our AA brand unit as ‘Investors
in People’ is just one indication
that we are developing the highest
standards of employment policies
and practices. Increased scores
in our satisfaction survey in 2002
demonstrate that our employees
share our vision and are committed
to delivering our strategy. I would
like to join the chairman in thanking
them all for their ongoing and
valued commitment.
Conclusion
T o sum up, we have a strong
business with leading market
positions. Our core businesses
are growing and are strongly 
cash generative and our investment
in new businesses is proceeding
as market opportunities emerge.
I am confident therefore that our
strategy will continue to deliver
value for shareholders.

Centrica plc review 2002 05
During the year our share of residential
energy customers has remained steady
at 40% of the total market. Customer
losses reflect a longer term trend of
stabilising market share and the rate
at which people are switching suppliers
has shown signs of slowing down. While
we expect the result of this reduced
industry churn to be slower growth in our
residential electricity customer base than
we had previously anticipated, reduced
customer acquisition expenses should
contribute to better electricity profits.
Against this background of lower industry
churn, we have still managed to grow
our electricity customer numbers by 8%.
Our market share for residential gas
at the end of the year was around 64%.
In residential electricity we estimate
our market share at year end was 22%.
We believe selling practices across
the energy industry must continue
to improve and we have taken a leading
role in developing a new code of sales
practice, and in removing commission-
only sales agents.
losses in communications.
Some of this improvement
was due to a reversal
of the over-recovery of
transportation payments to
pipeline operator Transco
made in the previous year.
During 2002 we integrated
our energy and home
services activities to give us a
greater understanding of our
customers, and to increase
revenue and operational
efficiencies. We are now
well placed to offer a wide
range of reliable products
and services with the aim 
of becoming Britain’s
leading home services
provider. We are making
major investments to
enhance the quality of
service we provide to
customers. Investing in
our staff helps us build
durable relationships with
our customers, so we are
increasing the number of
engineers and building
up skills and expertise. Our
operations will benefit from
our investment in customer
relationship management

leading to improved service
levels and lower costs.

The AA
Centrica Business Services focuses on the needs of small and medium
sized enterprises.
The underlying profitability of the AA’s 
core roadside and personal finance
businesses continued to grow in 2002.
Key to this growth was the investment
in the ‘Just AAsk’ campaign to reposition
the AA brand. As a result of the campaign
product awareness increased from 33%
to 43%. This repositioning of the brand
supports the AA’s continued drive towards
providing end-to-end motoring services
to members and cross-sales across the
whole product range.
TheAA.com website, which provides
an easy way to buy AA products online,
attracted 21 million visitors and supplied
16 million route maps in 2002. Judged
the most popular UK motoring related
site in 2002, it also won a national

The AA continues to act as the independent
voice of the motorist. Highlights included
February’s launch of EuroRAP , a system to give
a safety star rating to Europe’s roads, and the
Chancellor’s budget commitment not to make
any further fuel tax increases.
AA roadside services
Membership numbers grew during the year , with our
share of the personal and business market rising
to 31 %. Customer satisfaction levels were also up
two points at 68%. The AA won the JD Power &
Associates UK Roadside Assistance Study award for
customer satisfaction and was named the UK’ s best
motoring organisation in a Which? magazine survey .
We continued to invest in new patrol vehicles,
route guidance technology and management
systems, and AA patrols received the first of their
new all weather diagnostic computers, helping
them to fix more faults at the roadside. This system
is being rolled out to all our 3,600 patrols in 2003.
Our AA training college trained 125 new patrols as
well as Service Centre technicians during the year .
AA personal finance
More than 70,000 car and personal loans were
taken out during 2002, with product awareness

Centrica
Business Services
Centrica Business Services has become the leading
supplier of energy to the UK commercial sector during 
the year with 27% of the market (measured by share 
of supply points). This amounts to 51% of the gas 
market and 20% of the electricity market.
We set out to maintain our position in the gas market,
keeping our focus on customer service and value, 
rather than aggressively acquiring market share. 
We completed the integration of Enron Direct, which we
acquired at the end of 2000, and expanded the business
with the acquisition of Electricity Direct. These acquisitions
and better targeted organic growth have led to a 39%
increase in average electricity consumption per customer.
T owards the end of the year we added to our range 
of services by launching a telecoms product under
the One. T el brand.
We now have interests in four
power stations across the country. Centrica plc review 2002 07

Gas production
Upstream gas profits fell in line with the reduction in wholesale
prices. During the year, a number of transactions were concluded
in line with our strategy of increasing gas equity ownership beyond
the Morecambe fields. Centrica customers will benefit from an
estimated 135 billion cubic feet (1.3 billion therms) of additional
gas acquired. Production volumes represented 27% of our
downstream demand in 2002.
Storage
In November, Centrica acquired the Rough gas
storage facilities in the North Sea. During the
period of Centrica’s ownership, turnover was 
£9 million with an operating profit of £1 million.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has
to decide whether to clear the acquisition, refer
it to the Competition Commission for further
investigation or accept undertakings in lieu of
a reference.
Industrial sales and wholesaling
Sales volumes were down by 8% against 2001,
but profits rose due to better gross margins
and a one-off profit on the termination of
a European gas supply contract.
Electricity generation
Our interests in four power stations and in
the entire output of Spalding power station
when it comes onstream will give us a peak
capacity of 2.6 gigawatts by the end of 2004.
Production volumes in 2002 rose 160% to 7 ,662
gigawatt hours due partly to the acquisition of
the Glanford Brigg power station. Our stations
provided 22% of our annual downstream
demand and 20% of peak requirements.
Accord Energy
Our Accord trading business continued to support
our energy procurement strategy. The business
broke even despite the highly volatile trading
environment in 2002, including problems caused
by the unplanned shutdown of the continental
European interconnector and the highly
publicised difficulties of other energy companies.
increased by the ‘Just AAsk’ campaign. We had
more than 117,000 fixed term personal loans at
the end of the year, up 40,000 from the previous
year. Our advertising emphasised the benefit of
getting ‘car loans from car people’.
Our volume of insurance policies grew, and
the customer renewal rate rose to 78%. We
launched a motor insurance policy especially for
members, which takes breakdown history into
account as a key factor in setting the premium.
This policy achieved 6,000 sales in the first year.
The number of customers taking out our parts
and labour policy for vehicle repair
expanded to 130,000.
Other AA services
Our 129 garages – acquired from Halfords in
2001 – were rebranded AA Service Centres
during the year, increasing our presence in
towns and cities across the country. Our
purchase of T yreserve provided a further
step to providing a complete motoring
service, and as a result our customers 
now have access to more than 3,000 
AA approved fixed and mobile tyre centres.
In the Republic of Ireland, the AA continued
to grow and remained the leading provider
of roadside assistance and personal
insurance services.
Publishing, car data check, the driving school
and road signs all did well during the year.
The ‘JustAAsk’ campaign launched in May has helped
broaden awareness of the AA product range.

Goldfish Bank continues 
to make progress, and
during the year we
concentrated on building
awareness of Goldfish
as a financial services
provider, rather than
simply a credit card.
Spontaneous awareness,
which doubled to 12% by
the end of the year, placed
us towards the top end of
the new banking brands.
The number of cards in
force rose 6% to 1.08 million
with 77,000 new accounts
opened during the year. The
average monthly spend on
the Goldfish card increased
by 14% against 2001 , making
it among the highest in the
UK market. In the second
half we started offering
personal loans, attracting
high quality applicants with
a flexible product and no
redemption penalties. 
We attracted 11,000
applicants for our new
internet savings account –
half of them from new
Goldfish customers.
In November we transferred
our customers across to a
new customer services

complex process involving

During the year we saw a 23% increase in customers. Our

We invested in new products – particularly mobile – and
in raising awareness of One. T el as a full telephone, mobile

With the introduction of a new industry process for carrier

Attractive pricing and greater retail distribution contributed
to very encouraging mobile sales of more than 35,000

We continue to look for opportunities to
take over customers from companies who
want to leave the retail market. In December
we agreed to purchase A TCO’s retail energy
business in Alberta subject to legislative
changes and regulatory consents. This will
give us about 820,000 gas and 160,000
electricity customers and provides a good
starting point for introducing the benefits of
unregulated energy and services packages.
Home and business
services
We bought Enbridge Services Inc for
£438 million in May 2002, but raised more
than £300 million by selling some of our
interests in the waterheater assets that
came as part of the deal. However, we have
retained relationships with around 1.3 million
households as the exclusive provider of their
waterheater installation and maintenance.
In Ontario we are a leading installer of
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
(HVAC) and some 330,000 households
have contracted with us for HVAC
maintenance and protection plans.
Upstream gas
We continue developing our gas fields
in Alberta, which supplied us with 24%
of our sales to North American customers.
Retail energy
We are the leading supplier of energy 
in Ontario, marketing under the Direct 
Energy brand, and in May we entered the
province’s electricity market, successfully
converting around 500,000 pre-signed
contracts on to supply on day one. In
August, we acquired a further 212,000
customers in Michigan, Ohio
and Pennsylvania from the NewPower
Company. We also entered the energy
markets in T exas and by the end of the
year we were serving 890,000 retail energy
customers across the state.
The pace of organic growth in North
America slowed in 2002 owing to a
combination of legislative delays, political
pressures and large wholesale price
swings. However, we continue to lobby
in support of market liberalisation, and
we believe momentum will pick up again.
In November, the Ontario government
decided to cap residential and small
business prices below the market rate,
effectively suspending competition until
2006. We are paid the difference between
the capped and market prices as a subsidy
which is protected until 2006. Further
organic growth is unlikely until the subsidy
expires so in the meantime we will focus
on maximising sales to our customer
base across the full range of gas and
home services products.

goodwill amortisation, up by
£35 million to £123 million.
Earnings before exceptional
charges and goodwill
amortisation were up 32% to
£636 million. This represents
a return on capital employed
over the year of 32% or 7.9% on
our average market capitalisation.
Basic earnings per share, grew
from 8.1 pence to 11.4 pence and
adjusted earnings per share from
12.1 pence to 15.2 pence. Over
the last three years the adjusted
performance measure has grown
by an average compound growth
rate of 24%.
Exceptional charges and
goodwill amortisation
During the year, non operating
exceptional charges arose
of £26 million, net of tax
(2001: £71 million operating
exceptionals net of tax).
These related to changes
in our Golf England operation
and disposal of our LPG
cylinder business. In addition,
a £9 million (2001: £ nil)
exceptional tax charge arose
(see T axation below). The
goodwill amortisation charge
for the year was £123 million
(2001: £88 million), in line
with our programme of
continuing acquisitions.
Net interest
Net interest charged to the
profit and loss account was
£62 million compared with
£43 million in 2001 and was
covered 15 times by operating
profit* compared with 16 times
a year earlier. The increase in
interest payable was due to
higher average indebtedness
mainly as a result of acquisitions,
offset by lower interest rates and
the net proceeds of the share
placement during the year. 
We aim to grow our earnings
and cash flow within a prudent
risk management framework.
During the year our share price out
performed the FTSE 100 by 3.1%
and since demerger in February
1997 to the end of 2002 we
out performed the index by 187%.
Centrica’s aim is to achieve a
total shareholder return (TSR)
ranking in the first quartile of UK
FTSE 100 companies, taking
account of share price growth
and dividends received and
reinvested over a sustained
period. Centrica promotes
continuing growth in earnings
and cash flow and seeks to
maximise the return on capital
it achieves within a prudent risk
management framework.
The company’s closing share
price on 31 December 2002
was 171 pence (31 December
2001: 222 pence), resulting
in a market capitalisation of
£7.3 billion (2001: £8.9 billion).
World stock markets continued
to fall in 2002, the FTSE 100
index dropping by 24.5%.
The company’s share price still 
out performed the FTSE 100
by 3.1% (2001: 2.1%) and since
demerger we have out performed
the index by 187%.
Earnings
Operating profit* was £932 million
(2001: £679 million). Most of the
improvement came from our 
UK residential gas supply 
business, and growth in our
business services and home
services operations. 
Earnings increased by £155 million
to £478 million in 2002. This
reflected improved operating
profits* up £253 million and
lower exceptional charges offset
by taxation up from £155 million
to £250 million and higher
Taxation
The ongoing taxation charge of
£243 million for 2002 represents
a 28% rate on profits adjusted
for goodwill amortisation and
exceptionals (2001 comparative
rate: 26%). The increase in the
effective rate is principally due
to the introduction of a 10%
corporation tax surcharge on
UK offshore gas production,
with effect from 17 April 2002.
This surcharge increased the
tax charge for the year by
£12 million and resulted in a
restatement of the deferred
tax liability of £9 million,
which has been treated as
exceptional. The overall charge
is still less than the UK 30%
statutory rate, primarily because
previously unrecognised deferred
tax assets have been utilised 
during 2002.
Cash flow
Group operating cash flow
(including dividends from
joint ventures and associates,
from continuing operations
before exceptional payments)
was £790 million for 2002,
compared with £885 million
in 2001. An increase of £299 million
in operating profit* before
depreciation and amortisation 
of investments was more than
offset by changes in working
capital, including growth in
trade debtors, the timing of
gas transportation payments,
petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and
gas production royalty payments.
T otal capital expenditure was
£449 million this year, up from
£312 million in 2001. This
includes £180 million of costs
capitalised for information
systems investments associated
with our new customer relationship
management (CRM) infrastructure.
Acquisition expenditures (net of
cash and overdrafts acquired)
were £989 million in 2002
(2001: £1,204 million), consisting
primarily of our purchases of the
Brigg power station and Rough
gas storage facilities in the UK,
Enbridge Services Inc in Canada
and WTU Retail Energy LP and
CPL Retail Energy LP in the US.
The group’s net cash outflow before
liquid resources and financing was,
as a result, £918 million, against a
net outflow of £342 million in 2001.
Balance sheet
The net assets of the group
increased during the year from
£1,536 million to £2,402 million. 
Net debt (excluding the Goldfish
Bank facility of £430 million and
the £196 million of non-recourse
debt raised on the water heater
assets acquired with Enbridge
Services Inc) increased to
£529 million at 31 December 2002
from £433 million at the previous
year end.

Summary reports
Independent auditors’ statement to the members 
of Centrica plc
We have examined the summary financial statement of Centrica plc.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual review and summary
financial statement in accordance with applicable law. Our responsibility
is to report to you our opinion on the consistency of the summary financial
statement with the annual financial statement, directors’ report and
the directors’ remuneration report and its compliance with the relevant
requirements of section 251 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985
and the regulations made thereunder. We also read the other information
contained in the annual review and summary financial statement and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
summary financial statement.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for
the company’s members as a body in accordance with section 251 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our work in accordance with Bulletin 1999/6, ‘The auditors’
statement on the summary financial statement’ issued by the Auditing
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.
Opinion
In our opinion the summary financial statement is consistent with the
annual financial statements, the directors’ report and the directors’
remuneration report of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2002
and complies with the applicable requirements of section 251 of the
Companies Act 1985, and the regulations made thereunder.
The maintenance and integrity of the Centrica plc website is the
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the
financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Full report and accounts
This summary financial statement is a summary of the information contained

Details of how the company applies the principles of the Code are set out
in the report on corporate governance in the full report and accounts

committees. Directors’ membership of these committees is shown
on page 17.

Summary remuneration report
This is a summary of the full remuneration report, which is contained in the
2002 annual report, copies of which are available from the Centrica website
at www.centrica.com or the Centrica shareholder helpline (see page 16
for contact details).
Composition and role of the remuneration committee
The board has established a remuneration committee, which is chaired 
by Patricia Mann. The other members of the committee in 2002 were 
Roger Carr, Sir Sydney Lipworth (until his retirement on 13 May 2002), 
Sir Michael Perry and Sir Brian Shaw. Helen Alexander and Robert T obin
became members of the committee when they joined the board on
1 January 2003. All of the members of the committee are independent 
non-executive directors.
The committee makes recommendations to the board, within
formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework of executive
remuneration and its cost to the company. The committee is also
responsible for the implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages for each of the
executive directors. The committee has access to advice
provided by the group head of reward (Mike New), the group
human resources director (Anne Minto), the company secretary
(Grant Dawson), the chief executive (Sir Roy Gardner) and external
consultants (T owers Perrin). Centrica plc review 2002 15
Summary remuneration report continued
Framework and policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The group’ s remuneration policy is designed to provide competitive
rewards for its executive directors and other senior executives, taking
into account the company’ s performance, the markets in which the
group operates, and pay and conditions elsewhere in the group.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the committee aims to
achieve a balance between fixed and variable compensation for each
director . Accordingly, a significant proportion of the remuneration
package depends on the attainment of demanding performance
objectives, both short and long term. In agreeing the level of base
salaries and the annual performance bonus scheme, the committee
takes into consideration the total remuneration that executives could
receive. The committee reviews the packages and varies individual
elements when appropriate from year to year . It is intended that the
current remuneration policy, which has previously been approved
by shareholders, will continue for 2003 and succeeding years.
Components of remuneration
The components of remuneration for each executive director
include a base salary and an annual performance bonus. In
addition, an annual grant of options is made under the executive
share option scheme (ESOS) and an allocation of shares is made
under the long term incentive scheme (LTIS), both of which are
subject to performance conditions. The performance conditions
for LTIS awards are based on the company’s total shareholder
return (TSR) relative to the returns of FTSE 100 companies over
the performance period. The performance conditions for the
ESOS are based on the extent to which growth in the company’s
earnings per share exceeds growth in the Retail Price Index.
The following table shows graphs of the company’s TSR
performance against that of the FTSE 100 index.
Executive directors are entitled to a range of other employment
benefits, including contributory, final salary pension and company
car. They are also eligible on the same basis as other employees
to participate in the company’s all-employee share schemes.

in March, in time for your self-assessment tax return.
Arranging your dividend payment in this way also helps Centrica improve
its efficiency by reducing postage and cheque clearance costs. If you wish

a direct dividend payment form. The form is also available to download
from our website.

IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
OUR BUSINESS
RESPONSE TO THE DOWNTURN
From late September 2008 there has been a rapid and significant weakening of the Group’s main end-markets, reflecting
the severe global economic downturn.
In response, the following management actions have been initiated:
WELL POSITIONED FOR WHEN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY RECOVERS
Longer-term we believe the Group is well positioned, with a portfolio of businesses supplying high-technology consumable
products with leading positions in markets with sound prospects for growth as the global economy recovers.
COOKSON’S BOARD AND EXECUTIVES MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, REPORTED ON A PERIODIC BASIS, TO MEASURE THE GROUP’S
PERFORMANCE OVER TIME
The Group’s financial key performance indicators (“KPIs”) are more fully defined in note 3.22 to the consolidated financial
statements. Performance data in relation to the KPIs for 2008 and the prior year are discussed in more detail in the Operating
Review, in the Financial Review and in the Health, Safety and Environmental Statement. Targets are set annually for these
performance indicators through the Group’s annual budgeting process, in line with the Group’s strategic objectives.
Non-Financial KPIs Purpose 2008 performance vs 2007
Rate of injuries and illness
resulting in absence from work
Measured to monitor progress towards the
Group’s goal of zero work-related injuries
and illness
• Rate of injuries and illness resulting in
absence from work at 1.4% compared
with 1.5% in 2007
Research and development
(“R&D”) spend
Monitored to ensure that adequate resources
are being invested to maintain the Group’s
strong pipeline of new products and services
• R&D spend: £30.7m vs £23.1m in 2007
Total energy consumption Measured as part of the Group’s programme
to reduce energy usage and the associated
carbon emissions
• Energy usage in manufacturing operations,
excluding Foseco, for which comparative
information is unavailable
Gas use down 3.4%
Electricity use down 6.7%
Financial KPIs Purpose 2008 performance vs 2007
Underlying revenue growth Provides an important indicator of organic
or “like-for-like” growth of Group businesses
between reporting periods. This measure
eliminates the impact of exchange rates,
metal prices, acquisitions, disposals and
significant business closures. It is calculated
using revenue for the Ceramics and
Electronics divisions and net sales value
for the Precious Metals division
• Underlying revenue growth:
Ceramics +4%
Electronics (9)%
Precious Metals (2)%
Trading profit, return on sales
(“RoS”) and return on net
sales value (“RoNSV”)
Used to assess the underlying trading
performance of Group businesses
• Group trading profit from continuing
operations of £216.3m, up 28%
• RoS (at constant currency):
Ceramics 13.3%, down 1.1 pts
Electronics 8.3%, down 2.3 pts
• RoNSV (at constant currency):
Precious Metals 3.8%, down 6.6 pts
Headline profit before tax
(“PBT”) and headline earnings
per share (“EPS”)
Both used to assess the underlying financial
performance of the Group as a whole
• Headline PBT: £176.2m, up 18%
• Headline EPS: 8.9p, up 9%
Free cash flow and average
working capital to sales ratio
Free cash flow is used to assess the
underlying cash-generation of the Group.
One of the factors driving the generation of
free cash flow is the average working capital
to sales ratio, which indicates the level of
working capital used in the business
• Free cash flow: £73.1m, up £25.5m
• Average working capital to sales of 24.2%
(2007: 23.0%)
Return on net assets
(“RONA”) and return on
investment (“ROI”)
Both used to assess the profitability
achieved from the Group’s asset base
• Group ROI: 8.2% down 1.6 pts
• Divisional RONA:
Ceramics 34.5%, down 5.1 pts
Electronics 26.6%, down 13.4 pts
Precious Metals 5.9%, down 8.0 pts
Interest cover and net debt
to EBITDA
Both used to assess the financial position
of the Group and its ability to fund future
growth
• Interest cover 7.6 times (2007: 12.0 times)
• Net debt to EBITDA 2.6 times (2007:
0.3 times)

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OUR BUSINESS
The past year has seen the most dramatic changes in the
global economy and in our end-markets in living memory.
Over the first nine months of 2008, our main end-markets
– of steel production, electronics and automotive – continued
to see reasonable growth and the Group’s trading results in
the period showed a strong improvement over 2007 .
In April, we completed the strategically significant
acquisition of Foseco, a ceramics business operating in the
foundry castings market which represents an excellent
complement to our existing ceramics business, Vesuvius.
Foseco’s results exceeded our expectations in 2008 and the
integration is proceeding very well.
As the global financial crisis spread to affect the broader
global economy, our end-markets and trading performance
deteriorated rapidly through the last quarter. By December,
activity levels in our main end-markets showed an
unprecedented decline of some one quarter on 2007 levels.
Many steel producers, electronics and automotive
manufacturers announced prolonged production shutdowns
through December and into the first quarter of 2009.
Financial performance
Notwithstanding this sharp deterioration in the fourth
quarter, our results for the year as a whole were an
improvement over 2007 . Trading profit (at constant exchange
rates) increased 11%, with the benefit of nine months’
contribution from Foseco. Headline profit before tax increased
18% to £176 million and headline earnings per share
improved 9% to 8.9 pence (as restated for the rights issue).
Looking to 2009, we expect to see little to no
improvement in market conditions through the first quarter
and then, hopefully, a slow improvement through the second
quarter and into the second half of the year. This is a view
shared by almost all commentators on the global steel
industry, to which over 40% of Group trading profit is linked.
We hope to see the improving trend continuing in 2010, as
the various governmental economic stimulus initiatives take
effect, but we do not expect end-markets to recover to levels
equivalent to the first nine months of 2008 until 2011 at the
earliest.
Against this background, we have moved quickly and
decisively to reduce our cost base to adapt to the lower level
of prevailing economic activity, and to strengthen our
financial position in order to create a capital structure more
suited to the current environment.
Management action
Starting last September and continuing into the current year ,
we have implemented a series of actions aimed at reducing
costs and further improving cash and working capital
management. These are described more fully in the Chief
Executive’s Review. I regret that substantial job losses are an
unavoidable consequence of the restructuring actions, but it
is essential that we act swiftly to adapt to the current global
economic reality.
Rights issue
On 29 January 2009, we announced a fully underwritten
12 for 1 rights issue to raise £241 million, net of expenses.
Shareholder approval was obtained at an Extraordinary
General Meeting held on 17 February and dealings in the new
shares commenced on 5 March.
We have been very pleased by the support shown by
shareholders for this initiative. By raising these funds at an
early stage we have not only enhanced the covenant and
longer-term liquidity headroom under our existing attractive
bank facilities, but we have also created a position of greater
strength and flexibility from which to move forward.
Dividend and dividend policy
Against this background and in the expectation of continued
challenging trading conditions, the Board has reviewed
its near-term dividend policy and has decided not to
recommend a final dividend payment in respect of 2008 (an
interim dividend of 0.88 pence per share (as restated for the
rights issue) was paid in October 2008). A decision to resume
dividend payments will be made once we can see a clear
recovery in our end-markets and trading performance, and in
the context of the Group’s cash requirements at that time.
Board and corporate governance
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s strategy
and monitoring its performance. Through its own actions and
those of the Board committees, the Board continues to
comply with the highest standards of corporate governance.
Both the Board and the Executive Committee have
remained unchanged since my last report. I am confident
that this continuity, together with the blend of skills and
experience that the team brings to the Group, has played and
will play an important part in our successful navigation of the
current challenging economic environment.
Employees
I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of our employees
worldwide for their contribution over the past year, in the
face of often very difficult circumstances. More than ever,
their delivery of the highest standards of customer service
remains a key factor in the Group’s success.
Outlook
In recent months we have experienced an unprecedented
downturn in our end-markets, to which we have responded
promptly and decisively. This downturn, and the dramatic
deterioration of the overall economic environment, has
inevitably had a significant impact on our share price and we
are resolutely focused on the need to rebuild shareholder
value over time. We remain a strong business with excellent
positions in markets with good, fundamental, long-term
growth prospects and I am confident that we will be ready to
benefit from the economic recovery when it comes.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2008 Results
The results for 2008 reflect two very different periods of
trading. Over the first nine months we experienced continuing
growth in our main end-markets of steel, consumer
electronics and automotive. However, from late September
we saw a rapid and significant weakening, reflecting the
severe global economic downturn. As a result, we achieved a
return on sales margin of 10.7% over the first nine months
but this fell to 7.3% for the last quarter of the year.
Despite the weak fourth quarter, the full year results
showed a significant improvement over 2007. Revenue of
£2,203 million and trading profit of £216.3 million increased
23% and 11% respectively at constant exchange rates,
reflecting both the contribution from Foseco following its
acquisition in April 2008 and also the positive impact on
revenue of passing through higher metal prices. The
weakening of sterling had a significant positive impact such
that on an ‘as reported’ basis, revenue and trading profit
increased 36% and 28% respectively. Headline profit before
tax increased by 18% and headline earnings per share by 9%.
Net debt at 31 December 2008 was £732 million with a
net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times (as calculated for bank
covenant purposes).
Response to the economic downturn
We have reacted quickly to the economic downturn,
implementing a series of cost reduction and cash conservation
measures, and raising £241 million of net proceeds via a
rights issue announced in January 2009. These proceeds
have reduced our indebtedness and created a more suitable
capital structure for the current economic environment.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the
first phase of cost reductions to yield annualised savings of
£17 million from early 2009 onwards. This included reducing
temporary and full-time headcount by a combined total of
600 and implementing an extensive salary freeze for the first
half of 2009.
In January, we launched a second phase involving the
proposed permanent closure of six Ceramics manufacturing
facilities in the UK, Mexico, Belgium, Germany and the US,
together with overhead staff reductions. These measures will
result in a further total headcount reduction of over 750 and
are expected to result in annualised savings of £23 million
from mid-2009. Of the total annualised savings of £40
million arising from both phases, £30 million is anticipated
to be realised in 2009 and an incremental £10 million in 2010.
We have also introduced a new Group-wide incentive
programme to focus on cash generation with particular
emphasis on reducing working capital in line with reduced
business volumes. Further, all capacity expansion related
capital expenditure projects have been postponed, pending
clear signs of recovery in our end-markets. Similarly, the
payment of dividends is being suspended for the time being.
More recently we have agreed with our banks to pre-pay
the facility tranches originally due to be repaid next year in
exchange for which the tightening of the net debt to EBITDA
covenant from 3.5 times to 3.0 times has been deferred by a
further year to 30 June 2010. We have also agreed with our
UK pension trustee to suspend the monthly ‘top-up’
payments, which totalled £22 million in 2008, until the
earlier of July 2010 or the recommencement of dividend
payments.
Foseco
The acquisition of Foseco significantly expanded the existing
Ceramics division and brought together the two largest
worldwide specialists in ceramics for molten metal handling.
Following the completion of the acquisition on 4 April
2008 we promptly sold Foseco’s Carbon Bonded Ceramics
(“CBC”) business to satisfy regulatory requirements, and
closed its “plc” headquarters. Anti-trust requirements were
finally met with the disposal of Vesuvius’ Hi-Tech ceramic
filters business in December 2008. The integration has
progressed very well and further potential synergy
opportunities have been identified such that we have
increased the annual synergy savings target from the
original £18 million to £24 million by 2010.
During 2008, the Foseco businesses have performed well
ahead of our original expectations. On a pro-forma basis
(excluding CBC and “plc” costs) for the full year 2008 they
delivered revenue of £488 million and trading profit of £72.0
million, up by 18% and 24% respectively at reported
exchange rates over full year 2007, despite a slowdown over
the last two months of 2008.
Ceramics division
The enlarged division, which trades as Foseco in foundry
markets and as Vesuvius in all other markets, recorded
revenue of £1,265 million and trading profit of £167.7 million,
giving a return on sales margin of 13.3%. Excluding the
contribution from Foseco, underlying revenue was up 4% for
the year as a whole, having been 8% ahead at the half year,
but trading profit was down 8% for the year on a constant
currency basis, reflecting the fourth quarter performance.
Including Foseco, the fourth quarter revenue was £326
million and trading profit £34.1 million, giving a return on
sales margin for the fourth quarter of 10.5%.
Global steel production, our main end-market, when
compared to the same periods in 2007 grew 5% in the first
nine months but then fell 14% in October, 20% in November
and 24% in December. The pattern in the foundry markets
was similar but the slowdown only started in November. Our
fused silica, Solar Crucible™, market continued to experience
strong growth. Against this background, revenue and
underlying growth for the four product lines was as follows
(at constant exchange rates and including Foseco pro-forma
on a full year basis); Steel Flow Control £430 million, +1%,
Linings £433 million, +5%, Foundry £457 million, +6% and
Fused Silica £72 million, +20%.
Electronics division
The division’s revenue of £620 million was up 11% at reported
exchange rates but, at constant exchange rates and eliminating
the ‘pass through’ of increased metal prices, underlying
revenue was down 9%. Trading profit of £51.7 million was
down 11% at reported exchange rates and 22% at constant
exchange rates. This again reflects a very poor fourth
quarter, in which revenue was £135 million and trading profit
£6.6 million, giving a return on sales margin of 4.9%.
Revenue for the Assembly Materials product line was £382
million and for the Chemistry product line was £238 million,
down 10% and 9% respectively on an underlying basis.
Chemistry had a particularly weak fourth quarter reflecting its
exposure to the automotive as well as electronics end-markets.
Precious Metals division
Net sales value of £118 million was 3% higher than the prior
year at constant exchange rates. This reflected higher levels
of reclaim activity in Europe and gold coin blank production
in the US, both stimulated by the high price of gold, together
with the additional volumes from the Leach & Garner
business acquired in September 2007, offsetting the sharp
decline in consumer demand for retail jewellery.
Trading profit of £4.5 million was approximately half that
of the prior year reflecting a lower margin product mix in the
US, particularly much reduced gold chain sales.
Outlook
Cookson’s divisions predominantly supply consumable
products, on short lead times, to the global steel, foundry,
electronics and precious metals industries. As such, the
Group’s expectations of future trading are based upon an
assessment of end-market conditions and these conditions
are subject to greater uncertainty than usual in the current
economic climate.
As predicted, our major markets have remained weak
through January and February. We expect a slow improvement
through the second quarter as the de-stocking in our
end-markets comes to an end. Further improvements are
expected in the second half reflecting the Group’s normal
trading seasonality and supported by the anticipated boost
to infrastructure demand from the stimulus packages
recently announced by governments around the world.
Actual trading performance will depend on the depth and
duration of the global economic downturn. Despite the difficult
trading conditions, our performance in 2009 will benefit from:
• anticipated cost savings of £30 million arising from the
cost reduction actions described above;
• a full year contribution from Foseco (versus only nine
months in 2008); and
• the realisation of further Foseco related integration
synergies, anticipated to be £12 million in 2009.
The reported results will also benefit from significant
currency translation gains if sterling remains at current
levels relative to other major currencies.
For the longer-term we believe that Cookson is well
positioned, with a portfolio of businesses supplying high-
technology consumable products and related technical
services, with leading positions in markets with sound
prospects for growth as the global economy recovers.

OPERATING REVIEW
OUR BUSINESS
Trading profit increased significantly to £216.3 million, an increase of 11% at constant exchange rates and
28% at reported exchange rates. The increase in trading profit (at constant exchange rates) reflected a
contribution of £52.8 million from Foseco, more than offsetting underlying trading profit reductions in all
three divisions arising due to the fourth quarter market deterioration. Excluding Foseco, trading profit (at
constant exchange rates) for the Group was down by 16%, with Ceramics (excluding Foseco) down by 8%,
Electronics down by 22% and Precious Metals down by 59%.
The return on sales margin in 2008 decreased to 9.8% from 10.5% for 2007 (at reported exchange
rates), reflecting the fourth quarter deterioration. The impact of higher metal prices, which increased
reported revenue in the Electronics and Precious Metals divisions without any impact on profitability,
depressed the return on sales margin in 2008 by around 0.3 percentage points compared to last year.
Headline profit before tax increased by 18% and headline earnings per share were up 9% to 8.9 pence,
reflecting an 8% increase in the weighted average number of shares as a result of the October 2007 share
placing associated with the acquisition of Foseco. The headline earnings per share number reflects an
adjustment to reflect the impact of the rights issue completed subsequent to year-end on 4 March 2009.
Prior to the effect of this adjustment, headline earnings per share were 58.8 pence.
Following the acquisition of Foseco, net debt at 31 December 2008 increased to £732 million with a pro-
forma net debt to EBITDA ratio (as calculated for bank covenant purposes) of 2.6 times. On 4 March 2009,
the Group completed a successful rights issue which raised cash proceeds of £241 million, net of expenses.

The acquisition of Foseco was completed on 4 April 2008 for around £620 million in cash and assumed
debt. The acquisition was financed by the combination of the net proceeds of £151 million from a share
placing on 11 October 2007 and a new bank facility. To satisfy the EU and US competition authorities’
requirements, Foseco’s Carbon Bonded Ceramics (“CBC”) business was sold to RHI AG on 16 April 2008 and
Cookson’s Hi-Tech ceramic filters business (“Hi-Tech”) was sold to Süd-Chemie AG on 23 December 2008.
The retained Foseco businesses are now managed within Cookson’s Ceramics division. Foseco’s “plc”
headquarters have been closed and the global integration process is proceeding well, with integration
benefits to be realised by 2010 now expected to be £24 million per annum (of which £10 million has been
realised in 2008), against a target of £18 million per annum at the time of announcing the acquisition.
The retained Foseco businesses traded strongly in the first ten months of 2008 (of which seven months
are included in Cookson’s results) and well ahead of our original expectations. However, their trading was
negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions in the last two months of the year. On a pro-
forma basis (excluding CBC and “plc” costs), for the twelve months of 2008, Foseco reported revenue of
£488 million and trading profit of £72.0 million, up by 18% and 24% respectively at reported exchange
rates compared with 2007.
Foseco’s operations have now been integrated into three of the four product lines within the Ceramics
division. Foseco’s ‘Foundry’ division now constitutes the majority of the Foundry product line, whilst the
activities of Foseco’s ‘Steel’ division are now included in the Steel Flow Control and Linings product lines.
For the first nine months of 2008, the Group’s businesses generally performed well. During this period, the
Ceramics division showed significant growth, including a better than expected contribution from recently-
acquired Foseco, the Electronics division maintained its performance at 2007 levels and the Precious Metals
division remained profitable. However, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Group experienced a rapid and
significant softening in its principal end-markets, including an unprecedented reduction in global steel
production, combined with weaker automotive and consumer electronics markets. Despite prompt and
decisive action to reduce the Group’s cost base, this downturn had a significant negative impact on trading
results in the fourth quarter and, consequently, for the year as a whole.
Group revenue in 2008 of £2,203 million was 23% ahead of 2007 at constant exchange rates and up
36% at reported exchange rates. The increase in revenue at constant exchange rates principally reflected
the acquisition of Foseco on 4 April 2008 and the impact of higher metal prices being ‘passed through’ to
customers in the Electronics and Precious Metals divisions. Once these factors are excluded, underlying
revenue in 2008 decreased marginally by 2% compared to last year (at constant exchange rates). Revenue
for the Group is well balanced geographically with 41% coming from the Group’s operations in Europe, 27%
from NAFTA and 25% from Asia-Pacific.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
OUR BUSINESS
The principal products in Vesuvius’ Fused Silica product
line are Solar Crucibles™, which are used in the production of
photovoltaic (“solar”) cells. Global solar cell production
continued to grow well during 2008.
Following the 19% reduction in global steel production in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and weakening end-markets for
foundry castings, management took prompt action to reduce
the operating cost base of the division across all product lines.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, headcount was reduced with
over 250 temporary workers being released (notably in Europe)
along with 300 permanent positions. Overtime and premium
shift working was eliminated where practicable and extended
facility shutdowns were introduced over the Christmas and
New Year period to match the shutdowns initiated by a number
of our customers. In addition, in January 2009, the process was
initiated to permanently close six manufacturing facilities, one
in each of the UK, Mexico, Belgium and Germany, and two in
the US. Formal employee consultation procedures are now
underway and it is anticipated that the closures will be
substantially completed by the end of June 2009. This,
together with additional staff reductions in overhead positions
during 2009, will result in a further total headcount reduction
of over 600 people. A renegotiation of existing raw material
contracts is also currently in progress.
Following the acquisition of Foseco, the management
reporting responsibilities of the enlarged Ceramics division
were restructured on a product line, rather than geographic,
basis. This enables the business to better serve its
increasingly global customer base and also helps facilitate
the integration of the Foseco business. An overview of each
product line is given below.
Steel Flow Control
The Steel Flow Control product line provides a full range of
products and services to control, regulate and protect the
flow of steel in the enclosed continuous casting process.
These include VISO™ and VAPEX™ products, slide-gate and
tube changer systems and refractories, gas purging and
temperature control devices, mould and tundish fluxes and
ingot hot-topping systems.
Global steel production represents 100% of the end-
market for Steel Flow Control products and services.
Underlying revenue (at constant currency and as if Foseco had
been acquired with effect from the beginning of January
2007) grew by 1% for the year, marginally ahead of the 1%
reduction in global steel production. For the first nine months
of the year, underlying revenue grew by 7% but then fell
sharply in the fourth quarter reflecting the 19% reduction in
steel production in this period. This underlying growth,
combined with the integration of the steel flow control
operations of Foseco, resulted in reported revenue (at
reported exchange rates and only including Foseco from the
date of acquisition) of £427 million, a 2% increase on 2007 .
Underlying trading profit for the year (at constant currency
and as if Foseco had been acquired with effect from the
beginning of 2007) was 16% lower than for 2007 reflecting
the very difficult trading environment in the fourth quarter .
Capacity was increased in Europe with the construction
of a new £8 million facility in Ostend, Belgium, which became
operational at the end of 2008. Production of the more
standardised Steel Flow Control products has been
reallocated from our other European factories to this new,
highly automated facility to yield significant overall
productivity gains.

* Including pre-acquisition results of Foseco
Trading under the Vesuvius and Foseco brand names, the Ceramics division is the world leader in the
supply of advanced consumable products and systems to the global steel and foundry industries and a
leading supplier of speciality products to the glass and solar industries.
The acquisition of Foseco in April 2008 significantly expanded the existing Ceramics division and brought
together the two largest worldwide manufacturers of specialist ceramics for molten metal handling. The
enlarged division performed satisfactorily in 2008 with revenue of £1,265 million, up 62%, and trading profit
of £167.7 million, an increase of 53% (both at reported exchange rates), giving a return on sales margin of
13.3%. At constant exchange rates, revenue and trading profit were higher by 46% and 35% respectively.
Excluding the contribution from Foseco, underlying revenue was up 4%, trading profit was down 8% (both
at constant exchange rates) with the return on sales margin decreasing to 12.7% (compared to 14.0% for 2007).
Following the acquisition of Foseco, the key end-markets for Vesuvius are global steel production (which
accounts for just over half of the division’s revenue on a pro-forma basis) and the foundry casting market
(just over one-third of the division’s pro-forma revenue). The division’s other key end-markets are solar,
glass and industrial process plants.
End-markets continued to grow satisfactorily during the first nine months of the year and then
experienced a severe deterioration in the fourth quarter. Over the first nine months of the year, global steel
production was up 5% on the corresponding period in 2007. However, in the last quarter of 2008, many of
the larger steel producers, including ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel/Corus and Severstal, announced their intention
to cut back production in response to market conditions and to reduce inventories in the face of falling
demand. During October and November 2008, the number and scale of production cut-backs continued to
increase and, as a result, global steel production was 19% lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 than for the
corresponding period in 2007. Compared to the corresponding months in 2007, global steel production in
the months of October, November and December 2008 was lower by 14%, 20% and 24% respectively. For
the year as a whole, global steel production fell by 1% to 1.3 billion tonnes, the first annual decline in ten
years. China continued its position as the world’s leading steel producer with year-on-year growth of 3% and
accounted for 38% of the world’s total production in 2008. Global production outside of China was down
3%, with growth in India (up 4%) being more than offset by reductions in the US (down 7%), the enlarged
European Union (down 5%) and the CIS (down 8%).
The foundry castings market, which represents around one-third of the division’s revenue on a pro-
forma basis, produces castings which are used in a wide variety of engineered products and approximately
25% of the revenue from the division’s Foundry product line relates to the production of castings for the
automotive sector (being cars and light trucks). The foundry casting market was generally strong in the first
ten months of the year , particularly in Brazil, Germany, India and China. However , towards the end of the year
the market deteriorated significantly largely driven by an unprecedented reduction in automotive
production, particularly in the US and Europe.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
OUR BUSINESS
Steel Flow Control (continued)
Vesuvius’ main operations in China are 100% owned.
Since 2003, the division has operated a 50/50 joint venture
with Wuhan Iron & Steel Corporation (“WISCO”), China’s fifth
largest steel producer, producing slide-gate refractories. This
operation had revenue of £11 million in 2008. Based on this
success, a further 50/50 joint venture with WISCO was
announced in October 2007 for the production of VISO™, the
division’s range of isostatically-pressed alumina-carbon
products used to control and protect the flow of molten
metal in the enclosed continuous casting steelmaking
process. The joint venture, managed by Cookson, involved
the construction of a new facility in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
The new facility, of which Vesuvius’ share of the investment
was £2 million, became operational in July 2008. Around
half of the production is to be dedicated to supplying VISO™
products to satisfy the anticipated expansion of WISCO’s own
steel-making capacity, with the remainder available to the
Ceramics division to sell to other Chinese steel producers.
Following the acquisition of Foseco, a number of
complementary Steel Flow Control products, notably mould
fluxes (refractory materials used to prevent oxidation of the
molten steel in the tundish and during casting) and ingot hot-
topping systems, have been added to Vesuvius’ existing
range of products and services to further enhance our
offering to steelmakers.
As part of the series of cost-cutting measures noted
above, it is intended that three Steel Flow Control facilities
will be permanently closed in 2009, namely Newmilns in the
UK, Fisher (Illinois) in the US and Emmerich in Germany. The
headcount reduction will total around 320 employees.
Linings
Linings includes products and services that enable our
customers’ industrial furnaces and vessels to withstand the
effects of extreme temperatures or erosive chemical attack.
The business manufactures castables, gunning materials,
ramming mixes, pre-cast shapes, taphole clay, bricks,
mortars, and provides construction and installation services.
Global steel production represents around 70% of the
end-market for Linings products and services with the
remainder arising from a variety of non-steel markets
including the cement, lime, aluminium, petrochemical and
waste incineration industries.
The Linings product line continued its recent good
progress with revenue (at constant currency and as if Foseco
had been acquired with effect from the beginning of 2007)
up 6% to £433 million compared to 2007. Strong underlying
growth of 5% was complemented by the full year contribution
arising from the acquisition of Bayuquan Refractories Co.
Limited (“BRC”) in April 2007, the acquisition of SG Blair in
September 2008 and the integration of the linings
operations of Foseco’s Steel division in April 2008, such that
reported revenue (at reported exchange rates and only
including Foseco from the date of acquisition) of £415 million
was up 20% on 2007. The underlying growth was driven by
the growth in worldwide steel production, good growth in
non-steel markets and the ‘pass through’ of higher raw
material costs. As with the Steel Flow Control product line,
strong growth in the first nine months of the year was
partially offset by a decline in the fourth quarter. Underlying
trading profit (at constant currency and as if Foseco had been
acquired with effect from the beginning of 2007) remained
unchanged compared to 2007, resulting in a return on sales
margin (pre divisional and central cost allocations) for 2008
of 7.4% (2007: 7.8%). The reduction in the return on sales
margin reflects the significant deterioration in trading in the
fourth quarter. This business saw a reasonably significant
increase in raw material costs (which comprise a broad range
of ceramic minerals) in the first nine months of 2008,
although these increases started to abate towards the end
of the year. These additional costs have, to a very significant
extent, been successfully passed through to customers.
Linings has been increasing its capabilities particularly
in emerging markets where it is able to leverage the
expertise gained from its strong presence in the more
established markets in order to capture the expected growth
for these products. In India, the construction of a new facility
producing monolithics, pre-cast linings and taphole clay
became operational at the end of 2007. Following the
acquisition of BRC in China in April 2007, the facility – which
manufactures brick-lining products and had been previously
operating at full capacity – underwent a £1 million expansion
which was completed in the second quarter of 2008.
Foseco’s Steel division had a significant monolithics
business, including a range of complex shaped pre-cast
products (known as the Turbostop™ range) used in
controlling the flow of molten steel in the tundish. These
products are now being sold alongside Vesuvius’ existing
Linings products and services.
As part of the series of cost-cutting measures noted
above, it is intended that two Linings facilities will be
permanently closed in 2009, namely Hautrage in Belgium
and Brownsville (Texas) in the US. The headcount reduction
will total around 80 employees.
SG Blair, a specialist UK-based linings business, was
acquired on 28 September 2008 for a maximum cash
consideration of £0.4 million.
Foundry
The Foundry business is a leading supplier of products,
services and solutions to the foundry industry worldwide.
Products include feeding systems, filters, metal treatments,
metal transfer systems, crucibles, stoppers, sand binders,
coatings and moulding materials.
Vesuvius’ existing Foundry business, which principally
manufactures crucibles, was significantly expanded with the
acquisition of Foseco’s much larger Foundry business in April
2008. As a result, reported revenue for the business grew by
nearly nine times to £350 million. On a pro-forma basis (as if
Foseco had been acquired with effect from the beginning of
2007 and at constant currency), the underlying growth in
revenue was 6%. This growth has been driven by strong
market conditions in the foundry casting market for the first
ten months of 2008 and increased sales penetration, with
particularly good performance in infrastructure and
commodity-related markets such as mining machinery, oil
and gas, railway and heavy transportation, construction
and heavy machinery, and wind power generation. Cookson Group plc 18 Annual Report 2008 Cookson Group plc 19 Annual Report 2008
OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
OUR BUSINESS
The Electronics division is a world leading supplier of advanced surface treatment and plating chemicals
and comprises two product lines; the Assembly Materials product line is a supplier of solder and related
products and the Chemistry product line is a supplier of electro-plating chemicals.
Revenue for 2008 was £620 million, 1% lower at constant exchange rates compared to 2007 (11% higher
at reported exchange rates). Revenue in 2008 reflected the ‘pass through’ to customers in the Assembly
Materials product line of higher metal prices and, excluding both this impact and precious metal sales in
Chemistry, underlying revenue for the division was 9% lower than last year (on a constant currency basis).
The reduction in underlying revenue reflected a significant slowdown in the production of electronic
equipment (the end-market for just under two-thirds of the division’s revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2008
due to a marked ‘de-stocking’ by equipment manufacturers exacerbated by weakening end-user demand.
Electronic equipment production worldwide, which experienced high single digit growth over the last few
years, was broadly unchanged between full year 2008 and 2007, but was down 10% in the fourth quarter
compared to the corresponding period last year. A similar trend was evident for two of the key products
within the consumer electronics market, namely mobile phone handsets and PCs. Mobile phone handset
volumes were up 4% in 2008 compared to prior year, but were 12% down in the fourth quarter of 2008. PC
volumes, including laptops, were up 10% in 2008, but were unchanged in the fourth quarter . The automotive
sector, which represents around 19% of the division’s end-markets, was also very weak in the fourth quarter,
particularly in the US and Europe.
Trading profit of £51.7 million was 22% lower than 2007 at constant exchange rates and 11% lower at
reported exchange rates. The reduction in trading profit reflected the impact of the deterioration in trading
in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than offsetting the full year benefits of a number of restructuring
initiatives enacted in 2007, the successful launch of new products and the continued growth of Assembly
Materials’ reclaim business. In response to the deterioration in trading towards the end of 2008, a number
of cost reduction initiatives were launched including permanent headcount reductions of 70 in the fourth
quarter of 2008 with a further 170 headcount reduction expected in the first quarter of 2009.
Return on sales for the division at reported exchange rates decreased from 10.4% to 8.3% – a reduction
of 2.1 percentage points – due to the reduction in underlying volumes and the impact of higher metal prices.
If metals prices in 2008 had remained at similar levels to those in 2007, the return on sales would have
decreased by only 1.3 percentage points to 9.1%.
Asia-Pacific, the division’s largest region, accounted for 45% of revenue in 2008 (by location of
customer), a higher level than for 2007 reflecting the continuing migration of consumer electronics
production to this region, a trend that has been matched through our investment in capacity in the region
over the last few years.

Foundry (continued)
The automotive market (being cars and light trucks), which
globally represents around one-quarter of our foundry
castings market, whilst weak in the US, showed strong
growth in the larger emerging markets of Brazil, India and
China. Trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the last
two months of the year, driven by an unprecedented
reduction in global automotive production, particularly in the
US and Europe. On a pro-forma basis (as calculated above),
the underlying growth in trading profit was 4% and the
Foundry product line now contributes one-third of the
division’s trading profit.
Production of crucibles was transferred from Vesuvius’
Buffalo (New York) facility to an existing facility in Monterrey,
Mexico, with the Buffalo facility closing in the fourth quarter of
2008. The closure will generate cost savings of approximately
£1 million per annum from the beginning of 2009. The new
£5 million crucible facility in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province,
became operational in the third quarter of 2008. This facility
produces long-life, high-performance alumina-graphite
crucibles for the growing non-ferrous foundry market.
Production capacity has been increased during 2008
with the completion of four new facilities in Gliwice, Poland
(feeding systems and coatings), Alrode, South Africa
(coatings), Pune, India (feeding systems) and Gebze, Turkey
(feeding systems and coatings).
To satisfy EU authority requirements, Vesuvius’ Hi-Tech
ceramic filters business was sold on 23 December 2008. This
business contributed £12 million of revenue and £3 million of
trading profit in 2008.
The integration of Vesuvius’ existing crucibles business
into Foseco’s Foundry business, with its much wider range of
products and services, is proceeding well.
As part of the series of cost-cutting measures noted
above, it is intended that the Foundry facility in Tlalnepantla,
Mexico will be permanently closed in 2009. The headcount
reduction will total around 90 employees.
Fused Silica
The principal products in the Fused Silica product line are
Solar Crucibles™ used in the manufacture of photovoltaic
(“solar”) cells and tempering rollers used in the glass
industry.
Underlying revenue grew by 20% to £72 million
compared to 2007, driven by good market conditions in the
solar cell market.
Solar Crucible™ revenue, which represents half of total
Fused Silica revenue, grew strongly by 44% reflecting an
acceleration in the solar energy industry as supply shortages
of the polycrystalline silicon material used in the majority of
solar panels have eased with additional capacity now coming
on stream. This higher level of customer demand has been
met by the increased production capacity that has been put
in place by the division over the last two years.
Underlying revenue growth of 2% in tempering rollers
and other speciality products reflects satisfactory growth in
the glass industry, driven in particular by strong demand
from the construction industry in China in the first nine
months of the year. In order to meet this increased demand,
Vesuvius’ principal glass roller facility in Kua Tang, China
underwent a £1 million capacity expansion, which was
completed in the second quarter of 2008.
Trading profit for the Fused Silica product line has
increased by 39% on 2007 with the strong volume growth
from Solar Crucibles™ more than offsetting the normal ‘one-
off’ production start-up costs arising from the two new Solar
Crucible™ facilities completed in 2008.
To enable Vesuvius to continue to benefit from the good
growth in the solar energy market and maintain its leading
position as a key supplier to the industry, two new Solar
Crucible™ facilities were completed in 2008, with a third
expected to become operational in the second quarter of
2009. In March 2008, the new £6 million facility in Moravia,
Czech Republic became operational and in September 2008
the doubling of capacity of our existing facility in Wei Ting
was completed for an investment of £2 million. A further new
facility (“Sunrise”) located in Jiangsu Province, close to Wei
Ting, has recently been completed for a total investment of
just over £11 million. Following start-up trials, it is expected to
become operational in the second quarter of 2009. Cookson Group plc 20 Annual Report 2008 Cookson Group plc 21 Annual Report 2008
OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
OUR BUSINESS
The Precious Metals division is a leading supplier of fabricated precious metals (primarily gold, silver
and platinum) to the jewellery industry in the US, UK, France and Spain.
The Precious Metals division operates in two distinct geographic regions; the US, which constitutes 54%
of the total net sales value (being revenue excluding the precious metals content) for the division, and
Europe (which is focused on the UK, France and Spain). Average precious metal prices in 2008 were higher
than for 2007 with gold and silver higher by 27% and 14% respectively. Gold prices at the end of 2008 were
6% higher than at the beginning of the year, whilst silver prices were 23% lower.
Net sales value of £118 million was 3% higher at constant exchange rates (12% higher at reported
exchange rates). This reflected a sharp downturn in the demand for jewellery due to consumer spending
cutbacks, being more than offset by additional net sales value from the Leach & Garner business, acquired
in September 2007 and strong demand from the US Mint for gold coin blanks. The European businesses
also benefited from higher levels of precious metal reclaim activity, stimulated by the high price of gold.
Trading profit for 2008 at £4.5 million was 55% (£5.4 million) below 2007 (at reported exchange rates).
The profit shortfall arose wholly in the US due to the reduction in underlying volumes and the relatively
low profitability of the Leach & Garner trading activity prior to its transfer to the division’s principal US
production facility in Attleboro (Massachusetts) which was completed in July 2008. Actions taken to
mitigate the profit shortfall in the US included headcount reductions and the acceleration of the integration
of the Leach & Garner business. Total headcount in the US was reduced by 13% (around 170 people) during
2008. A new low-cost facility was completed in the Dominican Republic in March 2008 and the manufacture
of a number of product lines has been transferred from Attleboro to the new facility on a phased basis
during 2008.
The performance of the European businesses has improved compared to 2007, benefiting from the
restructuring initiatives undertaken in 2007 and the high level of reclaim activity. The restructuring
initiatives included the downsizing of manufacturing operations in Birmingham (UK), the opening of a new
low-cost facility in Thailand in the second half of 2007, and the closure of the Mauritius facility.
The return on net sales value for the division was 3.8% (2007: 9.4%).
Group corporate
The Group’s corporate costs, being the costs directly related to managing the Group holding company and
which now incorporate the former central operations of Foseco, were £7.6 million, in line with 2007.

Assembly Materials
Assembly Materials is a leading global supplier of materials
to assemblers of printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), the
semi-conductor packaging industry and to certain non-
electronics markets such as plumbing, automotive and
water treatment under the trade names of Alpha and Fry.
In PCB assembly, its products include solder (which is
available in bar, paste, powder and sphere form and in
no-clean, water-soluble and lead-free options), fluxes,
adhesives, cleaning chemistries and stencils.
The PCB and semi-conductor packaging segments of the
electronics market account for approximately 65% of
Assembly Materials’ revenue, with the remaining 35% going
into a variety of industrial applications.
Revenue for the year at £382 million was 5% higher than
2007 at constant exchange rates (17% higher at reported
exchange rates). The higher revenue reflected the ‘pass
through’ to customers of higher metal prices, in particular
for tin and silver. In 2008, the average prices of tin and silver
– Assembly Materials’ major raw materials – were respectively
31% and 14% higher than 2007 , such that approximately £54
million of the change in the division’s revenue was as a result
of these higher metal prices. Excluding the impact of higher
metal prices, underlying revenue was 10% lower than last
year (at constant exchange rates) reflecting the significant
slowdown in the production of electronic equipment in the
fourth quarter of 2008 combined with the continuation of
the strategy to focus resources on higher margin, more
value-added products. These products include solder paste
(for which volumes were up 4% by weight due to the
continuing shift from wave soldering to surface mount
technology) and low-silver SACX™ solder (for which volumes
were only marginally down by 3% by weight). At the same
time, sales of some more commoditised products, such as
leaded bar solder (for which volumes were down 21% by
weight), have been selectively reduced.
A number of new products have been launched during
the year including a 1% silver lead-free solder alloy, SACX™
solder paste and an expanded range of environmentally
friendly Greenline™ products, which are halogen-free and
contain low, or no, volatile organic compounds. The business
has also benefited from the continued growth – stimulated
by high metal prices – in the reclaim business in the US, in
which scrap solder generated by our customers’ production
processes is reclaimed for processing back into solder alloys
for sale to third parties or for reuse within the business. A
similar reclaim business has been set up in Guangxi Province,
China, which became operational at the end of 2008.
Trading profit for 2008 was lower than 2007 at constant
exchange rates, but marginally higher at reported exchange
rates. The return on sales margin in 2008 was slightly higher
than for 2007 (assuming metal prices in 2008 had remained
at similar levels to those in 2007).
In February 2008, the transfer of solder paste production
from Ashford, UK to Hungary was announced for completion
in the first half of 2009. This initiative will result in
annualised savings of £1 million from the middle of 2009.
2008 also benefited from the full year effect of the transfer
of Assembly Materials’ manufacturing operations within
NAFTA from the US to Mexico, which was completed towards
the end of 2007.
Chemistry
The Chemistry product line manufactures speciality
electro-plating chemicals for the electronics, automotive
and surface metal finishing industries under the trade
name Enthone.
End-markets for the Chemistry product lines’ plating
chemical products (excluding precious metal sales) are split
between the electronics industry (42%) and other industrial
and automotive applications (58%).
Revenue for the year at £238 million was 8% lower than
2007 at constant exchange rates (3% higher at reported
exchange rates). The lower revenue reflected the sharp
deterioration in electronic and automotive markets in the
fourth quarter of 2008 combined with the selective
reduction in sales of non-proprietary electro-plating
chemicals (revenue down from £18 million to £10 million).
Sales of plating-on-plastics and corrosion and wear-resistant
coating products for industrial and automotive markets were
down 3%, whilst sales of surface coating products serving
the PCB fabrication market within electronics were down 7%,
both reflecting the difficult trading environment in these
markets towards the end of the year.
Trading profit for 2008 fell substantially compared to
2007 at both constant and reported exchange rates, with a
corresponding reduction in the return on sales margin.
Ormecon GmbH, a speciality surface finishing technology
development company, was acquired on 3 September 2008
for a cash consideration of ¤13.5 million. This acquisition
further strengthens Chemistry’s market leading position in
PCB surface coating products and the business has now been
fully integrated within the existing German operations.

Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax was £176.2 million for 2008, which
was £26.4 million higher than for 2007. The increase in
headline profit before tax arose as follows:

Headline profit before tax 176.2 149.8 26.4 +18%
The £19.3 million higher charge for net finance costs
(ordinary activities) arises from an increase in the average
level of borrowings throughout the year resulting principally
from the acquisition of Foseco in April 2008.
Items excluded from headline profit before tax
A net charge of £86.6 million was incurred in 2008 (2007:
credit of £1.8 million) for the following items excluded from
headline profit before tax:
Restructuring and integration costs: costs of £39.6 million
(2007: £5.8 million) were incurred in 2008. Of the total
charge, £8.2 million related to the non-cash write-down of
assets and £31.4 million to cash-related costs. The principal
items included in the charge for 2008 were as follows:
• £26.1 million arose in the Ceramics division, of which £17.1
million related to the integration of Foseco (of which £10.7
million related to redundancy costs), £7.7 million to asset
write-offs associated with the announcement in January
2009 of the intended closure of six manufacturing
facilities, and £1.3 million to other cost-saving initiatives
completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 in response to
the very significant deterioration in end-markets towards
the end of 2008;
• £8.8 million in the Electronics division, of which the
principal elements were £3.7 million related to the
relocation of the Assembly Materials solder paste business
from Ashford, UK to Hungary, £3.1 million to redundancy
costs in the fourth quarter of 2008 in response to the very
significant deterioration in end-markets towards the end of
2008, and £0.5 million in the Chemistry product line for
further rationalisation of the sales, manufacturing and
distribution network in Europe; and
• £3.3 million in the Precious Metals division, principally
relating to the integration of Leach & Garner, the partial
transfer of manufacturing from Birmingham, UK to the
new low-cost facility in Thailand, closure of the Mauritius
facility and further restructuring of the US operations.
The costs of integrating Foseco into the Ceramics division are
currently expected to be around £21 million in total, of which
the remaining £4 million is expected to be reported as a
charge (all cash-related) in the full year 2009. In addition,
non-Foseco related restructuring costs of around £23 million
(all of which are cash-related) are currently expected in the
full year 2009, reflecting additional cost-saving initiatives
launched in response to the difficult trading environment. Of
the total cost of £23 million, £15 million relates to additional
costs (principally redundancy costs) associated with the
announcement in January 2009 of the intended closure of
six of the Ceramics division’s manufacturing facilities (two in
the US and one each in the UK, Belgium, Germany and
Mexico).
Inventory fair value adjustment: non-cash costs of £2.6 million
(2007: £nil) have been incurred in 2008 relating to the
element of Foseco’s inventory that was uplifted in value as
part of the fair value exercise on acquisition. Current
accounting rules require the value of all acquired inventory
to be uplifted from its net book value to a fair value, deemed
to be its selling price less disposal costs and the portion of
the total profit attributable to the selling effort. This has the
effect of capitalising into inventory the expected profit
earned up to the stage of production that the inventory had
reached at the acquisition date. The inventory on hand at
acquisition was sold during the remainder of 2008 and this
exceptional cost represents that element of total
manufacturing costs that related to this Foseco-related
inventory valuation uplift.
Profit relating to non-current assets: a profit of £3.4 million
(2007: £7.0 million) was realised in 2008, principally relating
to profit arising on the disposal of investments (comprising
assets held in Rabbi Trusts), being partially offset by a write-
down of property, plant and equipment in the Semi-
conductor Packaging Materials business, part of the
Electronics division.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets: costs of
£52.5 million (2007: £nil) were incurred in 2008, of which
£12.9 million related to the amortisation of intangible assets,
being principally the customer relationships, intellectual
property rights and the Foseco trade name, arising on the
acquisition of Foseco. These intangible assets are being
amortised over lives of either 10 or 20 years. The total cost
of acquiring Foseco (including the net debt acquired) was
£620 million, of which £41 million has been allocated to net
tangible assets, £256 million to intangible assets and £323
million to goodwill.
The remaining charge of £39.6 million related to the
write-off, as a non-cash charge, of all of the goodwill relating
to the Precious Metals division. The Precious Metals division
has been experiencing weak end-markets and, as a result,
the calculations used for impairment testing purposes
indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to
this division was not supportable.

As described in detail in the Operating Review, the significant
deterioration in trading in the majority of the Group’s
businesses in the fourth quarter of 2008 led to a reduction
in operating margins for the year which were 0.7 percentage
points lower at 9.8%. However, as a result of the post-
acquisition contribution from Foseco, trading profit increased
to £216.3 million – an increase of 11% on that reported for
2007 at constant exchange rates. The positive impact of
currency translation resulted in trading profit at reported
exchange rates increasing by 28% compared to 2007.
After net finance costs (ordinary activities) of £40.8 million,
increased from last year as a result of the higher borrowings
arising from the completion of the Foseco acquisition in April
2008, headline profit before tax was up 18% over last year to
£176.2 million. The Group’s effective tax rate remained
broadly in line with 2007 at 27.5% (2007: 26.9%).
The improvement in the Group’s trading profit more than
offset the increase in finance costs and with a broadly
unchanged effective tax rate this resulted in a 9% increase
in headline earnings per share over 2007 , notwithstanding an
8% increase in the weighted average number of shares as a
result of the October 2007 share placing. Despite this
improvement, the very significant deterioration in end-market
conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulted in the
Board’s decision not to recommend a final dividend to
shareholders in respect of 2008. As a result, total dividends
for the year consist only of the interim dividend of 0.88 pence
per ordinary share (as restated for the effect of the rights
issue) which was paid in October 2008.
Following the completion of the acquisition of Foseco in
April 2008 for a total consideration of £620 million, the
Group ended the year with net debt of £732 million, an
increase of £681 million from 31 December 2007. In March
2009, the Group completed a successful rights issue which
raised cash proceeds of £241 million, net of expenses.
“Through the rights
issue and other recent
initiatives, we have
strengthened our financial
position and created a
capital structure more
suited to the current
environment.”

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Group cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities
In 2008, the Group generated £120.4 million of net cash
inflow from operating activities, £51.0 million higher than in
2007. This net increase principally arose from:
2008 2007 Change
£m £m £m
EBITDA 263.5 204.3 59.2
Trade and other working capital (8.9) (44.8) 35.9
Cash outflow related to assets
and liabilities held for sale – (1.5) 1.5
Restructuring and integration
costs paid (23.0) (14.7) (8.3)
Additional pension contributions (25.0) (28.1) 3.1
Net interest paid (34.2) (19.1) (15.1)
Taxation paid (52.0) (26.7) (25.3)
Net cash inflow from operating
activities 120.4 69.4 51.0
The £8.9 million cash outflow in respect of trade and other
working capital was significantly lower than the £44.8 million
outflow in 2007 as a result of both the significantly lower
level of trading activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a
result of the deterioration in end-markets and also lower
metal prices towards the end of the year (notably for silver
and tin) in the Assembly Materials sector. These factors were
partially offset by the build up of raw material inventories in
the Ceramics division in the second half of 2008, driven by
concerns over raw material shortages caused by the Beijing
Olympics and the prevailing high commodity prices at the
time. These higher inventory levels are expected to unwind
during the first half of 2009.
The significant reduction in revenue in the fourth quarter
of 2008 resulted in the ratio of average trade working capital
to sales for 2008 deteriorating by 1.2 percentage points to
24.2% compared to 2007.
Cash outflow for restructuring and integration was £23.0
million related to programmes that were initiated either in
2008 or prior years. Of the total cash outflow for
restructuring and integration, £14.8 million related to the
Ceramics division, all related to Foseco. A cash outflow for
restructuring and integration of around £35 million is
expected in 2009 relating both to the completion of the
programmes initiated in 2008 or earlier years and to the
cost-saving initiatives launched at the beginning of 2009.
Net cash outflow from investing activities
Capital expenditure: payments to acquire property, plant and
equipment in 2008 were £72.8 million, 22% higher than
2007 and representing 154% of depreciation (2007: 172%).
Of the total payments, £57.9 million arose in the Ceramics
division in respect of the completion of a number of capacity
expansion projects in China, the Czech Republic, Mexico and
Belgium. A cash outflow for capital expenditure of not more
than £45 million is expected in 2009 reflecting the
suspension of all capacity expansion projects until there is
clear evidence of market recovery.
Proceeds from the sale of surplus properties: net proceeds,
principally arising in Italy, were £2.2 million (2007: £10.5
million).
Sale of other investments: net proceeds of £14.7 million
(2007: £nil) principally arose from the disposal of a number
of investments held in the US in Rabbi Trusts. These
investments were being held to fund certain non-qualified US
pension plan obligations which became payable at the end
of 2008.
Dividends from joint ventures: dividends of £0.4 million were
received in 2008 (2007: £1.3 million) from the Chemistry
product line’s Japanese joint venture.
Acquisitions: net cash outflow for acquisitions in 2008 was
£502.2 million and included the following:
• The acquisition of Foseco on 4 April 2008 for £484.6
million, comprising cash to acquire Foseco’s shares of
£496.7 million, transaction costs of £8.4 million, and cash
acquired of £20.5 million. In addition to this cash outflow,
Cookson also assumed Foseco’s gross borrowings at the
date of acquisition of £126.4 million which is detailed
below;
• The acquisition of an additional 20% interest in Foseco
India, an Indian publicly listed company, in February 2008
for £7.3 million, including cash consideration for the
shares of £6.9 million and transaction costs of £0.4
million. This transaction was required by Indian takeover
regulations as a result of Cookson’s acquisition of Foseco.
Following the acquisition of Foseco, Cookson holds 86%
of the shares of Foseco India; and
• The acquisitions in September 2008 of Ormecon GmbH
and SG Blair for a combined cost of £10.3 million.
Disposals: net cash inflow from disposals in 2008 was £21.2
million, principally relating to the disposal on 16 April 2008
of Foseco’s CBC business to RHI AG (gross proceeds of £8.0
million) and the disposal on 23 December 2008 of the
Ceramics division’s Hi-Tech ceramic filters business to Süd-
Chemie AG (gross proceeds of £16.5 million).
Other investing outflows: net cash outflow from other
investing activities in 2008 was £2.1 million (2007: £11.6 million)
which principally comprised trailing costs of £4.9 million in
respect of prior years’ disposals.
OUR BUSINESS
Items excluded from headline profit before tax (continued)
Curtailment gains relating to employee benefits: a credit of
£6.0 million (2007: £1.0 million) was realised in the year
relating to the full closure to future accruals of Foseco’s US
defined benefit pension plans, the disposal of Foseco’s CBC
business and the impact of redundancy programmes in the
UK and the US.
Finance costs – exceptional items: costs of £2.2 million were
incurred in 2008 (2007: £nil) relating to the write-off of up-
front fees arising from the cancelled part of the bank
facilities put in place to finance the acquisition of Foseco.
Profit on disposal of continuing operations: a net profit of
£0.9 million was realised in 2008 (2007: loss of £0.4 million)
principally relating to a profit of £8.1 million on the disposal
on 23 December 2008 of the Hi-Tech ceramic filters business
(formerly part of the Ceramics division’s foundry product
line) and a net loss of £4.0 million relating to the closure of
the Chinese operations of Foseco’s CBC business. The
substantive part of Foseco’s CBC business, namely its
operations in Europe and the US, were sold on 16 April 2008.
The net credit included a write-off of goodwill of £2.6 million.
Group profit before tax and after the items noted above was
£89.6 million for 2008 compared to £151.6 million in 2007,
a reduction of 41%.
Taxation
The tax charge on ordinary activities was £48.3 million. The
effective tax rate on headline profit before tax from
continuing operations (before share of post-tax profit of joint
ventures) was 27.5%, broadly in line with the 2007 rate of
26.9%. This effective tax rate is expected to remain broadly
unchanged in 2009, absent any significant changes in the
future geographic split of the Group’s taxable profits and any
material changes, beyond those already announced, in the
statutory tax rates in those countries where the Group has
significant taxable profits. The cash outflow in respect of tax
in 2008 was £52.0 million (2007: £26.7 million).
A tax credit of £8.1 million (2007: charge of £3.5 million)
arose in relation to all the items excluded from headline
profit before tax noted above.
Profit attributable to equity holders
Headline profit attributable to equity holders for 2008 was
£124.6 million (2007: £107.0 million), with the £17.6 million
increase over 2007 principally arising from the significant
increase in headline profit before tax. Profit attributable to
minority interests of £3.3 million was broadly in line with 2007 .
After taking account of all items excluded from headline
profit before tax noted above (net of the related tax impact),
the Group recorded a profit of £49.4 million for 2008, £58.5
million lower than the £107.9 million profit recorded in 2007.
Return on investment (ROI)
The Group’s post-tax ROI in 2008 was 8.2%, below the 9.8%
reported in 2007 reflecting the deterioration in end-market
conditions in the fourth quarter of the year . The Group’s post-
tax cost of capital (“WACC”) is approximately 9.0%.
Earnings per share (EPS)
The average number of shares in issue during 2008 was
1,407.8 million, 101.6 million higher than for 2007 principally
reflecting the full year impact of the placing of 123.4 million
new shares on 11 October 2007. The average number of
shares in issue used in the calculation of EPS for all years has
been multiplied by an adjustment factor to reflect the bonus
element in the 2,551.3 million shares issued in respect of the
rights issue announced on 29 January 2009. The adjustment
factor used was 6.6391.
Headline EPS, based on the headline profit attributable to
equity holders divided by the average number of shares in
issue, amounted to 8.9 pence per share in 2008, an increase
of 9% on the restated 8.2 pence for 2007. Excluding the
impact of the rights issue made subsequent to the year-end,
headline earnings per share in 2008 would have been 58.8
pence.
The Board believes the basis of calculating EPS on a
‘headline’ basis is an important measure of the underlying
earnings per share of the Group. Basic EPS, based on the net
profit attributable to parent company equity holders, was
3.3 pence (2007: 8.0 pence).
Dividend
For 2007 (adjusted for the impact of the bonus element of
the rights issue in March 2009), the Company paid a total
dividend of 1.96 pence per share; an interim dividend of 0.64
pence per share was paid in October 2007; and a final
dividend of 1.32 pence per share was paid in June 2008.
For 2008 (and adjusted for the impact of the bonus
element of the rights issue in March 2009), an interim
dividend of 0.88 pence per share was paid in October 2008.
Whilst the Group reported a good improvement in underlying
earnings for 2008, the very significant deterioration in end-
market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the
beginning of 2009, has resulted in the Board’s decision not to
recommend a final dividend for 2008 to shareholders. As a
result, total dividends for the year consist only of the interim
dividend of 0.88 pence per ordinary share.
A decision to resume dividend payments will be made
once a clear recovery can be seen in our end-markets and
trading performance, and in the context of the Group’s cash
requirements at that time. Cookson Group plc 26 Annual Report 2008 Cookson Group plc 27 Annual Report 2008
FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Currency
The weakening of sterling during 2008, particularly in the
second half of the year, had a marked impact on the average
exchange rates used to translate the Group’s overseas results
into sterling for 2007 and 2008. Between these years, the
average exchange rates for sterling weakened against most
European currencies (notably the euro by 14%, the Polish
zloty by 20% and the Czech Republic koruna by 23%), as well
as against the US dollar (by 7%), the Chinese renminbi (by
15%) and the Brazilian real (by 14%).
In 2008, the net translation impact of currency changes
compared to 2007 was to increase revenue by around £175
million and trading profit by around £25 million.
Pension fund and other post-retirement obligations
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit
pension plans, principally in the UK and US. In addition, the
Group has various other defined benefit post-retirement
arrangements, being principally healthcare plans in the US.
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension plans, including that
of Foseco, are closed to new members and its major defined
benefit pension plans in the US, including Foseco, are now
closed to new members and to further accrual for existing
members.
As at 31 December 2008, a net liability of £95.3 million
was recognised in respect of employee benefits, a similar
level to the £96.1 million as at 31 December 2007,
notwithstanding the inclusion of Foseco’s net employee
deficit, which totalled £54.9 million as at 31 December 2008.
The increase in the Group’s net liability as a result of the
Foseco acquisition has been more than offset in the year by
the effects of the increase of the prescribed discount rates
used to calculate the present value of future liabilities and, in
respect of Cookson’s main UK defined benefit pension plan
(“the UK Plan”), the additional ‘top-up’ funding payments
made throughout 2008.
The total Group net liability comprises a surplus of £70.6
million, relating almost entirely to the UK Plan, together with
a deficit of £165.9 million, of which £89.5 million relates
to the Group’s defined benefit pension plans in the US,
£47.3 million to pension arrangements in other countries,
and £29.1 million to unfunded post-retirement defined
benefit arrangements, being mainly healthcare benefit
arrangements in the US.
During 2008 it was agreed, in consultation with the
Trustee of the UK Plan, to reduce the level of ‘top-up’
payments (made in addition to normal cash contributions).
These payments had been made at a rate of £26.5 million
per annum from February 2006 and became £14.0 million
per annum with effect from 1 September 2008. Since the end
of 2008, the Group has again consulted with the Trustee and
both have agreed to a change to the existing schedule of
‘top-up’ payments, such that no further additional payments
will be made from January 2009 until July 2010, or until such
earlier time as the Group announces that it is to recommence
payment of dividends to shareholders. Upon additional
payments being recommenced, these will amount to a
maximum of £16.3 million per annum until June 2015. A new
triennial funding valuation is due for the UK Plan as at the
end of 2009, based upon which the Company and Trustee
expect to agree a new schedule of contributions to
commence in July 2010.
The discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the
UK Plan for IAS 19 accounting purposes is required to be a
corporate bond yield. The UK Plan has, since 2006, operated
a hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and money
market instruments, to mitigate the impact of interest rate
and inflation rate movements on the value of its projected
liabilities for meeting future pension payments (the UK Plan’s
“economic liabilities”), the value of which is related more to
interest rate and inflation rate swap yields than to corporate
bond yields. When the relationship between the relevant
swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the UK Plan’s
hedging strategy should deliver a broadly stable funding
ratio (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities) not just in
relation to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities, but also under
an IAS 19 basis of valuation. However, the current spread of
corporate bond yields over swap yields results in the IAS 19
value of the UK Plan’s liabilities being significantly lower than
the value of the actual underlying economic liabilities. As at
the end of 2008, an interim funding valuation (incorporating
the UK Plan’s economic liabilities) showed a funding ratio of
85%, but the IAS 19 valuation reflected a funding surplus,
giving a ratio of 120%. This represents a valuation difference
of approximately £140 million, of which some £30 million is
due to the use of the stronger Long Cohort mortality
assumption for funding purposes and the rest is largely due
to the difference in the discount rates used in each valuation
methodology. The Group continues to fund the UK Plan with
reference to its economic funding position.

OUR BUSINESS
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating
activities and after net outlays for the acquisition and
disposal of property, plant and equipment, dividends received
from joint ventures and paid to minority shareholders, but
before additional funding contributions to Group pension
plans.
Free cash inflow for 2008 was £73.1 million, £25.5 million
higher than 2007, due to the £51.0 million increase in net
cash flow from operating activities for the reasons described
above, more than offsetting the £12.9 million increase in the
payments to acquire property, plant and equipment.
As in prior years, free cash flow in the second half of the
year increased strongly compared with the first half due to
significantly higher cash inflows from trade working capital.
Net cash flow before financing
Net cash outflow before financing for 2008 was £418.2 million,
£442.4 million higher than 2007. This arose due to the cash
payments in respect of the acquisition of Foseco more than
offsetting the increase in free cash flow.
Cash flow from financing activities: net cash outflow from
financing activities (before movement in borrowings) was
£24.3 million (2007: inflow of £104.2 million), principally
comprising the following:
• Cash inflow of £18.3 million (2007: outflow of £20.0
million) relating to the settlement during the year of
forward foreign exchange contracts, in particular the US
dollar and euro swaps which were closed out in October
and November in response to the significant weakening
of sterling. These forward foreign exchange contracts
had been taken out to broadly align the currency profile
of the Group’s borrowings with the net assets of the
Group and formed part of the hedge on investments of
the Group’s foreign operations;
• Payments of £3.9 million to acquire Cookson Group plc
shares for the purpose of satisfying the vesting of shares
under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan;
• Payments of £6.0 million (2007: £4.8 million) in respect
of the transaction costs for the £790 million committed
bank facility entered into in October 2007; and
• Dividend payments to equity shareholders of £31.0
million in respect of the 2007 final dividend of 1.32 pence
per share in June 2008 and the 2008 interim dividend of
0.88 pence per share in October 2008.
Net cash flow and movement in net debt: net cash outflow
for 2008 (before movement in borrowings) was £442.5
million, £570.9 million higher than 2007.
With a £117.4 million negative foreign exchange
adjustment, £128.1 million of gross borrowings assumed on
acquisitions (of which £126.4 million was Foseco-related), and
£6.9 million of other non-cash movements, the net cash
outflow resulted in an increase in net debt of £681.1 million to
£731.7 million. The negative translation impact arose
principally as a result of the significant weakening of sterling
against most major currencies between 1 January and
31 December, 2008. Between these two dates, sterling
weakened 24% against the euro, 27% against the US dollar
and 32% against the Chinese renminbi.
Group borrowings
The net debt of £731.7 million as at 31 December 2008 was
primarily drawn on available medium to long-term committed
facilities of just over £0.9 billion. The Group’s net debt
comprised the following:
31 December 31 December
2008 2007
£m £m
US Private Placement loan notes 250.4 183.0
Committed bank facility 565.5 13.0
Lease financing 4.8 1.5
Other loans and overdrafts 26.8 20.5
Gross borrowings 847.5 218.0
Cash and short-term deposits (115.8) (167.4)
Net Debt 731.7 50.6
The US Private Placement loan notes, currently US$365
million, are repayable in three tranches; US$40 million in
November 2009, US$135 million in May 2010 and US$190
million in May 2012.
In October 2007, the Group entered into a new multi-
currency, committed bank facility for approximately £790
million, raised for the purpose of the acquisition of Foseco.
This facility was used, in combination with the net proceeds
of £151 million from the share placing on 11 October 2007, to
finance the acquisition of Foseco in April 2008. This included
the refinancing of the existing committed bank facilities of
Cookson and Foseco. This facility was originally repayable in
three tranches; £75.0 million and ¤37.5 million in October
2010, £75.0 million and ¤37.5 million in October 2011 and
£500.0 million and ¤75.0 million in October 2012.
On 6 March 2009, the Group came to an agreement with
its banks whereby the Group agreed to prepay in March 2009
the £75.0 million and ¤37 .5 million repayments originally due
in October 2010. In exchange for this the banks have
rescheduled the tightening of the net debt to EBITDA
covenant. As a result, the covenant test will now be 3.5 times
(previously 3.0 times) at 30 June 2009 and 31 December
2009, reverting to 3.0 times as at 30 June 2010 and thereafter .
For 2008, the Group’s EBITDA to interest on borrowings
ratio was 7.6 times (as compared with not less than 4.0 times
for bank covenant purposes) and the net debt to EBITDA
ratio (on a pro-forma basis reflecting the acquisition of
Foseco) was 2.6 times.
On 4 March 2009, the Group completed a rights issue
which raised £241 million of cash proceeds (net of expenses
of £14 million). The rights issue resulted in the issue of 2,551
million new shares at an issue price of 10 pence with the
shares being issued on the basis of 12 new shares for every 1
existing share. Cookson Group plc 29 Annual Report 2008 Cookson Group plc 28 Annual Report 2008
Policy
Cookson recognises that its operations impact a wide
community of stakeholders, including investors, employees,
customers, business associates and local communities and
that appropriate attention to the fulfilment of its corporate
responsibilities can enhance overall performance. In
structuring its approach to the various aspects of corporate
social responsibility, the Company takes account of guidelines
and statements issued by stakeholder representatives and
other regulatory bodies from around the world.
Social, environmental and ethical matters are reviewed
by the Board, particularly as regards the impact such matters
may have on the Group’s management of risk and the
internal control systems in place for addressing any
significant associated risks.
Code of Conduct
The Company has a Code of Conduct (“Cookson Code”),
which has been distributed throughout the Group in 25
languages and by which all its businesses are required to
operate. The Cookson Code emphasises the Company’s
commitment to compliance with the highest standards of
legal and ethical behaviour. The Cookson Code is reproduced
in full on the Company’s website.
As stated in the Cookson Code, the primary goal of
Cookson is the protection and advancement of the interests
of investors by providing attractive returns on a long-term
basis. In striving to achieve this goal, management must
conduct its business in a responsible manner, while engaging
in careful risk-taking as an essential ingredient of business
success. The Cookson Code requires that particular care be
given to the preservation and protection of Group assets by
making prudent and effective use of resources. Long-term
customer satisfaction is recognised as being essential to the
attainment of Group goals, which means listening carefully to
customers’ product and service requirements and maintaining
a reputation for integrity in all business and other dealings.
The Group can only achieve its goals through the efforts
of its employees. Cookson recognises that job satisfaction
requires working environments that motivate employees to
be productive and innovative, and which provide
opportunities for employee training and development to
maximise personal potential and develop careers within the
Group. Cookson believes that wherever in the world they
work employees have the right to be treated in good faith
and on the basis of respect for the dignity of the individual.
The Cookson Code requires all Group companies to
ensure that recruitment, training, promotion, career
development, termination and similar employment-related
issues are based on individual ability, achievement,
experience and conduct without regard to race, colour,
nationality, culture, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, disability or any other reason not related to
job performance or prohibited by applicable law.
The Cookson Code requires all employees, officers and
Directors to have a duty of loyalty to the Group. Individuals
may not use their positions to profit themselves or others at
the expense of the Group. Personal interests that do, may or
might appear to conflict with Group interests or improperly
influence the performance of an individual’s duties must be
avoided at all times.
Corporate Responsibility Statement
Cookson seeks to be a good corporate citizen wherever it
conducts business. The Cookson Code requires employees to
observe all national and local laws and never seek to gain any
advantage through the inappropriate use of payments,
business courtesies or other inducements. Bribery is strictly
prohibited. Group businesses must respect and take into
account regional and local concerns, customs and traditions.
Helpline
Cookson has a 24-hour Employee Business Concern Helpline
telephone and email facility. This is operated by a professional,
external provider of employee support, counselling and
business concern services, which provides Cookson’s
employees and business associates worldwide with an
independent and confidential service through which to
register any concerns about any incorrect or irregular
practices they perceive in Cookson’s workplace. With the
express permission of the caller or email correspondent, the
service provider reports any matters raised to a designated
team at Cookson’s Head Office for investigation.
Health, Safety and
Environmental Statement
Policy
Cookson has a Health, Safety and Environment (“HS&E”)
Policy based on the principle of operating in a manner that
preserves health, safety and a sound environment. For
Cookson companies worldwide, the minimum acceptable
standard is to meet their legal HS&E obligations, however,
the aim is to improve continually. Cookson believes that good
HS&E performance is an integral part of effective and
profitable business management. The policy, which is
reviewed regularly, is available in full on the Group’s website,
www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
Management systems
The Board assumes ultimate responsibility for HS&E policy
and for monitoring its implementation, while executives and
line managers are directly responsible for HS&E matters in
the operations under their control. A reporting system is in
place to collect, collate and report on HS&E matters,
including key performance indicators. Advice and support is
available from the corporate HS&E function, led by the Group
Head of HS&E who reports on these matters to the Board.
During 2008, the number of Cookson locations with
certification to ISO 14001, the international standard for
environmental management systems, and OHSAS 18001, the
standard for health and safety management systems,
increased, principally as a result of the Foseco acquisition.
The Group now has 60 locations certified to ISO 14001 and
29 locations certified to OHSAS 18001.
Performance
Since 2004, Cookson has operated a programme aimed at
reducing energy use and the associated emissions of
carbon dioxide (“CO
2
”), the principal greenhouse gas. The
programme trains employees to understand energy use and
conservation principles and introduces energy audits to
assist high-use sites in identifying and implementing
conservation measures. During 2008, Cookson conducted
energy audits and prepared energy use-reduction plans at
17 facilities. These efforts have yielded a 3.4% reduction in
gas use and a 6.7% reduction in electricity use from 2007 to
2008, excluding the impact of the Foseco acquisition.
A number of Cookson companies in the US have been
named as potentially responsible parties under the
Superfund law for wastes disposed of at sites owned by third
parties. Although likely Group costs depend on many factors,
the few cases that remain active are expected to be settled
within the amounts already provided.
Like many manufacturers, some Group companies have
potential environmental liabilities because of past operations
at their current or former sites. Where remediation is
required, Cookson environmental managers and external
specialists work with government authorities to ensure that
remediation is conducted effectively and efficiently.
Compliance
A small number of enforcement notices were issued to
Cookson companies in 2008, including several that assessed
minor penalties. One civil court action for alleged non-
compliance with waste management requirements associated
with managing an inactive site was filed against a Cookson
company in 2006. The company expects to settle the case
in 2009.
REACH
Cookson companies began implementing the European
regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and
Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) in 2008. Each chemical
manufacturing business established a team to address
REACH obligations. The businesses filed appropriate pre-
registrations by the statutory deadline and contacted
suppliers to ensure that the chemicals necessary for future
operations would remain available.
Workplace
Cookson’s success depends on retaining the commitment of
the people who work within it. The Group strives to ensure
that employees have a safe environment in which to work
and that employment practices are fair and equitable.
Safety
Cookson’s goal is zero work-related injuries and illness.
To achieve this, a worldwide initiative was commenced in
2002 to improve safety performance, with a particular focus
on applying sound risk assessments and ergonomic
principles. The programme includes minimum standards of
performance, targeted assistance to higher risk sites and a
variety of training and awareness activities. To ensure
continued progress, the Group set, in early 2007, a target of
a further reduction in injury and illness rates of 30% by the
end of 2009. In 2008, Cookson’s largest division initiated a
“Safety Breakthrough” campaign in response to several
serious accidents and to renew emphasis on safety
performance with a heightened focus on ensuring satisfactory
health and safety environments in customers’ locations
where Cookson employees are required to work. By the end
of 2008, Cookson’s overall recordable injury rate had
improved by 27% percent over the 2007 rate, and the rate of
injuries that caused days away from work improved by 12%
compared to the 2007 rate.
During 2008, Cookson continued to focus on the
elimination of work-related injuries through better
application of ergonomic principles. The last five years have
seen extensive ergonomic training throughout the Group and
the establishment of ergonomic teams at a number of
facilities, leading to a significant improvement in their
performance. Additional information on HS&E matters can
be found on the Group’s website – www.cooksongroup.co.uk.

The process also involved a series of one-to-one meetings
between the Chairman and each member of the Board and the
Group Secretary. The full Board then considered the report with
the Chairman and Senior Independent Director adding their own
comments based on the outcome of their discussions.
The Chairman was judged to have performed satisfactorily
against all the measured criteria. Based on the results of the
2008 review the Board considered that overall it was operating
effectively and that all Directors continue to contribute and are
committed to their respective roles at Cookson.
The Board agreed the action items to be addressed as a result
of the review. These included increasing the frequency of contact
between the Board and senior divisional management in order to
assist in management development and succession planning.
The Chairmen of each of the Audit, Nomination and
Remuneration Committees also reviewed the results of the
evaluation of each Committee with Committee members. All
Board Committees were considered to be effective.
Induction and training
The Group Secretary ensures that a comprehensive induction
programme is provided to all new Directors, including visits to
manufacturing facilities, meetings with key Group executives and
introductions to the Company’s principal external advisers, as
appropriate. New Directors are also advised of their legal and other
duties and obligations as Directors of a listed company. This is
supplemented by reference materials, which are updated as
required, including information about the Board, the Committees,
Directors’ duties, procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares
and other regulatory and governance matters. Directors are
provided with details of seminars and training courses relevant to
their role. They are encouraged to attend these as they consider
appropriate and are supported by the Company in so doing. Where
a general training need is identified, in-house training is provided to
the entire Board. In 2008 further updates were given to the Board
on the Companies Act 2006. During the year Directors also
attended external seminars and other functions relevant to specific
areas of their responsibility.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has an established investor relations programme
managed by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director . The
Company reports its financial results to shareholders twice a year ,
with the publication of its Annual and Half-Yearly Financial Reports.
In conjunction with these announcements presentations are made
to institutional investors and analysts, copies of which are posted
on the Group’s website – www.cooksongroup.co.uk. In addition, in
2008 the Company issued Interim Management Statements in May
and November and hosted a Capital Markets Day for analysts at its
Ceramics facility in Borken, Germany.
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with major
institutional investors and regular updates on shareholder issues
and discussions are provided to the Board. Board members also
receive copies of significant analysts’ notes issued on the
Company. All Directors normally attend the Company’s AGM,
providing shareholders with the opportunity to question them
about issues relating to the Group, either during the meeting or
informally afterwards.
Board Committees
The principal Committees of the Board are the Audit, Remuneration
and Nominations Committees. Each Committee has written terms
of reference agreed by the Board. These are available to view on
the Company’s website – www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members are the non-executive Directors,
namely Jeff Hewitt, Jan Oosterveld, Barry Perry and John Sussens.
During the year the Committee was chaired by Mr Hewitt. The
Board believes Mr Hewitt possesses the relevant financial
experience, as described by the Code.
The Group Finance Director, the Group Head of Internal Audit
and the Company’s Auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, are normally invited
to attend meetings and other executives are invited to attend as
and when appropriate. The Committee meets regularly with the
Company’s Auditor without any executives being present.
Audit Committee report
The principal roles of the Audit Committee are:
• assisting the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities in
respect of statutory and other financial reporting and in respect
of its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls
and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board on the appointment and
dismissal of the Auditor;
• approving the remuneration and terms of engagement of the
Auditor;
• monitoring and reviewing the Auditor’s independence, objectivity
and effectiveness, taking into account professional and
regulatory requirements; and
• helping to strengthen the independent position of the Auditor by
providing a direct channel of communication between it and the
non-executive Directors.
The Committee has established procedures for the receipt,
retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company
including accounting, internal controls, auditing matters and
confidential communications from employees.
The Group Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the
Committee Chairman and the Committee reviews and approves
the internal audit work programme for each year. During the year
under review, the Committee met four times and reviewed,
amongst other matters, the Company’s published financial
results; internal audit reports and management control issues;
the scope of the external audit and its cost effectiveness; the
performance of the Auditor; and the extent to which the
Auditor’s remuneration for non-audit services might affect its
independence and objectivity in carrying out the audit.
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were
discharged as follows:
• at its meetings in July 2008 and March 2009, the Committee
reviewed the Company’s Half-Yearly Report and Annual Results
Announcement/Annual Report and Accounts, respectively. On
both occasions, the Committee received reports from the Auditor
identifying any accounting or judgmental issues thereon
requiring its attention;
Cookson Group plc 32 Annual Report 2008
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Details are set out in the narrative below of the Company’s
corporate governance procedures and application of the principles
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2006 (‘the Code’). The
Company has complied with the provisions of the Code throughout
the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Board
Ultimate responsibility for the management of Cookson rests with
the Board of Directors. The Board focuses primarily upon strategic
and policy issues. It approves the Group’s strategy, oversees the
allocation of resources and monitors the performance of the Group
in pursuit of this.
Membership
The Board currently has seven Directors, comprising the non-
executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance
Director and four non-executive Directors. The Board considers
each of the non-executive Directors, namely Jeff Hewitt, Jan
Oosterveld, Barry Perry and John Sussens, to be independent of
management and free from any business or other relationship
which could affect the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Company has reviewed the availability of the non-executive
Directors and considers that each of them is able to, and in
practice does, devote the necessary amount of time to the
Company’s business. The Board nominates one of the non-
executive Directors to act as Senior Independent Director and
provide an alternative contact at Board level, other than the
Chairman, to whom shareholder matters can be addressed. Mr
Sussens continues to hold this position. There were no changes of
Board membership during the year. The biographical details of
the individual Directors who served during the year are set out on
page 31.
The Articles of Association of the Company require that
Directors should submit themselves for re-election at least every
three years. Messrs Beeston, Butterworth and Hewitt will
therefore be retiring and offering themselves for re-election at
this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) as set out in the
Notice of AGM and on page 41.
Responsibilities and meetings
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and
delegates certain matters to committees as outlined below. The
Board met as a full Board on eight scheduled occasions during
2008. One of these meetings was held at a Cookson facility during
a Board visit to the Group’s operations. Board meetings may also
be convened on an ad-hoc basis for non-routine business. In
addition, the Chairman and the non-executive Directors meet
routinely on their own without the executive Directors present and
at least once each year the non-executive Directors meet without
the Chairman present to discuss matters such as the Chairman’s
performance.
Specific matters reserved for the Board include: reviewing
Group and divisional performance; approving significant
transactions including acquisitions, divestments, capital
expenditure and changes to the Group’s capital structure; setting
and approving the Group’s strategy and annual budget; approving
the Group’s financing and treasury policies; succession planning
and approving Board appointments and the remuneration of the
non-executive Directors. In addition the Board considers health,
safety and environmental matters and reviews the Group’s risk
management processes.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and is set out in
writing. The Chairman leads the Board and meets routinely with
the Chief Executive and Group Secretary to discuss matters
relating to its efficient functioning. The Chairman also serves as
Chairman of Elementis plc and as the Senior Independent
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of D S
Smith plc. The Board considers that the Chairman is able to and
does devote sufficient time to his duties at Cookson.
The attendance of Directors at Board and principal Committee
meetings during the year, together with the maximum number of
meetings in the period when the individual was a Board member
(as shown in brackets), was as follows:

Papers are provided to the Directors in advance of the relevant
Board or Committee meeting to enable them to make further
enquiries about any matters prior to the meeting should they so
wish. The Group Secretary oversees the distribution of these
papers and ensures that there is an appropriate level of
communication between the Board and its Committees and
between senior management and the non-executive Directors. He
also keeps the Board apprised of relevant developments in
corporate governance.
Performance evaluation
The Board evaluates its own performance and effectiveness and
assesses the performance of its Committees and individual Board
members on an annual basis. The precise scope of the evaluation
varies from year to year and is agreed in advance with the full
Board. The Chairman leads the evaluation process with the
assistance of the Group Secretary.
The performance of the Chairman is included in the review
and takes into account the views of both the executive and non-
executive Directors. The Chairman’s evaluation is conducted by
the Senior Independent Director who provides feedback to the
Chairman. As part of the Chairman’s evaluation the non-executive
Directors meet separately with the Senior Independent Director.
The 2008 Board evaluation process focused upon key aspects
of Board performance – as identified in previous evaluations – and
the various skills and attributes expected of Cookson Directors. The
review was carried out using a specially designed questionnaire
prepared by an independent, specialist organisation in conjunction
with the Chairman and the Group Secretary. The questionnaire was
completed by the Directors and the Group Secretary with the
results being collated and summarised by the organisation. Each
Director received a copy of the high level report, which summarised
and analysed all responses on a non-attributable basis.
OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 35 Annual Report 2008
The Nominations Committee reviews the Company’s succession
plans. The Board as a whole also considers this subject. Each of
Cookson’s divisions submit detailed succession plans in respect of
senior divisional executives to the Board for review each year. The
Board also considers succession planning for senior Corporate
executives, with the Nominations Committee focusing in turn,
specifically on succession planning for members of the Board.
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee reports the
outcome of the Nominations Committee meetings to the Board.
Finance and Share Schemes Committees
The Board delegates certain responsibilities on an ad hoc basis to
the Finance and Share Schemes Committees.
The Finance Committee is chaired by the Group Chairman, its
other members being the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and Group Treasurer. The Committee meets as and when required
to consider the approval of treasury-related matters.
The Share Schemes Committee’s membership consists of any
two Directors. It meets as and when required to undertake
administrative matters in relation to the Company’s share schemes.
Executive Committee and Central Executive
In addition to the Committees of the Board described above, the
Group has an Executive Committee which supports the Chief
Executive in addressing Group-wide issues and initiatives. This
Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and comprises the
Group Finance Director, the Group Secretary and the Chief
Executives of each of the Group’s three divisions. Specific
authority has been delegated to the Central Executive comprising
the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group
Secretary. The Central Executive is responsible for reviewing and
approving capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals at
certain levels as determined by the Board. Responsibility for day-
to-day operational management rests with the divisional Chief
Executives.
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for the establishment and
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal control.
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code on
internal control which require that the Directors review the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including
financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk
management systems. Whilst no system of internal control can
provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or
loss, the Group’s system is designed to provide the Directors with
reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely
basis and are dealt with appropriately. Since the date of the
review, there have been no significant changes in internal
controls or other matters which could significantly affect them.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by Cookson. Group
management operates a risk management process designed to
identify the key risks facing each business and reports to the
Audit Committee on how those risks are being managed. As a
basis for this report, each of the Group’s major business units
produces a ‘risk map’ which identifies their key risks and assesses
the likelihood of those risks occurring, their impact if they do
occur and the actions being taken to manage those risks to a
desired level.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by
the Group’s Internal Audit function, which operates on a global
basis. This function assists management and the Board in the
effective discharge of their responsibility for internal control by
conducting reviews of Cookson businesses and reporting
objectively both on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system
of internal control in place and as to whether those businesses
are in compliance with applicable Group policies and procedures.
The Group Head of Internal Audit is responsible for developing
the function, within the framework of common Group policies and
standards, and for carrying out assignments in accordance with
an annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee receives reports from the Group Head of Internal
Audit on a regular basis and reports to the Board on the results
of its review.
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness
of the system of internal control, it delegates the following
matters to the Audit Committee to be carried out during the year:
• review of external and internal audit work plans;
• consideration of reports from management, internal audit and
external audit on the system of internal control and any material
control weaknesses; and
• discussions with management on the actions taken on problem
areas identified by Board members, in internal audit reports or in
external audit management letters.
In addition to the above, the Board considers significant financing
and investment decisions concerning the Group, including the
giving of guarantees and indemnities, and monitors policy and
control mechanisms for managing treasury risk. The Board also
reviews the role of insurance and other measures used in
managing risks across the Group, receives regular reports on any
major issues that have arisen during the year and makes an
annual assessment of how the risks have changed over the period
under review.
At the year end, following the review by the Audit Committee
of internal financial controls and of the processes covering other
controls, the Board evaluates the results of the internal control
and risk management procedures conducted by senior
management. This includes a self-certification exercise by which
they certify the effectiveness of the system of internal controls
within the businesses for which they are responsible, together
with their compliance throughout the year with the Group’s
policies and procedures.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Throughout its global operations, Cookson faces various risks,
both internal and external, which could have a material impact on
the Group’s long-term performance. Cookson manages the risks
inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all
forms of risk, where practical, and to transfer risk to insurers,
where cost effective. The risks below are not the only ones that
the Group will face. Some risks are not yet known and some that
are not currently deemed material could later turn out to be
material. All of these risks could materially affect the Group, its
business, results of future operations or financial condition.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)
Audit Committee report (continued)
• at each of the four meetings, the Committee received a report
from the Group Head of Internal Audit covering, amongst other
things, the work undertaken by the Internal Audit function and
management responses to proposals made in the audit reports
issued by the function during the year. In addition, at the
December 2008 meeting, the Committee reviewed the internal
audit plan, submitted by the Group Head of Internal Audit for 2009;
• at each of the four meetings, the Committee reviewed the
Auditor’s control findings;
• at the July 2008 meeting, the Committee reviewed the results of
an assessment which had been undertaken of the performance of
the Auditor and reviewed and agreed the audit plan presented by
the Auditor , which detailed the approach and scope of the work to
be undertaken and the level of fee to be charged;
• at its meetings in December 2008 and January 2009, the
Committee reviewed the approach and scope of the work to be
undertaken by the Auditor , in its role as Reporting Accountant, in
connection with their review of the profit forecast and working
capital report produced by management in relation to the rights
issue announced in January 2009. Also at these meetings, the
Committee reviewed the rights issue prospectus and reports from
management which supported the profit estimate and working
capital statements made therein;
• at its meetings in December 2008 and March 2009 the
Committee reviewed both the risk management process operated
by Group management designed to identify the key risks facing
each business and also how those risks were being managed;
• at its meetings in January and March 2009 the Committee
reviewed reports from management which addressed the
appropriateness of the production of the Group and Company
financial statements on a going concern basis;
• from time to time, executives were required to make
presentations to the Committee or to the full Board on the
identification, management and control of specific areas of risk
which impact the Company and the Group; and
• as a matter of routine, the Committee was presented with
information on any significant litigation involving the Group.
As noted above, one of the duties of the Committee is to make
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of
the Auditor . In 2008, the Audit Committee contemplated putting
the Group audit out to tender but, after considering a number of
factors concerning the Auditor and the Group’s current activity;
including the results of ongoing work being undertaken to
integrate the recently acquired Foseco business, it decided to
recommend the Auditor for re-appointment. Among the other
factors considered by the Committee were: the quality both of
reports provided by the Auditor to the Committee and the Board,
and of advice given; the level of understanding demonstrated of
the Group’s businesses; the objectivity of the Auditor’s views on the
controls throughout the Group; its ability to coordinate a global
audit, working to tight deadlines; the cost-competitiveness of the
Auditor in relation to the audit costs of comparable UK companies;
and the periodic rotation of the senior audit management assigned
to the audit of the Company.
The Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the
independence of the external audit is not compromised. Such
safeguards include:
• seeking confirmation that the Auditor is independent of the
Company in its own professional judgement; and
• considering all the relationships between the Auditor and the
Group, including those relating to the provision of non-audit
services and whether this impairs, or appears to impair , the
Auditor’s judgement or independence.
The Company has a policy governing the Group-wide conduct of
non-audit work by the Auditor . Under that policy the Auditor is
prohibited from performing services where it:
• may be required to audit its own work;
• would participate in activities that would normally be undertaken
by management;
• is remunerated through a ‘success fee’ structure; or
• acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
Other than the above, the Company does not impose an automatic
prohibition on the Auditor undertaking non-audit work. The Auditor
is permitted to provide non-audit services that are not, or are not
perceived to be, in conflict with auditor independence, providing it
has the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work in the
best interests of the Group. Details of the amounts paid to the
Auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in
note 8 on page 72.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of
the Audit Committee meetings to the Board and the Board receives
the agenda, papers and minutes of Audit Committee meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee members are the non-executive
Directors, namely Jeff Hewitt, Jan Oosterveld, Barry Perry and
John Sussens who chairs the Committee. The Committee’s
principal roles are to set the appropriate remuneration for the
Group Chairman, the executive Directors and the Group Secretary,
and to recommend and monitor the level and structure of
remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of
management below Board level. Further details of the activities of
the Remuneration Committee are provided in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reports the
outcome of the Remuneration Committee meetings to the Board.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee advises the Board on appointments
to, and retirements and resignations from, the Board. The members
of the Committee are the Group Chairman, the Chief Executive and
any three non-executive Directors. The Committee meets as and
when required and is chaired by the Group Chairman or a non-
executive Director . The Group Chairman would not act as Chairman
of the Committee where it was dealing with the appointment of his
successor . Formal meetings are held to consider standing items of
business; there is also a significant level of ad hoc discussion
between members of the Committee, particularly when a
recruitment exercise is taking place.
When considering the appointment of new Directors, the
Committee draws up specifications, taking into consideration the
existing balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board and
the ongoing requirements of the Group. It utilises the services of
external recruitment consultants to identify appropriate candidates,
interviews those short-listed and then makes recommendations for
each appointment to the full Board. Care is taken to ensure that all
proposed appointees have sufficient time available to devote to the
role and do not have any conflicts of interest.
OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 37 Annual Report 2008
fluctuations in the value of currencies in which it operates may
nevertheless adversely impact the Group’s financial position,
results of operations and ability to comply with its financial
covenants. Where appropriate, the Group manages its interest rate
exposures using interest rate swap agreements or other
instruments; however fluctuations in interest rates could materially
adversely impact the Group’s results of operations.
A withdrawal or reduction of precious metal consignment
arrangements, or increased metal prices resulting in
consignment lines being fully utilised, may cause a shortage of
raw materials or may require precious metals to be supplied in
a way which would materially increase the Group’s financial
indebtedness
The Group’s precious metal fabrication operations utilise
significant quantities of precious metals, primarily gold by value.
These metals are held predominantly on consignment under
arrangements the terms of which provide, inter alia, that the
consignor retains title to the metal and has a right of return over
the metal without penalty unless the consignee purchases such
metal at a market price for such metal plus a premium. Consignors
are party to either committed or uncommitted arrangements.
Under uncommitted arrangements, the consignor has no
obligation to supply the precious metal to the Group’s fabrication
operations and has the right, with limited or in some cases no
notice, to demand physical return or purchase of its consigned
metal. As the consignors retain title and associated risks and
benefits of ownership under these arrangements, the physical
metal so held is not recorded in the Group balance sheet.
The utilisation of consigned precious metals is established
practice in the precious metals industry. Should precious metals
consignors decide to reduce or withdraw the facilities for
whatever reason, or require a return of the consigned metal, or
increased metal prices lead to the consignment arrangements
becoming fully utilised, the Group’s precious metal fabrication
operations may suffer shortages of raw materials or may require
precious metals to be supplied in a way which would materially
increase the Group’s financial indebtedness. In either case, the
Group’s business, financial position and results of operations may
be materially adversely affected.
The Group’s worldwide operations and businesses may be
adversely affected by various political, legal, regulatory and
other developments in countries in which it operates
Political risks include the imposition of trade barriers, changes of
regulatory requirements and the volatility of input costs, selling
prices, taxes and currencies. The Group is subject to various legal
and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and
environmental matters. Future global political, legal or regulatory
developments concerning the businesses may affect the
businesses’ ability to operate and to operate profitably in the
affected jurisdictions. Should the Group’s businesses fail to
comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, this
may result in a financial loss or restriction on the businesses’
ability to operate.
The Group’s businesses are subject to a variety of operational
risks, including the risk of possible natural catastrophe, terrorist
action and fraud. If any of the operational risks materialise, this
could result in a substantial interruption to a facility, a potential
loss of customers and revenue and financial loss, which could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s future prospects,
financial position and results of operations.
The Group may suffer losses should a counterparty fail to perform
as contracted
The Group transacts business with and through a number of
counterparties, including customers, suppliers, financial institutions
and insurers. The financial failure of one or more of the Group’s key
customers and suppliers may result in financial loss, loss of future
business and a shortage of raw material supplies. In managing the
risks inherent in its operations, Cookson transfers risk to insurers
where cost effective and, accordingly, the financial failure of one or
more insurers used by the Group may result in a financial loss to
Cookson.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments held with or
through financial institutions give rise to credit risk, represented
by the loss that would be recognised should a counterparty fail to
perform as contracted. It is Cookson’s policy to limit the latter
counterparty exposure by dealing with reputable financial
institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those
counterparties on a regular basis in accordance with Board-
approved guidelines. However there can be no assurance that this
policy will effectively eliminate such exposure. Any counterparty
default may have a material adverse effect on Cookson’s future
prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
The Group may lose customers to competitors with new
technologies if its businesses do not adequately adapt to
market developments
The Group supplies materials and services primarily to the steel,
foundry and electronics industries on a global basis and to the
jewellery industry primarily in the US and Europe. The markets in
which many of the Group’s businesses operate can experience
rapid changes due to the introduction of new technologies. The
Group’s continued success depends upon its ability to continue to
develop and produce new and enhanced products and services on
a cost effective and timely basis in accordance with customer
demands. In addition, the markets for the Group’s products are
competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality,
product development and introduction time, customer service,
financing terms and other similar factors. Cookson invests
significant amounts in research and development to sustain its
competitive advantage and takes appropriate action to ensure that
its cost base remains competitive. If the Group fails to adequately
adapt to market developments related to new products and
technology, it could lose customers to suppliers with new
technology which allows them to supply customers with better
products or products which can be supplied more cheaply and/or
easily than Cookson’s products. Alternatively or additionally, the
Group could fail to achieve its anticipated returns on the amounts
it has invested in research and development. These outcomes could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s future prospects,
financial position and results of operations.
The Group’s future prospects, financial position and results of
operations could be adversely affected if it is unable to pass on
to its customers fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials
which it purchases
Tin, solvents, alumina, graphite, silver and gold are among the
principal raw materials that the Group purchases. The Group’s
businesses may be affected by fluctuations in the price and supply
of such raw materials. The Group’s ability to pass on increases or
decreases in the cost of raw materials to its customers is, to a large
extent, dependent upon market conditions, established market
practice and terms of trade. If the Group’s ability to pass on
Cookson Group plc 36 Annual Report 2008
Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
The financial performance and financial position of Cookson
may continue to be adversely affected by the recent weakening
in demand in its core end-markets
With operations worldwide, the Group’s businesses are subject to
various risks inherent in their international operations, including
economic, political and operational risks. The global financial
system has been experiencing severe difficulties since August
2007 and, in particular, financial markets have deteriorated
dramatically since the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers in
September 2008. This has led to a severe dislocation of financial
markets around the world and unprecedented levels of illiquidity in
the global financial system. In response to market instability and
illiquidity, a number of governments, including those of the UK,
other EU member states and the US, have intervened in order to
inject capital into, and generate additional liquidity in, financial
markets to promote stability, and, in some cases, to prevent the
failure of financial institutions. Despite such measures, the
volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets have
continued at unprecedented levels. The deterioration in financial
markets is impacting the wider global economy and recessionary
conditions are present in the UK, other EU member states and the
US, as well as in other countries where Cookson operates. The
deteriorating economic situation has been evidenced by the very
significant reduction in global steel production which occurred
during the fourth quarter of 2008 and which has had a very
significant negative impact on demand for Cookson’s ceramic
refractory products which are consumable products used in the
production of steel and which represent Cookson’s largest single
end-market. There is currently considerable uncertainty as to the
timing and strength of any upturn in global steel production, and
hence demand for Cookson’s ceramic refractory products. End-
market conditions in industries that are important for Cookson’s
other businesses, notably consumer electronics, automotive,
foundry castings and retail jewellery, are also currently weak.
The precise nature of all the risks and uncertainties Cookson
faces as a result of the current global financial and economic
crisis cannot be predicted and many of these risks are outside
Cookson’s control. If these levels of market disruption and
volatility continue, worsen or are extended, Cookson may
experience further reductions in trading activity, a lower share
price, the financial failure of one or more of its key customers and
suppliers, asset impairments, lower profitability and a material
adverse impact on its financial position. Even if the current
market disruption and volatility abates, a global recession or
deeper recessionary conditions in one or more countries
significant to Cookson’s businesses may adversely impact
Cookson’s earnings and financial position.
Cookson’s main businesses have very short-term order books
which limits management’s visibility for forecasting purposes
and hence required management actions may change
Cookson’s divisions predominantly supply consumable products,
on short lead times, to the global steel, foundry, electronics and
precious metals industries. As such the Group’s expectations of
future trading are based upon the Directors’ assessment of end-
market conditions, which conditions are subject to greater
uncertainty than usual in the current economic climate. This
assessment, in turn, sets the context in which management has
developed its planned cost-reduction and restructuring actions
and measures to respond to market conditions. In the event that
end-market conditions evolve outside the range of current
expectations, the required management actions may have to be
substantially modified from those currently envisaged, involving
significant additional costs and adversely impacting the Group’s
financial position and which may include management having to
deal with there being insufficient headroom under the financial
covenants in Cookson’s debt facilities.
Cookson’s cash generation and restructuring plans may not
achieve their goals and may cost more than anticipated
Cookson has initiated various cash generation and restructuring
actions which are described in the Operating Review on pages 12
to 21. In total, this cost saving programme is expected to result in
annualised savings of £40 million (of which £30 million is anticipated
to be realised in 2009 and an incremental £10 million in 2010), with
associated one-off cash costs of £27 million being incurred in the
first half of 2009. However , there can be no assurance that the
restructuring costs will not exceed present expectations or that
expected savings will be realised. Additionally, the cost savings may
take longer to realise than expected. In particular , a number of issues
may result in cost overruns or cost savings being reduced or taking
longer to achieve than expected, for example, certain restructuring
actions are subject to matters which are not within the control of the
Group; such as works council consultation or labour laws which may
delay redundancy plans. If the restructuring costs escalate and/or
the Group fails to achieve the expected savings in the expected
timeframe, this could adversely impact the Group’s future prospects
and results of operations.
Financial indebtedness could limit Cookson’s operational
flexibility, particularly in the difficult economic and industry
conditions
The existing level of Cookson’s financial indebtedness and gearing,
combined with covenants contained in its principal debt facility
agreements, could: limit flexibility in the management of the Group;
place Cookson at a competitive disadvantage compared to any
competitors that have less debt; increase Cookson’s vulnerability
to, and limit its ability to withstand, continued adverse economic
and industry conditions as well as to withstand downturns in
demand for its products; and affect its ability to obtain raw
materials, particularly precious metals, on a consignment basis.
Cookson has no significant debt maturities in 2009 and intends to
reduce and/or refinance its financial indebtedness on commercially
acceptable terms when it falls due beyond the next 12 months. If it
is unable to do this, its future prospects, financial position and
results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
The Group’s financial position and trading results may be
adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, interest
rates or the rate of inflation
The Group has no control over changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, or inflation and interest rates. In the normal course
of business, many transactions are carried out by Group businesses
in currencies other than their reporting currency, leading to
transactional foreign exchange risk, although this is not material
for the Group overall. It is Cookson’s policy that foreign currency
transaction exposures that are material at an individual operating
unit level are hedged using appropriate instruments such as
forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group does not currently
hedge translation exposures arising on unremitted non-UK
earnings. While the Group attempts to manage transactional and
balance sheet translation risks associated with currency exchange
rate fluctuations through its hedging and funding policies,
OUR GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED) Cookson Group plc 39 Annual Report 2008
indemnifications, representations and warranties, however,
significant liabilities arising out of these transactions may arise in
the future which have not been provided for and the emergence of
such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
financial position and results of operations.
The funding level of the Group’s pension plans and the Group’s
liabilities in respect of its post-retirement healthcare plans may
be detrimentally affected by adverse changes in the actuarial
assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and/or a decline in
the market value of plan investments
The Group operates defined benefit pension and other post-
retirement plans, principally in the UK and the US, the valuation of
which resulted in a net deficit of £95.3 million as at 31 December
2008. The Group’s largest defined benefit pension plans are in the
UK and the US, each of which is closed to new members, with the
Group’s largest US plans also being closed to further benefit accrual
for existing members. The Group’s main pension plan is its UK plan.
The calculation of plan liabilities using a discount rate based on the
yield on high quality corporate bonds, as required by international
accounting standards, resulted in a surplus of £70.0 million being
reported for the plan as at 31 December 2008. The use of a lower
discount rate for actuarial valuation and funding purposes results in
the plan being in deficit and a deficit-reduction plan has been
agreed with the plan Trustee under which additional future cash
contributions will be made which have been calculated to reduce to
zero the deficit calculated in the last formal actuarial valuation of
the UK plan. To reduce future volatility in the UK plan deficit, the UK
plan Trustee, with support from Cookson, entered into swap
arrangements and an equity hedge in 2006 to mitigate the impact
of changes in interest rates and inflation on the UK plan’s liabilities
and volatility in the equity performance of the plan’s assets.
The funding level of the Group’s pension plans and the Group’s
liabilities in respect of its post-retirement healthcare plans are
subject to adverse change resulting from movements in the
actuarial assumptions underlying the calculation of plan liabilities,
including decreasing discount rates, increasing longevity of plan
members and, in the case of pension plans, a decline in the market
value of plan investments. Adverse changes in these underlying
factors could materially impact the Group’s financial position.
Additional funding contributions into the Group’s UK defined
benefit pension plan may need to be made in response to a
request from the plan Trustee should the Group’s financial
position deteriorate to a level which, in the opinion of the
Trustee, materially impacts its financial covenant from Cookson
The Trustee of the Group’s UK pension plan is responsible, in
consultation with Cookson, for setting the level of funding
contributions into the plan. The schedule of contributions currently
in place aims at funding, by the end of June 2015, the plan deficit
disclosed in the most recent actuarial valuation. This schedule of
contributions is underwritten by the Trustee’s assessment of the
strength of the employer’s covenant between Cookson and the
Trustee, being the Trustee’s assessment of Cookson’s ability to
meet those future funding payments as they fall due. Should
Cookson’s financial position deteriorate materially for whatever
reason, the Trustee may demand, in consultation with Cookson, an
increase in funding contributions to fund part or the whole of any
outstanding funding deficit in the plan at that time. Additional
funding contributions paid to meet such a demand could have a
material adverse impact on the financial position of Cookson.
Depending on performance and market conditions, Cookson
may not pay out cash dividends in the foreseeable future, or
may pay out smaller dividends than the market expects
The Board has recently reviewed Cookson’s near-term dividend
policy in response to the ongoing global financial crisis and
increasingly challenging trading conditions. As a consequence no
final dividend for the 2008 financial year will be recommended to
shareholders. The decision as to whether to declare an interim
dividend in respect of the 2009 financial year will be made in
August 2009 and will be based on the Group’s trading and financial
position and the global economic outlook at that time. Cookson
intends to suspend the payment of dividends until there is clear
evidence of market recovery. There can be no assurance as to
whether cash dividends or similar payments will be paid out in the
foreseeable future or of their amount.
Cookson Group plc 38 Annual Report 2008
Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
increases in the cost of raw materials is limited, this could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s future prospects, financial
position and results of operations.
The Group’s financial condition may be materially adversely
affected by any significant liabilities for any defects of its
products or services
A large proportion of the Group’s products are used in the
manufacturing processes of the Group’s industrial customers. If a
product of the Group or of one of the Group’s industrial customers
does not conform to agreed specifications or is otherwise
defective, the Group may be subject to claims by its customers
arising from end-product defects, injury to individuals or other
such claims.
The Group’s current and former businesses have used and/or
continue to use a wide range of hazardous materials, in the
manufacture of industrial and consumer products. Legal claims
have been brought against certain Group companies by third
parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to
such materials, and further claims may be brought in the future.
Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to suits,
predominantly in the US, relating to products containing asbestos
manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the
Group. These suits usually also name many other product
manufacturers. To date, the Group is not aware of there being any
liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries. Provision is
made for amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs.
Management believes, taking into account legal advice received,
the Group’s insurance arrangements, indemnification provided by
former owners of certain of the subsidiaries impacted and
financial provisions, that none of the currently pending or
potential claims will, either individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial position and
results of operations. However, the outcome of legal action is
uncertain and there is always the risk that it may prove more
costly than expected and exceed the level of insurance cover,
indemnifications and provisions made, which may have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s future prospects, financial position
and results of operations.
The Group may suffer a loss of future revenue or an adverse
impact on its cashflows if it does not successfully integrate
Foseco into its existing operational structure
The acquisition of Foseco was completed on 4 April 2008. The
retained Foseco businesses are now managed within Cookson’s
Ceramics division. The global integration process is proceeding
well, resulting in the original synergy target of £18 million of
annualised cost savings being increased to a synergy target of £24
million of annualised cost savings per annum to be realised by
2010. There can be no assurance that the Group will successfully
integrate Foseco into its existing operational structure. There are
risks associated with diversion of management’s attention from
other aspects of the business, unanticipated events or liabilities,
and difficulties in relation to retaining key personnel or assimilating
operations. If such issues did arise, they may have an adverse
impact on Cookson’s operating results and financial position.
If the Group fails or is unable to protect, maintain and enforce
its intellectual property, the Group may lose its exclusive right
to use its technologies and processes
The Group relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents,
confidentiality procedures and agreements, and copyright and
trade mark laws to protect its proprietary rights. The existence of
complex factual and legal issues may give rise to uncertainty as to
the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent or
practice. If the Group fails to or is unable to protect, maintain and
enforce its existing intellectual property, this may result in the loss
of the Group’s exclusive right to use technologies and processes
which are included or used in its businesses. In addition, the laws of
certain foreign countries in which the Group operates may not
protect proprietary rights to the same extent as those of the UK
or the US.
The Group has applied for patents in a number of
jurisdictions, including in Europe and the US. These applications
are at various stages in the application process and patents may
not be issued, or may be issued in a form narrower than the
Group’s applications. If some of the patents or patent applications
are not granted, expire or are successfully attacked, the Group
may be unable to exclude competitors from using the technology
covered by them.
The Group has also acquired patents and patent applications
from other parties. The Group could become subject to lawsuits in
which it is alleged that it has infringed the intellectual property
rights of others or the Group could commence lawsuits against
others whom it believes are infringing upon its rights. The Group’s
involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in
significant expense, materially adversely affecting the
development of sales of the challenged product or intellectual
property and/or diverting the efforts of the Group’s technical and
management personnel.
Future expenditure on compliance with environmental and health
and safety laws and regulations may materially adversely affect
the Group’s future prospects, financial position and results of
operations
The Group is subject to applicable laws and regulations in all of the
jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to
pollution, the protection of the environment, human health and
safety, the disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials
and remediation of any land or water contaminated by such
substances. Violations of legal or other regulatory requirements
could result in restrictions on operations, the imposition of more
stringent permitting conditions, damages, fines or other sanctions
all of which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
future prospects, financial position and results of operations. While
the Board believes that the current and expected expenditures and
risks connected with these and potential future liabilities are
unlikely to impair the Group’s financial position materially, there
can be no assurance that the costs related to such liabilities will not
exceed current or future financial and insurance provisions which
may result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s future
prospects, financial position and results of operations.
The Group’s financial position and results of operations may be
materially adversely affected by any significant liabilities
arising pursuant to indemnities or breaches of representations
or warranties in contracts for the divestment of certain of its
former companies and businesses
The Group has divested its interests in certain companies and
businesses and has given indemnifications, representations and
warranties with respect to the businesses of the divested companies
at the time of their divestment. Management believes that sufficient
provisions are in place to meet possible claims resulting from these

Accountability and audit
A responsibility statement of the Directors and a statement by
the Auditor about its reporting responsibilities can be found on
pages 52 and 53, respectively. The Directors fulfil the
responsibilities set out in their statement within the context of an
overall control environment of central strategic direction and
decentralised operating responsibility.
Disclosure of information to the Auditor
As at the date of this report, so far as each Director of the
Company is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
the Company’s Auditor is unaware and each Director hereby
confirms that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is
aware of that information.
Auditor
Resolutions for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as Auditor
of the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine its
remuneration are to be proposed at the AGM.
Remuneration matters
The Directors’ Remuneration Report appears on pages 45 to 51.
Neither of the executive Directors’ contracts contains any change
of control provisions.
Remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive Directors
The Board considers the remuneration policy for the non-
executive Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees have not been
increased during the year and remain at £40,000 per annum. A
supplementary fee is payable to the Chairman of the Audit
Committee of £15,000 per annum and the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee receives a supplementary fee of
£10,000 per annum. A supplementary fee of £5,000 per annum
is also payable to the Senior Independent Director. No changes
were made in 2008 to the supplementary fees payable.
The Group Chairman’s remuneration, which is subject to
periodic review, is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
There was no change to the Group Chairman’s remuneration,
during the year. Neither the Group Chairman, who is not an
executive Director, nor the other non-executive Directors are
members of the Group’s pension plans, nor do they participate in

Messrs Beeston, Butterworth, Hewitt, Perry, Oosterveld, Salmon
and Sussens all served as Directors of the Company during the
year. Biographical information for the Directors of the Company,
who served during the year, is given on page 31. Messrs Beeston,
Butterworth and Hewitt will retire at the AGM and will offer
themselves for re-election. Further information on the service
agreements of the executive Directors, including Mr Butterworth,
is given on page 48. The non-executive Directors, including
Messrs Beeston and Hewitt, do not have such agreements.
Legal matters
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group
Secretary. There is also an agreed procedure in place for
Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent
legal advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Directors’ indemnities
To the extent permitted by section 236 of the Companies Act
2006, the Directors have been granted Qualifying Third Party
Indemnity Provisions by the Company and the directors of the
Group’s UK Pension Plan trustee board have been granted
Qualifying Pension Scheme Indemnity Provisions by Cookson
Pension Plans Trustees Ltd.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Following approval at the 2008 AGM, the Company’s Articles of
Association were amended with effect from 1 October 2008, to
take account of certain provisions of the Companies Act 2006
relating to directors’ conflicts of interest which came into effect
on that date. These provisions permit the Board to consider and,
if thought fit, to authorise situations where a Director has an
interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests
of the Company (‘Situational Conflicts’). The Board has
established a formal system for Directors to declare Situational
Conflicts so that they can be considered for authorisation by the
remaining members of the Board. In deciding whether to
authorise a Situational Conflict, the non-conflicted Directors are
required to act in the way they consider would be most likely to
promote the success of the Company, and they may impose limits
or conditions when giving authorisation or subsequently if they
think this is appropriate. The Group Secretary minutes the
consideration of any conflict and records the details of any
authorisations granted.
Employment policies
A fundamental concept embodied in the Company’s Code of
Conduct is that Cookson’s goals can only be met through the
efforts of its employees. Cookson recognises that job satisfaction
requires working environments that motivate employees to be
productive and innovative and provide opportunities for
employee training and development to maximise personal
potential and develop careers within the Group.
Cookson is managed on a decentralised basis and within each
division it is the responsibility of the relevant divisional Chief
Executive to adopt employment policies and practices that best
suit the size, style and geographical location of their operations.
This allows the Group’s operations to respond competitively to
changes in the marketplace and to develop and retain a strong
sense of identity whilst benefiting from being a part of a major
international group. Cookson values the involvement of its
employees and keeps them informed on matters affecting them
as employees and factors relevant to Group performance.
It is established policy throughout Cookson that decisions on
recruitment, career development, training, promotion and other
employment-related issues are made solely on the grounds of
individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct. These
principles are operated on a non-discriminatory basis. Cookson
gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment
from disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled
during their employment with Cookson, every effort is made to
enable them to continue their service with the Group.
Cookson Group plc 40 Annual Report 2008
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the
audited accounts of the Group and of the Company, Cookson
Group plc, for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Chief Executive’s Review, the Operating Review, the
Financial Review, the Director’s Remuneration Report, and the
Corporate Governance, the Corporate Social Responsibility and
Board of Directors sections of the Annual Report are each
incorporated by reference into, and form part of, this Directors’
Report.
The Annual Report contains certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the operations, performance and
financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these statements
involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can
cause results and developments to differ materially from those
anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge
and information available at the date of preparation of this Annual
Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update
these forward-looking statements. Nothing in this Annual Report
should be construed as a profit forecast.
Principal activities
Cookson Group plc is a leading materials science company which
provides materials, processes and services to customers
worldwide. The Group’s operations are formed into three divisions
– Ceramics, Electronics and Precious Metals. Trading under the
Vesuvius and Foseco brand names, Cookson’s Ceramics division is
the world leader in the supply of advanced consumable products
and systems to the global steel and foundry industries and a
leading supplier of specialist ceramic products to the glass and
solar industries. It is also a regional leader in the US, UK and
Australia in the supply and installation of monolithic refractory
linings. The Electronics division is a leading supplier of advanced
surface treatment and plating chemicals and assembly materials
to the electronics, automotive and construction markets. It
comprises two product lines: Assembly Materials and Chemistry.
The Precious Metals division is a leading supplier of fabricated
precious metals (primarily gold, silver and platinum) to the
jewellery industry in the US, the UK, France and Spain. Products
include alloy materials, semi-finished jewellery components and
finished jewellery.
Business review
As required by the Companies Act 2006, the Company must
provide a fair review of the development and performance of the
Group during 2008, its financial position at the end of the year
and likely future developments in the Group’s business, together
with information on environmental matters and employees and a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
Group. The information which satisfies these requirements is to
be found in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 10 and 11; the
Operating Review on pages 12 to 21; the Financial Review on
pages 22 to 27; the Corporate Responsibility and Health, Safety
and Environmental Statements on pages 28 and 29; the Key
Performance Indicators on page 7; and the Corporate Governance
Report on pages 32 to 39.
Going concern
The financial statements of the Company and the Group,
respectively, have been prepared on a going concern basis as
the Directors consider that the Company and the Group
have adequate resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future.
Information on the business environment in which the Group
operates, including the factors that are likely to impact the future
prospects of the Group, are included in the Chief Executive’s
Review and the Operating Review. The principal risks and
uncertainties that the Group faces throughout its global
operations are included in the Corporate Governance Report. The
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position
and debt facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition,
notes 4 and 37 to the consolidated financial statements set out
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its
capital; financial risks; financial instruments and hedging
activities; and its exposures to credit, market (both currency and
interest rate-related) and liquidity risk. Further details of the
Group’s cash balances and borrowings are included in notes 20
and 36 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has two committed debt facilities, approximately
£680 million of syndicated bank facilities and approximately
£250 million of US Private Placement loan notes. These facilities,
which together total approximately £930 million, have no
significant debt maturities in 2009, with the principal maturities
due in 2011 and 2012. These debt facilities contain a number of
financial covenants with which the Group is required to comply. In
March 2009, the Group completed a rights issue which raised
proceeds (net of expenses) of £241 million which were used to
repay gross borrowings. The rights issue significantly strengthens
the Group's financial position.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group
for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of approval
of the 2008 financial statements. These forecasts reflect an
assessment of current end-market conditions, their impact on the
Group's future trading performance and the actions taken by
management in response to the difficult market conditions. The
forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group will be able
to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show
continued compliance with the financial covenants. In addition,
management has considered various mitigating actions that
could be taken in the event that end-market conditions are worse
than their current assessment. Such measures include further
reductions in costs, further reductions in capital expenditure and
further reductions in those items of working capital within
management's control.
On the basis of the exercise as described above and the
available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
forseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group
and the Company.
Dividends
The Board has recently reviewed Cookson’s near-term dividend
policy in response to the ongoing global financial crisis and
challenging trading conditions. As a consequence no final dividend
for the 2008 financial year will be recommended to shareholders
and dividend payments will be suspended until such time as the
Group’s end-markets have recovered sufficiently. The cash cost of
dividend payments in 2008 was £31 million. A decision to resume
dividend payments will be made once a clear recovery can be seen
in our end-markets and trading performance, and in the context of
the Group’s cash requirements at that time.
An interim dividend of 0.88p (2007: 0.64p) per ordinary share
was paid on 13 October 2008 to shareholders on the register at
OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 43 Annual Report 2008
approval of HM Revenue & Customs and/or the Company’s Auditor .
Since the year end, no ordinary shares have been issued as a
result of exercises of options granted under the Company’s share
option schemes. Resolutions giving the Directors the authority to
allot further shares and make allotments of shares to persons
other than existing shareholders in certain circumstances will
again be proposed at the AGM.
Additional information for shareholders
Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Company’s
current Articles and applicable English law concerning companies
(the Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act 2006, together
the ‘Companies Acts’). This is a summary only and the relevant
provisions of the Articles or the Companies Acts should be
consulted if further information is required. Certain amendments
will be proposed to the Articles at the Company’s Annual General
Meeting to be held on 14 May 2009, to be effective 1 October 2009,
as explained in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting. A copy
of the Company’s current Articles, marked up to show the
proposed amendments, will be available for inspection from 8
April 2009 until the close of the AGM, during business hours at the
Company’s registered office and at the offices of Linklaters LLP,
the Company’s solicitors, at One Silk Street, London, EC2Y 8HQ,
England. They will also be available for inspection at the place of
meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the AGM.
Authority for purchase of own shares
Subject to the provisions of Company law and any other
applicable regulations, the Company may purchase its own
shares. Although it may not purchase or enter into a contract to
purchase any convertible shares, unless the terms of issue of
such convertible shares include provisions permitting the
Company to purchase its own equity shares or providing for
adjustment to the conversion terms upon such a purchase; or the
purchase, or the contract, has first been approved by an ordinary
resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of such
convertible shares.
At the 2008 AGM, shareholders gave the Company renewed
authority to make market purchases of up to a maximum of 10%
at that time of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at
the date of this report, the Company has made no such purchases
under this authority. The Directors believe it advisable to seek
renewal of this authority at each AGM.
The Company’s Articles specify that, subject to the
authorisation of an appropriate resolution passed by a general
meeting of the Company, Directors can allot relevant securities
under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, up to the aggregate
nominal amount specified by that Act. In addition, the Articles
state that the Directors can seek the authority of shareholders in
general meeting to allot equity securities for cash without first
being required to offer such shares to existing ordinary
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings in
connection with a rights issue and in other circumstances up to
an aggregate nominal amount as specified in Section 89(1) of the
Companies Act 1985.
Transfer of shares
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be
effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in
any other form acceptable to the Directors and may be under
hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on
behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully-paid
shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor will
remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the
transferee is entered in the Register of members. All instruments
of transfer which are registered may be retained by the Company.
Provided that the Directors may dispense with the execution of
the instrument of transfer by the transferee in any case in which
they think fit in their discretion to do so. All transfers of shares
which are in uncertificated form may be effected by means of the
CREST system.
The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of
transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it is in respect
of only one class of share and is lodged (duly stamped if required)
at the place where the Company’s Register is located accompanied
by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the
Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer
is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of
that person so to do). In the case of a transfer by a recognised
clearing house, or by a nominee of a recognised clearing house or
of a recognised investment exchange, the lodgement of share
certificates will only be necessary if and to the extent that
certificates have been issued in respect of the shares in question.
The Directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form,
in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason,
refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being fully-paid
shares) provided that such discretion may not be exercised in
such a way as to prevent dealings in the shares of that class from
taking place on an open and proper basis. The Directors may also
refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether
fully-paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. If the
Directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares
they shall within two months after the date on which the letter of
allotment or instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company
or the operator instruction was received by Cookson (in the case
of shares held in uncertificated form) send to the allottee or
transferee notice of the refusal.
A shareholder does not generally need to obtain the approval
of the Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the
Company, for a transfer to take place.
The Articles contain certain restrictions on the number of US
persons who hold shares in the Company so as to enable the
Company to suspend its obligations under the US Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and to prevent any such obligations from
arising again in the near future.
Voting rights
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or
restrictions attached to any class of shares, at a shareholders’
meeting, every shareholder who is present in person and every duly
appointed proxy shall have one vote on a show of hands, and on a
poll every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall
have one vote for every ordinary share of which he or she is the
holder . In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior
holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and
for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which
the names stand in the share register . A shareholder entitled to
attend and vote at a shareholders’ meeting is entitled to appoint a
proxy or proxies to exercise all or any of his or her rights to attend
and speak and vote in his or her place. A shareholder may appoint
more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting provided
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a
Cookson Group plc 42 Annual Report 2008
Pensions
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension
arrangements in place are considered to be consistent with good
employment practice in that particular area. Independent
advisers are used to ensure that the plans are operated in
accordance with local legislation and the rules of each plan.
Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets in
its own businesses. Outside the UK, the US, Germany, the
Netherlands and Belgium, the majority of pension plans in the
Group are of a defined contribution nature.
The Group’s UK defined benefit plan and main US defined
benefit plans are closed to new entrants and the Group’s largest
US defined benefit pension plans have ceased providing future
benefit accrual, with members instead being provided with
benefit through a defined contribution plan. Benefit accrual
under the Group’s UK defined benefit pension plan continues for
those employees who joined prior to the closure of the plan to
new entrants. Defined contribution plans exist for new employees
in the UK and the US.
For the Group’s UK defined benefit and defined contribution
plans a trustee board exists comprising employees, former
employees and an independent trustee. The board currently
comprises six trustee directors, of whom two are member-
nominated. Following the merger of the Foseco Pension Fund into
the Cookson Group Pension Plan on 1 January 2009, steps are
being taken to appoint a third member-nominated trustee
director from the membership of the former Foseco Fund. The
administration of each plan is outsourced.
The Company is mindful of its obligations under the Pensions
Act 2004 and of the need to comply with the guidance issued by
the Pensions Regulator. Regular dialogue is maintained between
the Company and the Trustee board of the UK plans to ensure
that both Company and Trustee are apprised of the same
financial and other information about the Group and the plans
which is pertinent to each being able to contribute to the
effective functioning of the plans. The Company currently has in
place a schedule of contributions, agreed with the Trustee board,
which aims to reduce to zero the deficit existing on the UK
defined benefit plan as at 31 December 2006 by July 2015. The
adequacy of this schedule of contributions will be monitored over
time, so as to assess the need for it to be modified in the light of
changes in the deficit position.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust for the
exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries.
An independent financial institution acts as the Trustee. The trust
assets are protected by law and by Federal Government
Regulation and are subject to annual audit by an independent
accountant, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of
Labor.
Further details of pension arrangements are given in note 38
on pages 94 to 102.
Donations
Donations in the UK for charitable purposes totalled £nil (2007:
£0.1m); and such donations throughout the Group totalled £nil
(2007: £0.1m). In accordance with Company policy, no political
donations were made in either 2008 or 2007.
Creditor payment policy
Each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing
the terms and conditions under which business transactions with
their suppliers are conducted. It is Group policy that payments to
suppliers are made in accordance with these terms, provided that
the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms and conditions.
In the accounts of the Company as at 31 December 2008, the
number of days’ purchases outstanding was 21 (2007: 9 days).
Significant agreements
The terms of the Group’s committed bank facility and US
Private Placement loan notes contain provisions entitling the
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event
of a change of control on takeover of the Company. A number of
other arrangements to which the Company and its subsidiaries are
party, such as other debt arrangements and share incentive plans,
may alter or terminate on a change of control in the event of a
takeover . In the context of the Group as a whole, these other
arrangements are not considered to be significant.
Events after the balance sheet date
Under the terms of a fully underwritten rights issue, ordinary
shareholders of the Company on the register at the close of
business on 13 February 2009 were offered, 2,551,293,144 new
ordinary shares on the basis of twelve new ordinary shares for each
existing ordinary share held. These shares were fully subscribed,
resulting in total proceeds on issue of £241m, net of expenses.
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the Company has an issued share
capital of 2,763,900,906 ordinary shares of 10 pence each, being
the total number of Cookson Group plc shares with voting rights.
The Company currently has only one class of shares.
Following the increase in the Company’s issued share capital
as a result of the rights issue, the Directors consider it desirable
to consolidate the ordinary shares of the Company. A resolution
is therefore being proposed at the forthcoming AGM to allow the
Company’s ordinary shares to be consolidated on the basis of
1 new share for each 10 existing shares. It is anticipated that this
will reduce the volatility in the share price. At the current level
small absolute movements in the share price represent large
percentage movements resulting in considerable volatility. In
addition, the Directors believe that the bid-offer spread on shares
prices at low absolute levels can be disproportionate to the share
price to the detriment of shareholders.
Details of movements in the Company’s issued share capital
during 2008 are given in note 13 to the Company financial
statements on page 117.
The Company operates a number of share-based share
incentive plans (further details about these are given in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report). For the majority of these plans
the Company can satisfy entitlements either by the acquisition of
existing shares or by the issue of new shares. Existing shares are
held in an employee share ownership trust (‘ESOP’). The trustees
of the ESOP purchase shares in the open market as required, to
enable the Company to meet liabilities for the provision of
existing shares to satisfy awards that vest. The trustees do not
register votes in respect of these shares.
The Directors are considering what adjustments, if any, it
would be appropriate to make to outstanding share-based
incentives as a result of the rights issue, including to the number
of shares granted under options and awards and to the exercise
price, if any, of those options and awards, and any relevant
performance conditions. Any such adjustments shall be made in
accordance with the rules of the relevant plan and, where required
by relevant plan rules, adjustments shall be made with the prior
OUR GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) Cookson Group plc 45 Annual Report 2008
OUR GOVERNANCE
The Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) is responsible for
setting the appropriate remuneration for the Group Chairman, the
executive Directors and the Group Secretary, and recommending
and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior
management, being the first layer of management below Board
level. A copy of the Committee’s Terms of Reference is available on
the Company’s website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
The current members of the Committee are all the non-
executive Directors, namely Jeff Hewitt, Jan Oosterveld, Barry
Perry and John Sussens, who also chairs the Committee. All the
members of the Committee are deemed to be independent. The
Group Secretary acts as Committee Secretary. The Chairman,
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are invited to attend
Committee meetings as appropriate.
In formulating its policies and deciding individual remuneration
levels, the Committee was advised during the year by the Chief
Executive, the Group Secretary and by the external advisers Kepler
Associates (‘KA’) and Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’), and the
law firm Clifford Chance LLP (‘CC’). KA and HNBS were appointed
directly by the Committee and CC was appointed by the Company
on the Committee’s behalf. HNBS and CC also provide other limited
advice to the Company, in their specialist areas of share award
valuation and share schemes respectively.
Remuneration policy for executive Directors
The Committee has established employment and remuneration
practices for the Company’s executive Directors aimed at fostering
a high performance culture. In formulating remuneration policy, the
Committee has regard to the international scale and nature of the
Group’s operations and takes into consideration guidelines issued
by its leading shareholders and bodies such as the Institutional
Shareholders’ Committee, the Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’)
and the National Association of Pension Funds. The remuneration
packages of the executive Directors are benchmarked against their
peers and have been designed to ensure that a substantial
proportion of remuneration is linked to performance.
The Committee considers the efficacy of the Group’s executive
remuneration policy each year and commissions more formal
reviews as it considers appropriate. The last such comprehensive
review was undertaken in 2006, when KA were asked to review the
Group’s executive remuneration policy to ensure that it continued
to provide a strong alignment with the delivery of value to
shareholders and reflected market best practice. The review
demonstrated that the overall remuneration package was
competitive in terms of both structure and quantum. However , the
review concluded that certain changes should be made to the
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). Further information on these
changes, which were made in 2007 , is given below.
Annual salary and benefits in kind
Base salary is set by reference to market rates in the relevant
country for jobs of similar complexity and responsibility. The
Chairman’s fee and the salaries of the Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director are benchmarked against salaries within two
FTSE 250 comparator groups, the first focusing on sector
comparators and the second on companies of similar size. The
salaries of the executive Directors are normally reviewed on
1 January each year . In response to market conditions the executive
Directors’ approved 2009 salary increases of 4% have been
deferred until 1 July 2009, in line with an extensive Group salary
freeze for the first half of 2009.
Benefits in kind receivable by the executive Directors
principally comprise company car allowances, life assurance
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
benefits and medical insurance. These benefits are similar to
those provided to other Company executives in the UK.
Variable remuneration
The remuneration programme is structured such that variable,
performance-related remuneration potentially represents more
than half of total remuneration.
Annual incentive
In line with the Group’s other senior executives, the executive
Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as
a percentage of base salary and based on achievement against
specified financial targets. Each year the Committee establishes
the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year. These
criteria are set by reference to the Group’s financial budget and
prior year actual financial results. The Committee considers that
attainment of these targets is important in the context of
achievement of the Group’s longer-term, strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance
below which no award is paid, a target level at which executive
Directors are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their base
salary and a maximum performance level at which a maximum
award worth 100% of base salary is earned.
For the financial year 2008, the executive Directors’ annual
incentive was based on Group headline earnings performance,
the calculation of which is shown in note 18 to the consolidated
financial statements. For 2008, performance was slightly over the
threshold level and so annual bonuses equivalent to 15% of base
salary will be paid to the executive Directors for 2008. These are
reported in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 49.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for 2009
the executive Directors’ annual incentive will again be based on
Group headline earnings.
LTIP and other share incentive plans
The LTIP was introduced in 2004 and is the only long-term
incentive plan under which awards are made to the executive
Directors. It rewards executives for delivering superior Total
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), defined as the increase in the value
of a share, including re-invested dividends, and (from 2007
onwards) headline earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth, and as such
is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders’
interests.
The LTIP has two elements: firstly, executive Directors are
eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth
up to 100% of base salary (‘Performance Shares’); secondly,
executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their annual
incentive in ordinary shares of the Company (‘Investment Shares’)
in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares
worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the annual
incentive so invested (‘Matching Share Award’).
The LTIP was amended with shareholder approval on
17 February 2009 so that shares purchased by executives under
a rights issue can be designated as Investment Shares and qualify
for a Matching Share Award. The value of the Matching Share
Award relating to shares purchased under a rights issue will, as
with any other Matching Share Award, be increased as if the
executive had invested a pre-tax amount in shares under the
rights issue. The executive Directors will be required to retain all
of the Cookson ordinary shares that they held at the time of the
rights issue for a period of 36 months after the rights issue in
order for a Matching Share Award based on shares purchased in
the rights issue to be able to vest.
Cookson Group plc 44 Annual Report 2008
Voting rights (continued)
different share or shares held by the shareholder. Proxies need
not be shareholders the Company. For the purposes of
determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a
meeting and how many votes such person may cast, the Company
may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 48
hours before the time fixed for the meeting, by which a person
must be entered on the Share Register in order to have the right
to attend or vote at the meeting.
Restrictions on shares
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of dividends
or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from
a person with 0.25 percent interest or more if such person has
been served with a notice after failure to provide the Company
with information concerning interest in those shares required to
be provided under the Companies Acts.
Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any
class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders
of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares
of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a
separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. At every
such separate general meeting the quorum shall be two persons
holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value
of the issued shares of the class. The rights conferred upon the
holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided
in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by
the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Restrictions on voting
No shareholder shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine,
be entitled in respect of any share held by him or her to vote
either personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable
by him or her to the Company in respect of that share remains
unpaid. In addition, if any member, or any other person appearing
to be interested in shares held by such member, has been duly
served with a notice to provide the Company with information
under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and has failed to
do so within 14 days, then (unless the Directors otherwise
determine) the member shall not (for so long as the default
continues) be entitled to attend or vote either personally or by
proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right
conferred by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Company shall have no less than five and no more than
fifteen Directors. The Company may by ordinary resolution from
time to time vary the minimum number and/or maximum number
of Directors. At each AGM all those Directors who were elected or
last re-elected at or before the AGM held in the third calendar
year before the current year shall retire from office by rotation.
A retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election. The Board may
appoint any person to be a Director (so long as the total number
of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in these
Articles). Any such Director shall only hold office until the next
AGM and shall then be eligible for election.
Amendment of Articles of Association
The Company may make amendments to the Articles of the
Company by way of special resolution in accordance with the

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED) Cookson Group plc 47 Annual Report 2008
OUR GOVERNANCE
Cookson Group plc 46 Annual Report 2008
The Group’s headline EPS will be calculated on a consistent basis and the Committee will have discretion to adjust for exceptional
items as it deems appropriate. Growth in headline EPS will be annualised percentage growth over the performance period (comparing
headline EPS for the base year, the calendar year prior to the award date, with the final year, the calendar year three years after the
base year), expressed as compound annual growth, above the compound annual growth in RPI.
Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee has also stipulated that, as an additional hurdle, it needs to be satisfied that
vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period.
Allocations were made under the LTIP to the executive Directors in March 2008, as shown on page 50. Messrs Butterworth and
Salmon purchased Investment Shares under the Matching Share element of the LTIP in 2008.
In addition to the executive Directors, senior divisional and corporate executives are allocated Performance Shares under the LTIP
and members of the Group’s Executive Committee and senior corporate executives are also given the opportunity to participate in the
Matching Share element.
In prior years, the Group operated a number of other executive and all-employee share plans under which certain awards and
options are outstanding, although neither of the current executive Directors holds options or awards under these plans. Under the
executive share option schemes the Company granted share options, with an option exercise price fixed by reference to the market
price prevailing at the time of grant, the exercise of which were subject to an EPS performance condition. The last executive share
option grant was made in 2003 and the Company does not intend to make any further grants under the schemes. The Company
operated two all-employee share plans, the UK and International Sharesave Plans which were closed to new participants in 2004.
Further details of the awards and options outstanding under these share plans are given in note 39 to the consolidated financial
statements.
In 2007, the Company implemented a Deferred Bonus Plan in place of the LTIP for certain corporate managers. Under this plan,
executives receive an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. These shares, which will be
sourced from existing shares, will vest after three years, although an executive’s allocation may lapse if he or she ceases employment
in certain circumstances before the end of the three-year period. The executive Directors do not participate in this plan.
The Directors are considering what adjustments, if any, it would be appropriate to make to oustanding share-based incentives as a result
of the rights issue, including to the number of shares granted under outstanding options or awards, to any associated exercise price and to
the calculation of any applicable performance conditions. Any such adjustments shall be made in accordance with the rules of the relevant
plan and where required by plan rules, adjustments shall be made with the prior approval of HMRC, and/or the Company’s Auditor .
Under the rules of the LTIP and executive share option schemes, the Company has the discretion to satisfy the majority of awards
either by the transfer of existing shares or by the allotment of newly-issued shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by
the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
Option exercises under the UK and International Sharesave plans are satisfied by the allotment of newly-issued shares. Any awards
that vest under the Deferred Bonus Plan will be met from the transfer of existing shares.
As at 31 December 2008, 372,008 shares were held in the Company’s employee share ownership trust (‘ESOP’). During the recent
rights issue the Trustees of the ESOP sold sufficient of the rights in the market to fund the take-up of the balance of the rights. As at
9 March 2009, the ESOP therefore holds 2,472,683 shares. The Trustees of the ESOP purchase shares in the open market as required,
to meet liabilities for the provision of existing shares to satisfy options and awards that vest.
The rules of each of Cookson’s share-based incentive schemes, including the LTIP, and the pre-existing share option and Sharesave
Plans, contain limitations on the total number of options over new shares that can be awarded in accordance with the ABI guidelines.
In the last 10 years less than 1% of the Company’s current issued share capital has been allotted to settle obligations arising from the
exercise of executive share incentives.
Details of the awards outstanding under the Company’s share plans as at 31 December 2008 and the associated exercise prices are
given in note 39.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Performance graph
The graph below compares Cookson’s TSR over the last five years with the return on the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts).
This index has been chosen as the comparator index to reflect the size, international scope and diversity of the Group’s businesses and is

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)
LTIP and other share incentive plans (continued)
Subject to the overall limit explained below, shares purchased by executives using any annual incentive can continue to count as
Investment Shares and qualify for a Matching Share Award in addition to any shares purchased in a rights issue which are designated
as Investment Shares. The Committee has specified that the total annual maximum value of Investment Shares (however sourced) that
can qualify for a Matching Share Award for the awards to be made in 2009 will be subject to an overall limit of 100 per cent. of an
executive’s salary.
In addition to the overall limit, the Committee has decided that only 63% of shares taken up under the recent rights issue can be
designated as Investment Shares under the LTIP in recognition of the significantly discounted price of the shares issued in the rights issue.
For awards made after 7 March 2007 the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to award participants the dividends that
would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the
award date and the date of vesting.
Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards can vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based on
the Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. For awards made in 2006, vesting was dependent upon the
Group’s three-year TSR performance relative to that of the companies of its comparator group, the FTSE 250 excluding Investment
Trusts, as detailed below:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares Vesting Percentage (Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 25% 0.5:1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 100% 2.25:1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Pro rata between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1
The performance period applicable to these awards ended on 31 December 2008. The Company’s TSR performance during this three-year
performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance was below
median. Accordingly the 2006 LTIP awards will lapse on the vesting date of 6 April 2009.
In 2007, the Remuneration Committee broadened the performance condition by including headline EPS growth. For awards made
in 2007 and for subsequent awards, vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based on the TSR performance measure described above
and 50% on headline EPS (the calculation of which is shown in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) growth over a three-
year period. The two measures will operate independently.
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2007, 2008 and 2009 LTIP awards will be based on TSR
performance in accordance with the following schedule:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares Vesting Percentage (Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 12.5% 0.25:1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 50% 1.125:1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2007 , 2008 and 2009 LTIP awards will be based on headline EPS
growth, as compared with the compound annual growth in the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’), in accordance with the following schedule:
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
Annual Compound Headline EPS Growth above RPI Performance Shares Vesting Percentage (Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below 3% 0% 0
3% 12.5% 0.25:1
At or above 10% 50% 1.125:1
Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Matching Share Awards will only vest if the Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
The Committee obtains independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance condition at
the end of the relevant performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the
Company’s performance are both in accordance with the rules of the LTIP. Measurement of the Group’s TSR takes place over a
performance period commencing on the first day of Cookson’s financial year in which the award is granted. Thus, for grants made in
2008, the performance period commenced on 1 January 2008 and will end three years later, i.e. 31 December 2010. TSR is measured
as the percentage increase in a return index (net of tax) between the beginning and end of the performance period. The return index
at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the
start of the performance period. The same three-month averaging method is used to ascertain the return index at the end of the
performance period. The companies are then ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR. If Cookson is ranked at or above
median against the comparator group then some proportion of the awards is eligible to vest. Cookson Group plc 49 Annual Report 2008

OUR GOVERNANCE
Cookson Group plc 48 Annual Report 2008
Shareholding guidelines
The Remuneration Committee encourages executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to at
least one times salary. To this end, executive Directors will normally only be able to sell a maximum of up to 50% (measured as the value
after tax) of any Performance Shares or Matching Share Awards vesting under the LTIP , until this criterion has been met.
Directors’ service contracts
Both of the executive Directors have contractual notice periods from the Company of 12 months. Neither of the executive Directors’
contracts contains any change of control provisions and they both contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an alternative paid
occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination. The following paragraphs
summarise the main conditions of the contracts of the Directors.
Executive Directors
Both of the current executive Directors have UK service contracts which have 12 months unexpired terms and provide for 12 months’ notice
being given. Mr Salmon’s contract was dated 14 June 2004 and Mr Butterworth’s 25 May 2005. Each contract provides for compensation
to be paid on early termination by the Company based on one times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half in a lump sum
and the balance in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary earned from any new
paid occupation.
Non-executive Directors
In accordance with the Code, each non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years subject to their election at
the Company’s first AGM following their appointment. Thereafter , subject to approval of the Board and their re-election at the appropriate
AGM, they are appointed for a further three-year term.
Date of Date of AGM at which Unexpired
appointment retirement term expires notice period
Non-executive Directors
Jeff Hewitt 01/06/05 – 2012 Not required
Jan Oosterveld 15/06/04 – 2010 Not required
Barry Perry 01/01/02 – 2011 Not required
John Sussens 01/05/04 – 2010 Not required
The Group Chairman, Mr Beeston, was appointed on 1 April 2003 for a fixed period which was due to expire at the conclusion of the AGM
in 2008. This was extended in 2007 and is now due to expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2011. He is entitled to 12 months’ notice from
the Company. Any compensation for loss of office would be based upon his annual fee. The remaining non-executive Directors are not
entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time.
All Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Board sets the remuneration of the non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and
the practice of other companies. The non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration. The
Chairman’s remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as non-executive directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to
conflicts of interest. The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are retained by the executive Director
concerned. In 2008, Mr Salmon received fees of £55,000 for his role as non-executive director of United Utilities Group plc.
No Directors had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than service agreements) with the Company or any
subsidiary company during the year.
Pension arrangements
Messrs Butterworth and Salmon are not entitled to participate in any of the Group’s pension arrangements. In accordance with their
contracts they received pension allowances of 25% and 30% respectively of their base salaries in 2008 to enable them to make their own
pension provision. Mr Butterworth’s pension allowance in 2008 amounted to £78,375 (2007: £71,250), whilst Mr Salmon’s pension
allowance in 2008 amounted to £154,980 (2007: £123,000). This information is audited by the Company’s Auditor .
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) Cookson Group plc 51 Annual Report 2008
Notes
1. In 2008 Messrs Butterworth and Salmon received potential maximum allocations of Performance Shares worth one times their
respective base salaries. Under the Matching Share award element of the LTIP they used their 2007 Annual Incentive payments to
purchase 28,293 shares and 43,958 shares respectively, and received maximum allocations of Matching Share Awards based on these
amounts which had a maximum potential value on the date of award equivalent to circa two times their respective base salaries. The
allocations were made to Messrs Butterworth and Salmon on 31 March 2008 and the allocations were calculated based upon the
closing mid-market price of Cookson’s shares on the day before the awards were made. Cookson’s mid-market closing price on the
31 March 2008 was 664p.
2. The April 2005 market prices shown for shares on the day before the awards were made have been multiplied by 10 to reflect the
impact of the share consolidation on 26 May 2005 on the Company’s share price. On this date every 10 ordinary 1p shares held by
shareholders were exchanged for 1 new 10p ordinary share.
3. The mid-market closing price of Cookson’s shares ranged between 7 4.75p and 776p during 2008 and on 31 December 2008 was 126.75p.
4. The performance criteria which apply to the vesting of share allocations under the LTIP are summarised on pages 46 and 47 .
5. The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2005 ended on 31 December 2007. The Company’s TSR performance during
the 3-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance
was above the upper quintile. The Remuneration Committee was satisfied that the vesting of these awards was justified by the
underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period. Accordingly the 2005 LTIP awards vested fully on the
third anniversaries of their award dates. Mr Salmon’s awards vested on 4 April 2008. The mid-market closing price of Cookson’s
shares was 679p on this date; the value of shares transferred to Mr Salmon was therefore £1,185,310. Mr Butterworth’s award vested
on 5 August 2008 being the first dealing day following the end of the formal close period for the Group’s half yearly results. The
mid-market closing price of Cookson’s shares was 621p on this date; the value of shares transferred to Mr Butterworth was therefore
£252,350. The total aggregate value of shares transferred to Messrs Butterworth and Salmon as a result of LTIP awards vesting in
2008 was therefore £1,437,660. Messrs Butterworth and Salmon both sold sufficient shares on vesting to meet their associated tax
liabilities.
6. The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2006 ended on 31 December 2008. The Company’s TSR performance during the
3-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance was
below median. Accordingly the 2006 LTIP awards will not vest on 6 April 2009 and the awards will lapse.
7 . The Remuneration Committee is considering what adjustments, if any, it would be appropriate to make to the number of shares
allocated under the outstanding LTIP awards and the calculation of the associated performance conditions following the recent rights
issue. Any such adjustments would be made in accordance with the plan rules. Pending this review, none of the information given in
the table or associated notes has been adjusted for the effect of the rights issue.
8. The information in the table is audited by the Company’s Auditor .

OUR GOVERNANCE
Cookson Group plc 52 Annual Report 2008
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE
MEMBERS OF COOKSON GROUP PLC
We have audited the Group and parent company financial
statements (the “financial statements”) of Cookson Group plc for
the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Group
Income Statement, the Group and parent company Balance Sheets,
the Group Statement of Cash Flows, the Group statement of
Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been
audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company financial
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities on page 52.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific
information presented in the Operating and Financial Review that
is cross referred from the Business Review section of the
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
To the shareholders of Cookson Group plc
The Directors of Cookson Group plc are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report and the financial statements of the parent
company only (‘the Company’) and of the Company and its
subsidiaries (‘the Group’), in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU and have elected to
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in
relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and
fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law to give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, including the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules, the Directors are also responsible for
preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report
and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law
and those regulations. In relation to the latter, the Directors
represent that, to the best of their knowledge and belief:
(i) the Group and Company financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial
result for the year ended 31 December 2008; and
(ii) the Directors’ Report and information referenced therein, taken
together, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company
and of the Group, together with a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in
other jurisdictions.

OUR ACCOUNTS
2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)
2.2 STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE (CONTINUED)
• IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008 and will be
adopted by the Group in its 2009 annual report. IFRIC 13, which addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits
to customers who buy other goods or services, will have no impact upon the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total
recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
With the exception of certain items noted below, which are carried at fair value, the consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 have been prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and IFRS, having been prepared in accordance with IFRS for the first time in 2005.
3.2 BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS
Information on the business environment in which the Group operates, including the factors that are likely to impact the future
prospects of the Group, are included in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 10 and 11 and the Operating Review on pages 12 to
21. The principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces throughout its global operations are included in the Corporate
Governance Report on pages 32 to 39. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and debt facilities are
described in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 27. In addition, notes 4 and 37 to the consolidated financial statements set out
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; financial risks; financial instruments and hedging
activities; and its exposures to credit, market (both currency and interest rate-related) and liquidity risk. Further details of the
Group’s cash balances and borrowings are included in notes 20 and 36 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has two committed debt facilities, approximately £680m of syndicated bank facilities and approximately £250m
of US Private Placement loan notes. These facilities, which together total approximately £930m, have no significant debt
maturities in 2009, with the principal maturities due in 2011 and 2012, and contain a number of financial covenants with which
the Group is required to comply. In March 2009, the Group completed a rights issue which raised proceeds (net of expenses) of
£241m which were used to repay gross borrowings. This rights issue significantly strengthens the Group’s financial position.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of
approval of these consolidated financial statements. These forecasts reflect an assessment of current end-market conditions,
their impact on the Group’s future trading performance and the actions taken by management in response to the difficult market
conditions. The forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt
facilities and show continued compliance with the financial covenants. In addition, management has considered various
mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that end-market conditions are worse than their current assessment. Such
measures include further reductions in costs, further reductions in capital expenditure and further reductions in those items of
working capital within management’s control.
On the basis of the exercise as described above and the available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the
Company.
3.3 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states
key lines which should be disclosed. It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the re-ordering of items
presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial
performance. In keeping with the spirit of this aspect of IAS 1, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the
face of its Group Income Statement the effect of any components of financial performance considered by the Directors to be
exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved
and in making projections of future results.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such
presentation. Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of major restructuring and integration activity, inventory fair
value adjustments, profits or losses on sale or impairment of non-current assets, amortisation and impairment charges relating
to intangible assets, curtailment gains or losses relating to employee benefits, finance costs, any profits or losses arising on
business disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact
on the Group’s results of operations either due to their size or nature.
The line item description in the Group Income Statement “rationalisation of operating activities” that appeared in previous
reports has been changed to “restructuring and integration costs”. The new description more closely reflects the nature of the
costs being reported on this line. This change in presentation has no impact upon the Group’s previously reported net cash flows,
financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
Cookson Group plc 58 Annual Report 2008
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Cookson Group plc is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its
registered address is shown on page 126. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the
Operating Review on pages 12 to 21.
The financial statements, which were authorised by the Directors for issue on 9 March 2009, are presented in millions of
pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies
set out in note 3.6.
2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU (“IFRS”). The financial statements of the Company-only have been prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”), as disclosed in note 1 to the Company financial statements.
2.1 NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, has been adopted
early by the Group. IFRS 8 sets out requirements for disclosure of financial information about the Group’s operating segments
and replaces International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 14, Segment Reporting. IFRS 8 requires segment information to be
disclosed based upon the Group’s internal reporting to management. This change in accounting policy has no impact upon the
Group’s previously reported net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share. The
Group’s segment information is disclosed in note 6.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations have all been endorsed by the EU, are all effective for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 and have been adopted by the Group in these consolidated financial statements.
None of these amendments and interpretations has a material impact upon the results or net assets of the Group.
• Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – Reclassification of Financial Instruments;
• IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions; and
• IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The limit of Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
2.2 STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE
The following revised and amended standards and interpretations, which have all been endorsed by the EU and are available for
early adoption, have not been early adopted by the Group in these consolidated financial statements.
• IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial Statements, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
and will be adopted by the Group in its 2009 annual report. IAS 1 (Revised) introduces the term “total comprehensive income”,
a measure that includes all components of profit or loss as currently reported in the Group Income Statement, together with all
items of income and expense not recognised in profit or loss, as currently reported in the Group Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense. In future, the Company’s consolidated financial statements must include a Group Statement of
Comprehensive Income and a Group Statement of Changes in Equity. The adoption of IAS 1 (Revised) will have no impact upon
the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
• IAS 23 (Revised), Borrowing Costs, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will be adopted
by the Group in its 2009 annual report. The main change introduced by IAS 23 (Revised) is the removal of the option of
immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready
for use or sale. The Group’s current policy in relation to borrowing costs, shown in note 3.10 below, is to recognise them in the
income statement using the effective interest rate method. The adoption of IAS 23 (Revised) is not expected to have a significant
impact upon the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
• Amendments to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, relating to
puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2009 and will be adopted by the Group in its 2009 annual report. The adoption of these amendments will have no
impact upon the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
• Amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and IAS 27, Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements, are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will be adopted
by the Group in its 2009 annual report. The adoption of these amendments, which relate to the measurement of the initial cost
of investment in subsidiaries in the financial statements of the Company-only, will have no impact upon the Group’s net cash
flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
• Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will
be adopted by the Group in its 2009 annual report. The amendment to IFRS 2 clarifies that vesting conditions are service
conditions and performance conditions only; other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. It also
specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The
adoption of the amendment to IFRS 2 is not expected to have a significant impact upon the Group’s net cash flows, financial
position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share. Cookson Group plc 61 Annual Report 2008

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.6 FOREIGN CURRENCIES (CONTINUED)
(c) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation
are recognised in the income statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation
as appropriate. In the consolidated Group financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in
translation reserves as a separate component of equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement on disposal of
the net investment.
3.7 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to
customers, after deducting sales allowances and value-added taxes. Revenue is recognised when the risk of loss transfers to the
customer, depending on individual customer terms at the time of despatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance.
Provision is made for returns where appropriate.
3.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefits expense when they fall due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that they result in either a cash refund or a reduction in future
payments. Outstanding contributions are recognised as a liability within accruals.
(b) Defined benefit pension plans
The net surplus or net liability recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, less the fair
value of the plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have
terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising
from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and
reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plans is recognised as follows:
(i) Within trading profit: Current service cost – representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit
obligation resulting from employee service in the current year; and
Past service cost – representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation
resulting from employee service in prior periods that arises from changes made to the benefits
under the plans in the current year. To the extent that the changes to benefits vest immediately,
past service costs are recognised immediately, otherwise they are recognised on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period.
(ii) Within finance costs: Interest cost on the liabilities of the plans – calculated by reference to the plan liabilities and discount
rate at the beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iii) Within finance income: Expected return on the assets of the plans – calculated by reference to the plan assets and long-
term expected rate of return at the beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iv) Within the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense: Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities
of the plans.
(v) Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the income statement in the same line as the
item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised or, if material, separately reported as a component of
profit from operations.
Cookson Group plc 60 Annual Report 2008
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.4 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the Group Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line
with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s interest therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority’s interest
in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
3.5 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, Business
Combinations, are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that
are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which
are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net
fair value of the recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is recognised as an asset and initially measured
at cost. If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds
the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group took advantage
of the exemption under IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, not to restate all business
combinations prior to 1 January 2005 in line with the requirements of IFRS 3.
3.6 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the
results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences
arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement;
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii) Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income
statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses
are recognised directly in equity, in which case any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in
equity.
(b) Translation from functional currency to presentation currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its
results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such an average
rate does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used;
and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in translation reserves as a separate component of equity and are
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. Cookson Group plc 63 Annual Report 2008

3.12 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is
probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. All other
repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins
when the asset is available for use and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less
residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Freehold property Between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property The term of the lease
Plant and machinery – motor vehicles Between 1 and 5 years
– information technology equipment Between 1 and 5 years
– other Between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at
each financial year-end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to
its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, as described in note 3.15.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in
the income statement.
3.13 GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or associate represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or associate recognised
at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses. Impairment testing is carried out annually, as described in notes 3.15, 5.2 and 23. On disposal of a subsidiary or an
associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
3.14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL
Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from
contractual or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. They are amortised over their estimated useful
lives, as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Customer relationships 20 years
Trade names 20 years
Intellectual property rights 10 years
Other Between 5 and 10 years

3.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
(c) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of different share-based payment arrangements for its employees of both the equity-settled
and cash-settled type.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
date of grant takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), and is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense
recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non
market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value
determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a
form of stochastic option pricing model. For consistency, this method has also been used to value executive share options
and stock appreciation rights granted to executives whose options are not subject to the additional market-based
performance conditions. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense
with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the amount payable is initially measured at grant date using a
form of stochastic option pricing model and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair
value of the liability are recognised in the income statement.
3.9 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the
Group has sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is recognised in the income
statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
3.10 BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs, comprising interest on bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, the unwinding of the discount on
provisions and the costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings, are recognised in the income statement
using the effective interest rate method.
3.11 TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have
been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax
is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which
case the associated deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Cookson Group plc 65 Annual Report 2008

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.18 NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Non-current assets (or a collection of assets and liabilities in a disposal group) are separately classified as held for sale in the
balance sheet when their carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing
use.
Immediately prior to being classified as held for sale the measurement of the assets (and all assets and liabilities in a disposal
group) is brought up to date in accordance with applicable IFRS. Then, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets
and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial
classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Discontinued operations are those operations that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally
and for financial reporting purposes, that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and which represent a
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
3.19 LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
(a) Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if
lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
to the income statement.
(b) Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
3.20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
(a) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(b) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to
manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings. In accordance
with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement
to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being
hedged (note 4.2).
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. The fair value
of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet
date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.15 IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value
in use, which is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit,
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. The Group’s cash-generating units are disclosed in note 23 and represent the lowest
level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the resulting
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(b) Other tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a
change in the estimates used to measure the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. Where
an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior
years. A reversal of an impairment loss for tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately in
the income statement.
3.16 INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity
that is subject to joint control. Joint control exists when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the
activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity
method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for under IFRS 5.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the joint venture.
3.17 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly
incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads
based on normal activity levels. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value
is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.
In addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group holds precious metals under consignment
arrangements, further details of which are given in note 28. Cookson Group plc 67 Annual Report 2008

3.22 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)
(e) Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint
ventures and total net finance costs associated with ordinary activities. The Directors believe that headline profit before tax
provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(f) Headline earnings per share
Headline earnings per share is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint
ventures and total net finance costs and income tax costs associated with ordinary activities, less profit attributable to
minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe
that headline earnings per share provides an important measure of the underlying earnings capacity of the Group.
(g) Free cash flow
Free cash flow, defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant
and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to minority shareholders, but before additional funding
contributions to Group pension plans, is disclosed on the face of the Group Statement of Cash Flows. The Directors believe
that free cash flow gives an important measure of the underlying cash generation capacity of the Group.
(h) Average working capital to sales ratio
The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances (being
inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables) for a year to the reported revenue for that year. The
Directors believe that the average working capital to sales ratio provides an important measure of the underlying
effectiveness with which working capital balances are managed throughout the Group.
(i) EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges. The Directors believe that EBITDA provides an
important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(j) Net interest
Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by
the Directors to be exceptional.
(k) Interest cover
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest. The Directors believe that interest cover provides an important measure
of the underlying financial position of the Group.
(l) Net debt
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings and cash and short-term
deposits. The Directors believe that net debt is an important measure as it shows the Group’s aggregate net indebtedness to
banks and other external financial institutions.
(m) Net debt to EBITDA
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year. The Directors believe that net debt to
EBITDA provides an important measure of the underlying financial position of the Group.
(n) Return on net assets
Return on net assets (“RONA”) is calculated as trading profit plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures divided
by average operating net assets (being property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables
and payables). The Directors believe that RONA provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of
the Group’s divisions.
(o) Return on investment
Return on investment (“ROI”) is calculated as trading profit plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures divided
by invested capital (being shareholders’ funds plus net debt, employee benefits net surpluses and net liabilities and goodwill
previously written-off to, or amortised against, reserves). The Directors believe that ROI provides an important measure of
the underlying financial performance of the Group.

3.20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(c) Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments include investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant
risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Group Statement of Cash
Flows. Loans and borrowings comprise secured and unsecured loans and obligations under finance leases (note 3.19).
Non-derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s investments in equity and debt securities are classified as available-for-sale investments. Subsequent to
initial recognition they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in equity. When an investment
is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
All other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment losses.
3.21 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks
associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised
as an interest expense (note 3.10).
3.22 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in addition to
those reported in accordance with IFRS. Because IFRS measures reflect all items which affect reported performance, the
Directors believe that certain non-GAAP measures, which reflect what they view as the underlying performance of the Group, are
important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this
annual report.
(a) Net sales value
Net sales value is calculated as the total of revenue less the amount included therein related to any precious metal
component. The Directors believe that net sales value provides an important measure of the underlying sales performance
of the Group’s Precious Metals division.
(b) Return on sales and return on net sales value
Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue. Return on net sales value is calculated as trading profit
divided by net sales value. The Directors believe that return on sales provides an important measure of the underlying trading
performance of the Group and the Group’s Ceramics and Electronics divisions and that return on net sales value provides an
important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group’s Precious Metals division.
(c) Underlying revenue growth
Underlying revenue growth measures the organic growth in revenue from one year to the next after eliminating the effects
of changes in exchange rates and metals prices and the effects of business acquisitions, disposals and closures. The Directors
believe that underlying revenue growth gives an important measure of the organic revenue generation capacity of the Group.
(d) Trading profit
Trading profit, defined as profit from operations before restructuring and integration costs, inventory fair value adjustments,
profits or losses relating to non-current assets, charges relating to the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and
curtailment gains or losses relating to employee benefits, is separately disclosed on the face of the Group Income Statement.
The Directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group. Cookson Group plc 69 Annual Report 2008

4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
4.2 HEDGING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)
(b) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity within
hedging reserves. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or finance costs in
the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, in the income statement. When the forecast transaction that
was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period. When the forecast transaction
subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or
loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or non-
financial liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains
in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction takes place. If the hedged transaction
is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately within trading
profit in the income statement.
(c) Net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to
be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity within translation reserves and subsequently recognised in the income
statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
recognised immediately within trading profit in the income statement.
4.3 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt. The Group’s objectives when managing its
capital are:
• to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns;
• to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and net debt;
• to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future
returns to investors; and
• to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group manages its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including RONA and ROI (note 3.22).
5. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
5.1 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
It is Group policy to depreciate its property, plant and equipment assets, except freehold land, on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. This applies an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and
delivery of goods and services. A key element of this policy is the estimate of the useful life applied to each category of property,
plant and equipment which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge. Variations in asset lives could significantly
impact Group profit through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge.
5.2 GOODWILL
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value
that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake
an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets, using
discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the value in use to the Group of the capitalised assets. In the assessment undertaken in
2008, further details of which are given in note 23, value in use was derived from discounted 5-year cash flow projections, using
a growth rate of 3% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates. The projection period is, in the opinion
of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s businesses for this purpose. Changes
to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment of the
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.

4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions and borrowings that are
denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. It uses various financial instruments to manage these exposures, as
explained below.
(i) Recognised assets and liabilities
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognised asset or liability that are attributable to a particular risk and which could affect profit or loss. Such forward
foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2(a).
(ii) Forecast transactions
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that might
arise from the fluctuation of exchange rates in relation to highly probable forecast transactions that are denominated in
currencies other than its own functional currencies and which might affect profit or loss. Such forward foreign exchange
contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2(b).
(iii) Net investment hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts and debt denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling are both used to
hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its investment in the net assets of its foreign operations
that arise from fluctuations in exchange rates. Such financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges in
accordance with the policy in note 4.2(c).
(b) Credit risk
At the balance sheet date, the Group had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group Treasury function ensures that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents to
ensure that the Group is at all times able to meet its financial commitments and operate within its financial covenants.
(d) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowings. An analysis of the currency and interest rate profiles of
the Group’s borrowings is shown in note 37.
Borrowings at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and borrowings at fixed rates expose the
Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to borrow a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. From time to time
the Group manages its cash flow and fair value interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps, which have the economic effect
of changing the interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings.
4.2 HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Group designates certain financial instruments as either: (a) hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of
recognised assets or liabilities that are attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss (fair value hedges); (b)
hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable
forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss (cash flow hedges); or (c) hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial
instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged
items.
(a) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised within trading
profit in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are subject
to the hedged risk. Cookson Group plc 71 Annual Report 2008

6. SEGMENT INFORMATION
6.1 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: Ceramics, Electronics and Precious Metals.
In addition, corporate costs, being the costs directly related to managing the parent company, are reported separately in the analysis
of segment result. The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Operating Review on pages 12 to 21.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material) and segment result is
equivalent to trading profit. Segment assets exclude cash and short-term deposits, employee benefits surpluses, deferred tax
assets, income tax recoverable, investments in joint ventures, assets classified as held for sale and corporate assets that cannot
be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business segment. These items are shown collectively in the following tables as
“unallocated assets”. Segment result and segment assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

5.3 CURRENT ASSET RESERVES
In the course of normal trading activities, and in particular in the current economic environment, judgement is used to establish
the net realisable value of various elements of working capital, principally inventory and trade receivables. Reserves are
established for obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or doubtful debts and product warranties.
Reserve requirements are based on the facts available at the time and are also determined by using profiles, based on past
practice, applied to certain aged inventory and receivables categories. In estimating the collectability of trade receivables,
judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related
ageing of the past due balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its
financial obligations due to deterioration in its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
5.4 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-
retirement benefits to current and former employees. It is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining
the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations. These assumptions are set after consultation with the Group’s
actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans’ assets and
liabilities. Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect
the Group’s profit and financial position.
5.5 DEFERRED TAXATION
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in certain of the
Group’s businesses, primarily in Europe and South America. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in
arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are
changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing difference might be recognised, then the value of the
deferred tax asset will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group has losses and other timing differences for which no value has been recognised for deferred tax purposes in these
financial statements. These can arise in loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of these timing differences
is not probable. It can also arise where the timing differences are of such a nature that their value is dependent on only certain
types of profit being earned, such as capital profits. If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these
companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
5.6 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES
In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out environmental clean-ups at former and
current production sites. Many of these obligations will not arise for a number of years and the costs are difficult to predict
accurately. The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate
amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups.
5.7 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Group’s financial statements present the results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations.
Discontinued operations include those businesses that have been sold, or are classified as held for sale, and which represented
a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. The Directors exercise their judgement to determine which
of the Group’s businesses should have their results presented within discontinued operations. Cookson Group plc 73 Annual Report 2008
OUR ACCOUNTS
9. RESTRUCTURING AND INTEGRATION COSTS
The restructuring and integration costs of £39.6m (2007: £5.8m) comprise £17.1m of costs associated with the integration of
Foseco into the Group’s Ceramics division and £22.5m for the cost of a number of initiatives throughout the Group aimed at
reducing the Group’s cost base and re-aligning its manufacturing capacity with its customers’ markets. The initiatives
implemented included redundancy programmes, the consolidation of facilities, plant closures, the streamlining of manufacturing
processes and the rationalisation of product lines. Of these rationalisation charges, £8.2m (2007: £1.6m) was in respect of asset
write-downs. Cash costs of £23.0m were incurred in the year (2007: £14.7m) in respect of the restructuring and integration
initiatives commenced both in 2008 and in prior years, leaving provisions made but unspent of £19.5m as at 31 December 2008
(2007: £5.8m). The net tax credit attributable to these restructuring and integration costs was £2.9m (2007: £0.5m).
10. INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT
The value of the inventory acquired on the acquisition of Foseco (note 42) was increased by £2.6m in order to restate the value
of finished goods inventory from cost, as it had been valued in Foseco’s balance sheet immediately prior to acquisition, to its fair
value as recognised on acquisition by Cookson, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3, Business Combinations. The
inventory that was subject to this valuation adjustment had all been sold by 31 December 2008. The tax credit attributable to this
adjustment was £0.8m.
11. PROFIT RELATING TO NON-CURRENT ASSETS
The net profit relating to non-current assets of £3.4m (2007: £7.0m) comprised net profits of £8.4m arising on the sale of
investments and surplus property, less asset write-downs of £5.0m. The net profit relating to non-current assets in 2007
comprised profits on the sale of surplus property. The net tax charge attributable to non-current assets was £0.2m (2007: £1.2m).

14. NET PROFIT/(LOSS) ON DISPOSAL OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
The net profit on disposal of continuing operations of £0.9m (2007: £0.4m loss) related to the sale of the Group’s Hi-Tech ceramic
filters business, formerly part of the Ceramics division, and the sale of Foseco’s Carbon Bonded Ceramics business, both of which
disposals were required for compliance with anti-trust clearances in relation to the acquisition of Foseco (note 42), together with
the net costs associated with a number of other small business disposals. None of the businesses disposed of either individually
or in aggregate represented a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation. Accordingly, these disposals are
presented within pre-tax results from continuing operations in the Group Income Statement. The aggregate proceeds, net of
selling costs, amounted to £21.2m (2007: £1.5m) and together with additional costs in relation to prior years’ disposals, resulted
in a net profit before tax of £0.9m (2007: loss of £0.4m).
The tax charge associated with these disposals was £0.3m (2007: £nil).

exceptional items comprising a credit of £2.9m (2007: £0.5m) in relation to restructuring and integration costs, a credit of £0.8m
(2007: £nil) relating to the inventory fair value adjustment, a credit of £3.7m (2007: £nil) relating to the amortisation and
impairment of intangible assets, a credit of £1.2m (2007: £2.8m charge) relating to deferred tax on goodwill, a charge of £0.2m
(2007: £1.2m) relating to non-current assets and a charge of £0.3m (2007: £nil) relating to the profit/(loss) on disposal of
continuing operations. The current tax cost for 2008 was reduced by a benefit of £1.2m (2007: £3.5m) arising from previously
unrecognised tax losses.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these areas
could, adversely or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to
absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2008, as effective
tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in
notes 3.11 and 5.5.
The tax charge relating to items charged or credited directly to equity was £20.5m (2007: £0.3m), of which £19.8m (2007:
£nil) relates to the surplus arising on the UK pension funds (note 38.5).

the terms of the rights issue which completed on 4 March 2009. The adjustment factor used was 6.6391.
For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include the
weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per
share, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations.
In addition to the 1.3m (2007: 3.2m) shares shown in the table above as being dilutive, the Company has outstanding options
in relation to its share option schemes that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of diluted
EPS above because they were antidilutive in the years presented.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination. The Directors consider that the Group has four cash-generating units: the Ceramics division,
the Chemistry product line of the Electronics division, the Assembly Materials product line of the Electronics division and the
Precious Metals division. These cash-generating units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.
Of these four cash-generating units, the carrying amount of goodwill is significant for the Ceramics and Chemistry cash-
generating units, in relation to the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill.

The £19.8m charge to the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense shown in the table above relates to the surplus arising
on the UK pension funds.
The total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2008 was £454.9m (2007: £355.8m). This consisted of £52.1m
(2007: £52.1m) relating to capital losses, £190.6m (2007: £146.7m) relating to operating losses, £104.0m (2007: £70.7m) relating
to unrelieved interest, £95.1m (2007: £73.2m) relating to other categories and £13.1m (2007: £13.1m) relating to UK ACT tax
credits. In accordance with the accounting policy in note 3.11, these items have not been recognised in the above analysis on the
basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. In total, there was an increase of £99.1m (2007: increase of £0.7m) in net
unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of £194.1m (2007: £149.9m).
This total includes £90.8m (2007: £62.8m) for losses which are available to offset future taxable US income, of which
approximately £8.1m (2007: £6.0m) will expire in 2020 and the remainder will expire between 2022 and 2028. A further £80.7m
(2007: £70.0m) of losses are available to offset future UK taxable income and may be carried forward without time limit. The
remaining losses with a value of £22.6m (2007: £17.1m) include £11.2m (2007: £11.7m) which may be carried forward indefinitely
and £11.4m (2007: £5.4m) which has a maximum life of between 5 and 20 years. The amounts arise in a number of countries and
are not individually significant, reflecting the spread of the Group’s operations.

23. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
23.3 IMPAIRMENT (CONTINUED)
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses,
with impairment testing carried out annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-
generating units is determined from value in use calculations based on detailed divisional plans covering a three year period from
the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five
year projection period using a growth rate of 3% (2007: 3% for each cash-generating unit). The cash flows in the calculations
are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are growth rates, operating margins and discount rates. Growth
rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the Group’s key
end-markets of steel, automotive and electronics; and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group
business unit operates.
The perpetuity growth rate of 3% is based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Group’s end-markets. The
Group’s projections, which are based on historical trends and external forecasts, show conditions for the first quarter of 2009 to
be no better than the fourth quarter of 2008 and then to improve slowly through the second quarter of 2009 as the de-stocking
in end-markets comes to an end. Further improvements in trading are expected in the second half of 2009 reflecting the Group’s
normal trading seasonality, notably for the Electronics and Precious Metals divisions, and also supported by the anticipated
beneficial impact on infrastructure demand (and, notably, its impact on the demand for steel and foundry castings) of the various
fiscal stimulus packages recently announced by governments around the world.
Operating margins are based on historic financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring
and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date. Discount rates are calculated by external consultants for
each cash-generating unit, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cash-
generating unit. The pre-tax discount rate used for the Ceramics cash-generating unit was 13.0% (2007: 12.5%) and for the
Chemistry cash-generating unit was 12.5% (2007: 11.3%).
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2008, the Directors made use of the most recent detailed
calculations of the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-generating units, prepared as at 31 December 2008. Those
calculations resulted in recoverable amounts that exceeded the carrying values of the cash-generating units in three of the
Group’s four cash-generating units.
For the Precious Metals cash-generating unit, which during 2008 continued to experience weakness in its jewellery end-
markets in both Europe and the US, the recoverable amount was less than carrying value and an impairment loss of £39.6m has
been recognised against the carrying value of its goodwill. The discount rate applied in this calculation was 14.8% (2007: 12.9%).
After recording this impairment, goodwill recognised on the balance sheet for the Precious Metals cash-generating unit is £nil.
The Precious Metals cash-generating unit is also a separate reportable segment in note 6.
For the Chemistry cash-generating unit, where its recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value by £4.4m, a reduction in
either the perpetuity growth rate assumption from 3.0% to 2.8%, or an increase in the discount rate assumption from 12.5% to
12.7%, would result in its recoverable amount being equal to its carrying value.
24. INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
The principal joint venture of the Group, in which it has a 50% interest, is Electroplating Engineers of Japan Ltd. The Group’s

27.2 MOVEMENTS ON IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)
Impairment provisions, write-offs and the reversal of unused amounts shown in the table above are charged or credited as
appropriate within administration, selling and distribution costs in the Group Income Statement.
In determining the level of impairment provisions required, the Group’s operating companies initially review all significant
trade receivable balances on an individual basis for evidence of impairment. Evidence of impairment may include such factors as
the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings. Of the total provision
for impairment of trade receivables at 31 December 2008 of £34.0m (2007: £18.1m) shown in the table above, £24.7m (2007:
£14.8m) related to balances that were impaired on an individual basis. The ageing analysis of these individually impaired balances
is shown in the table below.

Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represent a significant proportion
of the total outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration of credit risk.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was
£1,107.2m (2007: £797.6m).
In addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held precious metals on consignment terms with a total
value as at 31 December 2008 of £396.8m (2007: £344.1m). As at 31 December 2008, metal held under consignment comprised
575,781 ounces of gold (2007: 696,801 ounces), 4,391,512 ounces of silver (2007: 4,786,206 ounces), 18,561 ounces of platinum
(2007: 18,981 ounces) and 16,591 ounces of palladium (2007: 19,97 4 ounces). The Group also held precious metals on behalf of
customers for processing, the value of which as at 31 December 2008 was £106.7m (2007: £83.0m).
Cookson has entered into various precious metal consignment arrangements with precious metals consigning entities (the
“Consignors”). The metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from a Consignor and sold
concurrently to the customer, or may be consigned and sold directly from a Consignor to the Group’s customers, with the Group
charging customers only for the fabrication process. As the Consignors retain title and associated risks and benefits of ownership
under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recorded on the Group Balance Sheet. Consequently,
the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet. The utilisation of
consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious metals industry.
Cookson provides a guarantee in respect of each consignment arrangement. Whilst the terms of each consignment
arrangement differ in their specific terms, they share similar characteristics. Metals are held on consignment by the relevant
member of Cookson (“Consignee”) and the Consignor retains title to the metal and has a right of physical return of the metal
without penalty unless the Consignee purchases such metal at a market price for such metals plus a premium. The Consignee
pays a consignment fee on the value of the metals consigned to it which have not been returned or purchased. Consignment fees
are charged by the Consignor and were £6.6m for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £3.8m).
Consigned metals may be co-mingled with other metals. Consignors are party to either committed or uncommitted
arrangements. Under uncommitted arrangements the Consignor is under no obligation to supply metal to the Group’s fabrication
operations and has the right, with limited or, in some cases, no notice to demand physical return of its consigned metal. Under
committed arrangements the Consignors provide a rolling 12 month commitment to supply metal to the Group’s fabrication
operations.

As at 31 December 2008, the Group had US unrelieved interest with a tax value of £102.9m (2007: £70.7m), which may be carried
forward indefinitely, and US tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £11.3m (2007: £7.5m). This includes £2.9m (2007:
£2.0m) of research and experimentation credits which expire between 2018 and 2027 and £8.4m (2007: £5.5m) of foreign tax
credits expiring between 2009 and 2016.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had UK capital losses carried forward with a tax value of £52.1m (2007: £52.1m), which
are available to offset future UK capital gains and may be carried forward without time limit, and UK ACT tax credits carried
forward with a tax value of £13.1m (2007: £13.1m), which may be carried forward indefinitely.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £200.5m (2007: £107.3m).

All of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers
with whom they do business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made
for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered. Impairment
provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining
balances based upon historical loss experience. Historical experience has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are
maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

Hedging reserve
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast
transaction (note 29.2), the effective part of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity
within the hedging reserve. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the
cumulative gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the Group
Income Statement in the same period.

29.1 NET INVESTMENT HEDGES
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to synthetically change the currency profile of its borrowings to more closely
match the currency profile of the net assets of its foreign operations. Such contracts are designated as net investment hedges,
as they mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its investment in the net assets of its foreign operations that
arises as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates.
29.2 CASH FLOW HEDGES
In its operations the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to provide a hedge against the cash flow risk associated with
certain highly probable forecast transactions. Such contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are used in relation to the
forecast sale of goods and purchase of raw materials in order to provide a hedge against the variability in cash flows that might
otherwise arise as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to provide a hedge against the cash flow risk associated with interest payable on floating
rate debt instruments. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are used to hedge against the variability in cash
flows that might otherwise arise as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
29.3 FAIR VALUE HEDGES
In its operations the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, to provide a hedge against
the risk of changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies that might
otherwise arise as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates.

36.1 BORROWING FACILITIES
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £1,044.1m (2007: £383.0m), of which £228.2m (2007:
£187.0m) were undrawn and due to expire in more than two years but not more than five years from the balance sheet date.
The Group’s borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan Notes (“USPP”) and a multi-currency committed
syndicated bank facility of £793.7m (2007: £200.0m). The USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 December 2008 and amounted
to £250.4m (US$365.0m), of which $40.0m is repayable in November 2009, $135.0m in May 2010 and $190.0m in May 2012. The
syndicated bank facility comprises £443.7m of term loans and a £350.0m revolving credit facility which terminates in 2012. This
facility was used, in combination with the net proceeds of £150.6m from the share placing on 11 October 2007, to finance the
acquisition of Foseco in April 2008. This included the refinancing of the existing committed bank facilities of Cookson and Foseco.
The facility was originally repayable in three tranches: £75.0m and ¤37.5m in October 2010; £75.0m and ¤37.5m in October 2011;
and £500.0m and ¤75.0m in October 2012.
On 6 March 2009, the Group came to an agreement with the banks providing the syndicated facility whereby the Group
agreed to prepay, in March 2009, the £75.0m and ¤37.5m tranches originally due to be repaid in October 2010. In exchange for
this the banking syndicate has rescheduled by one year the tightening of the net debt to EBITDA covenant attached to the facility.
As a result, the covenant test will now be 3.5 times (previously 3.0 times) at 30 June 2009 and 31 December 2009, reverting to
3.0 times as at 30 June 2010 and thereafter. Following this change to the facility, the required future repayments are £75.0m and
¤37.5m in 2011, with the balance of £500.0m and ¤75.0m being repayable in 2012.

The treasury shares shown in the table above are ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company and are held by Cookson
Investments (Jersey) Limited as Trustee of the Cookson Group ESOP (note 15 to the Company financial statements).
In October 2007, the Company issued 18,583,519 new 10p ordinary shares through a share placing, to part finance the
Company’s acquisition of Foseco plc. The issue raised £150.6m net of issue costs. A cash box structure was utilised to affect the
share placing, as a result of which Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 applied to the excess of the net proceeds over the
nominal value of the shares issued and consequently no share premium was recognised. The excess net proceeds of £148.8m
were recorded as a merger reserve that was subsequently transferred to retained earnings and which is available for distribution
to shareholders. Cookson Group plc 91 Annual Report 2008

The financial assets shown in the tables above attract floating rate interest at the interbank offered rate of the appropriate
currency, less a margin. The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at the interbank offered rate of the appropriate
currency, plus a margin. The fixed rate financial liabilities of £250.4m (2007: £183.0m) have a weighted average interest rate of
7.9% (2007: 7.9%) and a weighted average period for which the rate is fixed of 2.3 years (2007: 3.3 years).
The fair value of the Group’s interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2008 was a liability of £10.4m (2007: £nil). A one percent
increase in interest rates would result in a £5.5m (2007: £nil) decrease in the fair value of this liability. A one percent decrease
in interest rates would result in a £5.5m (2007: £nil) increase in the fair value of this liability.

37.4 MARKET RISK – INTEREST RATE RELATED
(a) Cash flow risk
Changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuation in its future cash flows in relation to its financial
assets and liabilities that attract interest at floating rates (note 37.2). Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s
financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2008, a one percent increase in market interest rates would result in an
increase in both the Group’s annual net finance costs charged to the Group Income Statement and the Group’s net interest
paid in the Group Statement of Cash Flows of £1.5m (2007: reduction of £1.3m). Correspondingly, a one percent decrease in
interest rates would result in a reduction in both the Group’s annual net finance costs charged to the Group Income Statement
and the Group’s net interest paid in the Group Statement of Cash Flows of £1.5m (2007: increase of £1.3m).
(b) Fair value risk
Changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuation in the fair value of its financial assets and
liabilities that attract interest at fixed rates (note 37.1). Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities as at 31 December 2008, a one percent increase in market interest rates would result in a £5.7m (2007: £6.0m)
decrease in the fair value of the Group’s net debt including forward foreign exchange contracts and a one percent decrease
in market interest rates would result in a £5.7m (2007: £6.3m) increase in the fair value of the Group’s net debt including
forward foreign exchange contracts. Cookson Group plc 95 Annual Report 2008

38.2 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY – VALUATION AND RISK MITIGATION
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement
benefit plans, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
(a) Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK and US defined benefit pension liabilities are
summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of
those plans. These assumptions are unchanged from those used in 2007.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived by adjusting the standard mortality tables which reflect recent
research into mortality experience in the UK. The assumptions are based on PA 92 tables projected forward with adjustments
to reflect (i) the lower level of life expectancy amongst the blue collar membership (using an overall scaling factor of 112%,
based on the results of a recent investigation carried out on the mortality experience in the UK Plan); (ii) the medium cohort
improvement factors; and (iii) a minimum level, or “underpin”, to the amount by which life expectancy is expected to improve
at each age in the future, which has the effect of increasing the life expectancy at age 65 by some 0.5 years for someone
currently aged 65 and by up to 2 years for someone currently aged 45.
For the Group’s US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected
64 years for non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale AA. The Group’s major plans in Germany have
been valued using the Heubeck Richttafein 2005G mortality tables.

38.1 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type, and
accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans
The Group’s principal defined contribution plans are in the UK and the US and the assets of the plans are held separately from
the Group in trustee-administered funds. The total expense for these plans in the Group Income Statement amounted to
£10.1m (2007: £7.7m) and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
(b) Defined benefit pension plans
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US. The assets of these plans are held separately
from the Group in trustee-administered funds. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries.
The Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are
not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
The Group’s main defined benefit pension plan in the UK (“the UK Plan”), was closed to new entrants from 2004. A full
actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee and the
last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2006. At that date, the market value of plan assets was £278.3m and
this represented a funding level of 78% of the accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected unit method of valuation)
of £356.6m. Calculated on a “buy-out” basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an
insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £475.7m, representing a funding level of 59%. From 1 January 2008,
based on the latest full valuation, the Group’s ordinary contributions have been set at 16.9% of pensionable salaries. In
addition to these ordinary contributions, in 2006 the Company agreed a repayment schedule with the UK Plan Trustee, which
provided for additional funding payments of £26.5m per annum from 2008 to 2010, with the aim of eliminating the UK Plan
deficit by 2011. This repayment schedule was amended by the Company and the UK Plan Trustee with effect from 1 September
2008, such that the additional funding payments were reduced to £14.0m per annum over the same term as a consequence
of the improved funding position of the UK Plan. Early in 2009, a further amendment to the repayment schedule was made,
details of which are given in note 38.4(c) below. The next full triennial valuation is due as at 31 December 2009.
The US has a number of defined benefit plans, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit. In
addition, the Group’s US Retirement Security Plan has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans but with a
minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members’ accounts. The cash balance rate assumption in the
table in note 38.2(b) refers to the assumed minimum guaranteed return on members’ accounts. From early in 2007, the
Retirement Security Plan and what were then the largest of the Group’s other US defined benefit plans were closed to new
members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members. Existing plan members are, in each case, being provided
with future pension benefit through a defined contribution arrangement. Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit
pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2007. At that date the
market value of the plan assets was £55.5m, representing a funding level of 62% of accrued plan benefits at that date (using
the projected unit method of valuation) of £90.1m. Funding levels for the Group’s US defined benefit pension plans are
normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government
regulations.
Upon the acquisition of Foseco, the Group assumed £29.4m of net liabilities in respect of Foseco’s defined benefit pension
and other post-retirement obligations. Of this total net deficit, which included a surplus of £2.1m for the UK arrangements,
£18.2m related to obligations for arrangements in Germany, which are unfunded as is common practice in that country, £10.1m
to obligations in the US and £3.2m to obligations in the Rest of the World. With effect from 1 January 2009, the Foseco UK
pension plan has been merged with the Group’s UK plan.
(c) Other post-retirement defined benefit plans
The Group’s principal defined employee benefit plans other than pensions are healthcare benefit plans in the US and UK. As
is common for these types of plan, the costs of providing these benefits are not funded externally by the Group. Cookson Group plc 97 Annual Report 2008

(c) UK pension plan risk mitigation strategy
In 2006, the Company and the UK Plan Trustee undertook an initiative to consider how best to manage the UK Plan’s
exposure to major investment risks. The following were deemed to be the major investment risks which could affect the value
of the UK Plan’s assets compared to the value of its economic liabilities:
• Interest rate risk – the risk of government bond interest rates falling, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
• Inflation risk – the risk of inflation rising faster than expected, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
• Equity market risk – the risk of significant equity market falls, leading to a fall in the value of plan assets.
In order to mitigate these key risks, the Trustee has entered into the following financial derivative arrangements:
• Interest rate swaps – the UK Plan receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable rate of interest, based on the
London Inter Bank Offered Rate. This is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall, significantly
offsetting the corresponding increase in the value of the UK Plan’s economic liabilities.
• Inflation swaps – the UK Plan pays out a fixed rate of interest of around 3% per annum and receives payments linked to
actual inflation. This is beneficial when inflation increases faster than expected and significantly
offsets the corresponding increase in the value of the UK Plan’s economic liabilities.
• Equity derivatives – using a combination of equity derivatives, the UK Plan has bought protection against the first 20% fall
in equity market prices over the four year period from 1 December 2006. To pay for this protection,
the UK Plan foregoes any equity market price returns above about 6.5% per annum, but will continue
to receive dividend payments and the benefit of any active management out-performance of its equity
manager’s respective benchmark.
The interest rate and inflation swaps entered into are designed to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk for approximately
80% of the UK Plan’s liabilities. This investment strategy has significantly reduced the risk that the value of the UK Plan’s
assets falls materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
(d) Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 actuarial assumptions
The following table analyses, for the Group’s main UK, US and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on
plan liabilities resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other
assumptions constant.
It should be noted that the investment strategy adopted by the UK Plan, details of which are given above, was designed
to mitigate a significant majority of the interest rate and inflation risk related to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities. The
stabilising impact of this strategy is not reflected in the following table.
Impact on plan liabilities
Assumption Change in assumption UK US Germany
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by 1.7% Decrease/increase by 1.2% Decrease/increase by 1.3%
Price inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by 1.5% n/a Increase/decrease by 0.8%
Mortality Increase by one year Increase by 3.2% Increase by 2.8% Increase by 1.9%
With regard to the Group’s post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, a one percent increase in the healthcare cost trend rate
assumptions shown in the table in note 38.2(b) would increase the accumulated post-employment medical benefit obligation
by £1.0m without changing the post-employment medical benefit costs and a one percent decrease in the healthcare cost
trend rate assumptions would reduce the obligation by £0.9m without changing the post-employment medical benefit costs.

by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds. As described in note 38.2(c) below, the UK Plan operates a
hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and money market instruments, to mitigate the impact of interest rate and
inflation rate movements on the value of its projected liabilities for future pension payments (the UK Plan’s “economic
liabilities”), the value of which is related more to interest rate and inflation rate swap yields than to corporate bond yields.
When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the UK Plan’s hedging strategy
should deliver a broadly stable funding ratio (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities) not just in relation to the UK Plan’s
economic liabilities, but also under an IAS 19 basis of valuation. However, should corporate bond yields be significantly above
swap yields, as has been the case since the second half of 2007, then the IAS 19 value of the UK Plan’s liabilities will be
reduced to a greater extent than will the value of the actual underlying economic liabilities. The funding valuation of the UK
Plan’s economic liabilities as at the end of 2008 showed a funding ratio of 85%, while the IAS 19 valuation showed a funding
surplus, with a ratio of 120%. This represents a difference of approximately £140m in the valuation of the UK Plan’s liabilities,
of which £90.0m relates to the difference in the discount rates used in each valuation methodology, £30.0m due to the use
of the Long Cohort mortality assumption for funding purposes and £20.0m due to other valuation differences. The Company
continues to fund the UK Plan with reference to its economic funding position.
The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated sterling
corporate bond index, adjusted to reflect (i) the reduction to the index in January 2009 resulting from the removal of two
financial institution bonds; and (ii) a reduction aimed at matching the duration of the index to that of the UK Plan’s liabilities.
The US discount rate is based on the equivalent iBoxx index for US domestic corporations. The assumptions for price inflation
are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds.
The discount rate for Germany is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 10 year euro corporates AA index.
Expected asset return
The expected asset return is the Company’s expectation (based on market yields), at the valuation date, of long-term asset
returns. The Group’s major post-retirement investment portfolios are those related to its UK and US plans. Both portfolios are
invested in equities, bonds and cash. In addition the UK Plan invests in infrastructure and absolute return funds. The UK Plan’s
bond exposure is held through a synthetic bond portfolio, comprised of money market instruments and cash, which is
designed to give broadly the same economic exposure as a portfolio of UK government bonds split 30% fixed-interest and
70% index-linked gilts. The majority of the Group’s total post-retirement assets are in synthetic bonds, equities and bonds,
the assumptions as at 31 December 2008 as to the expected returns of which are explained below. The UK Plan has also
entered into some derivatives arrangements, detailed at 37.2(c) below, designed to mitigate equity market, interest rate and
inflation risk.
• Money market instruments and swaps – the UK Plan holds ‘synthetic bonds’, being money market instruments and swaps
intended to provide the same economic exposure as gilts, but typically delivering a
small yield above that of gilts; for 2008 the incremental yield assumed was 0.2%
per annum.
• Equities – the assumption for the UK Plan is that, in the long-term, equity investments are
considered likely to outperform government bonds by a margin of 3.5%. The
assumption for the US plans represents an outperformance of 4.3% over long-term
treasury bonds.
• Bonds – the US plans hold a mixture of government and corporate bonds and therefore the
long-term return is expected to be part-way between treasury and corporate bond
yields. Cookson Group plc 99 Annual Report 2008

(a) UK Plan asset allocation
As at 31 December 2008, the UK Plan’s assets, excluding risk-mitigation derivatives, were allocated 37% in equities (of which
47% are UK and 53% overseas); 42% in money market instruments combined with interest rate and inflation swaps; 10% in
infrastructure investments; 8% in absolute return funds; and 3% in cash. The UK Trustee’s target allocation currently
provides for money market instruments to be 40% of the UK Plan’s assets and for 10% of its assets to be held in each of
infrastructure investments and absolute return funds, with 40% to be held in equities. The infrastructure and absolute return
assets are held to reduce further the exposure to equity market risk and to provide an alternative source of return which is
not highly correlated with equity markets.
The swaps held in combination with the money market instruments (typically AAA-rated, very short-term debt) provide a
similar exposure to holding gilts and are in addition to the interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and equity options in place as
part of the risk mitigation strategy described at 38.2(c).
(b) US pension plan assets not recognised above
In addition to the assets reported above, £4.4m (2007: £9.2m) of assets were held as at 31 December 2008 to fund certain
non-qualified US pension plan obligations (note 25). These assets are not included within pension plan assets as they are
available to satisfy creditors in the event of the winding-up of the Group company in which they are held and are reported as
investments in the Group Balance Sheet.
(c) Defined benefit contributions in 2009
The Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefit pension plans of £18.0m in 2009. The Group
is also expected to make aggregate contributions in respect of its other post-retirement benefit plans of £3.0m in 2009.
Early in 2009, in response to the difficult market conditions faced by the Company’s businesses, the Company consulted
with the Trustee and both have agreed to a change to the existing schedule of additional funding payments, such that no
further additional payments will be made from January 2009 until July 2010, or until such earlier time as the Company
announces that it is to recommence payment of dividends to shareholders. Upon additional payments being recommenced,
these will amount to £16.3m per annum until June 2015. A new triennial funding valuation is due for the UK Plan as at the
end of 2009, based upon which the Company and Trustee expect to agree a new schedule of contributions to commence in
July 2010.
(d) Actual return on plan assets
The actual return on plan assets was £14.1m (2007: £21.7m).

38.3 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
The liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes are
measured by discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method,
in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.

reductions arising from business disposals and redundancy programmes. The gain of £1.0m in 2007 arose in relation to the UK
post-retirement medical plan, resulting from a reduction in the Group’s costs of providing benefits under the plan.
Of the total net curtailment loss reported in 2007 of £0.6m, £0.4m has been credited within administration, selling and
distribution costs, £2.0m has been charged within restructuring and integration costs and £1.0m has been reported as

39. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (CONTINUED)
39.1 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES (CONTINUED)
(a) Long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) (continued)
In 2007, the Remuneration Committee broadened the performance condition by including headline EPS growth. For awards
made in 2007 and for future awards, vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based on the TSR performance measure
described above and 50% on headline EPS (the calculation of which is shown in note 18) growth over a three-year period.
The two measures will operate independently.
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007, 2008 and future LTIP awards will be based on TSR
performance in accordance with the following schedule:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares vesting ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0
Median 12.5% 0.25:1
Upper quintile (top 20%) 50% 1.125:1
Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007, 2008 and future LTIP awards will be based on Headline
EPS growth, as compared with the compound annual growth in the UK Retail Prices Index (“RPI”), in accordance with the
following schedule:
Annual compound Headline Matching Shares vesting ratio
EPS growth above RPI Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below 3% 0% 0

At or above 10% 50% 1.125:1
Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
An executive’s Matching Shares award will only vest if the Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
The fair value of awards granted under the LTIP is measured using a stochastic pricing model.
(b) Mid-term incentive plan (“MTIP”)
Under the MTIP, executives were eligible to receive a bonus, paid partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares of the Company,
the beneficial receipt of which was deferred for two years from the date of the award (“restricted shares”), based upon the
achievement of target financial performance measured over a three-year period. Performance targets based on either the
Group’s cumulative profit or cumulative profit and cash flow performance were set by the Remuneration Committee for each
three-year MTIP period. The MTIP operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle culminated at the end
of 2005.
The fair value of awards granted under the MTIP is measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(c) Executive option schemes (“ESOS”)
The last executive share option grant was made in 2003. Under these schemes, share options were granted at the market
price prevailing at the time of grant. Options normally only became exercisable if the growth in Headline EPS was at least
equal to the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum (2% per annum for options granted in 1995 and 1996) for a consecutive
three year period.
The fair value of awards granted under the ESOS was measured using a stochastic pricing model.
(d) UK and international Sharesave schemes (“SAYE” schemes)
The last grant under the SAYE schemes was made in 2004. Under the SAYE schemes, employees had the opportunity to
purchase ordinary shares in the Group at a discounted price of up to 20% by using their savings together with an additional
tax free bonus at the end of their saving period. The schemes operated in conjunction with a three or five-year savings
contract and options were granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
Employees who entered into these contracts had to make monthly savings of between £5 and £250.
The fair value of awards granted under the SAYE schemes was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(e) Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
In 2007, the Company implemented a new DBP in place of the LTIP for certain corporate managers. Under this plan,
executives receive an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. These shares vest after
three years, although an executive’s allocation may lapse if their employment ceases in certain circumstances before the end
of the three-year period. The executive Directors do not participate in this plan.
The fair value of awards granted under the DBP scheme is measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.

39. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
39.1 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
The Group operates a number of different share-based payment schemes; the main features of each scheme are outlined below.
(a) Long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”)
The LTIP was introduced in 2004 to replace the Mid-Term Incentive Plan (“MTIP”) and the executive share option schemes,
both of which are being phased out.
The LTIP has two elements. Firstly, executives who are eligible receive a conditional annual award of shares worth up to
a prescribed percentage of their base salary (“Performance Shares”). Secondly, executives who are eligible can elect to invest
all or part of their annual incentive in ordinary shares of the Company (“Investment Shares”) in return for which they receive
a conditional award of ordinary shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the annual incentive so invested
(“Matching Shares”). In addition, for awards made after 7 March 2007, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to
award participants the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend record
dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.
Performance Shares and Matching Shares can vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based
on the Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. For awards made in 2006, vesting is based upon
the Group’s three-year TSR performance relative to that of the companies of its comparator group, the FTSE 250 excluding
Investment Trusts. Vesting of the Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2006 LTIP awards are determined as
follows:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares vesting ratio

42. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED
42.1 ACQUISITION OF FOSECO
In February 2008, as an initial stage in its acquisition of Foseco, the Company completed the purchase of 20 percent of the issued
share capital of Foseco India Ltd. at a cash cost of £6.9m, with directly attributable acquisition costs of £0.4m. On 4 April 2008,
the Company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Foseco at an agreed price of 295p per Foseco share,
valuing Foseco’s equity at £496.7m. In addition to the cash cost of the shares, directly attributable acquisition costs amounted to
£10.0m and net debt assumed on acquisition was £105.9m.
Foseco is a world leader in the supply of consumable products for use in the foundry and steel-making industries, with a
presence in 32 countries and major facilities in Germany, the US, the UK, Brazil, China, India, South Korea and Japan.
On 16 April 2008, the Company completed the disposal of Foseco’s Carbon Bonded Ceramics business (“CBC”) to companies
owned by RHI AG (“RHI”). In order to expedite anti-trust clearances in relation to the Company’s acquisition of Foseco, a
conditional agreement to sell CBC to RHI had been reached on 11 January 2008. CBC had revenue of approximately £19m for the
year ended 31 December 2007 and gross assets of approximately £8m as at 31 December 2007. Prior to disposal, the CBC assets
were classified as held for sale. Anti-trust clearance in connection with the acquisition of Foseco also required the disposal of the
Group’s Hi-Tech ceramic filters business, formerly part of the Ceramics division. This latter disposal was completed on 23
December 2008, to companies owned by Süd-Chemie AG. For the year ended 31 December 2008, Hi-Tech had revenue of
approximately £12m.
42.2 OTHER ACQUISITIONS
In addition to the acquisition of Foseco, in September 2008 the Group made two further acquisitions for a combined cost of
£10.7m, satisfied in cash. The fair value of the assets acquired in these transactions was £1.7m resulting in the recognition of
£9.0m of goodwill.
During 2007, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures for a total consideration of £14.1m, comprising
fair value of net assets acquired of £8.6m, associated goodwill of £3.7m, and £1.8m invested in joint ventures. The net cash
outflow in 2007 in relation to acquisitions was £14.0m.

The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the
fulfilment of obligations undertaken in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure,
together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites. The provision comprises amounts payable in respect
of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including
claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the
timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to
be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances
with regard to individual matters.
The provision for restructuring and integration costs is used to manage the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise
its operating activities. The balance of £19.5m as at 31 December 2008 relates to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives,
the majority of which commenced in 2007 and 2008 and is expected to be spent over the course of the next two years.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other
regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is
subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority
of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly
updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group Balance
Sheet only when its realisation is virtually certain. As at 31 December 2008, £11.9m (2007: £6.4m) was recorded in receivables in
respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which £9.1m (2007: £4.7m) is non-current. The amounts reported in the table
above as charged to the Group Income Statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a
movement on provisions. Other components of the charge, such as asset write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying
value of the relevant balance sheet item. Cookson Group plc 109 Annual Report 2008

realised from the acquisition, together with the value of Foseco’s assembled workforce. The fair value adjustments shown above
are provisional, based upon the fair value work that has been performed since the acquisition date. It is anticipated that the
acquisition accounting will be finalised in the Group’s 2009 half yearly financial report.
In respect of the other acquisitions, no significant fair value adjustments were made in arriving at the recognised values on
acquisition and the goodwill of £9.0m principally relates to the value of the anticipated synergies to be realised from the acquisition. Cookson Group plc 111 Annual Report 2008

45. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of discontinued operations amounted to £4.3m (2007: £3.2m). Details of
guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 19 to the Company financial statements.
The Group has extensive international operations and several companies within the Group are parties to legal proceedings,
certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the Group company involved. While the
outcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the Group’s insurance
arrangements, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially
adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or results of operations.
Legal claims have been brought against Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by
exposure to hazardous materials. Two of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits in the US relating to a small number of
products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. To date, there have been
no liability verdicts against either of these subsidiaries. A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled, and the
amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a materially adverse effect on the Group’s financial position
or results of operations.
46. PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES
Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Cookson Group plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are

47. RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms.
Transactions between related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
During the year , Group subsidiaries made sales of products and services to Group joint venture companies of £1.5m (2007: £1.2m)
and made purchases of goods and services from Group joint venture companies of £1.8m (2007: £0.2m). As at 31 December 2008,
amounts owed by the Group’s joint ventures to Group subsidiaries was £nil (2007: £nil) and amounts owed to Group joint ventures
by Group subsidiaries was £nil (2007: £nil). Details of related party information in relation to key management personnel are
given in note 12.3.
48. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
Under the terms of a fully underwritten rights issue, ordinary shareholders of the Company on the register at the close of
business on 13 February 2009 were offered 2,551,293,144 new ordinary shares of 10p each on the basis of twelve new ordinary
shares for every existing ordinary share held. These shares were fully subscribed on 4 March 2009, resulting in total proceeds
on issue of £241m, net of expenses of £14m. Cookson Group plc 113 Annual Report 2008
OUR ACCOUNTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.3 PENSION COSTS
The Company participates in a UK-wide Group pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of
the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund. The Company is unable to
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as
required by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount
charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan. The assets of the plan are held
separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.4 POST-RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS
The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not
funded and the amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit
method.
2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of loans to overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, foreign currency
borrowings, trading and other items are taken to profit or loss.
2.6 BORROWING COSTS
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct
issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
2.7 INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES
Shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment in
value.
2.8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to
manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings. In accordance with
its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to
fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being
hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. The fair value of
interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet
date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
2.9 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the
Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Cookson Group plc 112 Annual Report 2008
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
1.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Company-only financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Company’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements of Cookson Group plc, a company registered in
the United Kingdom. The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities
that are part of the Cookson Group plc group.
A separate Company-only profit and loss account has not been presented, as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies
Act 1985.
1.2 BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS
Information on the business environment in which the Group operates, including the factors that are likely to impact the future
prospects of the Group, are included in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 10 and 11 and the Operating Review on pages 12 to
21. The principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces throughout its global operations are included in the Corporate
Governance Report on pages 32 to 39. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and debt facilities are
described in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 27. In addition, notes 4 and 37 to the consolidated financial statements set out
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; financial risks; financial instruments and hedging
activities; and its exposures to credit, market (both currency and interest rate-related) and liquidity risk. Further details of the
Group’s cash balances and borrowings are included in notes 20 and 36 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has two committed debt facilities, approximately £680m of syndicated bank facilities and approximately £250m
of US Private Placement loan notes. These facilities, which together total approximately £930m, have no significant debt
maturities in 2009, with the principal maturities due in 2011 and 2012, and contain a number of financial covenants with which
the Group is required to comply. In March 2009, the Group completed a rights issue which raised proceeds (net of expenses) of
£241m which were used to repay gross borrowings. This rights issue significantly strengthens the Group’s financial position.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of
approval of these consolidated financial statements. These forecasts reflect an assessment of current end-market conditions,
their impact on the Group’s future trading performance and the actions taken by management in response to the difficult market
conditions. The forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt
facilities and show continued compliance with the financial covenants. In addition, management has considered various
mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that end-market conditions are worse than their current assessment. Such
measures include further reductions in costs, further reductions in capital expenditure and further reductions in those items of
working capital within management’s control.
On the basis of the exercise as described above and the available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the
Company.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in
relation to the Company-only financial statements.
2.1 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the
balance sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect
of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred
taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which
the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance
of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued
as receivable.
2.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for employees. Equity-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-
based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense
recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based
vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date
of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option
pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model. Cookson Group plc 115 Annual Report 2008

10. INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS
10.1 BORROWING FACILITIES
As at 31 December 2008, the Company had committed borrowing facilities of £1,044.1m (2007: £383.0m), of which £228.2m
(2007: £187.0m) were undrawn and due to expire in more than two years but not more than five years from the balance sheet
date.
The Company’s borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan Notes (“USPP”) and a multi-currency
committed syndicated bank facility of £793.7m (2007: £200.0m). The USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 December 2008 and
amounted to £250.4m (US$365.0m), of which $40.0m is repayable in November 2009, $135.0m in May 2010 and $190.0m in May
2012. The syndicated bank facility comprises £443.7m of term loans and a £350.0m revolving credit facility which terminates in
2012. This facility was used, in combination with the net proceeds of £150.6m from the share placing on 11 October 2007, to
finance the acquisition of Foseco in April 2008. This included the refinancing of the existing committed bank facilities of Cookson
and Foseco. The facility was originally repayable in three tranches: £75.0m and ¤37.5m in October 2010; £75.0m and ¤37.5m in
October 2011; and £500.0m and ¤75.0m in October 2012.
On 6 March 2009, the Company came to an agreement with the banks providing the syndicated facility whereby the Company
agreed to prepay, in March 2009, the £75.0m and ¤37.5m tranches originally due to be repaid in October 2010. In exchange for
this the banking syndicate has rescheduled by one year the tightening of the net debt to EBITDA covenant attached to the facility.
As a result, the covenant test will now be 3.5 times (previously 3.0 times) at 30 June 2009 and 31 December 2009, reverting to
3.0 times as at 30 June 2010 and thereafter. Following this change to the facility, the required future repayments are £75.0m and
¤37.5m in 2011, with the balance of £500.0m and ¤75.0m being repayable in 2012.

The cancellation in 2006 of the Company’s deferred shares and share premium account created, following the registration of the
order of the High Court with the Registrar of Companies, a non-distributable reserve of the Company of £1,003.4m reported
within other reserves. This reserve becomes distributable at such time when all external creditors of the Company as at
15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have agreed that this reserve may be deemed distributable, or to the extent
that additional share capital or share premium arises after 2006 as a result of an issue of new shares.

17. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
17.1 PENSION PLANS
The Company participates in a UK-wide Group defined benefit pension scheme. The Company is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and therefore accounts for its membership of the scheme as it would for a defined
contribution scheme. Costs charged in the year in respect of its contributions payable to the scheme were £23.4m (2007: £4.6m).
The pension scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be
expected to increase as the members of the scheme reach retirement.
The last full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary,
was carried out as at 31 December 2006. At that date, the market value of the plan assets was £278.3m, representing 78% of
accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected unit method of valuation) of £356.6m. Calculated on a ‘buy-out’ basis
(using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were
£475.7m, representing a funding level of 59%. The 2006 full valuation has been updated, as appropriate, in order to estimate the
liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2008, at which date the market value of the plan assets was £406.3m (2007: £318.1m),
representing 120% (2007: 92%) of estimated accrued plan benefits of £337.6m (2007: £344.1m).
The Company also participates in a UK-wide defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charge represents
contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to £0.1m (2007: £0.1m). There were no outstanding
contributions payable to the scheme as at 31 December 2008 (31 December 2007: £nil).

Treasury shares
As at 1 January 2008, 0.6m ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company were held by Cookson Investments (Jersey) Limited, as
Trustee of the Cookson Group Employee Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), with a nominal value of £0.1m, which were purchased
at a gross cost of £5.3m. During the year 0.7m shares were purchased by the ESOP at a cost of £3.9m to meet future share option
obligations. In addition, 0.9m shares were utilised by the ESOP to meet share option obligations and accordingly £6.6m has been
transferred from the treasury shares reserve to retained earnings, net of £0.3m consideration received.
As at 31 December 2008, the number of ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company so held in trust was 0.4m, having a
nominal value of £nil, which were purchased at a gross cost of £2.6m. The purchase of these shares was financed by the Company
out of borrowings included in the Company Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2008. The market value of these shares as at
31 December 2008 was £0.5m (2007: £4.4m). The Trustee of the ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends on the shares
held. The shares are held, as treasury shares, to meet share option obligations as and when they arise at the discretion of the
Company.

17.2 POST-EMPLOYMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS
The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not
funded. The level of the accrued plan benefits provision is based on independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit
method. The last full actuarial valuation of the plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out
at 31 December 2008, at which date the accrued plan benefits were £1.2m (2007: £1.3m; 2006: £3.8m; 2005: £4.9m; 2004:
£4.2m). During 2007 changes were made to the post-retirement healthcare plan which resulted in a reduction of the costs borne
by the Company in order to meet its liabilities under the plan. As a result of these changes a curtailment credit arose of £1.0m,
reducing the plan benefits accrual.

19. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group,
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make
a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2008 in respect of the liabilities of its
subsidiary companies amounted to £66.9m (31 December 2007: £39.7m) and guarantees under property leases of discontinued
operations amounted to £4.3m (31 December 2007: £3.2m).
In addition, on behalf of its subsidiaries the Company has given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to
£396.8m (2007: £344.1m), representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at
31 December 2008. Further details of these consignment arrangements are given in note 28 to the consolidated financial
statements.
Cookson has extensive international operations and several of its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of
which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved. While the outcome of litigation
can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company
and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
20. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
Under the terms of a fully underwritten rights issue, ordinary shareholders of the Company on the register at the close of
business on 13 February 2009 were offered 2,551,293,144 new ordinary shares of 10p each on the basis of twelve new ordinary
shares for every existing ordinary share held. These shares were fully subscribed on 4 March 2009, resulting in total proceeds
on issue of £241m, net of expenses of £14m. Cookson Group plc 125 Annual Report 2008

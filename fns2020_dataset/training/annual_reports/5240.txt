Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Introduction
The	past	y ear	has	seen	eg	get	back	onto	an	“ev en	k eel”	after	
the	di f ficul ties	of	the	pr evious	y ear	which	ar ose	f r om	the	
global	financial	crisis	and	deepened	r apidly	f r om	the	autumn	
of	2008	on w ar ds.	Our	f ocus	has	r emained	r esolutely	on	our	
cor e	business	of	dev eloping	and	del iv ering	back	of fice	
optimisation	softw ar e	and	associated	services	which	deliv er	
substantial	and	measur able	cost	sa vings	f or	our	customers.
Al though	contr act	decision	times	continue	to	be	length y ,	the	
financial	services	sector	is	now	seemingly	wi l ling	to	in v est	in	
pr ojects	f or	which	ther e	is	a	tangible	and	posi tiv e	r eturn.	W e	
ar e	pr oud	of	our	blue-chip	customer	base,	both	in	the	UK	and	
international ly .	W e	ha v e	demonstr ated	clearly	our	abi li t y	to

r ev enue	f r om	support	services,	addi tional	l icences	and	
implementation	services	—	in	ef f ect,	sel ling	mor e	deeply	and	
widely	into	our	existing	customer	base	—	as	wel l	as	pr ocuring	
new	customers.	Nation wide	is	an	ex cel lent	example:	eg	made	
i ts	first	l icence	sale	to	Nation wide’ s	Li f e	Assur ance	division	in	
2005;	this	w as	f ol lowed	b y	a	suc cession	of	addi tional	l icence	
sales	to	other	parts	of	the	business,	culminating	in	Nation wide	
buying	an	enterprise- wide	licence	in	December	2009.	W e	ha v e	
dev eloped	a	suc cessf ul	business	model	based	on	an	ini tial	sale	
to	pr o v e	the	concept	f ol lowed	b y	additional	r ol l-out	sales.	This	
has	been	achiev ed	wi th	a	number	of	other	existing	customers	
in	the	UK	and	international ly .
The	r ecent	acquisi tion	of	XT AQ	incr eases	the	Compan y ’ s	
customer	l ist	f r om	25	to	nearly	40	wi th	companies	such	as	
B ar cla y car d,	Citibank,	GE	Capi tal,	Principal i t y	B uilding	Societ y	
and	R o y al	B ank	of	S cotland	as	wel l	as	a	number	of	publ ic

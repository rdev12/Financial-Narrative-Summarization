The Kinexus rheometer is a new platform for analysing the 
flow properties of materials. Designed for ease of use, its 
adaptive intelligence guides users on how to operate the 
system quickly, leaving them more time to investigate ways in 
which to characterise and optimise a material’s performance.

Chairman’s Statement
John Hughes, Chairman
Introduction
Spectris achieved a good performance in 2008, in spite of an 
economic environment which deteriorated during the second 
half of the year. Sales for the full year increased by 19% to  
£787.1 million compared with £659.8 million in 2007*. On  
a constant currency basis, sales increased by 7%, of which 
approximately 4% was from acquisitions. 
Operating profit increased by 13% to £118.3 million (2007: 
£104.3 million). On a constant currency basis, operating profit 
increased by 2%, of which approximately 3% was from 
acquisitions. Operating margins were 15.0%, compared with 
15.8% in the prior year. Increased expenditure on research  
and development led to a reduction of 0.4 percentage points  
(pp) in operating margins, acquisitions resulted in a reduction 
of 0.2pp and the dilutive effect of foreign exchange reduced 
margins by 0.1pp. Profit before tax increased by 12% to  
£110.1 million (2007: £98.0 million) and earnings per share 
increased by 25% to 72.8 pence (2007: 58.1 pence). The effective 
tax rate reduced by 4pp to 24%, as a result of a tax-efficient 
inter-company financing structure and the recognition of tax 
losses brought forward in the UK.
Cash conversion was strong, with 86% of operating profit 
converted to operating cash. Capital investment was in excess  
of depreciation due to investment in a new technical centre for 
one of our businesses in the UK and investment in IT system 
upgrades. Net debt at the end of the period was £162.1 million, 
compared with £77.3 million at the end of December 2007. The 
increase is due to the cost of acquisitions, capital expenditure 
and the weakening of sterling. Net interest costs were  
£8.2 million, giving an annualised cover of 14.4 times.
The group’s financial position is strong. At 31 December 2008, 
the group had cash of £64 million, committed facilities of 
£257 million (of which £217 million was utilised), and 
uncommitted facilities of £41 million (of which £10 million  
was utilised). Since the year end, an additional £50 million, 
five-year loan facility has been secured.
“ The group is in a strong financial and 
strategic position and we consider that the 
actions we are taking are appropriate in the 
near term whilst retaining in our businesses 
the resources to support growth as market 
demand recovers.”
*  Two businesses were divested in 2007. In order to aid understanding of the 
results for the ongoing business, references in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Statement, Operating Review and Financial Review to the sales and 
operating profit results in the 2007 comparatives exclude the results of these 
two businesses. Unless otherwise stated, figures for operating profit, profit 
before tax and earnings per share are adjusted measures – for explanation of 
adjusted figures and reconciliation to the statutory reported figures see Note 3. 03

Financial highlights
The Board proposes to pay a final dividend of 17.0 pence which, 
combined with the interim dividend of 6.4 pence, gives a total  
of 23.4 pence (2007: 21.0 pence), an increase of 11%. The dividend 
will be paid on 26 June 2009 to shareholders on the register on  
5 June 2009.
Outlook
The current market conditions continue to be challenging and  
offer very limited visibility. We have taken, and continue to take, 
timely actions to reduce operating costs and, should the outlook 
deteriorate further, we will not hesitate to take additional steps. As 
a result of the phasing of restructuring costs and their associated 
benefits, the balance between first and second half year profitability 
is expected to be materially different from past years. The group is 
in a strong financial and strategic position and we consider that  
the actions we are taking are appropriate in the near term whilst 
retaining in our businesses the resources to support growth as 
market demand recovers.

Chief Executive’s Statement
“ We are pleased with the strategic and 
operational progress we made in 2008.  
We have grown sales and profits and  
have made good progress on delivering  
against our strategy.”
John O’Higgins, Chief Executive
Introduction
Spectris delivered a good performance in 2008, with sales and 
profits from continuing businesses improving compared with  
the prior year. At constant currencies, sales increased by 7% and 
operating profit increased by 2%. Sales growth in the second  
half of the year was slower than in the first half as tougher 
economic conditions led to demand reducing in some of our 
markets. However, this weakening was offset to some extent  
by the contribution from acquisitions made in the year and  
by continuing good demand in markets such as energy and 
pharmaceuticals.
Strategy
We continued to deliver against our strategy:
Strengthening market positions through innovation •	
 Increasing regional expansion with a focus on  •	
emerging markets
Growing existing businesses through acquisition •	
Focusing on operational excellence •	
 Building our presence in key strategic growth areas,  •	
both organically and through acquisition.
Strengthening market positions through innovation
In late 2007, we took the decision to make strategic growth 
investments in research and development and during 2008 we 
increased expenditure on R&D by over £12 million to £57 million, 
or 7.2% of sales (2007: 6.8%). The increased investment was 
targeted primarily at speeding up time to market for selective 
product development programmes, particularly in the Materials 
Analysis segment. Examples of the new products and applications 
launched during the year are described in the Operating Review 
which follows. 
Increasing regional expansion with a focus on emerging 
markets
Total group sales at constant currencies increased in all major 
regions. Sales in Asia grew by 8%, with China continuing to see 
good growth of 14%, however, sales in Japan declined by 7% due  
to a slowdown in the electronics, automotive and semiconductor 
industries. Sales in North America increased by 8%. In Europe, 
sales increased by 3%, with Germany up 10%. Sales in industrialising 
markets such as Latin America, Russia, the Middle East and Africa 
increased by 24%, reflecting the continuing growth in these regions. 
Asia and the other industrialising countries now comprise 35% of 
total group sales.
We continued to invest in initiatives to expand our direct sales 
presence in key markets. In January 2008, HBM acquired its 
distributors in the Nordic countries. In May, PANalytical and 
Malvern Instruments opened a new joint headquarters in North 
America, extending their applications laboratories and training 
facilities. In August, Particle Measuring Systems acquired its 
distributor in China, increasing its direct sales presence in the key 
market of electronics in Asia. Service and consumables account for 
around 24% of sales, reflecting the importance of the aftermarket 
business, particularly as customers look to outsource this area of 
their business in order to reduce their own costs.  05
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Business Review Governance Financial Statements Overview
Growing existing businesses through acquisition
During the year, we invested a total of £88.8 million in acquisitions 
to strengthen our existing businesses. In addition to the 
distributors described above, we acquired Viscotek Corporation,  
a leading provider of chromatography solutions, during the first 
quarter. During the third quarter, we acquired nCode, a leading 
supplier of durability test and analysis software and data 
acquisition instruments, and the Siemens Machine Vision 
Business, an industry leader in automatic identification and  
data capture. In December, the acquisition of LDS Test and 
Measurement was completed. LDS is a leading provider of data 
acquisition and instrumentation products and vibration test 
systems and is an excellent fit with the existing businesses in the 
Test and Measurement segment. Since the year end, we have 
completed a further acquisition for the Test and Measurement 
segment to strengthen our position in the global noise 
management market. The companies acquired and their strategic 
fit to our businesses are described in more detail in the Operating 
Review which follows. 
Focusing on operational excellence
The emphasis on operational excellence continued. Our focus on 
improving purchasing efficiency resulted in growth of 22% in the 
volume of components purchased in Asia and Eastern Europe.  
Our gas analysis business completed the relocation of its system 
build activities to Shanghai, China, in order to be closer to its key 
customers in Asia and develop a more competitive cost base in this 
region. Many of our operating companies are investing in lean 
manufacturing initiatives aimed at increasing quality, reducing 
inventories and improving supply chain efficiencies.
Conclusion
In summary, we are pleased with the strategic and operational 
progress we made in 2008. We have grown sales and profits and 
have made good progress on delivering against our strategy, as 
evidenced by the increased investment in both acquisitions  
and research and development to accelerate our new product 
development programmes, which lay the foundations for future 
growth. The current market conditions continue to be challenging 
and offer very limited visibility. We consider that the actions we  
are taking to reduce operating costs are appropriate in the near 
term whilst retaining in our businesses the resources to support 
growth as market demand recovers.

segment, adding capability in complete excitation systems and 
enabling customers to purchase the complete test system for 
both structural analysis and vibration testing from a single 
source to enhance productivity in their research and 
development cycles.  06

Business Review
Group Overview
We operate on a global scale
Our sales and service offices are located around the 
world, supporting customers in the key regions of Europe, 
Asia and the Americas, and with a growing presence in 
other expanding regions in the rest of the world. 
We enable our customers to achieve rapid 
payback on their investment
Our products generally involve low capital expenditure 
and bring significant and rapid payback for customers in 
terms of increased productivity. A typical example is the 
installation of a BTG Mütek system at a large producer  
of recycled fibre-based carton board, which, by cutting 
chemical additives and boosting productivity, paid for 
itself in just three months. In another example, a UK 
mineral processing company has increased throughput  
by around 60% following the installation of a Malvern 
in-line particle size analyser. The majority of our sales  
are to customers who are looking to upgrade existing 
processes at modest cost.
This Business Review forms part of, and should be read in conjunction with, the 
Directors’ Report.

Business Review
Strategy and Objectives
Our objective is to deliver shareholder value  
over the long term by supplying productivity-
enhancing solutions for our customers. 
Our strategy is based on five key elements:
Strengthening market positions through innovation •	
We invest around 6-7% of sales each year in R&D (7.2% in 
2008), with the aim of developing and delivering advanced 
products and applications to our customers. Working closely 
with customers, experienced engineers develop solutions which 
are tailored to the customer’s specific requirements, based on 
standard platforms customised through high added value 
applications engineering. This understanding of our customers’ 
processes brings significant competitive advantage. Much of our 
technology is proprietary and protected by patents or process 
know-how. New products and applications may be developed in 
house, by acquiring bolt-on product lines or by collaboration 
and licensing agreements for proprietary technology in 
partnership with universities and other institutions.
 Increasing regional expansion with a focus  •	
on emerging markets  
We seek to grow our businesses around the world, with 
particular emphasis on industrialising markets such as China, 
India and Latin America. We continue to establish sales and 
support facilities in these regions so that we are able to support 
our global customers wherever they are based. 
 Growing existing businesses through acquisition •	
We seek to enhance the growth potential of our businesses by 
pursuing an active but disciplined approach to acquisitions, 
focusing on businesses which are strong players in specific 
application areas where there are significant barriers to entry.
 Focusing on operational excellence •	
We continue to focus on improving all aspects of our business 
through a range of actions including: process efficiencies, value 
pricing, optimising the business mix, cost competitiveness, 
designing products for low-cost production, reducing inventory 
and improving supply chain management. 
 Building our presence in key strategic growth areas,  •	
both organically and through acquisition  
We aim to grow our existing businesses organically by 
developing new products as well as pursuing opportunities for 
growth in new markets, such as nano-technology and life 
sciences. Our investment in R&D enables us to maintain our 
leading market positions and acquisitions are targeted at both 
existing and new markets. 
Business model
In order to deliver our strategy successfully, we organise our 
businesses in a way that combines the benefits of a multinational 
group with the best aspects of entrepreneurial capability. Our 
business model is based on a flat organisational structure of four 
segments, each comprising a number of autonomous operating 
companies, with management teams who have a high degree of 
responsibility and accountability, operating within a framework 
of group management and control. Within each business segment, 
the companies operate with their own brands, sales and service 
channels, tailored to meet individual customer requirements, 
enabling them to meet their customers’ demands. The key benefit 
of this results-driven structure is that management teams have 
local ownership and can focus on their priorities and react  
quickly to changing customer and market demand. High calibre 
employees, including qualified scientists, applications engineers 
and technicians, have direct contact with users to develop solutions 
that deliver tangible benefits. Stand-alone acquisitions must share 
these business characteristics and have the management strength 
to operate as autonomous units within the Spectris group. 
Central to our philosophy is a small corporate centre which 
determines the strategy and drives and monitors its 
implementation. In addition to setting and monitoring the group’s 
overall policies and values, the centre provides advice and selective 
support services such as legal, tax and treasury, establishing a 
control framework within which entrepreneurial cultures can 
thrive and knowledge can be shared between businesses.
SERVOPRO MultiExact   
The SERVOPRO MultiExact is an innovative multi-gas 
analyser specifically developed to meet the latest 
industry requirements for air separation plants. It 
provides exceptional levels of accuracy, stability and 
reliability for all required gas measurements, whilst 
offering unparalleled ease-of-use and minimising 
maintenance and cost of ownership. 09

Key Performance Indicators
We monitor progress against the delivery of 
our strategic goals via four key performance 
indicators.
1. Sales 
Sales growth is a measure of how we are growing our 
business organically. We aim to achieve year-on-year 
growth in sales, on a like-for-like basis, which excludes 
the effects of currency translation and acquisitions 
or divestments.
In 2008, total sales for continuing businesses were  
£787.1 million.
4. Cash conversion
We focus on cash generation and use cash conversion as  
a performance measure as we believe cash represents an 
effective measure of the quality of our earnings. Our target 
is to deliver high cash conversion of operating profit in 
each financial year. Cash conversion is defined as operating 
cash flow as a percentage of adjusted operating profit. 
Capital investment was 162% of depreciation (2007: 97%), 
due to an investment in a technical centre in the UK and 
investments in IT systems upgrades. Excluding the excess 
of capital investment expenditure over depreciation, cash 
conversion in 2008 would have been 93%. In 2008 cash 
conversion as reported was 86%.
2. Return on sales
Return on sales is a measure of improving profitability  
in our business. Return on sales is defined as adjusted 
operating profit as a percentage of sales. In 2005 we 
announced our intention to achieve a mid-teens return  
on sales margin. This was achieved in 2007. Our aim is 
now to sustain or improve margins over time.
In 2008 return on sales for continuing businesses was 15.0%.
3. Earnings per share 
Earnings per share is a commonly used measure of financial 
performance for shareholders. We aim to achieve growth in 
adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share in 
2008 was 72.8p. Adjusted earnings excludes certain 
non-operational items as defined by management in Note 3. 
Adjusted earnings per share is defined as the ratio of 
adjusted net profit for the year to the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 10

Overview
Materials Analysis provides a wide range of analytical 
instrumentation and systems for material characterisation  
to the metals and mining, pharmaceutical and life sciences,  
and semiconductor industries. Our products help customers  
to improve accuracy and speed of materials analysis in the 
laboratory and in process manufacturing applications.  
The operating companies in this segment are Malvern 
Instruments, PANalytical and Particle Measuring Systems.
Market drivers
In addition to the need to improve process manufacturing 
productivity, a key factor in the demand for this segment’s 
products is the requirement for certification to comply with 
regulation, for example for quality control in the manufacture 
of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry and detection of 
materials such as lead and cadmium to meet legislation on  
the use of hazardous substances. Another driver for materials 
analysis instrumentation is the growth in new molecular and 
material sciences, where our equipment is used to analyse  
and characterise materials and structures in the development  
of new products.

Segment performance
Sales in Materials Analysis increased by 18% (8% at constant 
currencies) to £253.2 million. Operating profit increased by  
8% to £37.5 million. Operating margins declined from 16.3%  
to 14.8%. Approximately 0.9pp of this reduction was due to a 
34% increase in research and development expenditure in this 
segment from 7.5% to 8.4% of sales, and 0.6pp was due to the 
dilutive effects of foreign exchange rates. 
Malvern launched a number of new products aimed at the 
pharmaceutical and life sciences industry, with particular 
emphasis on the characterisation of proteins. These included 
two additions to the highly successful Zetasizer family: the 
Zetasizer APS and the Zetasizer µV, both of which are used  
for measuring the particle size and distribution of proteins  
and nano-particles in drug development. These products  
utilise technology developed by Viscotek, the business  
Malvern acquired in January. Particle Measuring Systems 
continued to focus on contamination monitoring products  
for the pharmaceutical industry and extended its capabilities  
for counting aerosol particle concentrations in the nano-
particulate range (down to one nanometre of diameter)  
through the acquisition of a 31.2% investment in Naneum 
Limited, a company supplying instruments for nano- 
technology applications.
PANalytical saw continuing demand from the metals, minerals 
and mining industry, despite the sector slowing in the second 
half of the year, as the need for greater efficiency and cost 
reduction sustained demand for analytical instruments. The 
company extended its range of products specifically designed 
for materials applications. One example is the MiniPal 4 Sulfur, 
based on the highly successful MiniPal compact spectrometer. 
Designed for petrochemical analysis, this product helps 
industrial customers demonstrate, amongst other things, 
compliance with new European legislation on sulphur in fuel. 
X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy has also emerged as an optimal 
solution for the screening of toxic heavy metals regulated by  
the EU directives RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) 
and WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and 
PANalytical’s equipment is helping customers to ensure their 
products meet these standards.
In the semiconductor industry, with a few notable exceptions, 
there was a decline in investment in capital equipment and the 
industry is beginning to see some consolidation. The reduction 
in demand for production-related equipment was offset to some 
extent by continued demand from universities and government-
funded institutions for research and development solutions  
for the analysis of new materials and complex structures, 
particularly in the fields of material sciences, which benefited 
PANalytical.
Outlook
We expect that consolidation in the pharmaceutical sector will 
continue to be a feature of the industry, however, our operating 
companies, with the new products and applications they have 
recently introduced, together with those they have acquired, are 
well placed to capture the opportunities in this sector, particularly 
in the increasingly important fields of life sciences and 
biotechnology. Demand in the metals, minerals and mining 
industry fell sharply towards the end of 2008 as capital expenditure 
was reined in, however, service and consumables are a major 
feature in this sector and we expect the demand for these to 
continue. Although demand in the semiconductor industry is not 
expected to improve in 2009, this market represents less than 5% 
of revenues in this segment and is thus not expected to have a 
significant impact. 
MiniPal 4 Sulfur
The MiniPal 4 Sulfur compact spectrometer is 
designed for accurate and precise petrochemical 
analysis. Its improved sensitivity and lower limits 
of detection provide reliable and cost-effective 
analysis of elements and also help to ensure 
compliance with environmental regulations,  
for example legislation to reduce sulphur  
levels in fuel. 14

Overview
Test and Measurement supplies test and measuring equipment 
for research and development, principally to the aerospace and 
automotive industries. For customers in these industries, our 
products and applications help them to design safer, more 
fuel-efficient, environmentally-friendly vehicle platforms whilst 
reducing time to market. Further applications are in consumer 
electronics and the environmental monitoring market.  
The operating companies in this segment are Brüel & Kjær  
Sound & Vibration and HBM.
Market drivers
Product testing and quality control are the principal drivers of 
demand in the test and measurement sector. Prototype testing is 
a costly, but unavoidable, stage in the development of many 
consumer durable products. R&D engineers must ensure not only 
that consumer requirements are met within shorter development 
cycle times, but also compliance with ever-increasing 
environmental, safety and efficiency targets. In addition to 
product development, increasing legislation and regulation on 
noise levels, for example EU directives on noise regulation for 
airports, cities and workplace noise, is also driving demand for 
our test and measurement applications.
Segment performance
Sales in Test and Measurement increased by 23% (8% at constant 
currencies) to £254.9 million. Operating profit increased by 13% 
to £29.7 million. An increase in R&D expenditure from 7.2% of 
sales to 7.8% led to operating margins, at 11.7%, being lower than 
the prior year figure of 12.6%. 
Automotive industry investment is focused on research and 
development of new models, with the emphasis on bringing 
smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles to market as quickly as 
possible. Shorter development cycles result in higher volumes of 
data requiring rapid analysis and manufacturers are now using 
software modelling to assess new vehicle designs before the 
prototype is built. This reduces the number of tests required and 
thus shortens the development time, helping to cut costs and 
reduce time to market. The acquisition of nCode extends our  15
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
software capabilities in this area, providing customers with the 
technology to carry out fatigue and durability testing and life 
prediction, as well as noise and vibration analysis and accelerated 
testing. The acquisition of the LDS Test and Measurement business 
broadens our portfolio of data acquisition instruments and adds 
world-leading capability in vibration testing, enabling us to 
provide customers with complete test systems.
Materials testing is increasingly being used in applications such as 
construction, mechanical engineering, and the energy industry. 
Orders were received for a number of new projects in the field of 
renewable energies, including supplying and installing test and 
measurement equipment for a research project in Germany to 
minimise material usage in the main stem of wind turbines, which 
are made of expensive steel and commonly weigh around 350 
tonnes. The research focuses on materials, assembly processes and 
new manufacturing methods for these critical support structures. 
HBM’s systems are being used in onshore research to test the 
stresses which would result from the wind, waves and salt water  
to which the materials will be subjected when used offshore.  
We also received significant orders from leading commercial 
aircraft manufacturers for testing applications on new  
development programmes.
As regulation increases, particularly in the area of noise pollution 
from airports and cities, demand for environmental monitoring  
is growing. This has benefited Brüel & Kjær, who supply noise 
monitoring and analysis solutions to customers around the world. 
In February 2009, we extended our capabilities in environmental 
monitoring systems to offer customers an increased range of 
products, including a suite of noise management solutions and 
innovative web-based services. 
Outlook
The automotive industry is facing a challenging year. The focus  
for new vehicle development will continue to be on building smaller, 
more fuel-efficient cars which meet increasingly stringent legislation 
on noise emissions and pollution control, and the products acquired 
in 2008 give our companies greater capabilities to capture the 
opportunities available. In the aerospace industry, ongoing 
programmes for new aircraft offer good prospects for this segment. 
Additionally, good demand is expected for data acquisition and 
measurement applications in environmental monitoring. 
The acquisition of nCode extends our software 
capabilities for research and development programmes  
in the automotive and aerospace industries. nCode’s 
products enable customers to carry out fatigue and 
durability simulation, providing them with the full  
testing cycle from virtual to physical test. This helps 
manufacturers to cut test and prototype cycles, saving 
time and money and speeding up time to market.

DRT-5500
The DRT-5500 Freeness Inline is the fastest, smallest 
and most flexible drainage rate transmitter on the 
market. It improves control during refining of the 
pulp and stabilises the drainage rate, which affects 
paper properties such as composition and strength. 
Improved drainage leads to lower energy 
consumption, reducing costs for pulp and  
paper manufacturers. 
In-line Instrumentation
Continued demand for oil and gas;  
strong growth in industrial gas business 
Demand for tissue products sustains  
pulp and paper market
Good growth in Asia, Middle East  
and Africa
Converting and packaging sectors

Overview
In-line Instrumentation provides process analytical measurement, 
asset monitoring and on-line controls for both primary processing 
and the converting industries. Our products and applications 
provide precision measurement in challenging operating 
environments, ensuring process quality, asset uptime, safety, and 
improved yield. The operating companies in this segment are Beta 
LaserMike, Brüel & Kjær Vibro, BTG Group, Fusion UV Systems, 
NDC Infrared Engineering and Servomex. 
Market drivers
The growing requirement to improve process manufacturing 
productivity and drive down costs in an increasingly competitive 
global environment has led to greater demand for process 
instrumentation. End user markets are facilities with critical plant 
assets such as paper mills and converting plants where downtime 
and lost production are costly. Environmental issues are also key 
drivers for process instrumentation in these industries. The oil and 
gas industry continues to focus on enhancing productivity and is 
seeing growing demand from the industrialising economies. 
Increasing power costs have led energy-intensive industries such as 
pulp and paper to install new instrumentation as they seek 
production efficiencies. Investment in infrastructure is also driving 
demand for process control solutions worldwide. The growth in 
demand for renewable resources, for example alternative energy 
sources such as hydro-electric and wind power, as well as the need 
to meet regulations on reducing emissions, has led to an increase 
in demand for process control solutions. Safety is also a priority in 
these industries, where it is a requirement to monitor gas emissions 
and other harmful substances in order to comply with increased 
health and safety regulation.
Segment performance
Sales in In-line Instrumentation increased by 17% (5% at constant 
currencies) to £233.3 million. Operating profit increased by 23% to 
£42.7 million and operating margins increased by 1pp to 18.3%. 
The favourable effects of foreign exchange rates and R&D 
expenditure growing at a slower rate than sales contributed to the 
increase in operating margins.

Overview Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
The high price of oil in the first half of 2008 led to rapid 
development of natural gas production and transportation  
and process efficiencies in existing plants, resulting in good  
growth for Servomex in this sector, particularly in the  
Americas. The company also saw strong growth in the industrial 
gas business and in June signed a global supply agreement with  
Air Liquide to supply industrial gas analysers to their operations 
worldwide. The aftermarket business is also showing good growth 
as customers look to outsource their service and maintenance 
work. In November, Servomex opened a new technical centre in 
Crowborough, England, merging the production, management and 
R&D facilities under one roof for the first time. In the last quarter, 
the company launched two new gas analysers: the SERVOTOUGH-
Oxy and SERVOPRO-MultiExact, which set new industry 
benchmarks in flexible, accurate and reliable gas measurement. 
Brüel & Kjær Vibro continued to see good demand for its condition 
monitoring products for oil and gas installations and for remote 
monitoring systems for wind turbines.
In the pulp and paper industry, although some capacity was taken 
out of the industry over the summer, the falling price of energy in 
the second half of the year helped paper manufacturers to improve 
margins, however temporary shutdowns were implemented at 
many mills at the end of the year to reduce inventories. Certain 
grades of paper have remained unaffected, with the market for 
tissue products growing in all regions of the world. This benefited 
BTG who saw increased demand for high performance creping 
blades as a replacement for traditional steel blades. In addition,  
the company secured an order to supply its new blades to a major 
tissue manufacturer for production of a new product. During the 
year BTG launched a number of new products which help to reduce 
pulp and papermaking costs, including a drainage rate transmitter 
which provides improved control during refining of the pulp and 
reduces energy consumption. 
Customer investment in alternative energy sources continued to 
create demand for products from NDC and Fusion. NDC received 
orders for the on-line measurement of proprietary coatings used in 
solar panel production and Fusion also saw increasing demand for 
its UV curing equipment from the solar energy market. Fusion’s 
equipment is used for the curing of adhesives, layers and coatings 
on a variety of solar energy-generating platforms.
Demand from the converting industry was strong in the first  
half of the year but orders slowed towards the end of the year  
as the difficult economic environment became evident. At NDC, 
speciality markets such as lithium ion battery production continue 
to generate good demand. The company introduced a new on-line 
web measurement and control system, the Pro.Net TDI, which 
features a ‘Total Distributed Intelligence’ architecture, breaking 
down complex gauging tasks to their simplest components. The 
system uses operator interfaces supplied by another Spectris 
operating company, Red Lion Controls. Red Lion’s operator 
interfaces are also being used on NDC’s newly-launched 710e 
series of ethernet-enabled on-line gauging systems for process 
control. These systems measure critical parameters such as  
coat weight and moisture in the converting and papermaking 
industries, as well as moisture, fat and protein for a wide range of 
applications in the food industry. Beta LaserMike saw good sales  
of its products to the metals industry, which is now the company’s 
second largest market, after cable, with increasing sales into new 
applications rather than cold mill operations. The company also 
launched the LaserSpeed 4000 gauge which provides non-contact 
length and speed measurement in non-metals applications such as 
plastics and film. 
Demand for optical fibre continued to grow, driven by oceanic 
undersea cables and for fibre-to-the-home applications, 
particularly in the Asia Pacific region. This has resulted in fibre 
producers recommissioning ‘mothballed’ production equipment 
and/or adding new equipment to increase volumes and production 
speeds. This has benefited Beta LaserMike, who supply a variety of 
process control systems to address the different stages in the 
manufacture and quality control of optical fibre, and Fusion, 
whose equipment is used to cure the barrier coatings that are 
required to protect the glass fibre prior to its incorporation into the 
transmission cables.
Outlook
Customer investment in the energy market is expected to continue, 
despite the falling oil price. The focus on alternative energy sources 
continues, in particular the use of wind turbines, where Spectris 
has a growing presence in both development of new materials for 
the turbine structures and in remote monitoring of power 
generation. The outlook for the pulp and paper market remains 
uncertain in the short term, although demand for tissue is 
expected to continue to grow. The converting industry is slowing 
in some areas, particularly in China, but speciality markets in 
converting and high technology, especially lithium ion battery 
production, are still doing well in this region.
Series 710e 
The Series 710e is a new range of 
on-line gauging systems, featuring 
high-speed digital processing 
technology and ethernet 
connectivity. The systems provide 
real-time measurement of critical 
parameters such as coat weight 
and moisture in the converting and 
papermaking industries, as well as 
moisture, fat and protein for a 
wide range of applications in the 
food industry. 18

Universal signal conditioners 
The new IAMS series of universal signal conditioners 
feature a detachable LCD display/programming 
module. This provides simple push-button 
programming which allows the signal conditioner  
to be easily set up and can be used to programme 
multiple units in the same way, greatly reducing 
configuration time. When not being used for 
programming, it can remain attached to the unit  
to indicate the input parameters, in the same way  
as a panel meter.
Industrial Controls
Good demand from general manufacturing 
applications, but weakness in second half
Continued growth in industrialising economies 
Acquisition of Siemens’ Machine Vision Business 
expands tracking and traceability solutions 
Overview
Industrial Controls supplies automation and control products  
for the discrete manufacturing industries. Our products provide 
identification and tracking solutions during the manufacturing 
process, displays for process monitoring and control, and data 
interfaces for a broad range of manufacturing industries. Sales  
are indirectly to end users via distributors as well as directly to 
original equipment manufacturers, with a significant proportion  
of repeat business. The operating companies in this segment are 
Microscan and Red Lion Controls. 
Market drivers
Manufacturing automation is growing in importance as customers 
compete in an increasingly global environment where improving 
efficiency and reducing unit costs are key to survival. Another 
significant factor driving automation and control equipment is  
the demand for increased operational data regarding product 
manufacture, and the need to improve processes to reduce  
rework and scrap, for example by tracking products through the 
manufacturing process and beyond so that they can be traced  
in the event of a product recall. In some industries, such as the 
aerospace and pharmaceutical industries, product tracking  
by means of barcodes is a regulatory requirement.
Segment performance
Sales in Industrial Controls increased by 19% (9% at constant 
currencies) to £45.7 million. Operating profit was £8.4 million 
compared with £8.6 million in the prior year. Operating margins 
were 18.4% (2007: 22.5%). Changes in the product mix, an increase 
in research and development expenditure, and acquisition 
integration costs resulted in margins being lower than in the 
previous year.

second half of the year, including large plant floor marquee 
displays for factory floors, the G3 Kadet series of operator interface 
panels with touchscreen displays for process machinery, and 
universal signal conditioners with detachable LCD display and 
programming modules. 
Outlook
Whilst the longer-term demand drivers for general automation 
continue to be positive, this segment is particularly sensitive to 
general manufacturing and industrial output. The acquisition of 
the Siemens Machine Vision Business has enabled us to increase 
the served market within the broader industrial controls space, 
estimated to be in the region of £10 billion, particularly in the  
area of product tracking.
The acquisition of the Siemens Machine Vision Business

Reported sales in continuing businesses increased by 19% to  
£787.1 million. Favourable movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates had an impact of approximately £81.7 million  
or 12% on sales, meaning that sales in continuing businesses 
increased by approximately 7% on a constant currency basis. The 
year-on-year impact on sales from acquisitions was approximately 
£28.1 million or 4% of sales in continuing businesses.
Adjusted operating profit rose by 13% in continuing businesses to 
£118.3 million, with operating margins declining from 15.8% to 
15.0%. The decrease in margins can largely be explained by an 
increase in research and development expenditure (0.4pp) and the 
dilutive effect of foreign exchange (0.1pp) and acquisitions (0.2pp). 
Favourable movements in foreign currency exchange rates had an 
impact of approximately £12.1 million or 12% on operating profits, 
and profits in continuing businesses increased by approximately 
2% on a constant currency basis. The year-on-year impact on 
profits from acquisitions was approximately £3.4 million or 3% 
of profits in continuing businesses.
The year-on-year increase in interest costs is £1.4 million (from 
£6.8 million to £8.2 million). This includes £1.0 million relating  
to foreign exchange and the balance is due to the extra cost of 
additional borrowing in the year. Adjusted profit before tax 
increased by 12% from £98.0 million to £110.1 million. 
Statutory operating profit, after including acquisition-related 
intangible asset amortisation of £4.6 million (2007: £1.9 million), 
increased by 10% from £102.9 million to £113.7 million.
Statutory profit before tax decreased by 10% from £118.1 million

Acquisitions
The total cost of acquisitions made in the year was £88.8 million, 
including acquisition expenses as well as a small amount of deferred 
and contingent consideration expected to be paid in future years, 
and excluding cash acquired. The largest of these acquisitions took 
place close to the end of 2008. These acquisitions contributed  
£28.1 million of sales and £3.4 million of profits during the year.
Taxation
The effective tax rate on profits was 23.7% (2007: 28.0%), a decrease 
of 4.3pp. The effective tax rate continues to be below the weighted 
average statutory tax rate of 29.7% (2007: 32.3%), primarily as a 
consequence of the tax effects of a tax efficient inter-company 
financing structure and the recognition of tax assets from tax 
losses arising in prior years in the UK.
The underlying tax charge is expected to remain approximately 
3pp below the weighted average statutory tax rate for the 
foreseeable future.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 25% from 58.1 pence to 
72.8 pence, reflecting the net impact of a 12% increase in profit 
before tax, a reduction in the average number of shares in issue, 
and the reducing tax charge.
Basic earnings per share decreased by 1% from 70.9 pence to 
70.3 pence. The differences between the two measures are shown in 
the table below.

Adjusted earnings per share  72.8  58.1
The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the 
year decreased from 121.6 million to 115.4 million. This decrease 
arose as a result of the share buy-back programme that was 
completed in February 2008, partially offset by the exercise of 
share options in the year.

Movement in net debt   (84.8) (5.6)
Cash conversion of operating profit to operating cash was 86% 
(2007: 99%). The lower cash conversion was a result of a 
combination of capital expenditure (£21.9 million), net of disposals 
(£0.9 million), being £7.5 million higher than depreciation, and a 
build in working capital towards the second half of the year. 
Average working capital expressed as a percentage of sales reduced 
to 13.4% whereas year-end working capital expressed as a 
percentage of sales increased from 14.4% to 18.4%. 2.9pp of this 
increase is attributable to the year-end on year-end foreign 
exchange rate movement with the US dollar strengthening by 28% 
against sterling and the euro appreciating by 24%. At constant 
exchange rates, the year-end working capital ratio would have been 
15.5%, still 1.1pp higher than the prior year, reflecting the build up 
of working capital towards the end of the year. 
Capital expenditure during the year equated to 2.7% of sales  
(2007: 1.9%) and, at £21.9 million (2007: £12.7 million), was 162% 
of depreciation (2007: 97%).  22

Business Review
Financial Review continued 
Overall, net debt increased by £84.8 million (2007: increase of 
£5.6 million) from £77.3 million to £162.1 million. Interest cost, 
excluding the financing charge arising from IAS 19, was covered by 
adjusted operating profit 14.4 times (2007: 15.6 times), providing 
significant headroom over and above banking covenants which 
require a minimum of 3.75 times cover.
Financing and treasury 
The group finances its operations from both retained earnings and 
third-party borrowings, the majority of which are currently at 
fixed rates of interest. 
As at 31 December 2008, the group had £257 million of committed 
facilities, which consists of £164 million of private placements 
maturing between September 2010 and October 2013, £90 million  
of revolving credit facilities, of which £50 million matures on  
31 December 2009, and £3 million of bank loans secured on 
property of three of our businesses. £40 million of revolving credit 
facilities were undrawn at the year end. In addition, the group  
had a cash balance of £64.4 million and has £40.5 million of 
uncommitted facilities, mainly in the form of overdraft facilities 
for our local operations. £9.6 million of these facilities were drawn 
at the year end.
At the year end, 73% of group borrowings were at fixed interest 
rates (2007: 96%). The ageing profile at the year end showed that 
15% of debt is due to mature within one year (2007: 3%) and 85%  
of debt is due to mature in between one and five years (2007: 31%). 
Since the year end, an additional £50 million, five-year term facility 
was secured in January 2009 under covenant conditions  
in line with existing facilities. 
Currency
The group has both translational and transactional currency 
exposures. Translational exposures arise on the consolidation of 
overseas company results into sterling. Transactional exposures 
arise where the currency of sale or purchase invoices differs from 
the functional currency in which each company prepares its local 
accounts. The transactional exposures include situations where 
foreign currency denominated trade debtor, trade creditor and 
cash balances are held.
The largest transactional exposures are to the US dollar and,  
to a lesser extent, the euro and the Japanese yen. The largest 
translational exposures are to the US dollar, euro and Danish 
krone. The table below shows the key average exchange rates 
during 2008 and 2007. 
  2008 2007 
  average average
US$  1.85 2.00
Euro  1.26 1.46
Yen  192 236
Translational currency exposures are not hedged.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge forecast sale 
transactions where there is reasonable certainty of an exposure.  
At 31 December 2008, approximately 65% of the estimated  
US dollar and Japanese yen exposures for 2009 were hedged using 
forward exchange contracts.
To demonstrate the currency exposure faced by the group, the table 
below shows the differences between the group’s consolidated 
revenues and costs for each of the major currencies in 2008 before 
reflecting the effect of transactional hedges taken out in the year.
 $*   €* £  Yen Other Total

*  Dollar/euro categories include tracking currencies
**   Costs include interest of £3.3 million in $, £5.2 million in € and income of 
£(0.3) million in GBP
 
In 2009, the currency exposure is expected to change significantly 
following the decision to change the currency of invoicing in 
certain countries in Asia from US dollars to euros in order to 
better balance our euro cost base. If this decision had been fully 
effective at the beginning of 2008, the US dollar sales revenues 
would have been reduced by approximately £30 million and the 
euro sales revenues increased by a corresponding amount.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Operating profit includes a defined benefit pension scheme  
current service charge of £1.7 million (2007: £0.9 million). The  
net pension liability in the balance sheet (before taking account  
of the related deferred tax asset) has reduced to £8.5 million  
(2007: £11.1 million), largely as a consequence of the buy-out of the 
liability on the Brüel & Kjær pension scheme in full in the USA 
during the year and actuarial gains on the scheme liabilities. 
During 2008, the group made cash contributions into the  
defined benefit pension scheme amounting to £5.4 million  
(2007: £3.1 million).
Principal risks and uncertainties
The group has identified the key potential strategic, operational 
and financial risks and uncertainties which could have a material 
impact on the group’s long-term performance. These potential 
risks, and the actions to manage and mitigate them, are described 
in detail on the following pages. The directors do not foresee any 
further specific risks in 2009.

Business Review
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The necessary actions are taken by the audit committee to 
remedy any failings or weaknesses identified by its review of the 
internal control system; and
 the executive directors report to the Board on changes in the •	
business and external environment which present significant 
risks. The group finance director provides the Board with 
monthly financial information which includes key performance 
indicators. Regular reports on significant legal issues and 
insurance matters are received from the company secretary.
The key potential risks and uncertainties which could have a 
material impact on the group’s long-term performance are 
described below.
Strategic risk
Spectris has a broad spread of markets, products and customers,  
as described previously in this review, and this limits, to a large 
extent, any specific risk to the ability to implement our strategy  
due to changes in the political and economic environments in the 
countries in which we operate. This broad spread of markets also 
provides a good averaging of individual sector investment cycles. 
Our products typically involve low capital outlay but provide 
significant and rapid payback. These benefits become even more 
attractive to customers as they seek to reduce their own costs 
of production. 
A key element of Spectris’ strategy is to grow the business portfolio 
through acquisition of stand-alone or bolt-on businesses which 
complement or extend the range of products and applications 
Spectris can provide. Potential risks exist in successfully 
integrating acquisitions. However, Spectris believes that its track 
record of carefully selecting businesses which fulfil its acquisition 
criteria and rigorous financial assessment of the potential 
acquisition’s ability to contribute to growth will continue to ensure 
that any businesses acquired will be successfully integrated. 
Operational risk
In order to sustain competitive advantage, the group invests 
significantly in research and development. The development of all 
new technologies and products involves risk including the product 
being more expensive, or taking longer, to develop than originally 
planned; that the market for the product is smaller than originally 
envisaged; or that the product fails to reach the production stage. 
However, we endeavour to reduce this risk by ensuring that new 
product development is carried out in conjunction with customers 
to ensure that the products meet expectations of the market. All 
businesses are exposed to risk from competitive activity. However 
the diversity of Spectris’ products and markets, and the high 
barriers to entry, limits the overall risk from any single competitor. 
Although the majority of our business is to supply products only, 
there may be instances where Spectris companies enter into 
complex long-term or multi-site contracts with customers. Spectris 
has a strict approval process for such contracts in order to manage 
any risks they may present. Potential risk from loss of a key 
customer is limited as no single customer accounts for more than 
1% of turnover, and credit control procedures limit the risk from 
non-payment by customers. Group operating companies also 
monitor customer satisfaction to ensure they are meeting 
The process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing any significant risks forms part of  
the group’s system of internal controls. 
Internal controls 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the group’s system of 
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure 
to meet business objectives and can provide only reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Consistent with the guidance provided for directors on internal 
control by the Financial Reporting Council (‘Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’), the Board 
confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing assessed significant risks faced by the 
group, that this has been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts, that this 
process has been reviewed by the Board during the year and that 
the group accords with the guidance. The Board affirms the 
importance it attaches to the continuous review and application of 
the guidance, the regular and systematic assessment of the risks 
facing the group and the value of embedding risk management and 
internal control systems within its business processes. The group 
has an internal audit function which reviews the design and 
effectiveness of internal controls across the group’s operations.
The processes which the Board and the audit committee have 
applied in reviewing the effectiveness of the group’s system of 
internal controls are summarised below:
 an established process is in place whereby each business unit •	
regularly assesses, evaluates and reports risks of group 
significance. Each business unit is required to document the 
management and mitigating actions in place and proposed;
 regular review of the status of risks and corresponding •	
mitigating actions ensure that risk management is embedded  
in day-to-day management processes and decision-making as 
well as in the annual strategic planning cycle; 
 the effectiveness of risk management and mitigating actions is •	
reviewed regularly by the executive directors and twice yearly 
by the audit committee;
 additionally, the executive directors consider those risks to the •	
group’s strategic objectives which are not addressed within the 
business units and develop appropriate approaches to managing 
and mitigating these risks;
 annual financial plans for each business unit, significant  •	
capital investments or contractual commitments and major 
acquisitions or divestments are all subject to review and 
approval by the Board;
 a Group Accounting and Policies Manual sets out the minimum •	
standards and procedures to be applied in relation to those  
risk areas which are regarded as significant in a group context;
 a process of self-assessment of compliance with the Manual  •	
and reporting thereon has been established, providing for  
a documented trail of accountability from business unit 
presidents and finance directors to the audit committee.   24
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Business Review
Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued 
customers’ product, delivery and service requirements. The 
company is also exposed to the risk that some of the components it 
sources, particularly for custom-built items or older components, 
are provided by a single supplier and are vulnerable to interruption 
of supply. The group seeks to address this risk by finding alternative 
sources to reduce dependency on single-source suppliers and 
building sufficient safety stock of critical components. 
Spectris’ operations are characterised by short lead times and 
seasonal fluctuations in sales, with some businesses exhibiting  
a greater trend towards sales in the second half of the year. This 
limited forward visibility and the potential for delays in the 
shipment of orders exposes the company to the potential risk  
that it may not meet its sales forecast for the year. 
Financial risk 
The principal financial risks managed by the group are foreign 
currency, interest and liquidity. The group’s exposure to 
commodity risk is perceived to be small by virtue of the nature  
of the businesses.
Foreign exchange transaction risk is managed principally through 
forward contracts covering up to 75% of forecast forward 
exposures for up to eighteen months ahead. Foreign exchange 
translation risk, which results from converting foreign currency  
to sterling, is not hedged but is actively managed through natural 
hedging by matching invoicing and purchasing currencies as far as 
is commercially practical. In addition, it is the aim where possible 
to hedge foreign currency investments with borrowings in the 
same currency. In order to minimise interest cost and maximise 
interest income, companies are required to pass surplus funds to 
Group Treasury through inter-company loans. Where possible 
zero balance pools are in place to centralise cash automatically.
The long-term aim with regard to interest rate risk is to have a 
balance between fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps 
are considered to achieve this balance.
The group manages its liquidity risk through the use of regularly 
updated cash flow forecasts and liquidity headroom analysis to 
determine its funding requirements. The group maintains 
sufficient lines of credit from high quality investment grade 
lenders to cover expected cash requirements and provide 
reasonable headroom. The facilities are described in detail  
in the Financial Review. 
Intellectual property risk
Spectris’ business is focused on the design and manufacture of 
technologically advanced products and applications and the group 
makes significant investment in research and development. As a 
consequence, the group owns and protects patents, trademarks, 
trade secrets, copyright information and intellectual property 
licenses. Although these are important to growth as a whole, no 
single patent, trade secret or trademark is sufficiently important to 
present a material risk to the success of the company. Appropriate 
measures are taken to protect the company’s intellectual property 
rights and to minimise the risk of infringement by third parties. 
Spectris is prepared to initiate legal action if necessary to safeguard 
its interests. Inadvertent infringement of third-party rights also 
presents a risk and Spectris has procedures in place requiring its 
operating companies to maintain a watching brief on new 
applications and to undertake specific reviews prior to 
commencing new product development programmes, acquisitions 
or licenses.
Information technology/business interruption risk
Spectris depends on timely and reliable information from key 
software applications to aid day-to-day operational management 
and to provide accurate financial information for its head office. 
Whilst the company endeavours to ensure the continuous 
availability and operation of these systems and software, any 
disruption could delay or otherwise impact day-to-day decision 
making. Disaster recovery plans to maintain business-critical 
processes and activities in the event of a significant interruption to 
the normal course of business are in place throughout the group 
and are regularly tested.
Hazardous risk 
Assessment of risk to the business is carried out on a continuous 
basis to determine any potential effects on the environment 
resulting both from product manufacture and operation of our 
products at the customer’s site. Each operating company is 
required to produce a risk register which identifies possible 
hazardous risks to their business. For each risk the likelihood  
of the occurrence is documented, together with the possible 
consequences, the actions required to minimise the probability  
of the event occurring, and responsibility assigned to a member  
of the company’s management team. The risk register is reviewed 
regularly by the group’s internal audit function.
Contractual arrangements
The company has no contractual or other arrangements which are 
essential to the business of the company, nor any key customers or 
major suppliers upon which it is dependent. 25

Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility
Spectris is committed to creating business 
growth through adding value for its customers 
whilst ensuring that its impact on the 
environment is minimised.
Spectris operates from 160 offices in 29 countries around the 
world. The company’s products are used to monitor and control 
processes for enhancing productivity for customers in a wide range 
of industries. 
Spectris continues to meet the criteria for membership of the 
FTSE4Good UK index, which measures and benchmarks the 
performance of companies that meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards. The criteria are assessed on a regular basis 
by the independent research organisation EIRIS, with increasing 
emphasis on ethics and human rights.
The policies and information described below apply to all 
Spectris operations. 
Policy setting and monitoring
Overall responsibility for developing corporate policies on 
environmental, social, ethical, and health and safety matters, and 
for reviewing their effectiveness, lies with the Spectris Board. The 
policies are communicated to all business units via the Spectris 
Group Manual. The individual operating companies are then 
responsible for ensuring that these policies are communicated and 
applied within their particular business, taking account of local 
legislation and regulation. All policies and procedures are reviewed 
periodically and any updates are communicated to the 
operating companies.
Reporting and compliance
Conformity with these policies is monitored by self-certification, 
on an annual basis, by the Managing Director and Finance 
Director of each operating company that their business has 
complied in full. Any instances of non-compliance must 
be reported. 
Such certification forms an integral part of the company’s risk 
management and corporate governance processes, and is regularly 
reviewed by the group’s internal audit function and the company’s 
external auditors. Compliance testing is a formal part of internal 
audit reviews. Through a structured review process, the internal 
audit function undertakes visits to group locations on a rotational 
basis. These visits involve an assessment of the business’ key 
internal controls as well as compliance with the group’s policies 
and procedures. The results of internal audits and any non-
compliance events are reported to the Audit Committee.
Risk assessment
The key potential risks and uncertainties which could have a 
material impact on the group’s long-term performance are 
described elsewhere in this Business Review. Potential social and 
environmental risks to the business may arise within product 
manufacture or operation of a product at the customer’s site. 
Where a significant risk is identified, procedures for storage, 
normal operating conditions and emergency situations are 
documented and regularly monitored for compliance with the 
relevant regulations. A nominated individual is responsible for 
safety compliance and all employees are informed and trained in 
safety procedures, depending upon the extent of their involvement 
with the product presenting the risk. Documented processes are in 
place to reduce the likelihood of an occurrence. Material risk 
processes and procedures are regularly reviewed by the group 
internal audit function.
Potential social and environmental risk in Spectris’ operations is 
limited. However, the PANalytical business, which supplies 
instrumentation for X-ray analysis, makes limited use of beryllium 
in detector windows and X-ray tubes, whilst certain NDC Infrared 
Engineering products utilise low-level sealed radioactive sources. 
In all cases, the legal requirements for the correct handling and 
labelling of such products are documented and regularly audited 
for compliance. Procedures also exist for the disposal of 
contaminated waste and for recovering used products from 
customers and disposing of them safely. The Servomex gas analysis 
business includes the storage of flammable and toxic gases at its 
testing facility. Operating procedures for the movement and use of 
cylinders containing such gases are in accordance with the 
appropriate legal requirements and are inspected annually by an 
independent authority. Chemical and hazardous waste is disposed 
of in accordance with written procedures.
Environment
Many Spectris products and technologies have positive 
environmental benefits by providing customers with the ability  
to reduce energy consumption or material wastage or to control 
emissions. Our curing lamps, for example, use ultraviolet light to 
cure or ‘dry’ environmentally-friendly inks and coatings, replacing 
conventional heat treatment of traditional materials which  
is energy-intensive and emits toxic solvent vapours. Our 
instrumentation helps wind farm operators to keep their turbines 
running by using remote predictive monitoring to detect and 
prevent faults. Our products can also help customers to meet 
environmental legislation. For example, we supply instrumentation 
which can measure low levels of materials such as lead and cadmium 
to meet legislation on the restriction of hazardous substances. We 
also supply systems which analyse the amount of sulphur in fuel to 
ensure compliance with regulations on the levels permitted. Further 
examples of the use of Spectris products having a direct beneficial 
contribution to the environment are shown on our website.
We are also committed to adopting environmentally responsible 
policies wherever our companies operate. We aim to reduce the 
environmental impact of our operations by developing products 
which are energy-efficient and avoid the use of harmful substances. 
Design processes take into account the operational lifetime of every 
product and end-of-life removal or disposal. Consideration is also 
given to environment-friendly production, packaging and shipping. 
Products have been developed which meet the new European 
regulations on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). For example, 
printed circuit boards used in instrumentation sold to customers in 
this region no longer use lead-based solder in their manufacture.  26
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
All businesses are conscious of the need to conserve energy and 
resources and local initiatives are in place at many sites to reduce 
energy consumption and minimise wastage. These include 
recycling of items such as waste paper, cardboard, aluminium cans, 
batteries, toner cartridges and mobile phones, reducing energy 
consumption through the use of timers and sensors to control hot 
water, air conditioning and lighting, reducing water consumption 
and re-use of packaging and filling materials. The new technical 
centre for Servomex in Crowborough, England, which was opened 
in November 2008, has been designed and built to the latest 
environmental standards, including the use of heat exchangers to 
maximise heating efficiency and motion sensor lighting to reduce 
power wastage. At NDC’s facility in the US, remote control units 
for the lighting system have been installed to enable the company 
to achieve energy and cost savings. At PANalytical in the 
Netherlands, despite a doubling of production volumes over the 
past ten years, the company’s overall energy consumption has 
decreased by around 10%. 
Spectris complies with the UK Producer Responsibility Obligations 
(Packaging Waste) Regulations which set targets for the recovery 
and recycling of packaging waste. 
Our environmental policy is published on our website at  
www.spectris.com. The nature of our manufacturing activities 
means that Spectris’ operations have very little impact on the 
environment, as our products do not require energy-intensive 
manufacturing processes and we endeavour to employ non-
polluting technology wherever possible. Although we have four 
production facilities in the UK, their low power consumption 
means that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced is 
not significant and hence Spectris is not required to participate in 
the second round of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, nor 
is it expected that the company will be included in the UK’s 
Carbon Reduction Commitment plan.
Environmental management systems
Approximately half of Spectris’ operations (by turnover) have 
received accreditation to the environmental standard ISO14001. 
Other companies are working towards accreditation where this is 
deemed beneficial for their customers. 
During 2008 no significant environmental incidents were recorded. 
Employees
Spectris’ employees are key to the success of the company.  
We employ around 6,000 people in 160 offices throughout the 
world, with a high proportion of employees qualified at, or  
above, degree level. We are committed to providing our people 
with a creative working environment with plenty of scope for 
individual responsibility and achievement. In 2008, on average, 
3,000 employees were employed in production and engineering,  
with 2,220 in sales and marketing and 500 in administrative 
functions. Compensation and benefits, which are in line with  
other leading companies in the sector, are designed to reward  
the achievement of objectives. Annual reviews provide feedback  
on employees’ performance, set objectives and identify training

Employment 
Policy
Spectris operates mainly in Europe and the US, but with a growing 
presence in Asia. Although different social and employment 
conditions exist in different locations, Spectris places high priority 
on compliance with the legislative and ethical requirements of the 
countries in which we operate, particularly with respect to 
employment practices, labour rights and equal opportunities. The 
Company Secretary has overall responsibility for employment 
policies, but responsibility for implementation is delegated to 
individual business units, with operational policies and procedures 
tailored to suit local needs. The company’s employment policy is 
available at www.spectris.com. 
Overall HR policies are set at the centre and implemented by each 
operating business, taking account of local conditions. Spectris 
retains a diverse workforce, valuing the different perspectives of its 
employees, and the company is committed to equal opportunities 
for all employees in terms of recruitment and employment, 
training and development, and promotion. We strive to create a 
culture of honesty, respect and professional excellence whilst 
maintaining a healthy balance between working and personal lives, 
with initiatives such as part-time and job share opportunities 
providing family-friendly working conditions. Employee surveys 
are carried out in a number of companies to measure the views of 
employees on company issues and action plans agreed to address 
the issues raised.
Staff turnover is dependent to a large extent upon local market 
conditions, but is generally low, particularly at senior management 
level and amongst technical/R&D staff, where in-depth technical 
knowledge brings loyalty and commitment to the company. Whilst 
data on employee turnover is not collated centrally, it is monitored 
by individual businesses. 
Graduate recruitment programmes and student work placements 
exist in several companies, providing opportunities for young 
people, particularly scientists, to be introduced to the 
business environment.
Reporting
It is the responsibility of the managing directors in each operating 
company to ensure that all employees are fully aware of Spectris’ 
HR policies. The group monitors compliance through various 
processes, including confirmation in writing by each business unit 
annually, and consolidated Equal Employment Opportunities 
Commission returns which are produced in the US.
Training and development
Spectris’ commitment to training and personal development 
emphasises the importance of retaining staff throughout the group 
and ensuring that all employees are encouraged to realise their full 
potential. Annual appraisals and performance reviews are carried 
out to determine training and development needs for individual  27

Overview Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
As part of their commitment to activities that 
stimulate interest in the sciences, PANalytical 
sponsored two students in the 2008 ‘Expedition 
Greenhouse World’ – an initiative run by Utrecht 
University in the Netherlands. On the week-long 
expedition in October to Spitsbergen, Norway, the 
students visited Longyearbyen glacier where they 
collected rocks full of 40–60 million year old fossils  
of the plants that caused the greenhouse effect at 
that time. They investigated core samples where  
the ancient carbon layers demonstrated the high 
concentrations of atmospheric CO

changes devastated the Palaeocene animal population 
and, during a trip that took them 4km underground, 
the students saw 55-million year old footprints made 
by extinct hippopotamus-like mammals.

employees. Malvern and Servomex, our two principal UK 
businesses, have received the Investors in People award for their 
programmes of training, appraisal, employee development and 
skills recognition.
Financial participation in the group is encouraged through the 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme, available to all UK 
employees, and through grants under the group’s Performance 
Share Plan made to senior management across the group.
Employee communications
The company has a policy of encouraging its operating companies 
to provide information to their employees on a regular basis. This 
information includes matters relating to their company’s 
performance, its prospects in the markets it serves and the future 
outlook for its business. In addition to regular staff briefings, most 
companies have intranets where news bulletins are posted. 
Health and Safety
Policy
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for environment, 
health and safety matters. Senior executives in each of the business 
units are responsible for implementing the company’s health and 
safety policy at local level and ensuring compliance with local 
legislation and regulations. The company’s health and safety policy 
can be viewed on our website at www.spectris.com. 
Spectris is committed to providing a working environment at all  
of its sites which, so far as is possible, is safe and without risk to 
health. Each operating company is responsible for ensuring that 
the highest standards of health and safety are achieved by its 
employees and by sub-contractors and suppliers.
 
Reporting
Any serious health and safety incidents are required to be reported 
by the Managing Director of the business in an accident report to 
the Company Secretary, who reports on such issues to the Board. 
All accidents are thoroughly investigated and appropriate 
corrective and preventative actions put in place. No serious injuries 
or deaths have been reported in the last ten years. Although minor 
incidents are monitored locally, statistics for these are not 
compiled for the group as a whole. Audits of health and safety 
policies and procedures are undertaken at all major locations by 
external assessors acting on behalf of the group’s insurers on an 
annual basis and recommendations are made for improving 
practices where appropriate.
Human rights 
Spectris believes in the fundamental rights of people in all parts of 
the world and is committed to adopting internationally recognised 
human rights standards wherever it operates.  28
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Policy
The company’s human rights policy, which can be viewed at  
www.spectris.com, is consistent with the Principles of Human  
Rights, as set out in the International Labour Organization’s Core 
Conventions, and includes policies on non-discrimination, 
harassment, pay and forced labour. The policy is reviewed periodically 
and any updates are communicated to the operating companies. The 
Chief Executive has overall responsibility for human rights. 
Spectris takes its commitments to human rights seriously and our 
operating companies are required to ensure that all employees are 
aware of the policy and understand it. In most of the operating 
companies, new employees are provided with an employee 
handbook which includes sections on employee responsibilities  
with regard to equal opportunities, non-discrimination, harassment, 
bullying, disciplinary practices, etc, and new employees must sign  
to say that they have read and understood this. 
In Asia, the General Manager is responsible for ensuring that the 
highest ethical standards are maintained in all of our Asia-based 
operations. Spectris has a number of sales offices in China and also 
owns a factory which supplies high quality weighing components. 
This comprises a modern facility located in a business park along 
with other western companies. The factory employs skilled 
workers, adopts employment conditions consistent with best local 
practice, and pays wages that are higher than average for the area.
Spectris considers human rights as part of its due diligence process 
for acquisitions, ensuring that the core labour rights, including 
non-discrimination, equal opportunities and freedom of 
association, of the company to be acquired are taken into account.
Reporting
The Managing Director and Finance Director of each operating 
company are required to certify, on an annual basis, compliance 
with all Spectris policies. Any non-compliance is investigated by 
local human resources managers or by Spectris management or the 
internal audit function if it is serious. Pay practices are monitored 
to ensure they are non-discriminatory. 
Circumstances may also come to light via the company’s 
Whistleblowing policy, via which employees may report to the 
business’s management team or any Board member, via a 
confidential email address, any concerns they may have over 
unethical business practices or conduct, dangers to health and 
safety, or breach of company policies. Any such disclosures are 
appropriately investigated. In addition, Spectris is committed to 
protecting the career and reputation of employees who report 
wrongdoing in accordance with established procedures, so long as 
their disclosures are delivered in good faith and seek to safeguard 
the best interests of the group.
Some individual operating companies also have their own 
Whistleblowing processes whereby employees can anonymously 
report concerns over discrimination, harassment etc.
Training
In the US, awareness training on harassment and discrimination is 
carried out, with companies providing regular refresher training 
on harassment and non-discrimination to all employees. In some 
companies there are worldwide programmes on corporate values 
and desired behaviour, with employees being measured against 
these values in their annual performance appraisals.
Ethics
All employees are expected to behave in accordance with the 
company’s behavioural values, which are shown opposite.  
These values define who we are and how we do business, both  
as individuals and as a company.
Policy
The ethical standards we expect each employee to meet are set out 
in our Ethics policy which is communicated to all employees. The 
Ethics policy can be viewed on our website at www.spectris.com. 
The policy prohibits bribery, corruption and similar facilitation 
payments. Donations to political parties or similar organisations 
are also prohibited. Any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly 
investigated. All operating companies are required to comply with 
export control regulations governing shipment of products and the 
appropriate compliance procedures are in place.
Reporting
As with all Spectris policies, conformity is monitored by self-
certification, on an annual basis, by the Managing Director and 
Finance Director of each operating company that they have 
complied with the policy. Any instances of non-compliance must 
be reported. In particular any known instances of fraud, including 
bribery and corruption, must be specifically disclosed. 
Certification forms an integral part of the company’s risk 
management and corporate governance processes, and is regularly 
reviewed by the group’s internal audit function and the company’s 
external auditors. Compliance testing is a formal part of internal 
audit reviews. Through a structured review process, the internal 
audit function undertakes visits to group locations on a rotational 
basis. These visits involve an assessment of the business’s key 
internal controls as well as compliance with the group’s policies 
and procedures. The scope of the work performed during internal 
audit visits includes testing to confirm compliance with the 
group’s overall position and policy regarding anti-bribery and 
corruption measures. 
The results of internal audits and any non-compliance events are 
reported to the Audit Committee.
The company operates a ‘Whistleblowing’ policy, described above, 
through which known instances of fraud, including bribery and 
corruption, may be reported confidentially. This will be 
strengthened in 2009 to include a telephone hotline and an on-line 
reporting system which employees will be able to access 
in anonymity.
Training
Currently a number of Spectris companies provide training to 
employees, however Spectris intends to formalise this with a 
group-wide ethics programme which will be introduced during 
Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility continued  29
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
2009. This formal programme will ensure that the group’s ethics 
policy (which includes statements on anti-bribery and corruption) 
is communicated to and acknowledged by all employees in local 
language, and will make training compulsory in all companies, 
either via the HR department or on-line training modules. All 
companies will be required to nominate an ethics compliance 
officer. Compliance with the ethics policy and training within each 
company will be monitored by the internal audit function as part 
of the risk assessment process.
Customers
Spectris sells productivity-enhancing instrumentation and services 
to a large number of customers around the world. We have 
developed close working relationships with our customers and in 
many instances involve them in the development of new products 
to ensure they meet their requirements. Surveys of customer 
satisfaction are conducted on a regular basis.
Suppliers
Spectris has no significant suppliers who are dependent upon the 
company’s business. Suppliers are paid in line with contractual and 
legal obligations. Spectris businesses work with their suppliers to 
help them to reduce their impact on the environment and to ensure 
that their products meet the relevant legislation. Outsourcing of 
products, particularly in Asia, is to quality-approved organisations 
only which are regularly inspected and audited by the strategic 
purchasing teams and local managements. Appropriate procedures 
are taken, where practicable, to ensure that the company’s policies, 
in particular in relation to human rights and ethics, are applied 
to suppliers.
Local communities
Spectris companies worldwide participate in a range of local 
activities and educational initiatives in support of their local 
communities. For example, as part of its sponsorship of activities 
that stimulate interest in the sciences, PANalytical sponsored two 
students on a week-long expedition to Spitsbergen, Norway, in the 
2008 ‘Expedition Greenhouse World’ to explore the climate change 
that took place 55 million years ago. In the UK, Malvern has 
sponsored scientists attending key scientific conferences,  
Servomex has five apprentices on a scheme and Brüel & Kjær are 
participating in the ‘Working with Engineering Education Scheme’ 
which links teams of students and their teachers with local 
companies to work on real scientific, engineering and technical 
problems.
Donations to charities and community causes in 2008 totalled 
£44,000, of which £22,400 were in the UK (2007: £28,000 of which 
£10,400 in UK). This included donations to charities following the 
earthquake in China, Cancer Research, the Red Cross, Heifer 
International, and to local arts and educational projects.
Honesty
Acting with absolute integrity in all that we do.
Empowerment
Creating an environment of autonomy in our operating 
companies where people are expected to take the 
initiative and to succeed.
Ownership
Taking personal ownership of the responsibility of  
our roles.
Delivery
Performing to the highest standards against the 
commitments we make both internally and, especially, 
externally to our customers.
Speed
Ensuring that our business decisions are made and 
actions executed with a sense of urgency.

Directors’ Report
The directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 
31 December 2008.
Principal activities
Spectris designs, develops and markets productivity-enhancing 
instrumentation and controls. For 2008 reporting purposes, the 
businesses were grouped into four segments: Materials Analysis, 
Test and Measurement, In-Line Instrumentation and Industrial 
Controls. Further details of the trading companies can be found in 
the Business Review (page 6). Developments in the group’s business 
activities are discussed in the Chairman’s Statement (page 2), the 
Chief Executive’s Statement (page 4) and the Business Review.
Acquisitions
During the year a number of acquisitions were made. Malvern 
Instruments acquired Viscotek Corporation, a US-based provider 
of chromatography solutions for the characterisation of natural and 
synthetic polymers and proteins. HBM and Particle Measuring 
Systems acquired their distributors in, respectively, the Nordic 
countries and China. HBM acquired nCode International, a 
supplier of durability, test and analysis software and mobile data 
acquisition instruments. Microscan acquired Siemens’ Machine 
Vision Business, a leader in Automatic Identification and Data 
Capture (AIDC), specialising in machine vision and inspection 
systems used in a broad array of manufacturing, packaging and 
traceability applications. Finally, the LDS Test & Measurement 
business was acquired and integrated with Brüel & Kjær Sound & 
Vibration and HBM. LDS is a leader in integrated vibration test  
and measurement equipment and software for applications in  
the aerospace, defence, automotive, machinery, electrical and 
electronics markets. The total consideration, including acquisition 
expenses and net debt acquired, as well as deferred and contingent 
consideration expected to be paid in future years, for the above 
acquisitions, was £88.8 million. Deferred consideration paid and 
working capital adjustments made during the year in respect of 
prior year acquisitions amounted to £1.3 million.
Disposals
There were no disposals during the year.
Share capital
The share capital of the company comprises ordinary shares of 5p 
each; each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings  
of the company. The authorised and issued share capital of the 
company, together with movements in the company’s issued share 
capital during the year, are shown in Note 25 on page 77. The 
Articles of Association of the company, available on the company’s 
website, contain provisions governing the ownership and transfer  
of shares.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders authorised the 
directors to make market purchases of the company’s ordinary 
shares up to a maximum number of 12,500,000 shares, representing 
approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the company, and 
to either cancel the shares or hold them as Treasury shares which 
may then be cancelled, sold for cash or transferred for the purposes 
of the company’s share plans, depending on the best interests of  
the company’s shareholders at the time. At the close of business on 
23 February 2009, the company had 125,005,123 ordinary shares  
in issue, of which 9,694,495 were held in Treasury. During the year 
21,363 shares were transferred out of Treasury to meet the 
company’s obligations under its share plans and no shares were 
cancelled out of Treasury. An authority to make further market 
purchases of the company’s ordinary shares, if believed appropriate, 
will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
although the Board has no present intention of so doing.
Also included in the special business of the 2009 Annual General 
Meeting are proposals to renew the directors’ authority to allot 
shares up to prescribed limits.
The company is introducing a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, 
providing shareholders with the option of using their dividend 
payments to buy additional Spectris plc shares. Further details are 
given in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
At 23 February 2009 interests notified to the company in 
accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules comprised:
Standard Life Investments 
10,490,369 shares (9.10% material interest)

Takeovers directive
Pursuant to s992 of the Companies Act 2006, which implements the 
EU Takeovers Directive, the company is required to disclose certain 
additional information. Such disclosures, which are not covered 
elsewhere in this Annual Report, include the following:
The company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’) give power to the 
Board to appoint directors, but require directors to submit 
themselves for election at the first Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment and for re-election where they have 
been a director at each of the preceding two Annual General 
Meetings and were not appointed or re-appointed by the company 
at, or since, either such meeting. The Articles may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders and are available to view on 
the company’s website.
The Board of directors is responsible for the management of the 
business of the company and may exercise all the powers of the 
company subject to the provisions of the relevant statutes, the 
company’s Memorandum of Association and the Articles. The 
Articles contain specific provisions and restrictions regarding the 
company’s power to borrow money. Powers relating to the issuing 
and buying back of shares are also included in the Articles and such 
authorities are renewed by shareholders each year at the Annual 
General Meeting.  33
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the group following a takeover, such as 
bank loan agreements and company share plans. None of these are 
deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the 
business of the group as a whole. In addition, there is a service 
contract between the company and one of its directors which 
provides for compensation for loss of office or employment 
following a change of control of the group (please refer to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 40 for further explanation). 
It is also possible that funding arrangements for the group’s defined 
benefit pension arrangements would need to be enhanced following 
a change of control if that resulted in a weakening of the relevant 
employer covenant.
Dividend
Results for the group are set out in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on page 45 and in the supporting notes. A final  
dividend of 17p per ordinary share is proposed for the year to  
31 December 2008 (2007: 15.25p). With the interim dividend, this 
makes a total for the year of 23.4p (2007: 21p). The final dividend 
will be paid on 26 June 2009 to shareholders on the register on 
5 June 2009.
The terms of the Spectris plc Employee Benefit Trust provide that 
dividends payable on shares held within the Trust are waived to 
0.01p. No dividends are payable on shares held in Treasury.
Research and development
Expenditure committed to research and development is focused on 
new product development, applications engineering and process 
integration. Costs are expensed as incurred, except where the 
expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation. In the 
year to 31 December 2008, amounts expensed totalled £57.0 million 
(2007: £45.2 million), and no expenditure met the criteria for 
capitalisation (2007: £nil).
Fixed assets
Whilst the market values of some properties differ from book 
values, the directors believe that the differences are not material.
Payment of suppliers
The group’s policy on payment of suppliers is to ensure that terms  
of payment accord with contractual and legal obligations. The 
company had no trade creditors at the year end (2007: £nil).
Directors
The directors of the company are named on pages 30 and 31. 
Stephen Harris resigned from the Board on 31 January 2008.  
John Poulter retired from the Board following the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting.
John O’Higgins and John Warren retire from the Board by rotation 
in accordance with the Articles of Association and, being eligible, 
offer themselves for re-election.
The directors’ total remuneration for the year and their  
interests in the shares of the company and its subsidiaries  
at 31 December 2008 are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 37 to 43.
In accordance with Section 309C of the Companies Act 1985 the 
directors disclose a qualifying third-party indemnity provision 
entered into between the company and its directors and officers 
which was in force at the date of approval of this report. This 
indemnity gives contractual force to the Indemnity of Officers 
provision contained in the company’s Articles which were approved 
by shareholders in May 2005.
Auditors
Separate resolutions to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and 
to authorise the directors to agree their remuneration will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting to be held at the company’s 
offices on Tuesday 19 May 2009 at 11.30 a.m. is contained in a 
separate letter from the Chairman accompanying this report.
Corporate governance
Combined Code statement of compliance
Spectris plc is subject to the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (‘the Combined Code’) that is appended to the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Combined Code sets out 
principles and provisions relating to the good governance of 
companies. 
Corporate governance has been and remains the responsibility of 
the whole Board. This statement describes how the company applied 
the principles and complied with the provisions of the Combined 
Code during 2008. The Board considers that it was throughout the 
year and continues to be in full compliance with the provisions set 
out in Section 1 of the Combined Code, save that:
 A majority of the members of the nomination committee are not •	
independent non-executive directors, as required by provision 
A.4.1. The committee consists of the Chairman, the senior 
independent director and the Chief Executive and the Board 
considers this to be the most appropriate composition for the 
sensitive issues addressed by the committee.
Board composition and procedures
The Board meets formally at regular intervals throughout the year 
to consider developments in relation to the company’s strategy and 
long-term objectives and to review trading results and operational 
and business issues. In particular it deals with those matters 
reserved to it for decision, including the acquisition and disposal of 
businesses, major capital expenditure, the appointment and, where 
necessary, removal of directors and Board and senior management 
succession planning. Additional meetings are convened as required 
to consider specific topics requiring immediate decision. Usually, 
two meetings each year are held at operating locations and 
encompass a detailed review of the relevant business. Operational 
decisions are delegated by the Board to senior management at 
trading company level over which the executive directors exercise 
supervision. All directors receive detailed progress reports one 
week prior to each Board meeting. 34
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Directors’ Report continued
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, three executive 
directors and three non-executive directors. The Board considers  
its non-executive directors (Peter Chambré, Anthony Reading and 
John Warren) to be independent, in that none of them are or have 
ever been holders of an executive office with the company. The 
positions of Chairman, Chief Executive and senior independent 
director are held by separate individuals and, in accordance with 
the Combined Code, the Board has adopted written profiles for the 
first two of these. The non-executive directors have all had senior 
experience in other organisations and offer independent judgement 
on Board matters. The Chairman’s other significant interests are as 
non-executive chairman of Intec Telecom Systems plc and Telecity 
Group plc, non-executive deputy chairman of Parity Group plc and 
non-executive director of Chloride Group plc and Barco N.V. The 
Board believes that the Chairman’s obligations to the company are 
unaffected by these directorships.
There are procedures for individual Board members to receive 
induction and training as appropriate and to solicit independent 
professional advice at the group’s expense where specific expertise is 
required in the course of exercising their duties. All directors have 
access to the company secretary, who is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations.
All directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at the first 
Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter at 
intervals of no more than three years.
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to Board committees, 
notably the nomination, remuneration and audit committees. The 
terms of reference of these committees are published on the 
company’s website and the following additional documents are 
available to shareholders on application to the company secretary:
schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board; •

Board appointments and performance evaluation
The nomination committee consists of the Chairman, the senior 
independent director and the Chief Executive and is chaired by the 
Chairman, save in the event of discussions relating to his succession 
when the senior independent director takes the chair.
Following a decision of the Board that the appointment of a new 
director is appropriate, the duty of the committee is to present for 
Board consideration suitably qualified candidate(s). In making such 
recommendations, the committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board and develops a description 
of the role and required capabilities. Candidates are then identified 
for interview, external search consultants being engaged as part of 
this process. The committee also makes recommendations to the 
Board regarding the re-election and/or re-appointment of any 
director. Similar selection processes apply for the appointment  
of a chairman.
The nomination committee meets as the need arises. Its terms of 
reference can be found on the company’s website.
The operation of the Board and its committees is reviewed by the 
Board as a whole annually. The executive directors’ and company 
secretary’s performances are appraised annually against objectives 
established for the prior year. The contributions of the Chairman 
and non-executive directors are reviewed in advance of the 
conclusion of their initial three-year term, by the senior 
independent director and the Chairman respectively, prior to their 
being proposed to shareholders for re-election. Additionally, the 
Chairman holds periodic meetings with the non-executive directors 
only and, led by the senior independent director, the non-executives 
have the opportunity to meet at least annually without the 
Chairman present.
An evaluation of the operation and performance of the Board was 
conducted in 2008. The process included submissions from all 
Board members in response to a structured questionnaire covering 
a range of issues, which were considered by the Chairman and  
the senior independent director and then reviewed by the Board  
as a whole.
Shareholder relations
Spectris conducts regular dialogue with institutional shareholders 
and divulges such information as is permitted within the guidelines 
of the Listing Rules. The content of presentations made after results 
announcements may be accessed by individual investors on the 
group website, www.spectris.com.
All shareholders are invited to participate in the Annual General 
Meeting, where the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the 
chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees 
are available to answer questions. The results of proxy votes are  35

declared at the Annual General Meeting after each resolution has 
been dealt with on a show of hands. These are then published on the 
group website. 
The Board is kept informed of the views of major shareholders 
through periodic reports from the Chief Executive, the company’s 
joint brokers Merrill Lynch and RBS Hoare Govett and the 
company’s shareholder relations adviser, Makinson Cowell. The 
Chairman and non-executive directors have the opportunity to 
attend the bi-annual analyst presentations.
Shareholders representing in excess of 3% of the company’s issued 
share capital receive a standing invitation to meet the Chairman, 
the senior independent director or new non-executive directors. 
Such meetings would supplement if necessary, but not replace,  
the regular meetings with the Chief Executive and group  
finance director.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises the non-executive directors and  
is chaired by John Warren who has recent and relevant financial 
experience as the former group finance director of WH Smith PLC. 
The committee meets at least twice each year to consider the 
effectiveness of the group’s internal controls, policies and 
procedures, the process of internal audit and the outcome of the 
external audit. Its meetings are normally attended by the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive, the group finance director, the company 
secretary and the external auditor. All executive directors attend 
the year end final audit review meeting and processes requiring the 
disclosure of relevant information by individual directors to the 
auditor have been adopted. The committee regularly confers with 
the auditor without the attendance of executive directors. Its terms 
of reference can be found on the company’s website.
The committee is responsible for making recommendations to the 
Board in relation to the appointment of the external auditor and 
then for approving the external auditor’s remuneration, terms of 
engagement and scope of work.
The committee has also adopted procedures governing and 
restricting the appointment of the external auditor for non-audit 
services. The following services are precluded:
 book-keeping or other services related to the accounting records •	
or financial statements of Spectris plc;
financial information systems design and implementation; •	
 appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution •	
in kind reports;
actuarial services; •	
internal audit outsourcing services; •	
management functions or human resources; •	
 broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking •	
services; and
legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit. •	
A cumulative annual cap of £200,000 is established for all other 
non-audit services (save for acquisition due diligence and taxation 
services) above which all engagements are subject to prior approval 
by the audit committee.
The Head of Internal Audit is employed by the group to perform 
internal control reviews across the group according to a work 
programme agreed by the committee. The Head of Internal Audit is 
assisted in this by two further internal auditors and by other group 
finance personnel. The nature and scope of the group’s internal 
control review resources is reviewed by the audit committee 
annually. The audit committee receives reports twice a year on the 
results of internal control reviews. The Head of Internal Audit has 
direct access to the chairman of the audit committee and may meet 
with him in the absence of executive management.
Internal controls 
The group’s system of internal controls is described on page 23 of 
the Business Review. 
 
Going concern
Having reviewed the group’s plans and available financial facilities, 
the Board has a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason it continues to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the group’s accounts.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Directors’ Report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report 
and the group and parent company financial statements, in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they have elected to prepare the group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).  36
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Directors’ Report continued
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and 
performance of the group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in 
relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant 
part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view 
are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company. 
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them •	
consistently; 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
 for the group financial statements, state whether they have been •	
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; 
 for the parent company financial statements, state whether •	
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis •	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement  
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors 
are unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect  
of the Annual Report 
We, the directors of the company, confirm that to the best  
of our knowledge: 
a)  the financial statements of the group have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and for the 
company under UK GAAP, in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group; and
b) the information that is cross-referenced from the Business 
Review section of the Directors’ Report includes a fair review  
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that face the group.
By order of the Board.

Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
Directors’ Remuneration Report
The directors present their remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2008.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is responsible for recommending to 
the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive, the executive directors and the company 
secretary. The remuneration of non-executive directors is a matter 
reserved to the Chairman and executive directors.
Within the terms of the agreed policy, the committee determines:
 the total individual remuneration package including, where •	
appropriate, bonuses and share-based incentives;
the targets for any performance-related incentives; •	
the scope of any pension arrangements; •	
 contractual terms of engagement and any payments to be made •	
on termination; and
 the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the •	
Chairman or Chief Executive.
The committee also monitors the level and structure of 
remuneration for business unit presidents or managing directors 
and the head of corporate development. 
The remuneration committee consists of the Chairman and the 
non-executive directors (all of whom are independent), these being 
at the date of this report Anthony Reading (chairman), Peter 
Chambré, John Hughes and John Warren. The Chief Executive  
may be in attendance by invitation and the committee takes into 
consideration his recommendations regarding the remuneration  
of his executive colleagues. The Chief Executive is not involved in 
discussions concerning his own remuneration. 
The committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading 
name of Hewitt Associates Limited which acquired New Bridge 
Street Consultants LLP) to advise on various aspects of the 
Chairman’s and executive directors’ remuneration. Hewitt New 
Bridge Street did not provide any other services to the company 
during the year. However, Hewitt Associates Limited provided 
benchmark data on selected management roles during the  
year. Hewitt New Bridge Street operates separately from the  
rest of Hewitt. 
The terms of reference of the remuneration committee can be found 
on the company’s website and are available on request. 
Remuneration policy
The Board, in considering the recommendations of the remuneration 
committee, complied throughout the year with the provisions of the 
Combined Code (including the principles for performance-related 
remuneration set out in Schedule A). The policy objective is to ensure 
that the high calibre individuals required at board level are fairly and 
competitively remunerated and incentivised in a manner consistent 
with the group’s strategic objectives.
The remuneration committee also regularly reviews the balance 
between fixed and variable pay. 
Salaries and fees
Base salaries and fees are established by reference to surveys of the 
terms offered by comparable UK quoted companies. The starting 
point for comparative surveys is the scope of the position and 
associated performance of the Chairman, each executive director 
and the company secretary. Excluding his own position and 
performance, the Chief Executive is responsible for the definition of 
the scope of positions and assessment of the performance of each 
executive director, for approval by the remuneration committee. 
Salaries are reviewed at the beginning of each year and are set at 
competitive levels, typically based around the market median, 
although the remuneration committee reserves the flexibility to 
respond to individual circumstances which may cause salaries to be 
set at a level higher or lower than market median. Market ranges are 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
Salary levels for all Board members were not subject to any increase 
at the review date of 1 January 2009.
Bonuses
To align remuneration with shareholders’ interests, a significant 
proportion of executive directors’ potential total remuneration is 
related to annual corporate performance.
Under the 2008 arrangements, bonuses of up to 100% of base salary 
were achievable upon the attainment of demanding profitability 
(75% potential) and personal (25% potential) targets set in relation 
to carefully considered business plans. Bonus payments commence 
only at a level which shows an acceptable financial result in the 
context of economic circumstances and market expectations, with 
an ‘on-plan’ performance yielding a payment of approximately half 
the maximum potential. Targets for maximum outturn are set at 
highly stretching, albeit attainable, levels. There is no change to the 
bonus potential or performance measures for 2009. Bonuses 
achieved in respect of 2008 performance based on targets set at the 
start of the financial year were as follows (as a percentage of salary 
at 31 December 2008):
J E O’Higgins 81.10%
C G Watson 75.65%
J C Webster 77.90%
Share-based incentives
The remuneration committee keeps under review the company’s 
share-based incentive arrangements and takes advice on market 
practice. The committee is of the view that offering senior 
management the opportunity to be awarded and then retain shares 
in the company is an important part of motivating and rewarding 
key employees so that they may participate in the future growth in 
value of the company. The Spectris Performance Share Plan (‘the 
Plan’), approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM, is intended to 
support this objective and to facilitate the retention of senior 
management over the longer term. 
Under the Plan, annual awards of shares may be made which vest  
at the end of a three-year period, subject to continued employment 
and the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions. The 
maximum award of performance shares that can be made to any 
participant in any financial year is limited to shares with a market 
value equal to 125% of the participant’s salary, although the  38
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
committee’s general policy is to determine awards by reference to  
a base award over shares worth 100% of salary, which may then be 
flexed up or down from year to year depending on corporate and 
personal performance. 
Awards are currently structured so that 50% of the award is subject 
to an earnings per share (‘EPS’) target and 50% subject to a total 
shareholder return (‘TSR’) target. Each condition operates over a 
fixed three-year period with no opportunity for retesting.
The performance criteria for grants made in 2008 are summarised 
in the tables below. 
 
Company 
EPS performance
% of award that vests (expressed as a 
percentage of one-half of the total 
number of shares subject to an award)
Consumer Prices Index (‘CPI’) + 
12% compound per annum 
(‘c.p.a.’)
100%
Between CPI +5% and  
12% c.p.a. 
Pro rata straight line between 25% 
and 100%
CPI +5% c.p.a. 25%
Less than CPI + 5% c.p.a. 0%
Company TSR performance  
relative to the FTSE 250 (excluding 
investment trusts)
% of award that vests (expressed as a 
percentage of one-half of the total 
number of shares subject to an award)
Upper quintile or above 100%
Between upper quintile and 
median
Pro rata straight line between 25% 
and 100%
Median 25%
Below median 0%
The above criteria will continue to apply to Performance Share Plan 
awards to be made in 2009.
For grants made in 2006 and 2007, the upper end of each vesting 
scale was set at a) CPI + 10% c.p.a. and b) upper quartile. The 
reference level for a base award of shares in 2006 and 2007 was  
67% of salary.
If awards in excess of 100% of salary were to be granted, the 
committee has also undertaken that the percentage of an award  
that will vest for threshold performance will be limited to 25% of a 
participant’s base salary rather than 25% of the number of shares 
subject to an award, with pro rata straight line vesting from this 
lower point up to 100% of the award. There is no intention to make 
awards in excess of 100% of salary during 2009.
The committee considers the above performance conditions to be 
an appropriate means of aligning the interests of participants with 
those of longer-term shareholders. The TSR performance condition 
will be measured independently by Hewitt New Bridge Street and 
the EPS condition will be verified by the company’s auditors. 
It is the intention of the committee that all future share-based 
incentives granted to senior managers or executive directors are 
made under the Plan. No share option grants were made during 
2008 or the year to date, nor are any grants envisaged. Executive 
directors may, however, continue to participate in grants made 
under the Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme which is 
applicable to all UK employees.
 
Exercise of share options granted under the 1996 executive share 
plan (which was not renewed on expiry) or the 1999 executive share 
option scheme, were subject to prior achievement of performance 
conditions, requiring compound annual growth in earnings per 
share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill (‘EPS’) 
over three financial years to be between 3% and 5% per annum 
ahead of the increase in the retail prices index (‘RPI’). This 
condition has now been met for all outstanding option grants. EPS 
growth was selected as the appropriate pre-condition to exercise in 
order to ensure that share option gains would only be received if the 
company’s performance for shareholders had been enhanced. 
Share retention
It is intended that each executive director should, subject to 
personal circumstances, build a retained shareholding in Spectris 
plc greater than two times base salary in value within a five-year 
period from appointment. Executive directors are required to apply 
the post-tax benefit of any vested Plan awards or bonus payments 
exceeding 60% of base salary to the acquisition of shares until this 
level of shareholding is achieved. 
Benefits
Company car and health insurance benefits are subject to income 
tax. The executive directors have defined contribution pension 
arrangements to which the company contributes at a rate of 25% of 
base salary.
Contractual terms
All executive directors have rolling contracts subject to  
12 months’ notice. 
The committee has determined that contracts of employment 
should, going forward, contain a contractual best endeavours 
obligation to seek alternative employment in the event of serving  
of notice of termination by the company, and that full mitigation 
reflective of any earnings from a new position should apply so as to 
reduce the payments otherwise due from the company during the 
notice period. Additionally, in these circumstances, it is the current 
intention that bonus entitlements should be calculated to the date  
of notice of termination only and that a phased payment provision, 
subject to reduction as explained above and equivalent to 1.65 times 
monthly salary, should apply in lieu of all remuneration and 
benefits otherwise payable during the notice period and in full and 
final settlement of all employment-related claims. Mr O’Higgins’ 
and Mr Watson’s contracts of employment reflect these terms.
Mr Webster’s contract, concluded in 1998, provides for a 
predetermined compensation payment in lieu of notice (equivalent 
to total notice period remuneration – salary, bonus and benefits)  
in the event of termination by the employer within 12 months of  
a change in control of the group. Termination payments in other 
circumstances would be a matter for negotiation and remain, at the 
discretion of the committee, subject to mitigation and/or reduction 
for accelerated payment. 
No compensation payments on termination of employment were 
made during the year. 39

External appointments
Executive directors may retain any payments received in respect  
of external non-executive appointments. Such appointments are 
limited to one per director at any time and are subject to the 
approval of the Board. Mr Webster is a non-executive director of 
Raymarine plc and was paid a fee of £35,000 per annum. No other 
external directorships are held by the executive directors.
Remuneration below board level
Remuneration for presidents of the group’s trading companies is set 
at competitive levels to reflect the size, complexity and geographic 
locations of these businesses. Base salaries for presidents of the 
group’s European operations fall within a range between €130,000 
and €340,000. Base salaries for presidents of the group’s US 
operations fall within a range between $220,000 and $300,000. 
Additionally, the group’s presidents participate in share awards 
under the Spectris Performance Share Plan (typically over 60% of 
base salary) and in profit-related bonus arrangements linked to base 
salary and payable against their business annual operating profit 
after exchange, plus or minus a financing charge/credit arising from 
changes in working capital over the year. On plan performance 
delivers a c.30% of base salary bonus with the upper limit of the 
payment range delivering 50% of base salary.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors’ fees are agreed by the Chairman and 
executive directors by reference to market practice. The base fee is 
supplemented by allowances for chairmanship of the audit and 
remuneration committees and the pension scheme trustee board. 
There is no participation in bonus, share option, or pension 
arrangements and no participation in the Spectris Performance 
Share Plan. All non-executive directors’ conditions of appointment 
provide for a six-month period of notice within an initial term of 
three years from election by shareholders at the director’s first 
AGM. The appointment may be renewed by mutual agreement for  
a further three-year period. 
Total shareholder return
The following graph indicates the value by the end of 2008 of £100 
invested in Spectris plc 5p ordinary shares on 31 December 2003 
compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 250 index 
(excluding investment trusts) over the same period. The graph was 
selected as the most appropriate comparison measure because the 
company is a constituent member of the FTSE 250 index and the 
members of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) form the 
comparator group for the purposes of the TSR performance test 
under the Spectris Performance Share Plan. 
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2008, of £100 invested 
in Spectris on 31 December 2003 compared with the value of  
£100 invested in the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts). 
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial 
year-ends. 40

Shares other than those marked SAYE relate to executive share option grants. Entitlement to exercise grants under the Unapproved 1996 
Executive Share Plan is conditional upon a performance criterion requiring compound growth in normalised earnings per share (EPS) over 
three years up to 5% per annum in excess of the increase in the retail prices index (please refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report on  
page 38 for further explanation). This condition has been met for all outstanding option grants. No consideration was paid by any recipient  
in relation to the grant of an option and there were no changes to the conditions on which any option was granted during the year. 
No director exercised share options during the year. The remaining options granted to S C Harris lapsed on his leaving employment on

Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Spectris plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial 
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Spectris plc for  
the year ended 31 December 2008, which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated and parent 
company balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, 
the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 
and the related notes. These financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have 
also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this  
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent 
company financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting 
Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set 
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 35. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements  
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985, and as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.  
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that 
specific information presented in the Annual Report that is 
cross-referred from the Business Review section of the  
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the 2006 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if 
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in 
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and 
company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in •	
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state of 
the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit 
for the year then ended; 
 the group financial statements have been properly prepared •	
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation; 
 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair •	
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2008; 
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the •	
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent •	
with the financial statements.

Notes to the Accounts
1. Accounting policies
General information
Spectris plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in 
the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985, whose 
shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies 
set out below. 
Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The group financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (adopted 
IFRS). The company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; these are presented on pages 85 to 91. 
The financial statements are prepared rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand on the historical cost basis except that 
derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The group’s business activities, together with factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are  
set out in the Business Review on pages 6 to 29. The financial 
position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 20 to 22. In addition, Note 2 to the financial statements 
includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and  
its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The directors have considered the group’s forecasts and 
projections and reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance. Taking account of the financing position at  
31 December 2008 and the new facility secured from the 
European Investment Bank (Note 20), the directors consider  
that the group will be able to operate within the level of its 
committed facilities even should the facility maturing at the  
end of 2009 not be renewed. No matters have been drawn  
to the group’s attention to suggest that renewal of this facility 
might not be forthcoming on acceptable terms should the  
group seek renewal in due course.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company and the group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing the annual report  
and accounts.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies 
and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The key judgements made in respect of the 
appropriateness of the group accounting policies relate to:
 the timing of revenue recognition where the group has some •	
responsibility for installation activity;
 the classification of financial instruments in relation to hedge •	
accounting;
 the classification of retirement benefit arrangements •	
between defined benefit and defined contribution; and
 the point at which development activity meets the cost •	
capitalisation threshold.
The directors do not consider the practical application of these 
judgements to involve significant subjectivity or uncertainty.
The estimates and associated assumptions are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and various 
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. Estimates that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements are recognised in the following areas:
 business combinations in relation to the determination of the •	
fair value of acquired assets and liabilities (Note 31);
 goodwill in relation to the assumptions underpinning •	
impairment testing (Note 14);
 retirement benefit schemes in relation to the assumptions •	
used to value plan assets and liabilities (Note 9);
 provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to determining •	
the quantum and timing of management’s best estimate of 
outflows (Notes 23 and 32).
The accounting policies set out below have been applied 
consistently by group entities to all periods presented in these 
financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations have 
been issued and endorsed, which are not yet effective for the 
year ended 31 December 2008. Although these have not been 
applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements,  
it is not expected that they will have a significant impact on  
the group’s reported results when they come into force with  
the exception of those noted below.
Revised IFRS 3, Business Combinations (2008), incorporates  
the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the 
group’s operations:
 contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with •	
subsequent changes therein recognised in profit or loss;
 transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will •	
be expensed as incurred;
 any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at •	
fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss; and
 any non-controlling (minority) interest will be measured at •	
either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a 
transaction-by-transaction basis. 49

Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
Revised IFRS 3, which becomes mandatory for the group’s 2010 
consolidated financial statements, will be applied prospectively 
and therefore there will be no impact on prior years in the 
group’s 2010 consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, introduces the ‘management 
approach’ to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which becomes 
mandatory for the group’s 2009 consolidated financial 
statements requires presentation and disclosure of segment 
information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by 
the group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess 
each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. 
The group has analysed the impact of IFRS 8 and it is not 
expected to have any impact on the presentation and disclosure 
of the segment information disclosed.
Revised IAS 23, Borrowing Costs, removes the option to expense 
all borrowing costs and requires the group to capitalise 
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the 
cost of that asset. The revised IAS 23 will become mandatory  
for the group’s 2009 consolidated financial statements and will 
constitute a change in accounting policy for the group. In 
accordance with the transitional provisions, the group will apply 
the revised IAS 23 to qualifying assets for which expenditure 
commences on or after the effective date. Therefore, there will 
be no impact on prior periods in the group’s 2009 consolidated 
financial statements.
Revised IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (2007), 
introduces the term ‘total comprehensive income’, which 
represents changes in equity during a period other than those 
changes resulting from transactions with owners in their 
capacity as owners. Total comprehensive income may be 
presented in either a single statement of comprehensive income 
(effectively combining both the income statement and all 
non-owner changes in equity in a single statement), or in an 
income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive 
income. Revised IAS 1, which becomes mandatory for the 
group’s 2009 consolidated financial statements, is expected  
to have a significant impact on the presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements include the results of the 
company and all of its subsidiary undertakings and associates 
(equity accounted investment).
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the 
group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of 
another entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting and are recognised initially at cost.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including 
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations  
are translated into sterling at average annual exchange rates. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are 
recognised directly in a separate translation reserve within 
equity.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at 
that date with any exchange differences arising on retranslation 
being recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction.
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the 
group’s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
accounting policies applied in these circumstances are described 
under the heading ‘Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting’ below.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value 
less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised 
cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising  
from operating and financing activities. In accordance with  
its treasury policy, it does not hold or use derivative financial 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments may be transacted to hedge the 
variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or of 
highly probable forecast transactions, caused by changes in 
exchange rates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried in the balance  
sheet at fair value. Where a derivative financial instrument is 
designated in a cash flow hedge relationship with a highly 
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or 
loss arising is recognised directly in equity. The ineffective part 
of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. When 
the forecast transaction subsequently occurs and results in the 
recognition of a financial asset or liability that impacts on the 
income statement, the associated cumulative gain or loss is 
removed from equity and presented within the income   50
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
1. Accounting policies continued
statement. When the forecast transaction subsequently occurs 
and results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, 
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity 
and included within the initial cost of the non-financial asset  
or liability. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is either sold, terminated or exercised without 
replacement or rollover; or the group revokes the designation;  
or the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting.
If a derivative financial instrument is not formally designated  
in a cash flow hedge relationship, any change in fair value is 
recognised in the income statement.
Net investment hedge accounting
The group uses US dollar and euro-denominated borrowings 
and derivative financial instruments as a hedge against the 
translation exposure on the group’s net investment in overseas 
companies. Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the 
variability in the net assets of such companies caused by 
changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the 
borrowings are recognised in equity. The ineffective part  
of any change in value caused by changes in exchange  
rates is recognised in the income statement.
The group takes advantage of cross-currency swaps for some  
of its US dollar-denominated private placement borrowings.  
The swaps have the effect of converting fixed rate US dollar 
borrowings into ‘synthetic’ fixed rate euro-denominated 
borrowings. The value of the element of the swap that locks 
interest payments at a fixed euro interest rate changes as US 
dollar variable interest rates, euro variable interest rates and 
foreign currency exchange rates change. Under IAS 39’s rules, 
such changes in value are considered to be ineffective as a net 
investment hedge and accordingly they are recognised in the 
income statement.
Business combinations and goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the 
purchase method. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair 
value of the purchase consideration for the interests in 
subsidiary undertakings over the fair value to the group of the 
net assets and any contingent liabilities acquired. In respect of 
acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the 
basis of its deemed cost which represents the amount recorded 
previously under UK GAAP. Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill 
was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. From 1 January 2004, goodwill 
is allocated on acquisition to cash-generating units that are 
anticipated to benefit from the combination, and is no longer 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment. Impairment is 
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the goodwill relates. This estimate of 
recoverable amount is performed at each balance sheet date.
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant 
judgement and is based on a number of factors such as the 
near-term business outlook for the cash generating unit, 
including both its operating profit and operating cash flow 
performance. Where the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment 
loss is recognised. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-
generating unit and part of the operation within that unit  
is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation 
disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill 
disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the 
relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of 
the cash-generating unit retained.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition. Management must be committed to the sale 
and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the 
sale must have been initiated. Ordinarily, the sale should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of the classification as held for sale.
Segmental analysis
A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is 
engaged in providing products or services (business segment),  
or in providing products or services within a particular economic 
environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks 
and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Segmental information is based on two segment formats: the 
primary format represents the group’s business segments whereas 
the secondary format reflects the geographical segments.
Segment result represents operating profits (including intangible 
asset amortisation and goodwill impairment charges) and 
includes an allocation of head office expenses. Segment result 
excludes tax and financing items.
Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other 
receivables and assets held for sale. Segment liabilities comprise 
trade and other payables, provisions, held for sale liabilities,  
and other payables. Unallocated items represent corporate and 
deferred taxation balances, defined benefit scheme liabilities 
and all components of net debt.
Intangible assets
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to  
the income statement in the year in which they are incurred 
unless development expenditure meets certain strict criteria  
for capitalisation. These criteria include demonstration of the 
technical feasibility of completing a new intangible asset that 
Notes to the Accounts continued 51
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
will be available for sale and that the asset will generate 
probable future economic benefits. Where expenditure meets 
the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised 
over their useful economic lives.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the 
future economic benefits, otherwise it is expensed as incurred. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative 
expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Patents and trademark – up to 5 years
Other intangible assets – 3 to 10 years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. The group recognises in 
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment the 
additions that are appropriate to capitalise and the subsequent 
costs of replacing the parts of such items when there are future 
economic benefits that will flow to the group and its cost can be 
measured reliably. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset cost. All other costs 
are recognised in the income statement as an expense as they 
are incurred.
Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated 
residual value, of property, plant and equipment over its 
estimated useful life. The depreciation charge is revised where 
useful lives are different from previously estimated, or where 
technically obsolete assets are required to be written down. 
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have separate 
lives, they are accounted for and depreciated as separate items. 
Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold property – 20 to 40 years
Short leasehold property –  over the period  
of the lease
Plant, machinery and other equipment – 5 to 20 years
Motor vehicles – 4 years
Tooling, computer hardware – 3 to 5 years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  
excluding goodwill
The carrying amount of the group’s assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised as an operating expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value as 
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Discounting is applied where it is expected to have a 
material impact.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Inventories acquired as part of business 
combinations are valued at fair value. Cost represents direct 
costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion 
costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing 
location and condition. In the case of manufacturing inventory 
and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of 
production overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis. Provision 
is made to write down slow-moving and obsolete items to net 
realisable value based on an assessment of technological and 
market developments and on an analysis of historic and 
projected usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash equivalents for the purposes  
of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at fair value.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. In respect  
of warranties a provision is recognised when the underlying 
products or services are sold. Provisions are recognised at an 
amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the group’s liability. Obligations arising from 
restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans  52
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
1. Accounting policies continued
have been established and when there is a valid expectation 
that such a plan will be carried out.
Post-retirement benefits
The group operates pension schemes providing benefits based 
on final pensionable pay. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the group. The group’s net obligation 
in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated 
separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service  
in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to 
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets 
is deducted. The discount rate is determined by reference to 
market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality 
corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the 
terms of the group’s obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in full in the period in which they arise in the statement of 
recognised income and expense.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of  
the increased benefit relating to past service by employees  
is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits 
become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, 
the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For defined contribution schemes, the assets are held separately 
from those of the group in independently administered funds. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the 
income statement as they fall due. 
In certain countries, the group participates in industry-wide 
defined benefit-type pension arrangements. In such 
circumstances, it is not possible to determine the amount of any 
surplus or deficit attributable to the group and the pension costs 
are accounted for as if the arrangements were defined 
contribution schemes.
Share-based payments
The fair value of equity-settled employee share option grants  
is calculated at grant date. The resulting cost is charged to the 
income statement over the vesting period of the plans. The 
value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual 
levels of options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due  
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Revenues
Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts 
and excluding value added tax.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income 
statement when the significant risk and rewards of ownership of 
the goods have been transferred to the customer, which is 
typically on delivery. For contracts that involve a significant 
element of installation or testing of equipment, revenue is 
recognised at the point of customer acceptance. Revenue from 
services rendered is recognised in the income statement in 
proportion to the measurement of the stage of completion of 
services rendered as at the balance sheet date. This is generally 
assessed by reference to the amount of time incurred in 
proportion to the total expected time to be taken to deliver  
the service. Revenue is not recognised if there are significant 
uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Interest payable and receivable
Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings 
calculated using the effective interest method. 
Interest receivable and payable is recognised in the income 
statement as it accrues using the effective interest method. 
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of 
the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in 
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments 
are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive  
to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted,  
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable  
in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of 
intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the 
liability to pay the related dividend.

Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
2. Financial risk management
The group’s multinational operations and debt financing expose 
it to a variety of financial risks. In the course of its business, the 
group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and credit risk. Financial risk management is an 
integral part of the way the group is managed. Financial risk 
management policies are set by the Board of directors. These 
policies are implemented by a central treasury department that 
has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk, and liquidity risk including, where appropriate, the use 
of derivative financial instruments. The group has clearly defined 
authority and approval limits. 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold 
or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative 
purposes. Such instruments are only used to manage the risks 
arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly 
probable future transactions. The quantitative analysis of 
financial risk is included in Note 21. 
(a) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase 
transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the 
respective functional currencies of group companies 
(transactional exposures) and where the results of overseas 
companies are consolidated into the group’s reporting currency 
of £ sterling (translational exposures). The group has operations 
around the world which record their results in a variety of 
different local functional currencies. In countries where the 
group does not have operations, it invariably has some 
customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency. The 
group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates between a number of different currencies but 
the group’s primary exposures relate to the US dollar, and, to a 
lesser extent, the euro, Danish krone and Japanese yen. Where 
appropriate the group manages its foreign currency exposures 
using derivative financial instruments.
The group manages its transactional exposures to foreign 
currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts. 
Forward exchange contracts are typically used to hedge  
highly probable forecast sale transactions which can be  
forecast to occur from anything between one and 18 months  
into the future.
The group’s translational exposures to foreign currency risks can 
relate both to the income statement and net assets of overseas 
subsidiaries. The group’s policy is not to hedge the translational 
exposure that arises on consolidation of the income statements 
of overseas subsidiaries. The group finances overseas company 
investments partly through the use of foreign currency 
borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign 
currency risk arising on translation of the group’s net investment.
(b) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that 
results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the 
interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable 
rates. Where appropriate, interest rate swaps are used to 
manage the group’s interest rate profile.
Currently, the majority of the group’s borrowings attract fixed 
rates of interest payments and therefore the group’s principal 
interest rate risk is a price risk.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the group will not be able 
to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group’s 
approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group’s 
reputation. The group manages this risk through the use of 
regularly updated cash flow forecasts and a liquidity headroom 
analysis which is used to determine funding requirements. 
Adequate committed lines of funding are maintained from high 
quality investment grade lenders. The facilities committed to the 
group as at 31 December 2008 are set out in Note 20.
(d) Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform  
its obligations. The group is exposed to credit risk on financial 
assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, 
trade and other receivables.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables. The amounts recognised in the balance sheet  
are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, 
estimated by the group’s management based on prior 
experience and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables are subject to credit limits, and 
control and approval procedures in the operating companies. 
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the 
group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on 
its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial 
instruments is managed centrally by transacting with an existing 
relationship bank with strong investment grade rating. 
Accordingly, the group’s associated credit risk is limited. The 
group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by 
the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative 
financial instruments, in the group balance sheet.
Capital management
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The Board of directors 
monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders and the 
level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the 
company. This is carried out through a Save As You Earn option 
scheme in the UK, as well as Performance Share Plans. Full 
details of these schemes are given in the share-based payments 
note (Note 27) of these accounts. 54
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Notes to the Accounts continued
2. Financial risk management continued
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
From time to time the group purchases its own shares in the market; the timing of these purchases depends on market prices. Buy 
and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
There were no changes to the group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
3. Adjusted performance measures
Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS. Adjusted figures are 
stated before amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, profits or losses on termination  
or disposal of businesses or major fixed assets, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains or losses on 
retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the 
underlying tax rate (see Note 11).
The adjusted performance measures are derived from the reported figures under adopted IFRS as follows:

Following legal rulings in Switzerland, the Swiss Institute of Certified Accountants has issued revised guidance that redesignates 
certain Swiss pension arrangements as defined benefit (previously defined contribution). Accordingly management has included  
its BTG Swiss pension plan as a defined benefit plan as at 1 January 2008. Management does not consider there has been any 
substantive change in its risks in relation to this plan.

The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return on each individual asset class. 
The expected return on equities is the sum of inflation, dividend yield and economic growth, less investment expenses. The return 
on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term gilts and bonds. The expected return on other assets is the current 
interest rate set by the Bank of England.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options. The key features of 
share option contracts are described in Note 27.

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the group’s cash-generating units 
represented by each of the group’s major businesses. The most significant elements of the group’s total consolidated goodwill of 
£342.6m at 31 December 2008 are allocated to PANalytical (£105.9m), BTG (£63.8m), HBM (£71.9m) and Brüel & Kjær Sound & 
Vibration (£62.2m). Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of 
impairment. There have been no indications of impairment in 2008. As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying  
value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each 
cash-generating unit based on actual operating results and the most recent budgets for the next financial year. 
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based relate to growth rates and discount rates. There are no 
individually significant assumptions in respect of any business that materially impacts the impairment testing. Growth rates for the 
period not covered by the budgets do not exceed 2.5%. The cash flow projections have been discounted on the group’s pre-tax 
weighted average cost of capital estimated at 13%. No impairment charge has been recognised in either 2008 or 2007 to write 
goodwill down to its estimated recoverable amount. 
The directors have considered the following individual sensitivities:
a 2% increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 15% would result in an impairment of £6.0m; •	
if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced to 1% no impairment would arise; and •	
if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25% in 2009 and 2010 no impairment would arise. •	
The goodwill impairment testing performed by management is based on plan data updated in February 2009. 68

Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not  
past due and an impairment has been recorded against the trade receivables that the group believes may not be recoverable.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with  
these items. 71

At 31 December 2008, the group had available £40.0m (2007: £65.8m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of 
which all conditions precedent had been met.
After the year end, a £50m, five-year term facility was secured from the European Investment Bank in January 2009 under covenant 
conditions in line with existing facilities.
Secured bank loans
Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the group’s subsidiaries. Of these £2.0m is denominated in 
Chinese renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, £0.7m is denominated  
in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 
£0.4m is denominated in euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a 
small margin.
Unsecured loan notes
The interest rates on the unsecured loan notes are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any 
cross-currency interest rate swaps, and remain fixed until redemption. On issue of the US$100m loan notes in October 2003 the 
group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap which has the effect of converting this US dollar borrowing into fixed interest 
euro-denominated debt. The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of €90.5m with a fixed 
interest rate of 5.64%. This interest rate remains fixed until redemption.  72

20. Borrowings continued
Under adopted IFRS, where cross-currency interest rate swaps are used, the value of the underlying US dollar borrowing is presented in 
this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial 
instruments in Note 21. For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts  
US dollar borrowings into euro borrowings is viewed as part of the group’s net debt, as analysed below.

The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where 
payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash 
flow, using approporiate yield curves, to the net present values.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is a liability of £9.2m (2007: asset of £0.1m) of 
which £8.1m has been debited to the hedging reserve (2007: credit of £0.1m), £0.8m debited to the translation reserve (2007: £nil) 
and £0.1m debited to the income statement (2007: £nil). These contracts mature over periods not exceeding 12 months. A summary 
of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available  
market data.
 
The amount included in the income statement is split between revenue and administrative expenses.
The following table shows the contractual forward exchange contracts hedging designated transactional exposures. These contracts 
mature in the next 12 months, therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 
12 months.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps
The value of the group’s cross-currency interest rate swaps can effectively be split into two components: a portion that is 
attributable to converting a US dollar-denominated borrowing liability into a euro-denominated borrowing liability (the currency 
portion) – the value of this portion changes as currency exchange rates change and a portion that is attributable to converting fixed 
rate US dollar interest payments into fixed rate euro interest payments (the interest portion) – the value of this portion of the swap 
changes as US dollar variable interest rates, euro variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates change.
Under adopted IFRS, the underlying US dollar borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the 
cross-currency interest rate swaps. In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised  
in full on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the movements in the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swap during the year and also how it is 
attributed to its currency and interest portions.

The combination of the underlying US dollar borrowings and cross-currency interest rate swap has been designated as a net 
investment hedge of the group’s net investment in its European businesses. However, the interest portion of the swap is ineffective 
in this hedging relationship. Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the 
change in value of the underlying US dollar borrowings in reserves, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is 
recognised in the income statement within financing costs. 74

Sensitivity analysis
At 31 December 2008 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the group’s 
profit before tax by approximately £0.3m (2007: increase of £0.3m).
For the year ended 31 December 2008 it is estimated that a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against  
£ sterling would have decreased the group’s profit before tax by approximately £4.3m (2007: £6.9m), a ten percentage point 
weakening in the value of the euro/Danish krone against £ sterling would have decreased the group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £4.1m (2007: £1.1m) and a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the Japanese yen against £ sterling would 
have decreased the group’s profit before tax by approximately £1.8m (2007: £2.6m).

Provisions are all presented as current liabilities.
Provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where the effect is significant, generally only where it is anticipated that 
a liability will crystallise in more than one year. 
Reorganisation
Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors’ best 
estimate of the cost to complete the restructuring.
Product warranty
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and 
included within the group’s standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the 
occasional extension up to 36 months. These extended warranties are not significant and the provision represents the directors’ best 
estimate of the group’s liability based on past experience. 
Other
Other comprises legal, property-related and other provisions. Property-related and other provisions represent the directors’ best 
estimate of the cost of settling future obligations over varying time periods. The company has on occasion been required to take 
legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself 
against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on 
past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent 
management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome  
of various court proceedings and negotiations, but is expected to be within one to three years. 
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management,  
taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful. 
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the directors are of the opinion that any associated 
claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed  
as remote. 76

Unrecognised temporary differences
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the following temporary differences due to the degree of uncertainty over both 
the amount and utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions. There is no associated expiry date in 
respect of tax losses.

The group has one class of ordinary voting shares which carry no right to fixed income.
During the year no ordinary shares were issued upon exercise under share option schemes (2007: 38,500), giving rise to  
net proceeds of £nil (2007: £0.2m). See Note 27 for a summary of potential issues of ordinary shares under existing share  
option schemes.
Other reserves
Movements in reserves are set out in the Reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves in Note 26. The retained earnings 
reserve includes own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (see Note 29). The retained earnings reserve also includes own 
shares purchased by the company and treated as treasury shares (see Note 30). The nature and purpose of other reserves forming 
part of equity are as follows:
Translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve
This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as 
effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve
This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital  
and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve records the historical repurchase of the group’s own shares. 78

27. Share-based payments
The Executive Share Option Scheme and Save As You Earn share option schemes were set up in order to provide executives and 
selected employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the company. Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise 
prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant. Share options 
granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth 
targets. Options vest after a period of three years, and have a maximum term of ten years. 
Under the Performance Share Plan, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the company’s shares. Awards to Spectris plc executives 
and senior managers are subject to performance criteria; 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of earnings growth targets 
(EPS) and 50% subject to a total shareholder return target (TSR). For executives and senior managers of the group’s operating 
companies, the performance criteria is subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company targets in respect  
of 50% of the award. For operating company managers the award is entirely subject to operating company profitability targets. 
Awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the twelve-month period following vesting.
Under the Save As You Earn scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years. Options may be exercised 
during a six-month period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share 
price prevailing on the day before the date of grant. There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the 
Save As You Earn scheme.

Share-based payment expense
Share options are valued using a stochastic option pricing model, with support from an independent remuneration consultant.  
The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition and the operating company profit condition have been included in the 
calculation of fair value under the Performance Share Plan. For options granted in 2008 and 2007, the fair value per option granted 
and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

Fair value per award – EPS condition      99.1%–99.4% 99.5%
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected term. The expected life is the average expected period to 
exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed 
option life.
* No options were granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The group recognised total expenses of £1.8m related to equity settled share-based payment transactions in 2008 (2007: £0.9m).

29. Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust

and held by the Spectris plc Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) to satisfy options under the group’s share option schemes (see Note 27).

At 1 January        0.2 0.3
Disposals       (0.1) (0.1)
At 31 December        0.1 0.2
The EBT holds ordinary 5p shares in Spectris plc for the purpose of satisfying obligations under the 1996 Executive Share Option 
Plan for the benefit of the group’s employees. The EBT held 10,765 shares at 31 December 2008 (2007: 20,780) at a cost of  
£0.1m (2007: £0.2m). The market value of the EBT’s shares at 31 December 2008 was £0.1m (2007: £0.1m).
The purchase of the shares on the open market is funded by loans directly from Spectris plc. Dividend income in excess of 0.01p  
per share on the shares held by the EBT has been waived by the Trust and is therefore not included in the group’s profit and loss 
account. Interest and administration costs of the EBT are charged to the profit and loss account of the company for the year.
30. Treasury shares
During the year the group repurchased 1.4 million shares (2007: 8.9 million) for a consideration of £9.3m (2007: £79.2m). 21,363 of 
these shares were issued to satisfy options exercised by employees which were granted under the group’s share scheme. No shares 
were cancelled during the year (2007: nil). 82
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
31. Acquisitions
During the period, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Viscotek Corporation effective on 1 January 2008, nCode 
International effective on 1 August 2008 and the LDS Test and Measurement business effective on 1 December 2008. The group  
also acquired the assets and liabilities of Siemens’ Machine Vision Business on 19 September 2008 and, in addition, a number  
of distributors in markets where a direct presence was sought. The assets and liabilities acquired, together with the aggregate 
purchase consideration, is summarised below. The profit contribution of the acquired businesses to the group’s result for the  
period was £3.4m. Group revenue and operating profit would have been £833.1m and £116.8m respectively had the acquisitions 
taken place on the first day of the year. Fair values attached to certain provisions acquired in connection with the LDS business  
are provisional at the balance sheet date, pending finalisation of the alignment with group policy. No material changes 
are anticipated.
Reflecting the proximity of the LDS acquisition to the year end, the allocation of the residual balance of goodwill between goodwill 
and the fair value of intangible assets is yet to be finalised. Where the fair value of acquired intangible assets has been identified, 
the residual goodwill represents the synergies that can be achieved through the integration into the group, the future potential to 
develop new technology, and the potential future relationships and contracts.

Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Notes to the Company’s Accounts
38. Accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by that 
Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United 
Kingdom. In accordance with the exemption provided by 
Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the company has not 
presented its own profit and loss account.
The company has taken the exemption available in respect of 
the requirements of FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Basis of accounting
The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value as 
described below.
Derivative financial instruments
The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the 
group’s exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks 
arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance 
with its treasury policy, it does not hold or use derivative 
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps
The company takes advantage of cross-currency interest rate 
swaps for some of its US dollar-denominated private placement 
borrowings. The swaps have the effect of converting fixed rate US 
dollar borrowings into fixed rate euro-denominated borrowings.
The underlying US dollar borrowings are required to be presented 
separately in the balance sheet from the cross-currency interest 
rate swaps. In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest 
rate swap is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet. 
All changes in value are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial guarantees
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to 
guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, 
the company considers these to be insurance arrangements and 
accounts for them as such. In this respect, the company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as 
it becomes probable that the company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at 
that date with any exchange differences arising on retranslation 
being recognised in the profit and loss account. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the difference between 
the cost or valuation of fixed assets and their residual value over 
their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis at the 
following rates per annum:
Leasehold improvements 5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Intangible fixed assets and amortisation
Intangible fixed assets purchased by the company are capitalised 
at their cost.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative 
expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Software costs 5 years
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where 
appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost as 
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and 
takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised, without 
discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes 
which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, 
except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Leasing
Annual payments under operating leases are charged to the 
profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Post-retirement benefits
The company participates in group operated defined 
contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. The assets  
of the schemes are held separately from those of the company 
in independently administered funds. The company is unable to 
identify its share of the group defined benefit scheme’s 
underlying assets and liabilities and therefore accounts for it  
as a defined contribution scheme. The amounts charged against 
profits represent contributions payable to the schemes in respect 
of the accounting period. 87

Financial Statements Governance Business Review Overview
Share-based payments
The fair value of equity-settled employee share option grants is calculated at grant date. The resulting cost for company employees 
is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the plans. The company has also offered share options to key 
management in other group companies and this cost has been included as part of the company’s investment in subsidiaries.  
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due  
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Cash flow statement
The company has not presented a separate cash flow statement in accordance with the exemption provided by FRS 1 (Revised),  
as its cash flows are included within the cash flows of the group, as set out elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Certain of the company’s employees participate in the Spectris Pension Plan, a UK multi-employer defined benefit scheme.  
Further details of the group’s scheme are contained in Note 9 to the group’s consolidated financial statements. The company is 
unable to identify its share of the Plan’s underlying assets and liabilities and therefore accounts for the scheme as a defined 
contribution scheme. In accordance with the Schedule of Contributions in place for the Spectris Pension Plan for the financial year 
ending 31 December 2008, employer contributions are 13% p.a. of pensionable salaries. The actuary certified in 2006 that this level 
of contributions was adequate for the purposes of the minimum funding requirement. Contributions paid in 2008 to the Spectris 
Pension Plan were £1.7m (2007: £1.7m) and the amounts outstanding at the year end were £0.1m (2007: £0.1m). Contributions paid 
in 2008 to defined contribution plans were £0.4m (2007: £0.4m).

an increased workload for clients in the natural resources sector and Kurt Salmon

Chairman’s statement
“ MCG is in a strong financial position and we will continue to focus attention 
on promoting profitable growth in our business and delivering value to our 
shareholders. Recognising this, the Board is proposing to increase the dividend 
for the year to 0.75p per share and will continue to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy.”
For 2011 we reported a 
12% increase in revenue and 
a 22% increase in underlying 
operating profit 
Strong operating cash flows 
have helped to nearly halve

What we do
Management Consulting Group PLC operates through two distinct independently 
managed practices, Alexander Proudfoot and Kurt Salmon, which are leaders in their 
fields. This structure has created highly focused businesses and provides a firm 
foundation for delivering profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value.
Alexander Proudfoot provides 
tangible and sustainable 
operational improvements for 
its clients, delivering improved 
performance at a scale and speed 
that they would not achieve 
on their own. It does not just 
identify opportunities; it actually 
implements the required changes, 
working with management and 
front‑line personnel, side‑by‑side, 
until the client achieves the 
projected financial benefits.

Business review
Chief Executive’s review
“ MCG has delivered significant growth in both revenue and profit in 2011, as well 
as strong operational cash generation. The results for the year as a whole are 
encouraging and demonstrate the resilience of our two businesses in an uncertain 
economic environment.”
MCG is a global business and more 
than 95% of 2011 revenue came from 
projects delivered outside the UK
The 22% increase in underlying 
operating profit reflects an 
impressive performance by 
Alexander Proudfoot 
The first half saw signs of recovery 
but weaker economic indicators 
in the second half affected 
business confidence
Strong cash generation 
has delivered a substantial 
reduction in net debt
Share awards made to 
employees during 2011 are 
conditional on retention and 
financial performance

“ MCG has a strong position 
in its key European 
markets, and an 
established position and 
brand in North America 
where economic growth 
is continuing. European 
markets may see little 
growth in 2012 but we 
are well placed to exploit 
opportunities for growth 
in geographies and sectors 
where economic prospects 
are more favourable.”

24 Annual report and accounts 2011
Directors’ report
The directors present their annual report, incorporating their reports on corporate governance, audit and risk, and remuneration, 
together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011. These will be laid before the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2012.
Activity
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of professional services. Details of the Group’s principal subsidiary undertakings, 
through which it carries out its activities, are set out in note 26 to the financial statements.
Business Review
The Company is required to set out in this report a fair review of the business of the Group during the financial year ended 
31 December 2011, the position of the Group at the end of the financial year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group (known as a “Business Review”). The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review can be found 
in the Risks and Uncertainties and Financial Review sections of the annual report.
Group results
The Group’s profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2011 amounted to £23,151,000 (2010: £14,328,000).
Dividends
An interim dividend of 0.20p per share was paid on 6 January 2012. The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 0.55p 
(2010: interim dividend of 0.15p; final dividend of 0.30p) per share to be paid on 2 July 2012 to shareholders on the register on 18 May 2012. 
Directors
The names and brief biographical details of the current directors are shown on pages 22 and 23. During 2011 Mr Barber, Mr Stagg, 
Mr Povey, Mr Carvalho, Mr Mahjoub, Mr Capello, Mr Ferriss, Mr Di Spiezio Sardo, Mr Simon and Mr Waldron held office throughout 
the year. Mr Lopinto and Baroness Cohen stood down as directors on 19 April 2011 and Mr Wietecha stood down on 30 September 2011. 
The Articles require that only one third of the directors shall retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting together with any 
directors appointed since the last Annual General Meeting. However, the Board has agreed that directors should stand for re‑election 
every year and, accordingly, all the directors will retire from the Board at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will offer 
themselves for re‑election.
During and at the end of the financial year no director had a material interest in any contract of significance to which the Company or any 
subsidiary was a party. Information on the directors’ interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. Related party transactions are disclosed in note 25.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy, in relation to all of its suppliers, is to agree the terms of payment when first contracting with the supplier and to 
abide by those terms provided that it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed 
terms and conditions. The Group does not follow any code on payment practice but operates a prompt payment policy on settling 
invoices. The amount of trade creditors shown in the balance sheet at 31 December 2011 represents 29 days of average purchases 
during the year (2010: 31 days) for the Company and 31 days (2010: 29 days) for the Group.
Substantial share interests
As at 5 March 2012 (the latest practicable date prior to the issue of this report), the Company had been notified, in accordance with 
Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial Services Authority, of the following interests in the 
ordinary share capital of the Company:

Capital structure
Information on the Group’s capital structure and its share schemes is set out in note 19.
Corporate governance
Information on the Company’s corporate governance is set out on pages 28 to 30.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group is committed to making a positive social and economic contribution in all the places it operates. This is driven by the Board. 
Emphasis is placed on ensuring that we continue to create and maintain trust in and loyalty to our Group by all our stakeholders.
The Board is responsible for the social, environmental and ethical (“SEE“) impact of the Group’s business and ensures that any risks 
arising are being managed appropriately. On an annual basis the Board assesses the Group’s exposure to SEE matters based on 
feedback from management. Overall, for the current year the Board has concluded that the Group’s exposure to SEE risks is limited, 
primarily due to the nature of its operations. Further information on the environmental and ethical policies adopted is provided below.
The Group has an active corporate social responsibility agenda which covers work with various non‑profit organisations and 
government ministries. 
Environmental policy
The Group’s environmental policy aims to minimise, where practical, the Group’s impact on the environment. 
As a group of professional services companies, the Group’s business has a relatively small impact on the environment. Nevertheless, 
the Board recognises the quality of the environment in which it operates is a concern for its stakeholders and others in the community 
and consequently is essential to the long term financial performance of the Group.
As a member of the FTSE4Good index, the Group ensures that all laws, regulations and official guidelines in the countries in which 
it operates are complied with. The Group is also a member of the United Nations Global Compact.
The Group’s Environmental Officer is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of areas where the Group could have an impact on 
the environment and takes steps to reduce this impact. These are detailed below. Reviews of the quantitative impact on the environment 
in these and other areas will continue to be undertaken to enable the Group’s environmental performance to be assessed and further improved.
Energy use and climate change
Carbon dioxide is one of the most significant air pollutants as a by‑product of energy consumption and is the major contributor to the 
“enhanced greenhouse gas effect“. We continue with the programme to measure the amount of electricity being used in our largest 
offices, to identify where reductions can be made in the future.
Due to the nature of the business and the need for employees with appropriate experience to work on projects, employees regularly 
need to travel to clients’ sites. The Group’s employees are encouraged, wherever possible, to share private road transport or use 
public transport.
Whilst further improvements are being targeted, the Group continues to progress in reducing energy consumption. The principal 
methods adopted by the Group to reduce energy consumption are as follows:
 — installing automatic power‑off systems on lights and certain equipment;
 — using energy‑efficient lighting;
 — using time‑switches on air conditioning systems; and
 — reducing travel by making use of video conferencing facilities.
Waste and recycling
The increase in waste generated is a serious problem in many of the countries in which the Group operates. The shortage of new landfill 
sites in these countries is well documented, as are the potential health impacts and carbon dioxide emissions caused by landfill sites. Management Consulting Group PLC
26 Annual report and accounts 2011
Directors’ report continued
Corporate social responsibility continued
Health and safety
The Group is committed to achieving and maintaining the highest standards of health, safety and welfare for its employees throughout 
the world. Employees are one of the Group’s most important assets and their health and safety is critical to business performance by 
reducing the costs associated with workplace injuries and ill health.
The Group aims to comply with all laws, regulations and official guidelines relating to health and safety in all its offices throughout 
the world. Due to the many different locations of the Group’s offices, the Group does not have a single detailed worldwide policy. 
Instead, it is the responsibility of a senior employee in each office to ensure that his or her office meets the high standards for which 
the Group aims.
Group ethics
The Group subscribes to the Association of Management Consulting Firms’ Code of Ethics (available at www.amcf.org) and, in the UK, 
the Code of Ethics of the UK Management Consultancies Association (available at www.mca.org.uk).
The codes of ethics conform to regulatory and legislative initiatives and assure the users of consulting services that members are 
publicly committed to providing the highest quality work. 
Whistleblowing
The Board considers the financial management team as holding an important role in corporate governance, having both the responsibility 
and authority to protect, balance and preserve the interests of all stakeholders. 
All employees can voice their concerns about any unethical behaviour through a confidential internal whistleblowing process.
Employees
The Group operates in a number of countries and its employment practices vary to meet local requirements and best practices within 
a framework established by the Group.
It is Group policy that all people be treated with dignity and respect. The Group is committed to providing and fostering a working environment 
that is free from harassment, discrimination, victimisation or bullying and where all employees are treated with dignity and respect.
Our ability to operate as a high‑performing organisation depends on our inclusion of people who come from diverse backgrounds. 
It is Group policy to ensure equal opportunities exist without discrimination for all employees, irrespective of their race, colour, creed, 
religion, gender, ancestry, citizenship, sexual preference, marital status, national origin, age, pregnancy, disability or any other reason 
prohibited by the laws of the individual countries in which it operates. This applies with respect to recruitment, promotion, compensation, 
transfer, retention, training and other employment actions. In South Africa the Group operates positive discrimination in respect of 
previously disadvantaged individuals. Wherever possible the employment of members of staff who become disabled will be continued 
and appropriate training and career development will be offered.
One of the Group’s key objectives is to achieve a shared commitment by all employees to the success of the business. We recognise 
the importance of employees understanding the Group strategy, the businesses’ priorities and the expectations of individuals. Presentations 
on strategy and priorities are made at meetings of employees and are supplemented by communications from the Group and divisional

Auditor
Each director who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as the director is aware:
 — there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 — the director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution to re‑appoint them will be proposed

Corporate governance
Chairman’s overview
The maintenance of effective corporate governance is a key priority for the Board. We have welcomed the recent changes in the UK 
Corporate Governance code and we were an early adopter of the annual re‑election of all directors.  
We have a diverse Board with representatives from a number of nationalities and a variety of business backgrounds.  They bring a 
wide range of experience and knowledge to bear in developing strategy, challenging management and bringing fresh perspectives.  
Each year the Board holds certain of its meetings at its main business locations abroad, giving the Board the opportunity to meet 
local management. During the course of the year we reduced the size of the Board and improved the balance between executive and 
non‑executive directors. In the medium term we will look to recruit new non‑executive directors who can further broaden the Board’s 
diversity, both in terms of their business background – industry and geographical markets – and gender.
The Board has considered carefully the requirements of Section 1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) and has taken 
various actions in light of its guidance. The Company has complied with the Code throughout the year.
Board of Directors
From 1 January 2011 until 19 April 2011 the Board comprised the non‑executive Chairman, six executive directors and six non‑executive 
directors. On 19 April 2011, Mr Lopinto stood down as an executive director and Baroness Cohen stood down as a non‑executive director. 
On 30 September 2011, Mr Wietecha stood down as an executive director. Thus, from 20 April 2011 until 30 September 2011 there 
were five executive and six non‑executive directors, and from 1 October 2011 until the year end, there were four executive directors 
and six non‑executive directors. The Code requires that smaller companies should have at least two independent non‑executive 
directors and the Company complied with this aspect. The Company also complied with the requirement to separate the roles 
of Chairman and Chief Executive.
Mr Ferriss, Mr Simon and Mr Waldron are considered to be independent non‑executive directors.
The roles of the Board and the management are clearly defined. Throughout the year, the roles of Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior 
Independent Director were separated and clearly defined in writing. The terms and conditions of appointment of the non‑executive 
directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and will also be available at the Annual General Meeting.
The Board is satisfied that each of the non‑executive directors committed sufficient time during 2011 for the fulfilment of their duties 
as directors of the Company. None of the non‑executive directors has any conflict of interest which has not been disclosed to the Board.
The number of Board and Committee meetings eligible for attendance and attended by each of the directors during the year was

On appointment, directors are provided with formal details of their responsibilities under legislation applicable to a company listed in 
the UK. Changes to such legislation and other relevant factors affecting the Group are communicated to all directors. Newly appointed 
directors are also required to participate in an induction programme in order to familiarise themselves with the Group’s businesses. 
Regular presentations are made to the Board by senior management in order to refresh and expand this knowledge.
All directors are authorised to obtain, at the Company’s expense and subject to the Chairman’s approval, independent legal or other 
professional advice where they consider it necessary. All directors have access to the Company Secretary who oversees their ongoing 
training and development needs. Management Consulting Group PLC

Election and re‑election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association contain detailed rules for the appointment and retirement of directors. There is a formal 
procedure in place to select and appoint new directors to the Board. These directors are required to retire at the next Annual General 
Meeting, but can offer themselves for re‑election by shareholders. Under the Articles, all directors are required to submit themselves 
for re‑election at intervals not exceeding three years. However, the Board agreed that, with effect from the 2011 Annual General 
Meeting, directors should stand for re‑election every year.
The Board annually evaluates the performance of individual directors, the Board as a whole and its Committees. This review comprises 
structured interviews with each director carried out by the Company Secretary followed by the presentation of the results of this process 
to the Board and individual discussions with the Chairman. The results of the evaluation were approved by the Chairman and an agreed 
plan of action produced. The results are specifically taken into account when considering the re‑appointment of directors.
Operation of the Board
The Board meets regularly. Six meetings were held during 2011. All members of the Board are supplied, in advance of meetings, with 
appropriate information covering matters which are to be considered. The Chairman met throughout the course of the year with the 
non‑executive directors in the absence of the executive directors.
There is a formal schedule of decisions reserved for the Board. This includes approval of the following: the Group’s strategy; the annual 
operating plan and budget; the annual and interim financial statements; significant transactions; major capital expenditures; risk 
management policies; the authority levels vested in management; Board appointments; and remuneration policies. As described below, 
the review of certain matters is delegated to Board Committees, which make recommendations to the Board in relation to those 
matters reserved for the Board as a whole.
Audit and Risk Committee
Details of the membership, role and operation of the Audit and Risk Committee are provided in the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Code recommends that the Committee should comprise at least two members and that all members should be independent 
non‑executive directors. The Committee comprised four independent non‑executive directors until 19 April 2011 and three independent 
non‑executive directors thereafter.
Financial matters
The Group has adopted a code of ethical conduct applicable to the Board and all members of the finance function. In addition, it has 
a whistleblowing policy whereby procedures exist that allow employees to report any financial wrongdoing that they believe may 
have occurred.
The Board has also defined which services can be purchased from the Group’s auditor and has adopted procedures in respect of 
the purchase of these services to minimise the risk of an actual or perceived conflict of interest. For similar reasons, the Board has 
adopted a policy in respect of hiring staff from the auditor who have been involved in the Group’s audit. 
Nominations Committee 
The membership of the Committee during 2011 was:
 — Mr Stephen Ferriss  (Chairman, member since 2008)
 — Mr Alan Barber  (Member since 2005)
 — Baroness Cohen  (Member until 19 April 2011, member since 2003)
 — Mr Andrew Simon  (Member since 2006)
 — Mr Julian Waldron  (Member since 2009)
 — Mr Marco Capello  (Member since 18 June 2010)
The Committee’s purpose is to consider future appointments to the Board and the succession policy for key management positions. 
The Nominations Committee adopted formal terms of reference dated 14 March 2003. These were updated on 2 March 2007 and are 
available from the Group’s website (www.mcgplc.com) or the Company Secretary upon request.
The Code recommends that a majority of the members of the Nominations Committee should be independent non‑executive directors. 
The majority of the Committee was independent throughout 2011. Management Consulting Group PLC

Remuneration Committee
Details of the membership, role and operation of the Remuneration Committee are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Code recommends that the Committee should comprise at least two independent non‑executive directors. The Committee 
comprised four independent and one non‑independent non‑executive directors from the beginning of the year until 19 April 2011 
and three independent and one non‑independent non‑executive directors thereafter.
Relations with investors and the Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting gives all shareholders the opportunity to communicate directly with the Board. During the year, the 
directors are available to respond to enquiries from investors on the Group’s operations. Effective communication with fund managers, 
institutional investors and analysts is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as performance, policy and strategy.
During the year, the executive directors hold discussions with major shareholders. The Chairman is available to shareholders if there 
are matters that they wish to discuss with him directly. Announcements are made to the London Stock Exchange and the business 
media concerning trading and business developments to provide wider dissemination of information. 
Registered shareholders are sent copies of both the annual report and accounts and the half‑year report. The Group’s website 
www.mcgplc.com also contains information relevant to investors.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Finance Director met with key shareholders throughout the year and in particular around 
the time of the full year results and the half‑year results.
The notice convening the Annual General Meeting to be held on 19 April 2012 is contained in the circular to shareholders.
Internal controls
The Company, as required by the Listing Rules, has complied with the Code provisions on internal control having established the 
procedures necessary to implement the revised Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control issued in October 2005 (The Turnbull Committee 
Report) and by reporting in accordance with that guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role 
of management is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company which is in accordance 
with the guidance set out in The Turnbull Committee Report and has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval 
of the annual report and accounts. This process, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, is as follows:
 — the Group’s management operates a risk management process which identifies the key risks facing the business and reports to the 
Audit and Risk Committee and the Board on how those risks are being managed. This is based on a risk register produced by executive 
management which identifies those key risks, the probability of those risks occurring, their impact if they do occur and the actions being 
taken to manage those risks to the desired level. This risk register is discussed at the Audit and Risk Committee and Board meetings 
on a regular basis and regular monitoring reports are presented to the Board. The management of these risks is monitored by the 
internal audit function;
 — large acquisitions and capital projects require Board approval; and 
 — there is regular communication between management and the Board on matters relating to risk and control.
The Board has established a strong control framework within which the Group operates. This contains the following key elements:
 — organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting requirements;
 — defined expenditure and contract authorisation levels;
 — on‑site, video and teleconferencing reviews of operations, covering all aspects of each business, are conducted by Group 
executive management on a regular basis throughout the year;
 — the financial reporting and information systems which comprise: a comprehensive annual budget which is approved by the Board; 
weekly reports of key operating information; cash flow and capital expenditure reporting; monthly results and forward performance 
indicators which are measured against the annual budget and the prior year’s results. Significant variances are reviewed by the 
Board and executive management and action is taken as appropriate. The forecast for the year is revised when necessary;
 — Group tax and treasury functions are coordinated centrally. There is weekly cash and treasury reporting to Group management 
and periodic reporting to the Board on the Group’s tax and treasury positions; and
 — internal audits are performed by Group’s internal audit function.
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings 
or weaknesses which it deemed to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been 
deemed appropriate. Management Consulting Group PLC

Report of the Audit and Risk Committee
This report describes the membership and operation of the Audit and Risk Committee.
Membership
During 2011 the membership of the Committee was:
 — Mr Stephen Ferriss  (Chairman until 19 April 2011, member since 2006)
 — Mr Julian Waldron (Chairman from 20 April 2011, member since 2008)
 — Baroness Cohen  (Member until 19 April 2011, member since 2003)
 — Mr Andrew Simon (Member since 2008)
Mr Ferriss is a banker and Mr Waldron is the chief financial officer of a French listed company. Both are considered to have recent and 
relevant financial experience. The profiles and qualifications of the Committee members are shown on pages 22 and 23. The Committee 
met five times during the year. The external auditor attended three of the meetings and the Committee met privately with them on 
one occasion.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is, in summary:
 — to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance, reviewing significant financial reporting  judgements contained in them;
 — to review the Group’s internal financial controls and to review the Group’s internal control and risk management systems;
 — to monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function;
 — to make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, re‑appointment and removal of the external auditor 
and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor;
 — to review and monitor the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process; and
 — to develop and implement policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non‑audit services, and to report to the Board, 
identifying any matters in respect of which it considers that action or improvement is needed and recommending the steps to be taken.
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed and updated with effect from 19 April 2011 to conform with current best practice 
and the revised guidance from the Financial Reporting for Audit Committees issued in December 2010. They have since been reviewed 
again and no changes were deemed necessary. They are available on the Group’s website (www.mcgplc.com) as well as in hard copy 
format from the Company Secretary. 
Operation of the Committee
The Committee has discharged its responsibilities during the year as follows:
 — Financial statements. The Committee reviewed the interim and full‑year financial statements. Presentations were made by management 
and the auditor about the key technical and judgemental matters relevant to the financial statements. The Committee was satisfied 
that it was appropriate for the Board to approve the financial statements.
 — Internal financial control and risk management systems. The Committee reviewed the register of Group risks prepared by management, 
recommendations made by the external auditor and internal audit reports. A review of the register of Group risks was carried out 
by internal audit. The Committee was satisfied that it was appropriate for the Board to make the statements regarding internal 
controls included in the Corporate Governance Statement. 
 — External auditor. The Committee has considered the independence of the external auditor and is satisfied that independence 
has been maintained. As part of this year’s decision to recommend the re‑appointment of the auditor, the Committee has taken 
into account the tenure of the auditor who was appointed in 2001. There are no contractual obligations that act to restrict the 
Committee’s choice of external auditor. As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities outlined above, 
the Committee has recommended to the Board that the external auditor be re‑appointed. It is policy that the auditor shall not 
provide any services that would potentially result in them auditing the result of their own work or which are prohibited under 
the US Sarbanes‑Oxley Act. The Committee pre‑approves any material permitted non‑audit engagements. Regular reports were 
presented of fees paid to the external auditor in order to ensure that the relationship between non‑audit fees and audit fees was 
not inappropriate. The Committee reviewed the external audit plan proposed by the auditor and participated in the review of 
the quality of the service that they provided.
 — Internal audit function. The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Committee, which reviewed and approved the annual internal audit 
work programme and reviewed all internal audit reports prepared in the year. The internal audit function also assists executive 
management on special projects.
The Chairman of the Committee reported to the Board on the Committee’s activities after each meeting, identifying relevant matters 
requiring communication to the Board and recommendations on the steps to be taken. Management Consulting Group PLC

Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and it describes how the Board has applied 
the principles relating to directors’ remuneration set out in the Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the annual report and accounts will be approved. 
The Act requires the auditor to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state 
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report 
has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
During 2011 the membership of the Committee was:
 — Mr Andrew Simon  (Chairman, member since 2006)
 — Mr Marco Capello (Member since 18 June 2010)
 — Baroness Cohen  (Member until 19 April 2011, member since 2003)
 — Mr Stephen Ferriss (Member since 2008)
 — Mr Julian Waldron (Member since 2008)
The Committee reviews and determines, on behalf of the Board, the salary, benefits and pension packages of the Chairman and the 
executive directors. The Committee also reviews, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration packages of the highest paid executives 
and the Company Secretary. Fees for the non‑executive directors are determined annually by the Board based on market information 
obtained from external surveys. The terms of reference for the Committee were last reviewed and updated in December 2010 and 
are available on the Group’s website (www.mcgplc.com).
In determining the directors’ remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted the Chairman save in relation to his own remuneration. 
No director is involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee makes use of published reports on directors’ remuneration 
packages and advice from independent external advisers is obtained when required. New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Corporation) 
is the independent adviser to the Remuneration Committee. Aon Corporation also provided insurance broking services to the Company 
during the year but the Committee consider this does not prejudice New Bridge Street’s independence. New Bridge Street provides 
advice to the Remuneration Committee on the operation of the Company’s incentive schemes and the remuneration of executive 
and non‑executive directors as well as employee remuneration and may also advise the Committee on other matters within the 
Committee’s terms of reference.
The Board carried out a review which included the Remuneration Committee which deemed the operation of the Committee 
to be satisfactory.
Remuneration policy
Compensation packages for executive directors are set by reference to individual and corporate performance, individual competencies, 
external market comparisons and remuneration levels below Board level in the Group. The package for each executive director 
currently comprises a basic salary, an annual bonus scheme, share incentives, pension contributions and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee has regard to associated risks arising throughout the Company when setting remuneration. In particular, 
the Committee ensures that the targets attached to variable pay schemes are set so that they do not encourage any undue risk‑taking 
by executives.
In order to align the interests of executive directors with the interests of shareholders, a significant proportion of executive directors’ 
remuneration is performance‑related through the use of annual bonus and share incentive schemes.
Base salaries
The Committee’s policy is to set the base salaries of each executive director at levels that reflect their roles, experience and practices 
in the employment market whilst ensuring that they take account of the pay and employment conditions of other employees within 
their business units. Pension and associated costs are also taken into account. 
There have been no increases in base salary in the year. Mr Stagg’s base salary of £300,000 per annum did not increase on his 
becoming Chief Executive in 2010 and has not increased since his appointment to the Board on 21 October 2009. Mr Povey’s base 
salary of £200,000 per annum was last increased on 16 December 2010. Mr Carvalho’s base salary of US$1,000,000 was last increased 
on 1 July 2008. Mr Mahjoub’s base salary of €500,000 was last increased on 1 January 2010.
Following the 2012 salary review, the Committee has decided not to make any increases to executive directors’ base salaries, but will 
review the Chief Executive’s and Finance Director’s base salaries on the anniversaries of their appointment. Management Consulting Group PLC

Annual bonus scheme
For 2011, Mr Stagg, Mr Povey and Mr Carvalho are entitled to an annual bonus that comprises current and deferred elements. 
The Group’s and individual businesses’ budgeted profits from operations (adjusted for subsequent acquisitions or disposals) are 
used as the benchmarks for the financial performance in relation to both elements of the scheme.
Under the current element, each director is entitled to an amount equal to up to 125% of basic salary. The amount payable is primarily 
determined by reference to the financial performance of the Group (and business, where relevant) with a smaller element of 20% of 
base salary being dependent on the achievement of detailed individual short and medium term performance criteria. 
Under the deferred element, an amount of up to 75% of base salary may be earned, subject to the achievement of a sliding scale 
of profit from operations targets which are above budget. Two‑thirds of this second element will be payable in cash three years after 
the end of the relevant financial year. The remaining third will be used to acquire shares in the Company which will also be transferred 
to the executive director three years after the end of the relevant financial year. However, both the deferred cash and share elements 
of the annual bonus will normally be forfeited if the executive director ceases employment with the Group during that three year period.
The financial performance parts of Mr Stagg’s and Mr Povey’s bonuses are related to the financial performance of the Group. The financial 
performance parts of Mr Carvalho’s bonus are related one quarter to the financial performance of the Group and three quarters to the 
financial performance of the business for which he is responsible, Alexander Proudfoot.
The budget for 2011 was set at 26% above the actual result for 2010. The actual underlying profit from operations of the Group 
for 2011 amounted to £28.3m before non‑recurring items and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, an increase of £5.0m 
(22%) compared with the prior year. For the Group, the financial performance criteria were partially met in relation to the current 
element of the scheme but not met in relation to the deferred element. For Alexander Proudfoot, the financial performance criteria 
were fully met in relation to the current element of the scheme and partially met in relation to the deferred element. As a result, 
89.3%, 89.3% and 101.1% of salary entitlement arises as a current bonus in respect of financial performance for Mr Stagg, Mr Povey 
and Mr Carvalho, respectively. The balance of the current bonus amounts to 20.0% of salary in the case of Mr Stagg, 20.0% of salary 
in the case of Mr Povey and 14.4% of salary in the case of Mr Carvalho and reflects the Committee’s assessment of the achievement 
of personal performance objectives. The current bonuses payable are £327,900 for Mr Stagg, £218,600 for Mr Povey, and 
US$1,154,700 (£718,828) for Mr Carvalho.
The bonuses due within the second element, which are deferred for three years, are a cash bonus of US$156,733 (£97,570) and a share 
bonus of US$78,367 (£48,785) for Mr Carvalho. No deferred bonuses are due to Mr Stagg or Mr Povey.
Mr Mahjoub, who was an employee of Kurt Salmon throughout the year, has been assessed for a bonus solely in respect of his work 
for that business based on the principles used in that business. Mr Mahjoub has been awarded a current bonus of €200,000 (£173,747) 
and a deferred bonus of €150,000 (£130,310) payable in shares, with vesting to occur on or around 31 May 2014, subject to his continued 
employment. Mr Wietecha, who was an employee of Kurt Salmon until October 2011, received a bonus of US$80,000 (£49,623) based 
on the principles used in that business. These bonuses have been reviewed by the Committee and agreed. 
The Committee has agreed that the annual bonus cap of twice salary already applying to Mr Stagg, Mr Povey and Mr Carvalho should 
apply to all executive directors’ annual bonuses.
For 2012, bonus arrangements will be broadly similar to those for 2011.
Share incentives
The Group has one share incentive scheme in which directors are currently eligible to participate, the Management Consulting Group 
2008 Performance Share Plan (the “2008 Performance Share Plan“).
There was a further scheme under which directors could participate, the Management Consulting Group PLC 1998 Executive Share 
Option Scheme (the “1998 Scheme“), which expired in the year. The 1998 Scheme (under which market value options are granted) was 
extended by the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 30 August 2006 to 18 June 2011 and it expired on that date. No awards were 
made to directors or staff under the 1998 Scheme during the year and no further awards will be made under the Scheme. All options 
issued under the scheme had lapsed by the end of the year.
The 2008 Performance Share Plan
The 2008 Performance Share Plan was approved at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2008 and will expire on 22 April 2018. 
It is designed to motivate directors and senior employees, whilst retaining them in the Group’s employment, by granting awards to 
acquire ordinary shares in the Company. 
Under the rules of the 2008 Performance Share Plan, an employee may not receive awards in any financial year over shares having 
a market value in excess of 100% of his annual base salary in that financial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment 
or retention, this limit may be increased to 200% of an employee’s annual base salary. Management Consulting Group PLC

Share incentives continued
The 2008 Performance Share Plan continued
The initial awards granted in 2008 were structured as conditional awards of free shares which would vest after three years provided 
the individual remained employed by the Group and the performance condition had been met. The performance condition was based 
on the compound annualised growth in adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) over a three year performance period. For these purposes, 
adjusted EPS will be calculated by excluding non‑recurring items, amortisation of intangibles and other items that the Committee 
considers appropriate. The adjusted EPS figure is based upon information in the annual report and accounts of the relevant year 
and is verified by the Audit and Risk Committee.
The vesting terms for these initial awards were as follows:
Compound annualised growth in adjusted EPS Percentage of the award that vests
Less than 6% 0%
At 6% 20%
At or more than 13% 100%
Between 6%–13% Straight‑line vesting between 20% and 100%
The adjusted EPS will be based on the results for the year preceding the year in which the award is made and the results for three years later.
Certain awards were made to participants below board level under the French schedule required to comply with the requirements 
of French tax and social security contributions legislation. This required the participants to hold their shares for a further two years 
after the vesting date, with certain exceptions.
During 2010, awards were made to Mr Stagg and Mr Povey. Mr Stagg’s award was made in part under the 2008 Plan and in part under 
a separate award agreement with the same terms as the 2008 Plan other than the award under the separate agreement can only be 
satisfied by the transfer of existing shares (other than treasury shares). These awards will vest in three years, subject to Mr Stagg’s 
and Mr Povey’s continued employment with the Company’s Group and the achievement of a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
performance condition set out in the table below: 
N S Stagg C J Povey
Date of grant 20 May 2010 22 December 2010
Share price at grant 24.5p 31.0p
20% vesting at TSR creation of 5.5p 6.0p
100% vesting at TSR creation of 35.5p 29.0p
Straight‑line vesting between 20% and 100%.
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Committee must be satisfied that the vesting level is warranted by the Company’s

The 2008 Performance Share Plan continued
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Committee must be satisfied that the vesting level is warranted by the Company’s 
underlying financial performance over the three year performance period.
The Committee believes these performance criteria are appropriate for the directors as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. 
The TSR calculation will be undertaken by a third party to ensure independent verification of the extent to which the performance 
conditions are met.
The Committee may set different performance conditions from those described above for future awards provided that, in the reasonable 
opinion of the Committee, the new targets are not materially less challenging in the circumstances than those for the initial awards 
described above. 
At 31 December 2011, there were awards outstanding over new shares under the 2008 Performance Share Plan of 12.4 million, 
comprising 2.5% of the issued share capital. 
Shareholders have approved that the aggregate options and awards over new issue shares outstanding are limited to 12.8% of the fully 
diluted share capital. In addition, there are 0.3 million options that are not dilutive which were put in place as part of the Kurt Salmon 
Associates acquisition.
Pension arrangements
The Group contributes 17.5% of salary to defined contribution pension schemes of Mr Stagg’s and Mr Povey’s choice. Bonuses and other 
payments to directors are not pensionable. The Group contributes to the US 401(k) retirement provisions for Mr Carvalho. Mr Mahjoub 
does not participate in a defined contribution scheme.
Other benefits
Benefits vary according to the employing country of the executive director but may comprise some or all of the following: a car 
(or car allowance), insurances for life, personal accident, disability, permanent health and family medical cover.
Service contracts
No director has a service contract containing more than a one year notice period or with pre‑determined compensation provisions 
upon termination exceeding one year’s salary and benefits. It is the Company’s policy that, except where prescribed by law, there 
should be no automatic entitlement to bonuses or share‑based payments in the event of an early termination.
Mr Stagg and Mr Povey have contracts with the Company which either party is able to terminate by giving twelve months’ notice. 
Mr Carvalho and Mr Mahjoub each have an appointment letter in respect of their role as a director of the Company which may be 
terminated with no notice. They also have employment contracts with Group companies. Mr Carvalho has a contract with a Group 
company which either party is able to terminate with twelve months’ notice. Mr Mahjoub has a contract with a Group company 
which either party is able to terminate by giving three months’ notice. Mr Stagg’s and Mr Povey’s contracts continue until age 65. 
Mr Mahjoub’s contract continues until the mandatory retirement age as specified under French employment legislation. Mr Wietecha 
and Mr Lopinto had appointment letters in respect of their roles as directors of the Company which could be terminated with no notice. 
Mr Wietecha had, and Mr Lopinto has, employment contracts with Group companies which either party is able to terminate by giving 
four months’ and three months’ notice, respectively. Mr Lopinto’s contract continues until the mandatory retirement age as specified 
under French employment legislation. 
In the event of the early termination of an executive director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy that the amount of compensation 
(if any) paid to the executive director will be determined by reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time.
The dates of the appointment letters of the executive directors who served during the year are as follows:
Director Date of contract
N S Stagg 13 January 2010
C J Povey 1 March 2011
L H Carvalho 18 March 2008
M E Lopinto 12 January 2010
C Mahjoub 17 December 2009
M Wietecha 18 March 2008
External appointments
Mr Stagg is a director of Shinetrip Ltd and a non‑executive board member of Wedlake Bell LLP. The Company recognises that 
executive directors may be invited to become non‑executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden 
their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group and they are entitled to retain any fees earned. None of the other current 
executive directors held non‑executive directorships for which they were remunerated. Management Consulting Group PLC

Non‑executive directors – summary of entitlements
The Chairman receives a fee of £100,000 per annum. Each of the other non‑executive directors in office throughout 2011 received a fee 
of £35,000 per annum and an additional fee of £5,000 was paid for fulfilling the roles of Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Chairman of the Nominations Committee and Senior Independent Director. Mr Simon 
was appointed to the Supervisory Board of the Company’s French subsidiary, Kurt Salmon Associés France SA, from 1 January 2009 
and the Board has awarded him a fee of €5,000 for carrying out this role in 2011. The Board has concluded that this appointment does 
not affect Mr Simon’s independence as the role is considered an extension of his role as a non‑executive director. Mr Capello and 
Mr Di Spiezio Sardo, who were appointed to the Board as non‑executive directors on 18 June 2010, have voluntarily agreed not to 
take fees.
Apart from as noted above, the fees payable to the non‑executive directors were last revised with effect from 1 January 2007. Having 
reviewed market survey information, the Board concluded that there should be no general increase in the fees payable to the non‑executive 
directors. The non‑executive directors are not entitled to bonuses, benefits, pension contributions or to participate in any share scheme.
None of the non‑executive directors has a service contract and all are appointed for limited terms. None of the non‑executive directors 
is subject to notice periods and none has any rights to compensation on termination. The Company considers this approach appropriate 
in the current circumstances. The dates of the most recent letters of appointment of non‑executive directors are set out below:

Performance graph
The regulations require this report to contain a graph illustrating the Company’s performance compared with an appropriate “broad 
equity market index“ over the past five years. Management Consulting Group PLC is a constituent of the FTSE All‑Share Index and, 
accordingly, that index is considered the most appropriate form of “broad equity market index“ against which the Group’s performance 
should be plotted. Performance, as required by the legislation, is measured by TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid).
This graph looks at the value, by the end of 2011, of £100 invested in Management Consulting Group PLC on 31 December 2006 compared 
with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE All‑Share Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. Management Consulting Group PLC

Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the parent company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 — properly select and apply accounting policies;
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 — make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Chairman’s Statement, Business Review and the Financial Review contain certain forward‑looking statements with respect to 
the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of the Group. These statements and forecasts involve risk and uncertainty 
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause 
actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward‑looking statements and forecasts. 
The forward‑looking statements are based on the directors’ current views and information known to them at 7 March 2012. The directors 
do not make any undertaking to update or revise any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, 
or otherwise. Nothing in this report should be construed as a profit forecast.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 — the Management Report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Management Consulting Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Management Consulting Group PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2011 which comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group statement 
of changes in equity, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Company balance sheet, the Company statement 
of changes in equity, the Company cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 — the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 — the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements. Management Consulting Group PLC

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 — certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 — the directors’ statement, contained within the Financial Review, in relation to going concern; 
 — the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
 — certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2011
1. General information
Management Consulting Group PLC (the “Company“) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. 
The address of the registered office is given on page 92. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activity are set out in 
note 3 and in the Financial Review.
2. Significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and preceding year in dealing with items which are 
considered material in relation to the financial statements.
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Management Consulting Group PLC and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS“). The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards (“IAS“) regulation. 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, 
the Company has elected not to present its own income statement. Its separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the parent 
company’s financial statements are the same as those adopted in the consolidated financial statements except that the parent company’s 
investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Business Review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities and principal risks 
and uncertainties are described in the Financial Review. In addition, note 23 to the Group financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and its exposures to liquidity risk and credit risk.
As detailed under “Liquidity and capital resources” in the Financial Review, in December 2011 the Group put in place a new 
borrowing facility, which runs until July 2016. The new facility is a fully revolving credit facility under which the Group can draw 
up to £85m. The financial covenants for the new facility are materially unchanged from the previous facility (referred to in note 23). 
At 31 December 2011, £47.9m was drawn on its facility. The Group prepares regular business forecasts and monitors its projected 
compliance with its banking covenants, which are reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are adjusted for reasonable sensitivities that 
address the principal risks to which the Group is exposed. Consideration is given to the potential actions available to management 
to mitigate the impact of one or more of these sensitivities, in particular the discretionary nature of a significant amount of cost 
incurred by the Group. 
The Board has concluded that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility and remain covenant 
compliant for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements 
and accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2011 
Amendments to IAS 32 (October 2009) Classification of rights issues clarify the classification of right issues. This is not expected 
to have a significant impact on the Group.
IAS 24 (Revised November 2009) Related Parties Disclosures simplify the disclosure requirements for entities that are controlled, 
jointly controlled or significantly influenced by a government. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 1 (January 2010) Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First‑time Adopters add 
paragraph E3. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group. Management Consulting Group PLC

Standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and, unless otherwise stated, 
are mandatory for the Group’s future accounting periods. The Group has not early adopted these interpretations.
Amendments to IFRS 7 (October 2010) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets help users of financial statements evaluate the risk 
exposures relating to transfers of financial assets and the effect of those risks on an entity’s financial position and promote transparency 
in the reporting of transfer transactions, particularly those that involve securitisation of financial assets. This is not expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 1 (December 2010) Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First‑time Adopters provide guidance 
for entities emerging from severe hyperinflation either to resume presenting IFRS financial statements or to present IFRS financial 
statements for the first time. The amendments also provide relief for first‑time adopters of IFRSs from having to reconstruct transactions 
that occurred before their date of transition to IFRSs. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 12 (December 2010) Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets provide a practical approach for measuring deferred 
tax liabilities and deferred tax assets when investment property is measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property. 
This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IAS 27 (Revised May 2011) Separate Financial Statements contains accounting and disclosure requirements for investments 
in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when an entity prepares separate financial statements. This is not expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group.
IAS 28 (Revised May 2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures prescribes the accounting for investments in associates and 
sets out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. 
This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial 
statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements establishes principles for financial reporting by parties to a joint arrangement. This is not expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities applies to entities that have an interest in a subsidiary, a joint arrangement, an associate 
or an unconsolidated structured entity. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures 
about fair value measurements. This is not expected to have an impact on the Group.
IAS 19 (Revised June 2011) Employee Benefits prescribes the accounting and disclosure by employers for employee benefits. 
This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1 (June 2011) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income improve the consistency and clarity of the 
presentation of items of other comprehensive income (OCI). The amendments also highlight the importance that the Board places on 
presenting profit or loss and OCI together and with equal prominence. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. This is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 7 (December 2011) Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities amend the required disclosures 
to include information that will enable users of an entity’s financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting 
arrangements, including rights of set‑off associated with the entity’s recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities, 
on the entity’s financial position. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 32 (December 2011) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities delete paragraph AG38 and add 
paragraphs AG38A–AG38F. This is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The discussion and analysis of the Group’s financial position and results are based on the consolidated financial statements which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of the financial statements requires the development of estimates and judgements 
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and costs and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements and uncertainties and potentially result 
in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. It is believed that the Group’s critical accounting policies 
are limited to those described below. The Group’s management has discussed the development of the estimates and disclosures related 
to each of these matters with the Audit and Risk Committee. Management Consulting Group PLC

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(a) Basis of preparation continued
Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets
Under IFRS goodwill is capitalised and tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite lives are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives. Changes 
in assumptions used in the Group’s impairment reviews or estimated useful economic lives could have a material effect on the presentation 
of the Group’s financial position and results of operations. Details of the impairment test calculations are set out in note 10.
Employee benefits
Accounting for pensions and other post‑retirement benefits involves judgements about uncertain events, including, but not limited to, 
discount rates, life expectancy, future pay inflation, expected rate of return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates. Determination 
of the projected benefit obligations for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme and post‑retirement plans are important to the 
recorded amount of the benefit expense in the income statement and the net liability recorded in the balance sheet. Actuarial valuations 
are carried out annually. These determine the expense recorded in the income statement, the net liability recognised in the balance 
sheet, and items to be recorded in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. Details of the assumptions used 
are included in note 17 to the financial statements.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course 
of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences 
will impact the income tax and deferred tax liabilities and assets in the period in which such determination is made. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for services provided to third parties in the normal 
course of business. Revenue from services is recognised when the service has been provided and the right to consideration earned. 
When a service has been provided to third parties but no billing made, the amount receivable is estimated. This estimate is based 
on the nature of the service supplied and the terms of the contract. Any significant under‑estimation or over‑estimation of amounts 
receivable could have a material effect on the Group’s financial position and results of operations.
Provisions
The Group has onerous property leases which require judgement in terms of the provision being carried on the balance sheet. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its “subsidiaries”) made up to 31 December each year. For subsidiaries with non‑coterminous year ends true‑up adjustments to 
31 December are made to net assets and net profit where material. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. This generally accompanies 
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed 
of during the period are included in the Group income statement from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal, respectively. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those 
used by the Group. In the income statement the results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are classified as part of continuing 
operations from the date control is achieved. The results of subsidiaries until the date control is relinquished disposed of during the 
period are classified within discontinued operations in the income statement.
Intra‑group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except for non‑current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale which are recognised and measured 
at fair value less costs to sell. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Where applicable the consideration 
for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date 
fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period 
adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are 
accounted for in accordance with the relevant IFRS. The measurement period is the period from acquisition to the date the Group obtains 
complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year.  Management Consulting Group PLC
52 Annual report and accounts 2011
Notes to the financial statements continued

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(d) Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value 
of the recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity. If, after reassessment, 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the 
business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually 
for impairment or when there is indication of impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to equity prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss and disposal.
(e) Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets (e.g. customer relationships, trademarks, licences) are capitalised and amortised on a straight‑line basis 
over their useful economic lives. Purchased computer software licences are capitalised as intangible assets on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight‑line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, which do not exceed three years. Costs associated with developing software are capitalised as intangible assets when 
they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes 
are recognised as an expense as incurred. All other intangible assets are amortised from three years to a maximum of ten years 
depending on useful economic life.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation 
is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, less estimated residual value, by equal annual instalments over their 
estimated useful lives of between three and seven years.
(g) Leasehold improvements
Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight‑line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term 
of the related lease.
(h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or 
changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by cash‑generating units .
For goodwill Alexander Proudfoot and Kurt Salmon are treated as separate cash‑generating units.
(i) Dividend distribution
Dividends to holders of common shares are recognised as a liability in the Group and parent company’s financial statements in the 
period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and demand deposits, and short term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, which are held 
for short term cash investment purposes.
(k) Financial liabilities
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the balance sheet date. Management Consulting Group PLC
53 Annual report and accounts 2011
Overview Business review Governance Financials
2. Significant accounting policies continued
(l) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years or are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised 
for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which such 
differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
(m) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured 
at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted 
to present value where the effect is material.
(n) Own shares
The Company shares held by the employee benefits trust established in respect of certain share‑based awards are presented 
as a reduction of equity.
(o) Investments
The Group’s financial assets are classified as either at “fair value through profit and loss” (“FVTPL”) or “available‑for‑sale” (“AFS”) financial 
assets, depending on the nature and purpose of the financial assets, which is determined at the time of original recognition. Financial 
assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. AFS financial assets are measured at 
fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on AFS monetary items, are recognised 
directly in equity. When an AFS investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
The investments in the parent company balance sheet represent equity holdings in subsidiary companies. These are carried at cost 
less impaired amounts.
(p) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the 
Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount.
(q) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(r) Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight‑line basis over the lease term. Management Consulting Group PLC

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(s) Retirement benefit costs
For defined contribution pension schemes, the amount charged to the income statement represents the contributions payable in 
the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals 
or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to the income statement are the current service costs and gains and losses 
on settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement if the benefits have vested. 
If the benefits have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs. The interest costs and the 
expected return on assets are shown as a net cost in finance costs or net income within investment income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income. The US defined benefit 
pension scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group in separate trustee administered 
funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value. Liabilities in relation to the defined benefit schemes are measured on an 
actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality 
corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities. Actuarial valuations are obtained at each balance sheet date. 
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented on the face of the balance sheet.
(t) Share‑based payments
Share awards are made to selected employees on a discretionary basis. Awards are measured at their fair value (which is measured 
using the stochastic pricing model at the date of grant) and are recognised as an employee benefits expense on a straight‑line basis 
over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non‑market 
based vesting conditions, with a corresponding increase in the share compensation reserve. The expected life used in the valuation 
model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital 
(in respect of the nominal value) and share premium (in respect of the balance) when the options are exercised. Where options 
do not vest, a transfer is made from the share compensation reserve to retained earnings.
2010 cost of sales has been restated to include the impact of the cost of divisional share awards, consistent with 2011. For 2010 
this has decreased cost of sales from £179.8m to £178.4m, increased gross profit from £90.6m to £92.1m and increased underlying 
administrative expenses from £67.4m to £68.8m.
(u) Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are drawn up in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each entity are expressed in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. In preparing the financial statements, 
transactions in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Non‑monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at 
the date when the fair value was determined. Non‑monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign company 
are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement and retranslation of monetary items are included in the income statement for the period. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non‑monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement 
for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non‑monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised 
directly in equity. For such non‑monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
(including comparatives) are expressed in Sterling using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense 
items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rate for the period unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly 
during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences 
are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
(v) Non‑recurring items
Non‑recurring items are those significant credits or charges which, in the opinion of the directors, should be separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions that may give rise 
to non‑recurring items include charges for impairment, restructuring costs, acquisition costs and discontinued operations.
(w) Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services 
provided to third parties in the normal course of business net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Revenue from services 
is recognised when services have been provided and the right to consideration has been earned. If services have been provided to 
third parties but no billing has been made, estimates are made of the amounts receivable. These estimates are based on the nature 
of the services supplied and contract terms.  Management Consulting Group PLC

3. Operating segments
The Group’s operating segments are defined as the two professional services practices, Alexander Proudfoot and Kurt Salmon. Kurt Salmon 
was formed from the merger of Ineum Consulting and Kurt Salmon Associates with effect from 1 January 2011. The 2010 comparatives 
represent the aggregation of Ineum Consulting and Kurt Salmon Associates. This is the basis on which information is provided to the 
Board of Directors for the purposes of allocating certain resources within the Group and assessing the performance of the business. 
All revenues are derived from the provision of professional services.
Inter‑segmental sales are not significant.

(b) Revenue and underlying operating profit by operating segment
The two (2010: three) operating segments are combined into one reportable segment owing to similar underlying economic characteristics 
across the practices.
Not all significant non‑recurring items and financial items can be allocated to the practices and are therefore disclosed for the reportable 
segment as a whole. Assets and liabilities by practice are not reviewed by the Board and are therefore not disclosed.

Analysis of goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash‑generating units (“CGU“) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
Group
2011
 £’000 
2010
£’000
Cost
Ineum Consulting 121,645
Kurt Salmon Associates 95,222
Kurt Salmon 217,638 216,867
Alexander Proudfoot 45,563 46,797
 263,201 263,664
Kurt Salmon was formed following the merger of Ineum Consulting and Kurt Salmon Associates with effect from 1 January 2011 
and consequently now forms one CGU. The two merged businesses have been combined in the 2010 comparatives to be shown on 
the same basis as 2011. The goodwill associated with the acquisition of Vertical Retail Consulting Limited (note 27) has been added 
to the Kurt Salmon CGU on the basis that this business is managed as part of the Kurt Salmon division and trades under that name.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value‑in‑use calculations. The key assumptions for the value‑in‑use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to contribution during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using pre‑tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGU. Goodwill is tested against the value in use of operating segments on the basis that, given the integrated 
nature of the segments, it cannot be reasonably allocated to a lower level of CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets and the strategic plan approved by the Board for 
the next three years. The cash flows are extrapolated based on a steady long term EBITDA growth assumption of 2% and contribution 
rates that are consistent with past experience and industry norms. The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU 
are 7.65% for Kurt Salmon and 7.99% for Alexander Proudfoot and are based on the relevant regional weighted average cost of capital.
For both CGUs the carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2011 was significantly below the assessed recoverable amount. 
This was unchanged having taken into account reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.  Management Consulting Group PLC

The fair values above are based on the reports received at the balance sheet date from independent investment advisers. Dividends are 
recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
The fair values represent the principal amounts on which dividends are received. The timing of dividend receipts varies but generally 
they are received every six months or annually. Dividend income is recorded in the income statement.
Financial assets primarily comprise investments in corporate securities. The main risk associated with these investments is the risk 
of changes in market value. Investment performance is regularly monitored and, where appropriate, professional advice is obtained.

15. Tax assets and liabilities continued
Of the total deferred tax assets recognised at 31 December 2011 totalling £18.6m, amounts of £9.3m (2010: £8.9m) are in respect of 
US tax losses and £8.2m (2010: £9.0m) are in respect of other timing differences relating to the US. Based on forecast data, the Group 
believes there will be sufficient future taxable profits in the US to utilise the tax losses and the deductions arising from the reversal 
of the other US related deferred tax assets. The US tax losses expire after 20 years. A further potential deferred tax asset for US tax 
losses totalling £10.1m (2010: £19.0m) has not been recognised at 31 December 2011.
A deferred tax asset of £nil (2010: £nil) has been recognised at 31 December 2011 in respect of tax losses arising in non‑US jurisdictions. 
A deferred tax asset of £22.2m has not been recognised at 31 December 2011 in respect of non‑US tax losses totalling £82.2m 
(2010: £77.2m). Based on the current tax rules in the respective jurisdictions, non‑US losses are expected to expire as follows: 
£10.6m by the end of 2016, £5.1m by the end of 2021, £1.3m by the end of 2031, with the remaining £65.2m being carried forward 
indefinitely. The losses may be subject to adjustment on tax audit and it is uncertain if there will be sufficient future profits against 
which the losses can be offset.
Additionally, the Group has not recognised potential deferred tax assets totalling £4.1m (2010: £6.6m) in respect of temporary differences 
other than losses as it is uncertain if there will be sufficient future profits against which these items can be offset.
No deferred tax liability is recognised in relation to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences which would give rise to the liability and it is probable that they will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. The unrecognised deferred tax liability at 31 December 2011 of £1.1m (2010: £0.9m) is in respect of the unremitted 
earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as 
a result of tax due in overseas intermediate holding companies and dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions 
in which these subsidiaries operate.

17. Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes throughout the world. The total cost charged to income in 
respect of defined contribution schemes was £4,209,000 (2010: £3,458,000), representing contributions payable to these schemes 
by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes
In the United States the Group operates a closed defined benefit pension scheme and a closed unfunded plan which provides benefits 
in respect of post‑retirement medical costs. In France, the Group has a statutory unfunded post‑retirement benefit obligation. In Germany, 
the Group has an unfunded post‑retirement benefit obligation and, in the UK, a funded pension scheme, which is defined contribution 
with defined benefit underpin; both plans are closed to new employees. Actuarial valuations are obtained annually from independent 
qualified actuaries for each of the defined benefit arrangements.
The retirement benefit obligations are summarised below:
2011
 £’000 
2010
£’000
US defined benefit pension scheme 12,780 14,713
US post‑retirement medical plan 3,346 4,143
French statutory obligation 1,185 960
German obligation 5,863 5,889
23,174 25,705
A 1% change in the discount rates used in calculating the above obligations is estimated to affect the total retirement benefit obligation 
by £7,400,000 (2010: £7,300,000). The cumulative amount of other gains and losses recognised in the other comprehensive income 
since the date of transition to IFRS is £20,300,000 (2010: £19,200,000).
US schemes
The funded US defined benefits pension scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 February 2001 and further benefit 
accruals ceased for all members with effect from 31 December 2001. The US medical benefits plan applies only to certain former 
employees who retired prior to 30 September 1995 and to the post‑retirement medical costs of a small number of current and former 
employees who were employed at that date.
The principal assumptions used for the recent actuarial valuations were:

Collar Table. The discount rate assumption was changed to reflect changes in long term corporate bond yields. Expected contributions 
for 2012 are £2,635,000.

no entitlement to any dividend, (ii) whose voting rights are restricted to matters in connection with a winding up of the Company or 
abrogation of rights attaching to deferred shares and (iii) whose entitlement to a return of capital on a winding up of the Company 
is limited to the amount paid up on the deferred shares up to a maximum of 24p per share (but only after any and all ordinary shares 
then in issue shall have received payment in respect of such amount as is paid up or credited as paid up on those ordinary shares plus 
the payment in cash or specie of £10m for every 1p paid up or credited as paid up on those ordinary shares).

(c) Share awards 
Conditional awards
The Performance Share Plan was introduced during 2008. Any employee (including an executive director) of the Company and its 
subsidiaries is eligible to participate in the Plan at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”).
The Committee may grant awards as conditional shares, a nil (or nominal) cost option with a short exercise period or as forfeitable shares. 
The Committee may also decide to grant cash‑based awards of an equivalent value to share‑based awards or to satisfy share‑based 
awards in cash.
The vesting of awards is subject to performance conditions set by the Committee. Further details in respect of share awards made 
to directors can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 38.

The performance conditions for conditional awards granted during the year are either purely TSR based or a combination of share price 
performance and the achievement of other non‑market based financial targets. 
The fair value of conditional awards was determined using the stochastic valuation model. Expected volatility was assessed by considering 
the historic volatility of the Company’s share price. 
The inputs into the stochastic valuation model for the conditional share awards are as follows:

23. Financial instruments
Capital structure and treasury policies
The Group and Company are financed by shareholders’ equity and debt. The Group and Company’s capital structures are reviewed regularly 
to ensure that each remains relevant to the business and its planned development. There are established treasury policies that are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that they remain relevant to the business. The objective of the Group and Company’s treasury policies is to provide 
liquidity for the Group and Company at minimum risk and minimum cost and to hedge known financial exposures, when economically 
efficient. The main treasury risks faced by the Group and Company are country specific liquidity risks. The Group and Company’s 
objectives regarding interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk are, respectively, to minimise interest charges; 
minimise realised exchange losses on foreign currency transactions; ensure that the Group and Company only deal with creditworthy 
customers; and ensure that the Group and Company have sufficient resources available to meet their liabilities as they fall due. Investment 
of the Group and Company’s cash is made within policies that cover counterparty risk and liquidity. Surplus cash is invested generally 
in overnight deposits or commensurate with the maturity of loan drawdowns. Drawdowns under the old multi‑currency facilities allowed 
for interest maturities of up to six months in US Dollars and Euros and other major currencies. The Group’s term loan was drawn down 
in US Dollars and Euros to provide a natural hedge against the Group’s US Dollar and Euro earnings. The Group’s working capital facilities 
were drawn down in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling, the three major currencies in which the Group operates. The old bank facilities had 
two financial covenants, Group net debt and Group interest cover, with which the Group has complied throughout the year. As detailed 
under “Liquidity and capital resources” in the Financial Review, in December 2011 the Group put in place a new borrowing facility, which 
runs until July 2016. The new facility is a fully revolving multi‑currency credit facility for up to £85m which is subject to the same two 
financial covenants. The Group’s net debt position is closely monitored and there are effective cash forecasting procedures in place. 
These procedures involve careful review of future billing levels and new business prospects with operational management. 
Information on borrowings is shown in note 16. Management Consulting Group PLC

(ii) recognition of potential tax exposures, contractual exposures and employee matters. Management Consulting Group PLC
91 Annual report and accounts 2011
Overview Business review Governance Financials
27 Acquisitions continued
Deferred consideration of up to US$1.5m in cash and 1,350,000 MCG ordinary shares may be payable to the vendors in the event that 
the acquired business achieves certain performance targets in the period up to 2014. Management estimates that the deferred 
consideration will be payable in full and its fair value is therefore the fair value on at the date of acquisition (33.5p per share).
Goodwill arises because the value of the business resides in its assembled workforce, which is not required to be separately valued 
under IFRS. The fair value adjustments are provisional at the year end.
Net cash outflows in respect of the acquisition comprised cash paid on acquisition of £1.4m. The post‑acquisition contribution of VRC 
to the Group was £0.8m to revenue, £0.1m to profit from operations and £0.1m to earnings before interest and tax. Had the acquisition 
been made on 1 January 2011 the Group’s revenue for the period would have been £305.8m, profit from operations would have increased 
to £26.1m, and earnings before interest and tax would have been £26.0m.
Acquisition related costs amount to £0.2m and are included in non‑recurring items (note 4). Management Consulting Group PLC

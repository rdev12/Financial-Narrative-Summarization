Overview
We have had another year of strong 
progress at MITIE, with double-digit 
growth in revenue, earnings and 
dividends. This is an excellent 
performance against a UK economic 
backdrop that remains challenging 
and is a testament to the passion and 
hard work of our people. 
During the year, we have made excellent 
progress on our key strategic initiatives, 
continuing to invest in our people, 
technology, facilities management (FM) 
and energy propositions as well as our 
overseas capability. We were delighted 
to retain and expand contracts with  
Rolls-Royce and Vodafone which 
conﬁrmed our strategy of providing 
integrated FM and energy services. 
We also acquired Dalkia FM in Ireland 
and made a signiﬁcant investment in the 
fast developing decentralised energy 
market. We start the new ﬁnancial year 
in a strong and conﬁdent position.
Results
During the year, revenues grew by 10.0% 
to £1,891.4m (2010: £1,720.1m). Operating 
proﬁt before other items increased by 
16.5% to £108.3m (2010: £93.0m), reﬂecting 
an improved margin of 5.7% (2010: 5.4%). 
Proﬁt before tax and other items increased 
by 15.3% to £105.7m (2010: £91.7m). 
Earnings per share before other items 
grew by 15.9% to 22.6p per share (2010: 
19 .5p per share). 
We have retained our strong focus 
on cash, reporting cash inﬂows from 
operations of £102.5m (2010: £98.4m) 
for the year, which represents excellent 
conversion of EBITDA to cash of 
86.7% (2010: 95.2%). The balance sheet 
is extremely strong with net debt at the 
year end at 0.65 times EBITDA at £7 6.5m 
(2010: £86.6 m), after using debt funding 
of £7 .3m for an acquisition. 
We have recently reﬁnanced our bank 
facilities and now have committed 
bank facilities of £250m until September 
2015, which will be available for draw 
down after the AGM. We also drew down 
£100m equivalent of US Private Placement 
debt in December 2010, in a mix of notes 
which mature between seven and nine 
years. Both of these facilities leave us in 
a strong position to take advantage of 
value-creating acquisition opportunities 
as they arise. 
We continue to see strong growth in 
our order book, which increased by 
6.3% during the year and now stands 
at a record £6.8bn (2010: £6.4bn). 
Our sales pipeline currently stands at 
£1 1.4bn and our contracted revenue for 
the year ending 31 March 2012 is 81% of 
budgeted revenue (2010: 75%). 
Dividend
We continue to generate attractive 
dividends and dividend growth for 
our shareholders. The Board has 
recommended an increased ﬁnal 
dividend of 4.9p per Ordinary share, 
providing a total dividend per share for 
the year of 9 .0p, a 15.4% increase on 2010. 
This is consistent with our dividend policy 
to maintain dividends in line with 
underlying earnings per share growth 
at a cover ratio of 2.5 times adjusted 
earnings. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
the dividend will be paid on 12 August 
201 1 to shareholders on the register at 
24 June 201 1.
Board
After serving for 1 7 years at MITIE, of 
which nine have been on the Board, 
Roger Goodman stepped down 
as a PLC Director on 31 March 201 1. 
We thank him for his valuable 
contribution to the Board.
People
We would like to thank all of our people 
for  their exceptional efforts and support 
and to welcome the 5,327 people who 
joined us during the year. We are now 
a company of 61,906 individuals, which 
makes us one of the UK’s largest private 
sector employers. 
In particular, we would like to welcome 
those who joined us following our 
acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland.
It is our talented, dedicated people 
who allow us to achieve consistently 
strong results and maintaining the 
motivation of our people is critical to our 
future success. We remain focused on 
recognising and rewarding exceptional 
team performance, nurturing talent and 
providing opportunities for our people 
to succeed in their careers.
Outlook
MITIE is in an excellent position. We 
continue to focus on organic growth, 
supplemented by selective acquisitions 
and the development of our integrated 
business model overseas.
We have a diverse, high-quality client 
base across both the public and private 
sectors, which underpins our consistent 
track record. This has enabled us to 
continue investing in our people, 
technology and new markets, all of 
which supports our strong order book 
and growing sales pipeline.
There are exciting opportunities in our 
markets, as clients across the board 
look to introduce further innovation and 
efficiencies into their businesses. We are 
ﬁnancially robust and have a clear 
strategy for the development of our 
business. We are conﬁdent that MITIE will 
continue to build on its long track record 
of sustainable, proﬁtable growth.

Responding  
to changing client needs
This has been another good year for MITIE, with double-digit growth  
in revenues, operating proﬁt and EPS. 
But you probably know that already. The ﬁgures are well reported in the  
media and feature prominently throughout this report for all to see.
In this statement, I intend to focus on the story behind that success  
and how as an aspirational company, we achieve aspirational goals.

Overview
MITIE’s strength is that we never forget 
that we’re a service company – 
we deliver the everyday outsourced 
services that clients need in order to build 
their own businesses. Our broad scope 
and capabilities mean that we are the 
people responsible for everything from 
managing property estates and 
reducing energy consumption to 
providing engineers, cleaners and security 
officers, controlling pests, gritting roads 
and much more besides. 
We can do these things very efficiently, 
which is how we can save our clients 
money. Our approach starts with getting 
the speciﬁcation exactly right, and 
agreeing service levels with the client. 
Then, with contracts in place, we mobilise 
our teams very effectively. People transfer 
is complex and made even more so by 
legislation – but it is vital to get it absolutely 
spot on. Then we blend our experience 
and skills, innovative IT processes and 
industry-leading training and 
development to deliver exactly what 
we say we will deliver, exactly how we 
promised it. That’s why MITIE clients tend 
to stay MITIE clients, and why our business 
has grown for 23 consecutive years.
At all times, the markets are driven by 
our clients, as are we. The evolution of the 
outsourcing market is neatly encapsulated 
in the chart below – and what it shows, 
in a nutshell, is that the industry is on a long 
journey, from providing single services to 
bundled services and then, in some cases, 
more integrated services.
But what the chart doesn’t show is that 
each client is on a journey of their own. 
They are all at different stages, and they 
all  have dramatically different needs 
which are changing at their own 
individual pace. Life at MITIE is never dull 
because every day somebody asks us to 
do something different. It’s our job to meet 
those needs, as and when they change.
Join the discussion,  
or keep up-to-date!
Social media gives our people a 
forum where they can discuss the 
things that matter most to them.
Where our clients go, 
we go…
We’re there for our clients and 
support them with everything they 
need as they progress and develop.

The more things change…
The recession has been a major driver for 
change in our marketplace. Clients are 
restructuring and rethinking to reduce 
costs and they are turning to us for 
assistance. At the same time, they are 
looking to improve the way they manage 
energy, and taking advantage of our 
energy services offering, which helps cut 
carbon while also reducing costs. This is 
ensuring that in the UK, our core market, 
attractive opportunities for growth remain.
75% of our contract awards this year have 
come from the private sector and we 
are seeing a lot of activity at the moment. 
There is also a move towards more 
integrated facilities management – 
not only in the UK but also overseas. 
When clients tell us that they would like 
the MITIE services they enjoy in the UK to 
be available in other countries, we will 
do everything in our power to make it 
happen. Our relationship with Rolls-Royce 
is a case in point, where during 2010 we 
went from being a UK supplier to one 
who partners with them across Europe. 
The international opportunities for 
our business are growing fast and 
will continue to do so as we help more 
clients like Rolls-Royce be more efficient 
outside the UK. Around 40% of our top 
100 clients are multinationals, so the 
opportunity is clear, and we are actively 
looking at how we can support them. 
The acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland, 
which was ﬁnalised in June, is an 
important step along this pathway. 
Dalkia provides outsourcing solutions 
to clients in several different sectors and 
their experience has given us proven 
FM capability in a new territory.
In the public sector, budgetary pressures 
remain, which will create further 
opportunities for MITIE in the coming 
months and years. We are well-placed to 
support our public sector clients and have 
close working relationships with the 
Cabinet Office and other bodies. Local 
government, justice and health are just 
three of the sectors where we can see 
great opportunities. Indeed, several 
of these have already come to fruition, 
including the contract to provide a full 
custody and detention service at the 
Campsﬁeld House immigration centre. 
This is our ﬁrst contract in the prisons sector 
– and I am conﬁdent that we can go on to 
win many more.
The need for all organisations to use 
fewer natural resources is changing our 
marketplace, as our clients rethink the 
way they supply and consume energy. 
Energy management is, and should be, 
integral to facilities management and 
we have invested considerably in these 
capabilities – we are now one of the 
top two energy services companies in 
the UK. We believe energy services will, 
in time, be part of every contract we 
operate, and are well-positioned to 
take advantage of this opportunity.
…the more they stay the same
Entrepreneurial spirit has always been one 
of the qualities that makes MITIE different. 
It is part of our DNA and goes right back 
to the birth of the company. Examples 
of that entrepreneurship in action are 
everywhere – not only in the creative way 
we approach contracts, but also in the 
practical support we have given people 
to help them develop their careers and 
grow successful outsourcing businesses. 
Since 1988, we have consistently backed 
the idea of equity and opportunity with 
funds and support, and have helped 
over 80 successful start-ups in that time. 
In fact the acronym MITIE stands for 
‘Management Incentive Through 
Investment Equity’ .
During the year, we refreshed this idea 
by launching the ‘MITIE Entrepreneurial 
Programme’ , a £10m fund to back teams 
with innovative ideas for starting mutually-
owned businesses. The ‘MITIE model’ 
gives management teams an equity 
stake in a business, which they then grow 
over a ﬁve to ten-year period and which 
is eventually acquired by us in full.
Public sector 
opportunities
Budgetary pressures will create 
further opportunities for MITIE in the 
coming months and years.
Moving into  
new sectors 
We continue to identify 
opportunities in new markets, 
sectors and regions.

Our strategy
A strategy to deliver stakeholder 
value through a focus on sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth lies at the heart of our 
business and has done so for ﬁve years. 
The strategy has worked well and is largely 
unchanged, although each year the 
areas of focus can change. 
As we introduce new services and 
ways of delivering them in order to 
meet the changing needs of our clients, 
there will be an increased emphasis 
on entering new markets. In particular, 
we anticipate that energy-related 
services will be a growing focus for 
us over the next few years, as will our 
presence in overseas markets. Just as 
our clients are seeking to make their 
operations more efficient, so too are we, 
which is why we have added operational 
excellence as an element that underpins 
our strategy. We have made some 
changes to the KPIs we report to reﬂect 
these changes, and these can be found 
on pages 12–14. 
A strategy which underpins our customer proposition…  
Why MITIE?

We motivate our people by developing their careers and rewarding excellent 
performance

Focused on our people
Our new HR director, Katherine Thomas, 
is putting a spotlight on talent.
Giving our people a voice
We communicate with our 
people in the ways they are 
most comfortable with.
MiTec
Our new technology centre in 
Northern Ireland is a totally secure 
hub for remote monitoring.
Sustainability
MITIE has always been a responsible 
business and we focus our sustainability 
activities in seven areas which are aligned 
to our proﬁtable growth strategy. This is 
explained in detail on pages 36–38.
Investing in technology
We approach all our contracts from the 
perspective of partnership – we want to 
work with our clients, not just for our clients, 
and to win their trust in all that we do. 
Technology plays a key role here, 
because it enables us to show clients 
exactly what we are doing and when 
we are doing it, in real time.
For example, our MiWorld system allows 
a client to see everything from the 
temperature of a factory to the current 
status of an engineer visit or when the 
security guard last clocked on and off – 
it is all at the click of a mouse, on a 
dashboard on his or her PC. Such 
knowledge can highlight inefficiencies 
and duplications and create further 
opportunities to manage costs.
Handheld PDAs (personal digital assistants) 
are now used across our business, over a 
large number of sectors and service lines. 
The technology is designed to meet the 
diverse requirements of all our different 
contracts and is quick and easy to deploy. 
PDAs allow us to do operational tasks, 
including the scheduling of our mobile 
workforce, in a much more efficient way. 
For example, each month we use PDAs 
to conduct in excess of 1,400 audits and 
to schedule over 25,000 planned and 
reactive activities.
Supporting our people
The other way we build trust is through 
our people, all 61,906 of them. Most are 
based on-site and work at the sharp end 
of the business. Whether they are facing 
our clients each day, or working behind 
the scenes, we work hard to engage and 
develop all of our people.
Communication with so many people 
on so many different sites, many of them 
working shifts, can be a real challenge. 
Just as we deliver services in the way 
that our clients want them delivered, 
so we also communicate with our people 
in the ways that they’re most comfortable 
with. In addition to all of the traditional 
methods of communication, that 
means social media – and in particular 
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. 
Our view is that these sites give our 
people an important forum where they 
can discuss the things that matter most 
to them. We take on board what people 
are saying, and when issues are raised 
we always respond.
In October 2010, we appointed 
Katherine Thomas as our new group 
HR director. She brings a wealth of 
experience to the role, having previously 
worked at BT as group talent and 
leadership director, and has already 
begun to formalise our people agenda. 
We now have a more structured 
approach to HR issues, with a clear vision 
for where we want to be in 2014, with an 
emphasis on issues such as recruitment 
and retention, talent management, 
succession planning and leadership 
development.

In 2010 we launched the ﬁrst MITIE 
graduate programme. We also 
established a Diversity and Inclusion 
Steering Group with the purpose of 
strengthening our commitment to 
achieving equality, diversity and inclusion 
in the workplace and community.
The consistent hard work of our people 
was recognised in the form of a number 
of awards throughout the year. Our Real 
Apprentice scheme was the winner in the 
innovation category at the ﬁrst European 
Employee Volunteering Awards. The 
groundbreaking programme helps to 
break down barriers and get the long-
term unemployed and people with 
a physical or mental disability back into 
the world of work. At the other end of the 
spectrum, we were recently awarded 
Global Supplier of the Year by Rolls-Royce. 
These are just a sample of the enormous 
achievements of our people which 
regularly attract industry recognition.
.
Looking Forward
These are very good results and this 
year we have been awarded a number 
of transformational contracts. We have 
secured some signiﬁcant work in the 
private sector where we have excellent 
relationships with our clients and are 
differentiated by our energy services 
capabilities and use of technology. 
We have been appointed to several 
large public sector frameworks and 
have a strong pipeline of opportunities 
in local government, social housing, 
justice and health.
The opportunities in outsourcing and 
energy services in the UK and abroad 
are signiﬁcant. Our strong balance 
sheet and excellent cash conversion, 
as well as a record order book and sales 
pipeline, will enable us to achieve our 
growth aspirations. The business is well 
positioned for continued sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth.
Finally, I’d like to place on record my 
thanks to all the people who have 
made MITIE what it is today. It’s your drive, 
expertise, passion and, at times, great 
sense of humour that underpins what 
we do. It has been a real privilege to work 
alongside you all during the year.

Description:
In order to achieve sustainable, proﬁtable growth,  
we monitor the percentage of existing contracts 
retained in our Facilities Management division on  
a rolling 12-month basis.
Target:
Achieve contract retention rates in excess of 90%.
Comment:
Our contract retention rate in our Facilities 
Management division stands at 84.2%. 
Description:
Sustainability will be an increasingly competitive 
advantage for us going forward as our clients look 
to us to help them improve their performance and 
reduce their costs.
Target:
Increase the proportion of energy services related 
revenue each year.
Comment:
This is the ﬁrst year that we have been analysing our 
performance in this area.
Description:
Reportable accidents are deﬁned as fatalities, major 
injuries and injuries resulting in absence from work of 
over three days. Our people are our greatest asset. 
Providing them with a safe environment in which to  
work is of paramount importance to us, so we use a  
KPI for reportable accidents to assess our performance.
Objective:
Retain focus on reducing the risk of accidents in 
our business.
Comment:
Our focus on health and safety has enabled  
us to reduce reportable accidents to 3.1 per  
1,000 employees.
Description:
In previous years emissions have been reported as CO2. 
This year they are reported as CO2e to allow for all six 
Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and broken down into scopes 
1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the GHG protocol. 
Emissions are calculated using the Defra guidance on 
how to measure and report GHG emissions and apply 
the 2010 guidelines for company reporting. Last year’s 
total CO2 emissions have been recalculated using CO2e 
for Scope 1 (direct emissions, gas and transport) and 
Scope 2 (indirect energy, purchased electricity) but 
excludes landlord managed energy and expensed 
business fuel (part of Scope 3). We have also restated 
the 2010 data to allow for changes to the property 
portfolio and acquisitions. The rate of CO2e emissions 
per MITIE employee is calculated using the average 
number of people employed during the year.
Objective:
Understand and minimise the environmental impact  
of our operations.
Comment:
Emissions per employee are lower than the prior year.

Contract types split within MITIE
Description:
As a substantial portion of our revenue was historically 
generated through single service contracts, one of  
our opportunities for growth is through expanding  
our relationships with existing clients by providing other 
services. We have seen a trend in the markets towards 
multi-service and FM contracts over the past few years 
and we are well positioned to meet the demands of  
this trend due to our broad range of services.
We measure the percentage of revenue that is 
generated by these types of contracts in order to 
measure how well we are performing in this arena. 
Comment:
58% of revenues are now attributable to multi-service 
and integrated FM contracts.

Description:
We are focused on long-term recurring revenue 
streams. At the start of each ﬁnancial year, we 
calculate the percentage of our budgeted revenues 
that are already contracted.
Target:
Secure greater than 75% of budgeted revenues at the 
start of each ﬁnancial year.
Comment:
At the start of the ﬁnancial year 2012, 81% of budgeted 
revenues were secured. 
Description:
We see increasing opportunities in international 
markets as our clients look to expand procurement 
and we beneﬁt from diversifying our revenue base.
Target:
Increase our proportion of international revenues.
Comment:
Our international revenues were 1.3% of group. 
All of our divisions are focused on operating more 
efficiently, and use many different measures to 
assess performance.
From a group perspective, the best way to assess our 
productivity is our group operating proﬁt margin, which 
is also one of our key ﬁnancial performance indicators 
and found on the following spread.
Description:
MITIE is a people business and we pride ourselves in 
creating and nurturing outstanding management. 
Monitoring how successful we are in retaining our 
people is an important measure for us.
Target:
Enhance focus on the development and retention of 
management to maintain a retention rate of over 90%.
Comment:
Our management retention rate was 89 .5% for the year.
This year we invested £7 .3m in the acquisition of 
Dalkia FM in Ireland, and £6.8m in minority interest 
acquisitions in six companies under the MITIE model. 
Our strong cash ﬂows, committed banking facilities 
and strong balance sheet have ensured that these 
investments can be made against a backdrop of 
limited gearing, with net debt to EBITDA at 31 March 
201 1 at 0.65 and interest cover of 33.1 for the year.

Capital expenditure  
as a % of revenue
Conversion of EBITDA to cash
Dividend growth
Description:
Our operating proﬁt margin (before other items*) 
provides us with a good indicator of the proﬁtability 
of our business. Where we have material restructuring 
and acquisition related items, such as integration costs, 
we exclude these from our measure.
Target range:
Maintain operating proﬁt margins between 5.0%  
and 6.0% per annum.
Comment:
We have improved our margin by 0.3ppts to 5.7%.
*  Other items are restructuring and acquisition related 
items.
Description:
Our strength lies in the management of people and  
in the provision of suitable assets to support their work, 
but our business is not capital intensive. We continue  
to monitor and control capital expenditure, and target 
growth and acquisitions in areas that do not require 
substantial capital expenditure.
Target range:
Maintain below 2.0% of revenue.
Comment:
Capital expenditure was 1.4% of revenue.
Description:
The efficiency with which we manage the generation  
of cash is an important indicator for our business.  
MITIE is built on a sound understanding of the 
importance of cash and working capital management 
and that ethos remains critical to our business.  
The conversion of earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to cash  
is one of the signiﬁcant cash-ﬂow indicators for MITIE.
Target range:
Over 80.0% of EBITDA converted to cash.
Comment:
We have achieved our target this year with 86.7%  
of EBITDA being converted to cash.
Description:
It is important that we continue to target a dividend 
policy that provides an appropriate return to 
shareholders with a dividend which grows in line with 
the underlying earnings of the Group. Dividend cover 
is calculated by reference to our underlying earnings 
which we measure using our basic EPS before other 
items*. EPS before other items is 22.6p (2010: 19 .5p) 
giving rise to growth of 15.9%.
Target range:
At least in line with underlying earnings growth at a 
cover rate of 2.5 times adjusted earnings.
Comment:
Our dividend growth for the year was 15.4%, providing 
cover of 2.5 times adjusted earnings.

Ringing the changes 
for Vodafone, across 
the UK and Ireland.
Our relationship with Vodafone started with a technical facilities 
management contract that came into MITIE through our acquisition  
of Dalkia FM in 2009. 
This had a base contract value of £6m per annum and 
last year, Vodafone moved to a fully integrated FM model across 
the UK and Ireland, with a base value of £16m.
Energy management is an 
important part of what we do for 
Vodafone. One of our goals is to 
help them meet their target of 
a 50% carbon reduction by 2020.

We now work closely with Rolls–Royce in support 
of its global property strategy. From our single 
service cleaning contract in 1992, to a national 
cleaning contract in 1998, to UK-wide facilities 
management in 2003, we have a proven 
delivery model and long-term relationship.

Not only was MITIE the choice of 
Orbit South and East, we were also the 
favoured option for the organisation’s 
residents too. Orbit residents were 
involved in the selection process, and 
wanted a contractor who was going to 
deliver a great service and also provide 
real value for money. In addition to our 
strong track record, we were able to 
offer residents a community investment 
package as part of the contract.

Organisations are seeking to drive down 
costs by focusing on integrated services, 
supplier rationalisation, retendering and 
innovation. As companies consolidate, 
they are examining their cost base and 
identifying opportunities for outsourcing. 
Our ability to deliver integrated services is 
again proving a key differentiator. As we 
have seen with the recent contract 
awards from Vodafone and Rolls-Royce, 
many clients are keen to access our 
strengths in a broader range of integrated 
services. Technology is another important 
driver, as more clients appreciate the 
value of instant information being 
displayed via a dashboard on their PC. 
We are also experiencing a number of 
clients choosing to take a ‘whole life’ view 
and linking the initial capital expenditure 
to the lifetime operating expenditure of 
their contracts.
Critical infrastructure projects such as data 
centres will be a major challenge for all 
sectors in the coming years. A data centre 
is the hub of a modern organisation, 
with failure causing the loss of company-
critical facilities including email and 
access to the internet. Many organisations 
are currently initiating plans to invest 
signiﬁcant funds in data centre infrastructure 
and the low-carbon energy solutions 
to power them.
Looking at outsourcing activity in 
the various sectors, the ﬁnancial and 
professional services area remains 
particularly active. Many clients are 
changing their procurement models 
and this has led to high levels of private 
sector tenders, most especially in the 
retail,  transport and utilities sectors.
Good opportunities.
In existing markets 
and beyond.
As a strategic outsourcing and energy services company, 
we serve both private and public sector clients. 
Our marketplace continues to evolve, driven by the needs of all 
clients to improve efﬁciency while reducing costs. Energy remains 
a major expense for many clients and frequently outstrips other 
factors in terms of potential savings. 
We are working with clients to look at how best to structure 
outsourcing solutions, in new and innovative ways. We initiate 
capital expenditure projects and deliver new energy contracts 
that lead to signiﬁcant reductions – not only in monetary terms, 
but also in carbon emissions, which is an important issue for 
all sectors.

The UK Government, local authorities 
and other bodies are initiating cutbacks, 
many of them signiﬁcant. They are 
looking at expenditure in ﬁne detail – 
from headcount to energy cost and this 
is creating opportunities for outsourcing. 
We expect this trend to remain in place 
during the coming years. We believe 
that outsourcing has the potential to 
reduce costs while also improving 
services, and we are well-positioned to 
support the UK Government’s agenda 
of addressing the deﬁcit, particularly 
in our focus areas of justice, health, 
social housing and education. 
Mutual ownership models have a 
part to play in reducing the costs of 
management and administration. 
These have worked well in the private 
sector and are likely to deliver similar 
beneﬁts in the public sector. Partnerships 
between the public and private sector 
are expected to be important as the 
Government seeks to transform the way 
in which services are provided.
Energy costs are a key issue for the public 
sector – but so too are carbon emissions. 
The Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme came 
into effect in April 2010. 
The CRC is a huge part of the 
Government’s pledge to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% 
from 1990 levels by 2050. The scheme will 
see organisations with total half-hourly 
metered electricity consumption greater 
than 6,000 mega watt hours a year 
(equivalent to approximately £460,000 
electricity spend) forced to buy 
allowances for each tonne of carbon 
dioxide (CO
2
) they emit and be placed 
in a league table according to their 
energy performance.
Through our CarbonCare service, we are 
helping all organisations, including those 
in the public sector, to manage their 
energy use and carbon footprint. 
International
An increasing number of clients 
are taking a pan-European view on 
procurement. They want to leverage 
their spend in order to reduce costs 
and improve efficiency across national 
boundaries. For example, during the 
year Rolls-Royce appointed us for the 
facilities and energy management of 
its European properties. Many of our 
clients have an international presence. 
As they centralise their procurement 
operations, we expect that business 
through pan-European contracts 
will increase.
As part of our international strategy, 
we acquired Dalkia FM in Ireland and 
have developed a senior management 
team with global experience. 
This team works closely with our 
partners in Service Management 
International (SMI) to develop 
international opportunities for MITIE.
According to research, the value of the 
EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) 
market for outsourced FM services is in 
excess of £250 billion, of which around 
10% is integrated services. As we 
look at value-creating opportunities 
across Europe for speciﬁc clients, 
we are increasingly well-placed 
to exploit this tremendous potential.
Emerging growth markets
We continue to identify opportunities 
in new markets, and recently we were 
awarded contracts in two sectors which 
are new to us.
In February 201 1 we signed our ﬁrst 
agreement for the energy provision for a 
waste-to-energy plant. All energy to the 
plant will be sourced from local wood, 
with surplus energy being sold back into 
the national grid. Towards the end of 2010, 
we were awarded a ﬁve-year contract 
by the Home Office to deliver a full 
custody and detention service at 
Campsﬁeld House immigration centre. This 
is our ﬁrst contract in the prisons sector, an 
area where we anticipate signiﬁcant 
future opportunity.

Heading to Ireland
In June 2010, we acquired the 
integrated Facilities Management 
business of Dalkia in Ireland. 
It provides integrated FM solutions 
for a range of clients in both the 
public and private sectors, 
operating in a variety of industries 
including technology and 
communications, transport and 
logistics, manufacturing, utilities 
and ﬁnance. This acquisition allows 
us to further support our clients 
overseas, and we are delighted to 
welcome the management team 
and employees.

Our Facilities Management (FM) business 
is responsible for delivering ‘soft’ FM 
services. The division’s offering ranges 
from fully integrated FM and consultancy , 
to any of our specialist single services 
which include:
Security; Cleaning; Catering; Document 
management and reprographics; Reception 
and front of house; Waste management; 
Environmental services; Landscaping; 
Pest control.
£4.1bn
We made signiﬁcant progress during 
the year, particularly in our ability to bid 
for and win large contracts that span 
many regions and draw on the services 
of all of our divisions. As our clients look 
to create value from all of their assets, 
we have responded with a ﬂexible 
model that uses our broad range of 
expertise in asset, energy and property 
management alongside any or all of 
our FM capabilities. 
The savings that clients can achieve by 
transitioning to a full FM service continue 
to drive growth in our business. Energy 
management is also an important 
differentiator for us and the development 
of CarbonCare has given us a market-
leading offering.
We tailor all of our services to suit our 
clients’ needs and this has seen us 
increasingly develop niche offerings 
for speciﬁc sectors, such as retail, transport, 
healthcare and, more recently, justice 
and prisons. 
We have made several enhancements 
to our security business and now offer 
a total security management solution, 
which includes manned guarding, 
response services, key holding and 
remote monitoring via our newly-opened 
technology centre in Northern Ireland. 
Specialist services to the police and 
justice markets is a growing area for us. 
There are opportunities in prisons, a range 
of police support services, and we have 
already commenced work in our ﬁrst 
immigration detention centre.
We are also developing our catering 
offering, with a brand refresh and the 
appointment of a new managing 
director and a sales director.
Our recent investments in customer 
relationship management and our 
integrated offering are bearing fruit: 
we achieved a 84.2% retention rate  
for rebid contracts during the year. 
We are also the third biggest player in 
both cleaning and security in the UK 
and one of the top ten providers for 
all of our other FM services.
Looking ahead, our ability to save costs 
for both new and existing clients, along 
with our focus on retaining clients and 
expanding into new markets, will support 
continued growth in FM.
Operating review
Exceptional capability.
Well-placed for 
future growth.
Since 1 April 2010, we have operated primarily in four divisions: 
Facilities, Technical Facilities, Property, and Asset Management.
Each division brings together a selection of services that 
naturally ﬁt together – from both an operational and a client 
perspective. As we grow, more of our contracts incorporate  
two, three or even all of our divisions.  Governance Accounts

Our Technical Facilities Management 
(TFM) business focuses on ‘hard services’ 
facilities management (FM) that is led by 
technology , engineering and the need 
to reduce energy consumption. 
Services include:
Integrated FM: mechanical and electrical 
engineering maintenance; Mobile multi-site FM; 
Specialist technical services; CarbonCare energy 
services; Lighting design and maintenance; 
Building Management Systems and controls; 
Compliance services.
£1.4bn
Energy reduction is a key growth driver 
and an area where our CarbonCare 
offering has successfully helped 
differentiate TFM in the marketplace. 
In 2010, BSRIA placed MITIE in the top two 
energy services companies in the UK. 
A signiﬁcant number of CarbonCare 
services are provided by TFM. It delivers 
a total energy solution that increases 
awareness of environmental issues, 
introduces innovative ideas and 
technologies, manages energy and 
carbon footprint data, ensures legislative 
carbon compliance and delivers 
guaranteed energy reductions. We also 
provide decentralised and cleaner 
renewable energy solutions, working in 
conjunction with our Asset and Property 
Management businesses.
The shift towards integrated FM is also a 
major driver for TFM. Our technical FM 
expertise underpins our integrated FM 
offering, and is particularly important 
where clients’ businesses are focused 
on hard services, for example in our 
Vodafone and Rolls-Royce contracts, 
which are led by TFM, as is the Royal 
Opera House contract.
We have recently launched National 
Mobile Services, which delivers fast 
and responsive mobile technical FM 
services (MobileTech) across the UK, 
most especially to organisations with 
widely spread property portfolios. 
Our multi-skilled technicians provide 
services to clients within a local 
geographic area, helping to build strong 
local relationships. We anticipate that 
MobileTech will be attractive to retail 
clients, where we are seeing an increasing 
number of contracts which require us 
to act as a ‘managing agent’ and take 
responsibility for their entire technical 
FM budgets.
As the number of cross-selling 
opportunities increases, the maintenance 
of data intensive sites is a market where 
we will be leveraging our Asset 
Management installation capabilities. 
A well-maintained data environment 
is critical for many clients. Our role is to 
understand the drivers for individual 
clients and the factors that make their 
environment unique. We work hard to 
understand and monitor the plant and 
equipment in order to put effective risk 
management programmes in place. 
This enables us to identify potential points 
of failure in advance and make sure we 
have the appropriately trained engineers 
who can deliver an immediate response 
to any issues that arise.
We focus on people and training at every 
level. A recent employee engagement 
survey achieved a 62% (class leading) 
response rate, and concluded that our 
people have an above average level 
of engagement. 
Current market trends, particularly in 
energy reduction and integrated FM, 
coupled with the investments we have 
made to supplement our capabilities 
in these areas, mean that we are  
well-positioned to support our clients  
in the fast-growing TFM arena.

We have recently made a series of 
changes to our business, in order to offer 
our clients more integrated, end-to-end 
solutions, and to operate in a more 
efficient and ﬂexible way. 
The integration of our engineering 
contracting business into Property 
Management is complete. As part of 
this process, we discontinued some 
of our engineering activities in certain 
parts of the country.
Local and Central Government 
Departments, together with the Social 
Housing market, are an important focus 
for us. The EPS Ltd acquisition has been 
fully integrated and has strengthened 
us in the South East. We have launched 
a new partnering model, Localcare, 
which uses shared ownership between 
a local authority or housing association, 
a private sector partner and the 
employees who are delivering the 
services. It enables the creation of 
mutually owned local organisations 
which deliver cost-effective services 
to their communities.  MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
We have combined our interiors and 
mechanical and engineering installation 
businesses into one integrated ﬁt-out 
business. Increased conﬁdence in the 
UK retail sector has generated new 
demand for store ﬁt-out and refurbishment 
and we are conﬁdent of gaining further 
market share as capital spending returns. 
In addition, our Residential Solutions 
offering now combines our capabilities in 
plumbing, heating, installation, carpentry 
and decoration to provide a complete 
internal ﬁt-out solution to the new build 
housing market. 
We completed a renewable energy 
pilot project to install photovoltaic (PV) 
roof mounted panels that use solar 
cells to convert energy from the sun into 
electricity. The installations took place 
on an initial pilot of 200 properties, which 
are owned by registered social landlords. 
The residents beneﬁt from cheaper 
electricity costs while the homeowner 
receives an income from feed-in tariffs 
for any excess energy generated. 
We anticipate signiﬁcant opportunities 
in this market, with potential for up to 
15,000 further properties during 201 1.
We are also working overseas for the ﬁrst  
time, in conjunction with TFM and FM,  
to deliver space planning and project 
work on the Rolls-Royce Property Estate 
throughout Europe. 
Our order book is signiﬁcant and we are 
seeing signs of optimism in many of our 
markets. Property Management is now 
in a strong position to take advantage 
of the various growth opportunities in 
our chosen sectors as markets improve.

Our Asset Management division 
develops bespoke energy assets that 
offer a secure and sustainable energy 
supply. Carbon efficient technologies 
are used to create energy infrastructure 
which provides the electricity , heating 
or cooling required by our clients. 
Decentralised energy delivers the long-
term beneﬁts of guaranteed cost savings, 
reduced carbon emissions and supply 
certainty. Services include:
Decentralised energy centre development; 
Low-carbon data centre development; 
Renewable energy integration; 
Energy services company (ESCo) 
management; Community infrastructure.
£0.1bn
We are seeing increased opportunities 
in the decentralised energy market. 
Both public and private sector clients 
recognise that this is an effective way to 
reduce energy costs and consumption, 
without an upfront capital investment 
in many cases. The ability to achieve 
sustainability targets whilst retaining 
funding for core services is a compelling 
argument in the current economic 
climate, particularly for our public 
sector clients.
The good progress made during the year 
is a result of the signiﬁcant investments we 
have made to develop our capabilities. 
We have been awarded several 
transformational contracts which, 
when completed, will provide us with 
world-class reference sites from which 
to roll-out similar models. 
At the Royal Free Hospital we successfully 
completed a gas turbine energy centre 
development and are now engaging 
with the client to look at cooling upgrades. 
We developed a sustainable biomass 
energy centre for a Waitrose store in East 
Cowes, the ﬁrst of its kind for the John Lewis 
Partnership, and we have also entered 
into a joint venture to develop a biomass-
fuelled energy centre for a large UK 
manufacturer.
In addition, we have established a 
reputation as a leader in the data centre 
market, where our skills in understanding 
and mitigating risk proﬁles have brought 
us an impressive portfolio of projects and 
accounts. We completed several major 
data centre projects during the year, 
including one for a leading global 
telecommunications company.
This series of ﬂagship developments 
has given us validation and visibility 
in the marketplace and supported 
the growth of a healthy forward sales 
pipeline. We are now able to show 
how organisations with intensive energy 
needs can meet their own requirements, 
securely and efficiently, while supporting 
their communities through local networks. 
We are recognised as one of the few 
providers in the UK that has the track 
record, scale and expertise to deliver 
substantial decentralised energy centres 
that will guarantee availability over a 
sustained contract term. Our business 
will be driven forward by this momentum 
and by our continuing focus on key 
sectors where we have a strong 
competitive capability.

Sustainability at MITIE
We have already talked about the 
signiﬁcant commercial opportunities 
opening up to us in the ﬁeld of 
sustainability – both through the 
comprehensive services under our 
CarbonCare offering, and through the 
work we do every day to help clients 
generate locally produced energy.
However we haven’t discussed how  
we’ve also worked hard to improve our 
own sustainability performance over the 
last few years. We have always believed 
that this makes good business sense  
and have made it a priority accordingly. 
We’ve improved our own environmental 
performance, and set ourselves 
challenging targets in areas like energy 
and fuel use. We’ve started to engage 
directly and more regularly with our 
suppliers to help raise environmental  
and social standards across our whole 
supply chain. We’ve extended the  
quality and range of the training we 
offer to employees, and reinforced our 
commitment to diversity and inclusion. 
And we’ve continued to work actively in 
the community, both through sponsoring 
life-changing projects like our Real 
Apprentice programme, and through 
encouraging our own employees to 
volunteer in their own local 
neighbourhoods.
We’re proud of what we have achieved, 
but as sustainability has become more 
mainstream, the public and our own 
stakeholders have started to expect 
more of us, both in the UK and around the 
world. With this in mind we have worked 
actively with the Sustainability team at 
PricewaterhouseCoopers to understand 
the areas where we might improve, 
setting ourselves a new, more focused 
and demanding strategy going forward, 
which will ensure that our business 
is resilient and sustainable not just 
economically, but in every other way. 
A new simpliﬁed, 
streamlined strategy
The challenge for all companies now – 
and especially for those that aspire to 
leadership, as we do – is to fully integrate 
sustainability into their corporate strategy, 
and the way decisions are made in  
the business, day to day. This means 
understanding and addressing strategic 
sustainability risks and opportunities, and 
linking these to our commercial activities 
and ambitions. It means having robust 
KPIs and targets that relate directly to our 
sustainability strategy, and ensuring that 
our reporting to stakeholders is transparent 
and comprehensive about all of the most 
material issues we face.
It was clear from our review that we’ve 
already made real progress in all these 
areas, but there is always room for 
improvement. Our new sustainability 
strategy is designed to help us do this.  
Our goal is to ensure that our corporate 
and sustainability strategies are mutually 
supportive, so that over the long term the 
work we do to improve our sustainability 
performance will create value for our 
shareholders, and our efforts to make 
MITIE a more proﬁtable business will also 
make it a more sustainable one. In simple 
terms, it’s about fulﬁlling the ’sustainable’ 
part of our corporate strategy, which aims 
to deliver stakeholder value through a 
focus on sustainable and proﬁtable long-
term growth.

Notes:
In 2010, we participated in the global voluntary reporting programme, The Carbon Disclosure Project and were rated 
76 with a performance rating of B.
Transport: Despite an increase of 447 vehicles due to business growth, our average annual consumption per vehicle 
has  dropped by just over 3% against our 2010 baseline.
Energy: Consumption has decreased by 13% against baseline primarily through the reduction in property portfolio 
and improvements in heating and lighting reﬁts. Although MITIE’s energy emissions are not covered under the EU ETS, 
Climate Change Agreement or Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, we are committed to driving 
down energy wastage through better management and the purchase of 100% renewable energy tariff electricity. 
Waste: The total amount of waste created has reduced by 31% resulting in a lower recycled percentage.
Water: Our water consumption had decreased by 1 1% against baseline through improved awareness and reduction 
in managed properties.

Client service is the heart of our 
business, and will drive our long-term 
success as a company. This objective 
covers everything related to customer 
relationship management, and how 
we meet and – we hope – anticipate 
their needs. 
A more efficient business is always 
a more sustainable one, which is why 
we’re working hard to become more 
productive, cut out unnecessary costs  
and push for all the suppliers we work  
with to have high sustainability standards. 
Challenging our own cultural practices 
will make us more price competitive and 
give a better service to clients. 
There’s more we can do to raise 
awareness of issues like climate change 
among our own people. We need to 
ensure every one of our employees 
understands what our stakeholders 
expect of us, and what they can do in 
their own everyday work to help reduce 
our environmental impact.

Responsibility/sustainability
Six focus areas
We are re-aligning everything we do on sustainability behind six key areas, which 
build on the work we’ve already been doing and are directly aligned with our 
corporate strategy drivers. Each has a clearly-deﬁned objective, and performance 
measures, so that we can track our progress and build momentum. Acquisitions, 
our seventh corporate strategy driver, has not been incorporated as a separate area 
of focus since the necessary sustainability considerations are carried out as standard 
during due diligence, and the relevant performance measures applied post integration. 
Taking this approach will allow us to focus our time and resources on those issues 
that are of the highest priority, both to the business and to our stakeholders. 
We want to build a reputation as a provider of world-class, sustainable services that 
delivers exactly what our clients want. That’s why our ﬁrst two objectives are concerned 
with our service delivery. If we achieve both of these goals we’ll build more long-term 
partnerships, become more productive, and generate more value, both for our clients 
and for ourselves. 
What does this mean in practice?
We’ll be surveying our key clients at 
least once a year, and learn as much 
as we can from the feedback we 
receive, by integrating the results into 
our group-wide customer relationship 
management system. 
We’ll also make our own expertise 
available to help our clients to set up 
programmes like our pioneering and 
award-winning Real Apprentice 
placement scheme, widening our 
community footprint and nurturing 
relationships at the same time. 
What does this mean in practice?
We’ll be using an employee 
communications campaign to 
spearhead a reduction in fuel 
consumption across our whole ﬂeet  
by 10% by 2013. We’ll also be promoting 
the take-up of more sustainable business 
practices to all our team leaders  
through new e-learning programmes, 
and interactive workshops. 
Alongside this we’ll run audits of at least 
40 major suppliers every year, and will 
expect all of them to meet or exceed 
the targets we set within a 12-month 
period. Environmental issues are 
particularly important here, so one 
of our ﬁrst objectives will be to identify 
any particular climate change risks and 
carbon emission hot spots in our supply 
chain, and set a baseline against which 
we can measure future performance. 
What does this mean in practice?
Once again, this is an area where 
actual rather than estimated data can 
make a real difference. We can use 
this data to help engage our own 
people and target areas for quick wins. 
By doing this, we hope to achieve a  
15% reduction in office energy use by 
2013 compared with the 2010 baseline, 
which has been restated to take into 
account acquisitions and other changes 
to the business, and an overall recycling 
rate of 80%. 
We’re also encouraging the use of ultra-
low emissions, zero-emission, and hybrid 
vehicles in our ﬂeet, and hope to see a 
further reduction in our average car ﬂeet 
emissions to 135g CO2 per km in the next 
year. At the same time, we’ll work more 
actively with our suppliers to reduce 
packaging waste, targeting our top 
ﬁve office suppliers as a ﬁrst priority. 
We also aim to establish the percentage 
of suppliers signed on for paperless 
communication and to improve on that 
position going forward by early 2012. 
The next two objectives are closely 
related. Our own environmental objective 
is one of the most important ones for us, 
and an area where we believe we can 
make a signiﬁcant impact. Like many 
other businesses, we can do more 
to improve our own environmental 
performance; unlike many businesses 
we can help our clients do this as well. MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
Sustainability review
What we do for ourselves, we can also 
do for our clients. Sustainability will be 
an increasingly competitive advantage 
for us going forward, as our clients 
look to us to help them improve their 
performance and cut their costs. 
We want to offer our clients the best 
service in the market, and we can 
only do that if we have the best people. 
One way we’ll be doing this is by setting 
ourselves the speciﬁc goal of recruiting, 
retaining and motivating our people 
better than any of our peers. We want 
all our people to fulﬁl their utmost 
potential, and support that through 
formal training and development, 
plus opportunities to develop their 
personal skills through volunteering. 
This sounds simple enough as an idea, 
but given the complexity of our business, 
and the sophisticated technical services 
many of our people provide, it can be 
a challenge ensuring that every working 
area is as safe as it can possibly be. Our aim 
is to be even better at doing that.

What does this mean in practice?
Our innovative low carbon and 
environmental technologies are some 
of the best in the market, and no-one 
else offers such a complete or integrated 
range. We want to grow this area of  
our business and really capitalise on this 
expertise. We’ll begin by assessing how 
well our actual and potential clients 
understand our ’green’ capabilities, 
and then set ourselves targets to grow 
the business from there. We’ll reinforce 
this by ensuring all our employees 
are fully aware of what we can do 
for clients in this increasingly important 
area, both in the UK and abroad.
What does this mean in practice?
Earlier in this report we talk about 
our business goals for 2012. If we’re 
to meet these challenges we’ll need 
to have outstanding leaders across the 
business, so management development 
will be especially important over the 
next year. This will include identifying 
the roles where succession planning 
is either an imminent need or a 
particular challenge. 
It’s also vital that all our people 
understand exactly what’s expected 
of them, both as individuals and as 
members of teams. This is why we’ll 
be refreshing our performance 
management framework, and aligning 
it even more closely with our core values. 
We’ll be strengthening our internal 
engagement programme, establishing 
a core set of measures across MITIE so 
we understand the road ahead and 
setting appropriate targets to achieve 
complete reach across the group. 
We’ll also encourage people to take 
part as volunteers in a wide range of 
activities, whether it’s supporting our 
regional charities’ fundraising efforts 
or getting stuck into our three new 
biodiversity community projects.
What does this mean in practice?
One of the most effective ways to 
improve health and safety performance 
in any business is to share the lessons 
learned from previous incidents – 
those that happened, those that 
were near-misses, and those that were 
successfully prevented. One way we’re 
doing this is by providing a new incident 
management platform that will enable 
more effective measurement of a better 
range of health and safety-related KPIs. 
Another is by implementing a new 
approach to assessing the root causes 
of incidents, and we aim to apply this 
thinking to all major and high potential 
incidents that occur. 
We’ll also be launching the third  
phase of our health and safety risk 
management leadership programme, 
which is all about ensuring that the most 
senior people in the business lead by 
example when it comes to safety and 
well-being at work and further embed 
this focus culturally in the business. The 
programme will run in tandem with the 
latest Work Safe Home Safe! campaign, 
which raises awareness of the speciﬁc 
hazards our people might encounter on 
a daily basis of the expected behaviours 
required and to stay safe on the job.
The next objective relates to our own 
people, who have always been our 
real competitive advantage, and the 
reason for our success. 
Last but deﬁnitely not least, our sixth 
objective is in the area of health and 
safety. We have a proven track record 
in this area, both on our own account, 
and in the work we do for clients. 
Few companies have the extensive 
expertise we do in the management, 
mitigation and elimination of risks in the 
workplace. It is without doubt one of 
our greatest strengths. Governance Accounts

MITIE has delivered another set of strong 
ﬁnancial results that are underpinned by 
our focus on both organic and acquisitive 
growth, cash conversion and the 
maintenance of a strong balance sheet. 
During the year we completed 
the integration of the prior year 
acquisitions of Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd 
and have enhanced our portfolio 
on an international basis through the 
acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland 
and the commencement of activities 
in continental Europe in support of  
Rolls-Royce. 
We have strengthened our long-term 
funding position by completing an issue 
of US private placement loan notes and 
through the renewal and extension of 
our existing banking facilities. These 
facilities provide long-term debt ﬁnancing 
capacity for a range of periods up to 
December 2019 . 
We enter the new ﬁnancial year in a 
strong position with good prospects, 
low gearing and enhanced capacity 
for future growth.
Financial performance
Revenue
Revenue has increased by 10.0% to 
£1,891.4m (2010: £1,720.1m) through a 
combination of organic and acquisitive 
growth, in line with our strategy. The 
increase in revenue is attributable to the 
full year impact of prior year acquisitions 
of £1 13.5m, £19 .4m from the acquisition of 
Dalkia FM in Ireland during the year and 
organic growth of £38.4m. Proforma prior 
year revenue including the full year effect 
of acquisitions made in the year ended  
31 March 2010 was £1,833.6m and organic 
growth was 2.1% on that basis. 
We have experienced growth in revenue 
during the year. The analysis by operating

After the exclusion of discontinued 
activities in our engineering contracting 
business, underlying organic revenue 
growth for the year was 3.5% (ﬁrst half  
1.6%; second half 5.3%).
The strong growth experienced in our 
Facilities, Technical Facilities and Asset 
Management businesses reﬂects the 
continuation during the year of clients’ 
demand for efficiency enhancing 
energy and facilities management 
solutions. Challenging conditions 
continued in certain construction related 
markets, which negatively affected the 
overall growth proﬁle achieved in our 
Property Management business.
Operating proﬁt before other items
Operating proﬁt before other items 
increased by 16.5% to £108.3m (2010: 
£93.0m) and our margin improved to 
5.7% (2010: 5.4%). 
The increase in operating proﬁt before 
other items is attributable to the full year 
impact of prior year acquisitions of £2.4m, 
£1.3m from the acquisition of Dalkia FM in 
Ireland during the year and organic 
growth of £1 1.6m. Proforma prior year 
operating proﬁt before other items 
including the full year effect of acquisitions 
made in the year ended 31 March 2010 
was £95.4m and organic growth was 
12.2% on that basis. Included in operating 
proﬁt before other items is income of £4.1m 
from an amendment to the past service 
cost of certain deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes as the result of the change from 
RPI to CPI for the valuation of liabilities,  
as explained on page 43.

Other items
Other items for the year were £18.8m 
(2010: £1 1.9m) and comprised the 
amortisation of acquisition related 
intangible assets of £8.9m (2010: £5.3m) 
and integration, acquisition and 
reorganisation costs of £9 .9m (2010: £6.6m). 
The increase in the amortisation of 
intangible assets of £3.6m in the year 
reﬂects the full year effect of the 
amortisation of assets identiﬁed in respect 
of the prior year acquisitions of Dalkia FM 
and EPS Ltd (incremental charge £3.1m) 
along with a charge of £0.5m in respect 
of the amortisation of intangible assets 
identiﬁed during the year following the 
acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland. 
Integration and acquisition costs of 
£5.1m (2010: £6.6m) were incurred during 
the year in respect of the acquisitions 
of Dalkia FM, EPS Ltd and Dalkia FM in 
Ireland. These charges mainly comprised 
costs associated with the implementation 
of new management, internal control 
and back office systems and structures. 
Furthermore, costs of £4.8m have been 
incurred in respect of the restructuring 
of certain parts of the group’s Property 
Management business. These costs are 
not expected to recur. 
After the impact of other items, the 
operating proﬁt for the year was £89 .5m 
(2010: £81.1m).
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance costs for the year were £2.7m 
(2010: £1.4m). The increase in net costs 
during the year reﬂects the impact of 
funding costs associated with recent 
acquisitions and the increase in interest 
rates payable by the group attributable 
to £100m sterling equivalent borrowings 
drawn down under US private placement 
loan notes in December 2010 as part of 
our reﬁnancing activities. 
Proﬁt before tax 
Proﬁt before tax and before other items for 
the year increased by 15.3% to £105.7m 
(2010: £91.7m). 
Reported proﬁt before tax for the year 
was £86.8m (2010: £79 .7m), an increase 
of 8.9% on the prior year. 
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £21.4m 
(2010: £22.2m), an improvement in the 
effective rate of tax to 24.7% (2010: 27 .9%). 
The improvement in the effective tax 
rate is  attributable to the £0.5m positive 
impact of recalculating the group’s 
overall deferred tax liability at the 
lower corporation tax rate of 26% which 
is effective from 1 April 201 1 along with 
a credit of £3.2m in respect of prior 
year items. 
Proﬁt after tax
Reported proﬁt after tax for the year 
was £65.4m (2010: £57 .5m), an increase 
of 13.7% on the prior year. 
Earnings per share
Our track record of delivering stakeholder 
value through earnings growth continued 
this year. Basic EPS before other items 
increased by 15.9% to 22.6p per share 
(2010: 19 .5p per share). 
Basic EPS was 18.6p per share (2010: 16.9p 
per share), an increase of 10.1%. This latter 
measure showed lower growth due to 
the impact of in-year integration and 
restructuring costs that are non-recurring.
Dividend
It is MITIE’s policy to grow its dividend in 
line with adjusted earnings per share. The 
ﬁnal dividend proposed by the Board has 
increased by 19 .5% to 4.9p per share (2010: 
4.1p per share). This brings the full year 
dividend to 9 .0p per share (2010: 7 .8p per 
share), an increase of 15.4%. The full year 
dividend reﬂects a cover of 2.5 times 
adjusted earnings per share, in line with 
our dividend policy.
Cash ﬂow, funding and liquidity
The conversion of group earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) to cash for the year 
was achieved at a rate of 86.7% (2010: 
95.2%). The cash performance of the group 
remains strong and in excess of our stated 
key performance indicator which targets 
the conversion of EBITDA to cash, at or 
above 80% on a rolling 12 month basis. 
Cash conversion measures the success 
of the group in converting operating 
proﬁt (measured by EBITDA) to cash and 
demonstrates the quality of earnings 
and effective cash management. 
MITIE has consistently delivered cash 
conversion in excess of 90% over the last 
ﬁve years. We commented in last year’s 
annual report that we had consciously 
reduced the cash conversion target for 
the current year to 80% as we expected 
to invest in working capital to support 
the organic growth of the business. 
We recognised that larger scale FM 
contracts that were expected to enter 
our portfolio during the year would require 
the support of working capital during their 
early months of operation. We maintain 
our focus on cash, which has allowed us 
to deliver consistently strong performance 
in cash conversion over the last ﬁve years.

The gearing of the group has remained 
modest and net debt at 31 March 201 1 
was £7 6.5m (2010: £86.6m), representing a 
net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.65 (2010: 0.84). 
During the year we have focused on 
establishing a renewed and longer term 
funding platform for the group as part of 
our reﬁnancing strategy. On 16 December 
2010, MITIE successfully completed an 
issue of US private placement loan notes 
with institutional investors for a value of 
£100m. The issue consists of £40m of notes 
denominated in sterling and ﬁxed at an 
interest rate of 4.38% maturing in December 
2019 and £60m of notes denominated 
in US dollars ($96m) maturing in December 
201 7 . The US dollar denominated private 
placement proceeds have been 
swapped into sterling debt, with half ﬁxed 
at an interest rate of 3.88% and half with 
a ﬂoating sterling interest rate of LIBOR + 
1.26%. The proceeds were used to repay 
shorter dated bank facilities which were 
due to expire in 2012.
In addition, on 29 March 201 1, MITIE 
secured new committed banking facilities 
of £250m which will fall due for renewal 
in September 2015 and will be available 
for drawdown following the AGM in July 
201 1. The group also has further overdraft 
facilities of £40m. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
MITIE uses a set of clear ﬁnancial and  
non-ﬁnancial KPIs to measure and 
communicate critical aspects of our 
performance. These KPIs are aligned 
with our strategic objective of achieving 
sustainable proﬁtable growth and 
our ﬁnancial KPIs are speciﬁcally 
focused on the level and quality of our 
earnings and cash ﬂows, the control of 
capital expenditure and the sustainability 
of dividends. 
We have performed strongly against 
these measures again this year and have 
now demonstrated a ﬁve-year track 
record of strength in each. 
Details of our ﬁnancial KPIs are set out 
on page 14 of this report. 
Pensions
Our ﬁnancial strength remains unaffected 
by any signiﬁcant deﬁcit in respect of 
the deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes 
to which the group contributes. The net 
funding position of all the deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension arrangements included on 
the balance sheet is a deﬁcit of £3.0m 
(2010: £10.5m). This included a deﬁcit of 
£3.0m on the principal group scheme 
(2010: £6.8m). 
The group also contributes to a number 
of deﬁned contribution pension schemes 
as well as making contributions to its 
customers’ deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes under Admitted Body Local 
Government status as well as to other 
arrangements in respect of certain 
employees who have transferred to the 
group under TUPE. The group’s deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension obligations in respect 
of schemes in which it is committed to 
funding amounted to £0.0m (2010: £3.7m).
Following the announcement in the 
June 2010 budget, the UK government 
has announced that it will use the CPI 
measure of inﬂation rather than RPI to 
determine the level of future statutory 
pension increases. As CPI is lower than 
RPI, the application of CPI to the valuation 
of future pension liabilities results in 
a reduction in the value of pension 
obligations on the balance sheet. 
The move to a CPI based valuation base 
affects certain of the group’s deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension liabilities. The ﬁnancial 
implication of this has been treated as a 
change in deﬁned pension beneﬁts and 
recognised as a negative past service 
cost in the income statement. As a result 
of this change, a credit of £4.1m has been 
recognised in the income statement for 
the year ended 31 March 201 1.
Acquisitions
On 25 June 2010, MITIE acquired the 
integrated facilities management 
business of Dalkia in Ireland. This business 
provides integrated FM solutions for a 
range of clients in the public and private 
sectors operating across a range of 
industries including technology and 
communications, transport and logistics, 
manufacturing, utilities and ﬁnance. 
The total consideration payable will be up 
to €12.5m (£10.6m), with up to €2m (£1.8m) 
only payable dependent upon the 
business achieving a minimum level of 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and other speciﬁc 
targets. Initial consideration of €9 .5m 
(£7 .9m) and €1.0m (£0.9m) of deferred 
consideration was paid in cash during 
the year. From the date of ownership, 
the business has contributed revenue of 
£19 .4m and operating proﬁt before other 
items of £1.3m which is in line with our 
acquisition business case. Acquisition 
and integration costs of £0.3m and £1.0m 
respectively were incurred during the year 
ended 31 March 201 1.
MITIE also increased its stake to 50% in 
Service Management International for 
£0.5m. SMI uses a network of FM service 
providers in 34 different territories to tender 
global contracts in which MITIE delivers 
the UK services. Further details of these 
acquisitions can be found within Note 31 
to the accounts. 
MITIE’s entrepreneurial 
investment model 
In August 2010, MITIE purchased certain 
minority shareholdings of six MITIE 
subsidiary companies under their 
respective articles of association and 
shareholder agreements in accordance 
with arrangements under our 
entrepreneurial investment programme 
known as the MITIE Model. The total 
consideration for all six purchases 
amounted to £6.8m being satisﬁed as 
to £0.4m in cash and as to the remaining 
£6.4m by the issue of 3.0m new Ordinary 
shares of 2.5p each in MITIE Group PLC 
valued at 209 .2p per share, being the 
closing market price per share on 
28 July 2010.

46 MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


The Board recognises that the manner in which the group is governed is critical to the long-term success of the business 
and is committed to the principles of corporate governance, for which the Board is accountable to shareholders, as 
detailed in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 2008 (the Code). In May 2010, the Financial Reporting 
Council (‘FRC’) introduced the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the ‘New Code’). The disclosure requirements 
of the New Code apply to companies with accounting periods commencing on or after 29 June 2010. Accordingly, 
the disclosure requirements of the New Code will be reported in the 2012 corporate governance statement, however 
all other provisions of a continuing nature are referred to where relevant within this statement. This report, together with 
the Directors’ remuneration report, provides details of key aspects of MITIE’s corporate governance environment and 
explains the manner in which the Board has applied the principles and provisions of good governance as set out in 
Section 1 of the Code and the New Code where relevant. 
Throughout the reporting period, significant consideration has been given to the balance of the Board and its 
Committees and the Board is conscious of any non-compliance with the Code. During the year and before the 
retirement of Roger Goodman on 31 March 2011, the Board reflected a ratio of 4:5 of independent Directors to non-
independent Directors (excluding the Chairman) compared to a 1:1 requirement under the Code. The Board confirms 
that the group has complied with all relevant provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year other than 
as noted above.  
With effect from 1 April 2011, the Board complies with the provisions of Code A.3 and has going forward an equal 
number of independent and non-independent Directors (excluding the Chairman). 

Role of the Board  
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company and accordingly, reviews and agrees 
the strategy for the group proposed by the Executive Directors on an annual basis. In setting the strategy, the Board 
takes account of key matters such as market trends, competitive environment, private/public sector approach, 
international aspects, people and talent and the MITIE model (as explained further below) ensuring at all times that 
sufficient consideration is given to risk and internal controls. Matters that are exclusively dealt with by the Board include: 
setting group objectives and strategies, approving business plans and budgets and monitoring performance against 
these, approving material acquisitions, disposals and business start-ups, including any material transactions outside of 
the normal course of business, approving the Group’s Half-yearly and Annual Report and Accounts, appointing and 
removing the Chairman, Directors and Company Secretary, management of the group’s risk profile and monitoring the 
group’s corporate governance arrangements. Approvals are managed in accordance with the group’s delegated 
authorities and matters are also set out in a schedule of matters reserved for the Board which is available at 
www.mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance. 
Roles and responsibilities 
There is a clear division of responsibility between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive as formally set out in the 
terms of reference for each of these roles. The Chairman is a Non-Executive Director and is responsible for the effective 
running and leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness. The Chairman liaises with the Company Secretary on 
the annual Board plan, agrees and sets the Board agendas, ensuring at all times that there is sufficient time allocated 
for strategic discussions. The Chairman encourages openness and fluid communication between Executive and  
Non-Executive Directors, a culture which has been facilitated by meetings between the Chairman and individual 
Directors. The Chairman ensures that the Non-Executive Directors contribute effectively and that the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors are aware of the views of major shareholders. He is also responsible for ensuring that the 
Board addresses major challenges faced by MITIE and for the effective performance of the Board and its committees. 
The Chairman is available to consult with shareholders throughout the year and will be available at the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’). 
The Chief Executive is responsible for all aspects of the operation and management of the group and its business 
within the authorities delegated by the Board. She is responsible for developing and effectively implementing strategy 
following approval of the strategic and financial plan by the Board. The Chief Executive’s remit includes proposing 
investment into new business and geographical areas and ensuring at all times that the group’s risk profile is 
appropriately considered. She ensures the timely and accurate disclosure of information to the Board and to 
shareholders. She leads the Executive Directors and senior management team in the day-to-day running of the group’s 
business under clear delegation of authority from the Board. The Chief Executive maintains regular dialogue with the 
Chairman on all important Company matters and together they provide coherent leadership of the group.   Governance Accounts

 Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising their independent skill and judgement. In reviewing the proposals 
for the strategic direction of the group, the Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and probe the Executive 
Directors, offering a breadth of knowledge, experience and individual skills. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors 
are responsible for contributing to the formulation and development of strategy. During the reporting period, the  
Non-Executive Directors held one-to-one meetings with certain senior divisional management teams to gain wider 
understanding and appreciation for the business when approving strategy. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors 
monitor high level corporate reporting and satisfy themselves as to the integrity of financial information and the 
operation of key financial controls. The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors’ and the Executive 
Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the head office and at the AGM. 
The role of the Senior Independent Director is to make himself available to shareholders should they have concerns 
which have not been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director 
or for which such contact is inappropriate in the circumstances. The Senior Independent Director in particular reviews 
information on major shareholders and financial analysis to obtain a balanced understanding of the issues and 
concerns of shareholders. Explained further below is the Senior Independent Director’s role in succession planning 
and performance evaluation for the Chairman. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good communication flows within the Board and its committees 
and ensuring that Board procedures are complied with. 
Director indemnity 
The Company maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, providing appropriate cover for any legal action 
brought against its Directors and/or officers. The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company extend 
the protection provided to Directors in respect of any litigation against Directors relating to their position as a Director 
of the Company, and specifically provide that the Company may indemnify Directors against any liability incurred in 
connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company and that the 
Company may fund defence costs. Individual Directors would still be liable to pay damages awarded to the Company 
in any action against them by the Company and to repay their defence costs (to the extent funded by the Company) 
if their defence was unsuccessful.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


Composition of the Board 
The membership of the Board as at 31 March 2011 and biographical details of the Directors (including details of 
committee chairmanships and other positions held) are given on page 47. During the year one Executive Director, 
Roger Goodman, retired from the Board. To comply with provision B.7.1 of the New Code, all Directors will submit 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM and details are provided in the Notice of AGM which is also 
available at www.mitie.com/investors.  
During the year, Non-Executive Director independence was considered by the Board. The Board determined that 
all Non-Executive Directors as at 31 March 2011, with the exception of the Deputy Chairman Ian Stewart, were 
independent in mind and judgement, and free from any material relationship that could interfere with their ability 
to discharge their duties effectively. Specific consideration was given to David Jenkins’ prior role with Deloitte LLP 
MITIE’s external auditors and his term of appointment. The Board determined that David is independent given that he 
had not been involved in the provision of services to MITIE and the passage of time since his departure from Deloitte LLP 
in May 2004. The Board has determined that David continues to provide independent influence and constructive 
support to the Group in his role as Senior Independent Director. 
As part of the ongoing review of Board performance the Nomination Committee and the Board specifically reviewed 
the roles of Chairman and Senior Independent Director, and the composition and chairmanship of each of its 
committees. The Board is satisfied that its composition is appropriate having regard in particular to the integrity, skills, 
knowledge and experience of its Directors and the size and nature of the business, and having regard to its desire 
that the Board does not become too large and unwieldy. The Board as at 31 March 2011, following Roger Goodman’s 
retirement, was comprised of four independent Non-Executive Directors; a Non-Executive Director deemed non-
independent as a result of his prior role as Chief Executive of the group, the Non-Executive Chairman and three 
Executive Directors.  
The Board has four formally constituted committees: the Audit Committee, the Executive Committee, the Nomination 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee for which the duties and responsibilities of each are set out in the terms 
of reference which are available at www.mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance. All Board committees are 
provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties. Further details in relation to the composition, role and 
functioning of each committee are set out within this Directors’ report, with the exception of the Remuneration 
Committee which is explained further in the Remuneration report on page 61.  
The Executive Committee members are Ruby McGregor-Smith, Suzanne Baxter, Bill Robson and, until his retirement as 
a Director on 31 March 2011, Roger Goodman. It functions primarily as an approval and signing committee and meets 
on an ad hoc basis, as and when required. Powers are specifically delegated to the Committee by the Board as 
evidenced in the Board minutes and the group Delegated Authorities Register, and the Committee are instructed 
to revert to the Board should any further decision making be required. In addition, the group operates an Executive 
Board. It is not a formally constituted committee of the Board, operating solely under the delegated powers of the 
Chief Executive, but is charged with supporting the Chief Executive in the operational management of the group.  
Board appointments  
The Nomination Committee leads the process for appointments to the Board and makes appropriate 
recommendations to the Board. Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance with the Articles 
of Association of the Company and the provisions of the Companies Acts. As at 23 May 2011, the members of the 
Committee are: Roger Matthews (Committee Chairman), David Jenkins and Terry Morgan. Ruby McGregor-Smith 
stepped down from the Committee during the year but continues to attend meetings at the invitation of the Chairman.  
During the year, the Committee met to evaluate the balance and composition of the Board. The Committee is 
committed to ensuring that new Directors bring the requisite skills, knowledge and experience required for the role 
being considered. It oversaw the Board succession planning with relation to the retirement of Roger Goodman and 
determined that his responsibilities be maintained by the Executive Board members. In considering any succession for 
the role of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director chairs the Committee. In addition, with support from the 
newly appointed Group HR director, the Committee has introduced a separate meeting in the coming year, which will 
be attended by the Chief Executive and Group HR director, to address succession planning for the Board and across 
the Group to ensure that there is a sufficient mix of experience and skills. The Committee recognises the need for the 
Board to have a balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company as outlined in B.1 of the 
New Code and in the search for new candidates, the Committee has due regard for the benefits of diversity, including 
gender, in line with section B.2 of the New Code. New Director appointments recommended to the Board by the 
Committee are undertaken in accordance with the Committee’s objective appointment and recruitment process. 
Director commitments 
Executive Directors are permitted to accept appointments outside the group provided permission is sought from the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive and that the additional appointments do not interfere with the Directors’ ability 
to discharge their duties effectively. The commitments outside the group of the Executive Directors are detailed 
in the Remuneration report on page 64. Executive Directors are entitled to retain any fees earned from these 
external appointments.  Governance Accounts

 Director development 
The Board has a general policy that each new Director receives a tailored induction suitable to their role which includes 
visits to Company and key client sites, and that all new Directors receive a tailored information pack which includes 
a copy of MITIE’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, latest Annual Report and Accounts, committee terms of 
reference and copies of recent Board minutes and supporting papers. In addition to the induction pack, all Directors 
receive a copy of the Board Handbook, which contains essential information such as Board and committee terms of 
reference, an overview of Directors’ statutory duties, corporate governance and regulatory guidelines, a copy of the 
Board delegated authorities and an overview of the Company’s insurance arrangements. The Handbook is reviewed 
and updated regularly as and when regulatory developments arise.  
Director information and support 
Directors are supplied with an agenda and supporting papers for all Board meetings in a timely manner and, in the 
same timeframe, have access to a secure facility for accessing board packs electronically. This ensures that each 
Director is appropriately briefed and able to discharge their duties properly. Papers submitted regularly for the Board’s 
review include reports on health and safety, current trading and performance, corporate development activities and 
briefings from the Company Secretary on matters relating to corporate governance. The Board will also receive, from 
time to time, detailed presentations from non-Board members on operational matters. The Board, its committees and 
its Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and, where appropriate, external 
independent legal advice funded by MITIE. In addition to scheduled Board and committee meetings during the year, 
the Chairman met the Non-Executive Directors on several occasions without the Executive Directors being present and 
the chairman of the Audit Committee meets with the Group Finance Director on a regular basis. 
All Directors are expected to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively 
and, where possible, attend all Board meetings and the AGM. Any time commitment matters are addressed by the 
Chairman with the Director concerned. During the year ended 31 March 2011, there were six scheduled Board 
meetings. Additional unscheduled Board meetings were held to deal with the review and approval of acquisitions 
and issues relating to shares and other administrative matters. Each year, the Board holds a dedicated strategy meeting 
and a budget meeting. Directors’ attendance at scheduled Board and committee meetings (Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination) of which they are members is shown in the following table:

Directors’ Interests  
With regards to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, 
the Code, the New Code, the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders.  
Director conflicts 
The Board has a formal policy on the declaration and management of director conflicts in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of the Company which has operated effectively during the reporting period. Any potential 
situation or transactional conflict must be reported as soon as possible to the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the 
Company Secretary. Where a potential conflict is authorised (under the statutory powers and powers granted under 
the Articles of Association to the Board), such conflict is kept under on-going review.

Board evaluation and re-election 
The Board is committed to effective and rigorous review of its performance and that of the committees and individual 
Directors, and accordingly a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees 
and of each Director is performed annually. Director performance evaluation for the current year has been carried 
out using a combination of formal appraisal questionnaires completed by all Board members and through meetings 
and discussions. This process includes feedback on the performance of the Chairman which is reviewed by the Senior 
Independent Director and independent discussions are held as required with the Non-Executive Directors in order to 
appraise the performance of the Chairman. The results of these reviews are reported to the Board and used to improve 
the Board’s performance. Results of the prior year appraisal process identified an overall level of satisfaction with the 
performance of the Board and that of its committees and Directors. Notwithstanding this, several further improvements 
in Board operation have been implemented during the reporting year, including introducing a separate meeting to 
deal with strategic planning each year which is followed up with defined actions to be reported back to the Board, 
clearer focus within management reporting on strategic matters and a strengthening of the HR support for the 
Remuneration Committee. As part of the formal Board evaluation, the Board has considered the performance of each 
Director and is satisfied that they continue to be effective and demonstrate clear commitment to their role. To comply 
with provision B.7.1 of the New Code all Directors are subject to annual re-elections. The Board is currently considering its 
approach to the externally facilitated performance evaluation of Directors every three years in accordance with B.6.2 
of the New Code. 

Financial and business reporting 
The Company is required to set out a fair review of the business of the group during the reporting period 
including an analysis of the position of the group at the end of the reporting period and the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the group. Details of the Business review are contained in this Directors’ and Governance report 
and the following sections of this Annual Report and Accounts:  
− the Chairman’s statement on page 4 and 5;  
− the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to 11;  
− the Key Performance Indicators on pages 12  1 ;  
− the Marketplace overview on pages 30 and 31; 
− the Operating review which includes the business model on pages 31 to 34;  
− the Sustainability review on pages 35 to 38; 
− the Financial review on pages 39 to 43; and 
− Factors that could affect our business on pages 44 and 45. 
Collectively these sections present a balanced assessment of the Company’s position and prospects. They demonstrate 
how the Directors have acted in the way most likely to promote the success of the Company, explaining how the 
Company generates and preserves value over the longer term and provides an overview of the strategy for delivering 
the Company’s objectives. 
Going concern 
The Directors acknowledge the Financial Reporting Council’s Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies issued in October 2009. The group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the Business review as referred to on pages 6 to 45. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial review on 
pages 40 to 43. In addition, Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements includes details of the group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The group’s financial forecasts, taking into account possible sensitivities in trading performance, indicate that the group 
will be able to operate within the level of its committed borrowing facilities. 
The group’s committed borrowing facilities comprise £100m of US Private Placement Loan Notes expiring between 
December 2017 and December 2019 which were issued in December 2010 and its committed banking facilities. 
The group renegotiated its banking facilities in March 2011 and its new committed facility of £250m will be available 
for drawdown in July 2011, subject to the approval of an amendment to the Articles of Association at the forthcoming 
AGM to clarify the definition of borrowing limits. Until that point, the group’s existing committed banking facility of 
£230m remains available for use by the group. The new committed facility will remain in place until September 2015. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts.

 Risk management and internal control 
The Board recognises that it is responsible for determining the level of risk acceptable that is appropriate for the group 
when establishing and operating to achieve the group’s strategic objectives. The Board is responsible for the group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is designed to support the group’s pursuit of 
achieving its objectives and strategies and also the identification and management of risks that may impact upon MITIE 
and upon the environment in which the group operates. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve these objectives and strategies and it will only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement and loss. 
Internal control framework 
The Board and senior management are responsible for maintaining and developing a culture of integrity, competence, 
fairness and responsibility throughout the group. Essential to this is the recruitment and retention of highly skilled 
individuals who promote the highest standards of integrity, competence, governance and ethical behaviour. Group 
policies and procedures support the business by providing an operational internal control framework for the group, 
each division and operating business to work within. This framework is designed to balance the need for group-wide 
consistency and control with the autonomy that local management require to develop and manage each operating 
business successfully. In order to delegate responsibilities clearly and effectively to the group’s operating businesses 
and to ensure compliance with the matters reserved for the Board, a formal delegated authorities matrix is issued to 
all operating subsidiaries that includes both financial and non-financial authorities and matters relating to strategy, 
contract approval, recruitment, capital expenditure, banking transactions and specific group policies. Each operating 
subsidiary is headed by a managing or regional director who has authority to manage their business within this 
framework of delegated authorities and group policies and procedures outlined above. To support the business further, 
the group has a team of specialist resources with individuals responsible for specific functions including legal, health 
and safety, IT, insurance, human resources, tax, pensions, purchasing, finance and business risk. Regular dialogue 
between these functions and the operating businesses provides additional support and forms a key part of the system 
of internal control. 
Monitoring the system of internal control 
Monitoring is carried out throughout the year via the receipt and review of various reports, presentations and discussions 
with management, as set out above. Specifically, the Audit Committee supports the Board by monitoring and guiding 
the activities of the internal audit function, including approving the internal audit programme, reviewing regular 
internal audit reports from the business risk function and via meetings with the Head of Business Risk. The internal audit 
programme is designed to provide a level of assurance over key risks as identified in the group risk register and is 
developed by the Head of Business Risk who reports to the General Counsel and independently to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the external auditors who contribute a further 
independent perspective on certain aspects of the internal financial control systems arising from their work. 
As necessary, the Audit Committee will have dialogue with the Executive Directors on their control responsibilities and 
in particular, those relating to specific matters reported by internal or external auditors. To further encourage a culture 
of risk management within the business, the Executive Board regularly reviews the programme of risk management 
undertaken across the group to demonstrate the importance of the management and assessment of risk at a senior 
level. 
Risk management 
The Board confirms that there is a continuing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced 
by the group which has been reviewed and improved during the reporting period with support from Grant Thornton. 
This work has focused on the assurance framework that exists within the group, the use and compilation of risk registers 
and an increase in the use of computer assisted audit techniques. The Board confirms that its risk assessment process 
has been in place throughout the reporting year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts 
and that this process is monitored by the Board in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council. Specifically, the Board considers the nature and extent of the significant risks it takes in 
setting strategy which are detailed further in the section regarding risk factors that could affect the business on pages 
44 and 45. The process for identifying, evaluating and managing risks requires the group and its principal businesses to 
consider strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks and the effectiveness of the mitigating controls based 
on a pre and post-controls risk evaluation. The principal risks identified from this process are recorded on the group’s 
risk register which is maintained by the group’s Business Risk function. This register is reviewed periodically by the Board. 
The risk register forms the basis of the internal audit programme for each year with risk areas reviewed on an annual 
to triennial basis dependent upon materiality and inherent risk assessment. During the reporting period, the Board 
has been considering the introduction of the Bribery Act 2010 and accordingly, has implemented a revised Fraud 
Policy and accompanying procedures to mitigate the risks posed within the business. ‘Whistleblowing’ activity is 
communicated to the Audit Committee along with the results of investigations carried out. These investigations have 
not identified any risks that result in a material, unmitigated exposure to the group. 
52 MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

 
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control 
In line with Turnbull Guidance and C.2.1 of the New Code, the Board performs a formal annual assessment of the 
operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control covering all material controls, including financial, 
operation and compliance controls, and updates this assessment prior to the signing of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. The Board also holds discussions with senior management and reviews the results of a formal internal controls 
review and system effectiveness confirmation from each operating subsidiary. The Head of Business Risk attends each 
Audit Committee meeting to provide regular updates on the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls. The Board 
confirms that management has taken steps during the year to improve the system of internal control, embed effective 
controls further into the operations of the group and to address improvements as they come to management’s 
attention. These steps are monitored at executive level to ensure they are implemented appropriately and that 
they are effective. 
Consolidated accounts preparation and financial reporting 
The consolidated accounts of the group are prepared by the Group Finance function that is responsible for the review 
and compilation of reports and financial results from each of the operating divisions and subsidiaries within the group, 
in accordance with the group internal control and reporting procedures. Each operating division supports its report and 
results submission with a statement of compliance with the group’s principal internal controls which is subject to review 
and sample audit by the internal audit function. In addition, the representations made by the Board in support of the 
consolidated financial statements including those in relation to the operating divisions are supported by detailed 
papers and cascaded reporting requirements throughout the group, which are reviewed by either the group finance 
team or internal audit and presented to the Audit Committee and the Board for final approval as appropriate.  
Internal control systems: information and communication 
The group maintains a number of systems and processes that report relevant information to group executive 
management and the Board as necessary. This includes financial and non-financial information regarding business 
performance, compliance with policy and procedure, relevant regulations and business critical matters. At an 
operational level each division and business holds regular board and management meetings. To maintain and develop 
relationships between separate divisions and to address specific matters, regional meetings are also held and are 
attended by regional representatives of each division. Senior group management also regularly attend these meetings. 
The Audit Committee 
The Company has a formally constituted Audit Committee comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Audit Committee is generally responsible for: 
− monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the group’s corporate reporting which includes any formal announcements 
relating to the group’s financial performance, and any significant financial reporting judgements therein; 
− monitoring and reviewing the independence and objectivity of the group’s external auditors, the objectivity and 
effectiveness of the audit process and the effectiveness and implementation of the group policy on the provision of 
non-audit services (the Non-Audit Services Policy);  
− monitoring and reviewing the integrity and effectiveness of the group’s internal financial controls environment, 
internal audit function and business risk management structures; and 
− making recommendations to the Board on shareholder resolutions for the appointment of, and remuneration for, 
external auditors.  
The chairman of the Committee will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the work of the 
Committee. 
Committee composition 
The Committee consists entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by David Jenkins. During the 
year the Audit Committee comprised: David Jenkins, Terry Morgan and Larry Hirst. The composition of the Committee 
meets the requirements of the Code. 
All members of the Committee are considered as being appropriately experienced to fulfil their duties and David 
Jenkins continues to be deemed by the Board as at the date of this report, to have significant, recent and relevant 
financial experience through his qualifications and held appointments.  
Meetings of the Committee 
During the year the Audit Committee held three meetings (see summary of meeting attendance on page 51). The 
Audit Committee invited the external auditors, Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Head of 
Business Risk to attend relevant parts of the meetings of the Committee. The matters under consideration at these 
meetings included: 
− generally monitoring the group’s corporate reporting process and the statutory audit of the annual Group accounts; 
− the Half-yearly Financial Report and Annual Report and Accounts; 
− critical accounting policies and judgements;  Governance Accounts
MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
Overview Business review Governance

 − the review of the external auditors’ audit plan, nature and scope of work and overall summary of key issues 
and judgements; 
− the re-appointment of the external auditors; 
− the approval of fees for the external auditors; 
− the effectiveness of the external auditors including the appropriateness and skills of the audit team; 
− compliance with the Non-Audit Services Policy by the external auditors and maintenance of auditor independence; 
− the approval of the group risk assurance framework and the internal audit plan for the year ending 31 March 2011; 
− the review of key internal audit reports and findings; and 
− generally monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control, audit and risk management systems and functions. 
The Committee also met separately with the external auditors and the Head of Business Risk met with the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee without the presence of the Executive Directors. 
Internal audit function 
The remit of the Audit Committee includes the monitoring of the internal audit function and the arrangements by which 
employees may raise concerns regarding any matters of financial reporting or other perceived improprieties across 
the group. The group’s internal audit function reports directly to the Group Counsel and the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. The Committee continues to review the size and composition of the internal audit function to ensure that it 
remains effective given the increasing size and complexity of the group and the emphasis placed upon remediation, 
rectification and re-audit of issues identified through the internal audit programme.  
External auditor 
Prior to 1994, MITIE was audited by BDO Binder Hamlyn who merged their practice with Deloitte. Since 1994, MITIE Group 
PLC has been audited by the firm now known as Deloitte LLP (previously Touche Ross & Co, Deloitte & Touche and 
Deloitte & Touche LLP). Each year the Audit Committee reviews auditor performance in respect of audit services, audit 
related services and non-audit services. The Audit Committee is committed to ensuring the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors and confirms that the requirements of the Non-Audit Services Policy have been met 
throughout the year. When considering the appointment of the external auditor, there are no contractual obligations 
that restrict the Audit Committee’s capacity to recommend a particular firm for appointment. The lead audit 
engagement partner is rotated every five years, with the next rotation due in respect of the year ending 31 March 2014. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied with the performance of the external auditor and after due consideration, has 
recommended the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP to the Board. 
The Audit Committee has approved a Non-Audit Services Policy that ensures that the Audit Committee has visibility 
over the levels of non-audit work performed by the auditors and requires notification to the chairman of the Audit 
Committee for any non-audit spend with the auditors that, on an annual basis cumulatively exceeds 50% of the annual 
audit fee and/or where any item, regardless of amount, is considered significant. The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
this policy provides sufficient control over the levels of non-audit spend with the Auditors whilst providing sufficient 
flexibility for the Group Finance Director to approve expenditure on advice below those levels. This policy also restricts 
the external auditors from performing work which will result in them auditing their own work, making management 
decisions for the group, creating a conflict of interest, finding themselves in the role of advocate for MITIE or creating 
any potential threat to their independence. Additionally, the external auditors will only be considered for the provision 
of non-audit services if they are best suited to perform the work in question. Deloitte LLP also maintains its own internal 
controls designed to safeguard its independence. A summary of the fees paid to the external auditors is given in Note 6 
to the financial statements. 
Disclosure of information to the auditors 
Each of the Directors in office as of the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts confirms that: 
− so far as he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information required by the auditors in the 
preparation of their report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
− he/she has each taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of such information. 
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Re-appointment of auditors 
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and the resolution to re-appoint them will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

The Board is committed to an on-going pro-active dialogue with institutional and private investors and welcomes 
the introduction of the UK Stewardship Code applicable to institutional shareholders, to further encourage engagement 
between the Company and its shareholders. The principal method of communication between the Board and 
shareholders is via news announcements, the Interim Management Statements, the Half-yearly Financial Report, the 
Annual Report and Accounts, the Sustainability Report and MITIE’s website (www.mitie.com). A full programme of 
formal and informal events, institutional investor meetings and presentations are also held following the Half yearly 
and Preliminary Results announcements which are led by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.  
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are available for additional meetings with shareholders upon request. 
The Board encourages the on-going dialogue between the Directors and investors and as such all Directors were 
present at the 2010 AGM and made themselves available for direct discussions with shareholders. Latest group 
information, financial reports, corporate governance and sustainability matters, Half-yearly and Preliminary Results 
presentations, major shareholder information and all announcements are made available to shareholders 
via the MITIE website (www.mitie.com) which has a specific area dedicated to investor relations.  
Significant importance is attached to investor feedback on the group’s performance, and as such the Executive 
Board receives an investor relations report at each meeting detailing corporate news, share price activity, investor 
relations activity and major shareholder movements. The Board is updated by the Executive Directors on these matters 
and receive the monthly Chief Executive’s report which has a section dedicated to investor feedback and broker 
updates and detailed analyst and investor feedback following the Half-yearly and Preliminary Results presentations. 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board is made aware of the issues and concerns of the major 
shareholders. The AGM also allows shareholders to address and discuss any issues surrounding the group directly 
with the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
Electronic communications 
The Directors remain committed to improving and extending the electronic methods in which the Company 
communicates with its shareholders, not only allowing the latest information on the group to be provided instantly 
but recognising the environmental benefits. The Board encourages each shareholder to join the growing number of 
investors electing to receive their information electronically and further details on how to register are provided on the 
inside back cover of this report. 

Financial results and dividends 
A detailed commentary on the financial results of the group for the year is contained within the financial review on 
pages  to 43 of this report. The profit before taxation for the financial year is £86.8m (2010: £79.7m). The Directors have 
recommended and paid the following dividends during the year: 
− recommended a total Ordinary dividend of 9.0p per share for the year ended 31 March 2011 (2010: 7.8p) with a total 
value of £31.9m based upon the number of shares issued as at 23 May 2011 (2010: £27.6m)

The final dividend for the year will be paid on 12 August 2011, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, to Ordinary 
shareholders on the register on 24 June 2011. The Company operates a Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP) which 
allows shareholders to build their holding by using the cash dividend to purchase additional shares in MITIE. Further 
details on the operation of the DRIP are included at the back of this report and are available from MITIE’s Registrar. 
During the reporting period, the trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts waived dividends on shares held. 
Shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust are for the operation of the Company’s employee share schemes as 
explained further on page 65. 

Share capital and powers of shareholders 
The group is financed through both equity share capital and debt instruments. Details of changes to the Company’s 
share capital are given in Note 29 to the financial statements. The Company has a single class of shares – 2.5p Ordinary 
shares – with no right to any fixed income and with each share carrying the right to one vote at general meetings of the 
Company. Under the Company’s Articles of Association, holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to participate in any 
dividends pro-rata to their holding. The Board may propose and pay interim dividends and recommend a final dividend 
for approval by the shareholders at the AGM. A final dividend may be declared by the shareholders in a general 
meeting by ordinary resolution, but such dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Board.

In December 2010, the Company completed an issue of US private placement loan notes with institutional investors. 
The issue consisted of £40m of notes denominated in sterling and fixed at 4.38% maturing in nine years and £60m of 
notes denominated in US dollars ($96m) maturing in seven years. The US dollar denominated private placement 
proceeds were swapped into sterling debt with half fixed at 3.88% and half with a floating sterling interest rate of LIBOR 
plus 1.26%. 
On 29 March 2011, the group renegotiated its banking facilities and its new committed facility of £250m will be 
available for drawdown in July 2011 subject to the approval of an amendment to the Articles of Association at the 
forthcoming AGM to clarify the definition of borrowing limits. Further details can be found in the Notice of AGM. 
Restrictions on the trading of shares 
Certain shares that are issued as consideration upon acquisition by the Company of the shares of minority shareholders 
in MITIE Model companies have restrictions placed upon them that both prevent the transfer of such shares and/or 
attach specific claw-back provisions for periods of up to two years following allotment. Otherwise, there are no specific 
restrictions on the size of any shareholding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the provisions of the 
Articles of Association of the Company (available at www. mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance) and prevailing 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between Company shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital. Details of employee share schemes are set out below and in Note 34 to the Accounts.  
Share capital authorisations 
The 2010 AGM authorised: 
− the Directors to allot (under s551 Companies Act 2006) shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £3,318,825.41 
shares representing one third of the issued share capital plus 15,029,127 outstanding commitment in respect of options 
granted under MITIE’s share schemes (such total equating to 37.59% of the issued share capital as at 31 March 2010)  
– during the reporting period, the Directors utilised this authority (and the preceding authority) to allot 4,615,605 shares 
to an aggregate nominal amount of £115,390.13 to employees participating in MITIE’s share schemes and to minority 
shareholders in consideration for MITIE Model shares as explained further below; 
− the dis-application (under Section 570(1) Companies Act 2006) of pre-emption rights over allotted shares up to an 
aggregate nominal value equal to £441,464.63 or a maximum 17,658,585 shares (representing 5% of the issued share 
capital as at 31 March 2010) – during the reporting period, the Directors utilised this authority (and the preceding 
authority) to allot 4,615,605 shares to an aggregate nominal amount of £115,390.13 to employees participating in 
MITIE’s share schemes and to minority shareholders in consideration for MITIE Model shares as explained further below; 
and 
− the Company to make market purchases of its own shares up to a total of 35,317,170 shares (representing 10% of the 
issued share capital as at 31 March 2010) – during the reporting period, the Directors did not utilise this authority. 
Further details of these authorisations are available in the notes to the 2010 Notice of AGM (available at  
www.mitie.com/investors). Shareholders are referred to the 2011 Notice of AGM (which is available at 
www.mitie.com/investors) which contains similar provisions in respect of the Company’s equity share capital. 
During the year to 31 March 2011 there have been no purchases by the Company of MITIE shares. The exact amount 
and timing of future purchases will be determined by the Company and will be dependent on market conditions and 
other factors. It is the Company’s present intention to cancel any shares it buys back, rather than hold them in treasury, 
but this policy will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Further details on the proposed renewal of powers for share 
buyback and the allotment of shares in the Company are provided in the Notice of AGM. 
Under the terms of certain shareholder agreements and articles of association relating to MITIE Model companies, 
certain minority shareholders in such companies may provide an option for the purchase by the Company of their 
minority shares. The mechanism for calculating the price to be paid in respect of such transfer is transparent, on an 
arms-length basis, and in accordance with the pricing structure generally applicable for other transfers under the 
MITIE Model. In consideration for these purchases, the Company generally has the option to settle payment in cash 
or in MITIE shares. On 12 August 2010, the Company announced the purchase of certain minority shareholdings in six 
MITIE subsidiary companies. The selling shareholders gave certain warranties and assurances relating to past and future 
performance of the relevant subsidiary companies. The shares issued in consideration are being held in safe custody 
for a maximum period of two years and may be sold to meet any claims that the Company may have in the future in 
relation to those warranties and assurances. Details of these structures are generally available (to the extent 
incorporated into the articles of association for individual MITIE Model companies) from Companies House at 
www.companieshouse.gov.uk.  
Other share matters 
There are a number of other agreements with provisions that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company such as bank facility agreements and employee share plans. None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business or the group as a whole. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs solely because of a take-over bid.

Employee involvement and employee equity-based incentivisation 
The Board remains committed to fostering and developing a culture of employee involvement in the business through 
communication with employees and equity involvement whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the 
Company through the Company’s various equity-based incentive schemes.  
Communication with MITIE’s employees continues to have a high priority. The group communicates with employees 
through the use of Group-wide mailings, employee magazines and updates, employee-focused initiatives and media 
networks and provision of access to broadcasts of periodic financial presentations.  
We are also committed to developing our use of social media tools as an effective way of communicating with our 
people as we recognise that these methods can provide great ways of allowing our people to give us feedback, share 
ideas and engage with the wider MITIE community. 
Our social media tools are supported by a new, Group-wide intranet system that was launched during the year. 
The system has already improved communications and information sharing across the business and includes regular 
blog updates by the Executive Board members and functional teams.  
Through the use of their own communication processes each of the group’s businesses is encouraged to ensure that 
employees are kept informed on Group and individual business developments and social networking sites continue to 
play an important part of engagement and communication with employees.  
The group continues to operate its Group-wide MITIE Stars-programme to recognise and reward exceptional 
performance by its people. The MITIE’s Got Talent, Group-wide talent contest continues to be supported and 
encourages employee engagement and recognition. The Group Sustainability Report contains further details of these 
initiatives and is available from www.mitie.com. Employees remain actively involved in the group’s activities via an 
employee forum. This year the forum held two meetings and included presentations by senior management or 
functional heads as requested by the employee representatives. The Board will continue to seek increasing involvement 
and activity of the employee representatives.  
The Board believes that the group’s culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver in the group’s growth 
performance and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees. During the year the 
group has continued to operate the MITIE Long Term Incentive Plan to incentivise and reward senior members of the 
MITIE management team, the Executive Share Option Scheme for certain other employees and the Savings Related 
Share Option Scheme which is open to all eligible employees of the group. During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness and suitability of the group’s employee share schemes and recommended to 
the Board amendments to equity-incentive schemes as outlined further in the Remuneration report and Notice of AGM, 
specifically the introduction of a Share Incentive Plan to be available to all employees and therefore encouraging 
wider equity participation within the group. The Board believes that the changes proposed to shareholders maximise 
the accessibility, effectiveness and incentive value of equity schemes. 
The group has historically grown by giving entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth by taking the risk 
of starting a new business, taking equity stakes at fair value in those new businesses in conjunction with MITIE and then, 
dependent on a pre-agreed pricing structure, offering to sell that stake to MITIE predominantly in exchange for MITIE 
shares, at the option of MITIE. This incentivisation scheme typically provides for such managers to elect to offer their 
stake in their business to MITIE between the fifth and tenth years from the date of establishment of the business.   Governance Accounts

Recipients of shares under this incentivisation scheme are generally restricted from selling the MITIE shares received 
as consideration for a minimum of two years. The Board believes that this is a unique business model that has driven 
MITIE’s past performance and continues to ensure a close alignment of interest between MITIE shareholders and the 
management and employees of the group. Accordingly, on 17 January 2011, the group launched a £10m 
Entrepreneurial Fund to back management teams with innovative ideas for starting mutually owned businesses. 
Employee diversity and inclusion 
The Board remains committed to developing further a culture that encourages the inclusion and diversity of all of 
the group’s employees through respecting and appreciating their differences and to promoting the continuous 
development of employees through skills enhancement and training programmes. The group’s employment policies 
are designed to attract, retain, train and motivate the very best people, recognising that this can be achieved only 
through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other 
aspect of diversity. Applications from disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. It is the policy of the group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled 
persons (including those who become disabled whilst employees of the group) should, as far as reasonably possible, 
be identical to that of other employees.  
The Company actively supports diversity and inclusion and during the reporting period, established a Diversity & 
Inclusion Steering Group to heighten awareness of diversity issues and accordingly oversaw the launch of a dedicated 
diversity week. Activities included presentations, workshops and training sessions focused on equality and diversity 
issues. Further information can be found within the group’s dedicated Sustainability Report which can be found at 
www.mitie.com. 
Financial instruments 
The group’s financial instruments include bank loans, finance leases, overdrafts, US private placement loan notes and 
performance guarantees. In addition, various other financial instruments such as trade creditors and trade debtors arise 
from its trade. The use of interest rate swaps and currency derivatives are used to manage interest and currency risk 
when necessary or material. The principal objective of these instruments is to raise funds for general corporate purposes 
and to manage financial risk. Further details of these instruments are given in Note 24 to the financial statements.  
Finance costs 
The amount of interest capitalised by the group is set out in further detail in Note 9 to the financial statements. 
Payment of creditors 
The group’s policy is to comply with the terms of payment agreed with suppliers, preferably on the group’s standard 
purchasing terms (as notified to suppliers), or otherwise to adhere to the suppliers’ standard terms. A copy of the 
group’s standard purchasing terms can be found at www.mitie.com/suppliers. At 31 March 2011, the group had 
36 days’ purchases outstanding (2010: 31 days). 
Fixed assets 
The Board does not believe that there is any material difference between the book value and the current open market 
value of the group’s interests in land and buildings. 
Events after the balance sheet date 
There have not been any significant events since the balance sheet date. 
Future developments 
The operating review sets out the Board’s view on likely future developments of the group. 
Research and development 
Given the nature of the group’s activities it does not carry out any material research and development work. 
Donations 
Donations to charity and community projects made during the year amounted to £190,738 (2010: £110,500). It is the 
group’s policy not to make political donations, and during the reporting period no political contributions were made 
(2010: £nil). The total value of community investment was £534,015 (2010: £392,483).  
Branch offices 
The group operate registered branch offices in the Republic of Ireland and the Isle of Man. Further details of the group’s 
principal subsidiaries are given in Note 37 to the financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare 
the financial statements for the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (IFRS) and have chosen to prepare Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
In the case of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounts, International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with IFRS 
where applicable. The Directors are also required to properly select and apply accounting policies, present information, 
including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information and, provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific IFRS requirements is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance.  
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year 
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently, make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent and state whether 
applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Company, safeguarding the assets, taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities, and the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration 
report which comply with the relevant requirements of the Companies Acts, Listing Rules and Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (DTRs).  
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Financial statements 
published by the Company on this website are prepared in accordance with UK legislation which may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  
To the best of each Director’s knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards and contained within this Annual Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole and the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with the description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

General remuneration principles 
The Committee is responsible for formulating remuneration policies and principles that promote the success of the 
Company in creating value for shareholders over the longer term, through alignment with the corporate objectives 
and business strategy after taking into full account the associated risks. The Committee understands that it is 
accountable to shareholders for the decisions made on Executive remuneration and seeks to maintain open and 
constructive communication where changes on remuneration policy are being proposed. 
The remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors and other group senior executives is shaped by 
the requirement to align the interests and individual performance of the Senior Executive team with those of MITIE’s 
shareholders. The policy has particular regard to the Company’s and the group’s long-standing culture of encouraging 
equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment.  
The Committee, and the Board, continue to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving 
force in the past success of the group. Consequently, in order to maintain and further develop MITIE’s performance 
culture, the Committee believes that the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors should continue to contain 
significant performance-related equity-based elements. 
The Remuneration Committee believes exceptional performance should be matched with appropriate remuneration 
to attract, retain and motivate Directors and management while being mindful of the behaviour that such packages 
create. The Committee ensures that packages are linked to and support the long-term performance of the Company.  
Remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Company’s remuneration principles. 
The Company’s policy is: 
Performance linked Company performance determines a significant element of remuneration packages. 
Only top-end performance can achieve the stretching targets that are reflected in the 
performance-linked pay elements of the packages. 
Shareholder aligned The discretionary share schemes are based on EPS growth aligning the interests of 
shareholders and the members of the senior executive team. Bonuses are structured 
to reward the attainment of the strategic target of long-term sustainable, profitable 
growth. 
Comprehensive and simple The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated 
and encourages Executives to concentrate on growth of the group. 
The Remuneration Committee believes, and is satisfied that, the remuneration policy is appropriate and takes account 
of the group’s performance and strategic objectives. 
The Committee plans to continue to use this approach and policy as a framework for the setting of future packages, 
whilst having due regard for the remuneration packages offered across the group and the external market. 
Share ownership policy 
A share ownership policy for Executive Directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP. Under this policy, 
all Executive Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of 
base salary (150% of salary for any Executive Director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of base salary). 
The Committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP 
awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected 
to retain no fewer than 50% of shares (net of taxes) that vest under the LTIP.

The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element (salary and certain benefits) and a variable 
element (annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity based incentives) and has been structured in order 
to align the Executive Directors’ packages with the interests of shareholders. The Committee tests the remuneration 
structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the 
market. The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the Executive Directors’ packages is set out below. 
Base salary 
Benchmarking is conducted by external remuneration consultants against sector and size comparators, in respect 
of base salary, total cash (ie salary plus bonus) and total remuneration. The Committee also takes account of a range 
of other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills 
of the individual Directors.  
The Executive Directors received salary increases during the year that took account of the range of factors described 
above the continued growth and performance of the group and the performance of the individual executive directors, 
with due consideration of the outcomes of the benchmarking exercise.  
Annual bonus 
Variable remuneration is designed to drive MITIE’s performance and be aligned to the group strategic objective 
of achieving long-term sustainable, profitable growth. The annual bonus rewards mainly short-term Company 
performance but also has a link to longer-term performance through partial delivery in MITIE Group PLC shares. 
During 2010/11, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 125% of salary, with any bonus earned 
above 100% of salary deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years and forfeited should the Director leave the 
business during this period. As in the previous year, up to100% of salary could be earned for the achievement of group 
budgeted financial performance and, following an amendment by the Remuneration Committee in May 2010, the 25% 
additional level of bonus for 2010/11 would be assessed on a series of non-financial strategic targets. In setting the non-
financial strategic targets, the Remuneration Committee had due consideration of the longer-term success of the 
Company and the aligning of interests with shareholders. The Remuneration Committee continue to believe that the 
performance targets for the annual bonus are sufficiently stretching for the maximum bonus payment. 
During the year under review, MITIE achieved the financial performance target in full and 100% of base salary was 
paid in cash. The Remuneration Committee decided that significant overall progress had been achieved on the non-
financial strategic targets and therefore awarded a further 25% of base salary, deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares 
for two years. 
As at the date of the report, the Committee expects the annual bonus structure for 2011/12 to remain broadly unchanged. 
Share-based incentives 
The remuneration package reinforces long-term decision making and sustainable profitable growth through the use of 
share-based incentives. For Executive Directors and certain senior group executives, the principal methodologies and 
schemes designed to support this ethos are the Company’s LTIP (as described on page 65) and the Share Ownership 
Policy (as described on page 62). Vesting of share awards under the LTIP are based on performance measured over 
three years. This period is considered appropriate to align rewards to Executive Directors with the strategic objectives of 
the Company. Certain Executive Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS (details of the holdings are set out 
in Table 4 of Section B below). It is the intention of the Committee not to issue further ESOS options to Executive Directors, 
although ESOS continues to be used to reward and incentivise certain other members of the senior group executive 
and management teams. Details of the amendments to share schemes applicable below Board level are detailed 
on page 65.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

 

Other standard benefits 
The other benefits awarded to the Executive Directors consist of contributions to a pension scheme, private healthcare 
and the provision of a car allowance. 

All Directors are appointed for an indeterminate period of office but are subject to annual re-election at the AGM in 
accordance with the New Code. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the head office and 
at the AGM. All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which provide for a maximum of 12 months’ 
notice from either party. There are no provisions for compensation on termination of employment set out within the 
contracts of the Executive Directors. The dates of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below:

R McGregor-Smith  Rolling contract  01-Apr-03 12 months
S C Baxter  Rolling contract  10-Apr-06 12 months
W Robson  Rolling contract  01-Apr-03 12 months

The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to non-executive positions at other companies 
can be beneficial both for the individual Director and the group through the broadening of their experience and 
knowledge. Ruby McGregor-Smith receives fees of £51,000 per annum in respect of her role as a Non-Executive 
Director of Michael Page International plc. As set out in the Directors’ and Governance Report, Executive Directors 
are entitled to retain any fees earned from external appointments.  

Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
The fee level is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals 
with the experience and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the group. The Non-
Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairing a committee, together with expenses 
incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in any of the Company’s share schemes or the annual bonus scheme, nor do they receive pension or ancillary benefits. 
Further details of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are provided in Table 1 of Section B below. 
Non-Executive Directors’ engagement terms 
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the 
head office and at the AGM. The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for an initial term of three years which is 
terminable on either three or six months’ notice and thereafter on a rolling term.

Equity-based incentive schemes 
During the reporting period, the Committee has thoroughly reviewed the Company’s share-based incentive schemes 
to ensure their continued effectiveness. The group currently operates three equity-based incentive schemes as set 
out below. The Board is proposing the renewal of scheme rules where indicated below and the introduction of new 
schemes as detailed. The interests of the Executive Directors in each of these schemes is set out in Tables 4 and 5 of 
Section B below.  
2001 SAYE Scheme (‘2001 SAYE’) 
The 2001 SAYE Scheme is the Company’s non-discretionary option scheme open to all eligible employees and is 
approved for HMRC purposes. Salary deductions are made and savings are used to purchase the options at the end 
of the three-year period. No options have been issued to any Directors under the 2001 SAYE Scheme. An award may 
not be granted under the 2001 SAYE Scheme rules after September 2011, when the scheme expires.  
Following a review by the Remuneration Committee, the Board continues to believe that the SAYE Scheme encourages 
equity participation for all employees and proposes the introduction of new SAYE Scheme rules (‘2011 SAYE’), details of 
which can be found in the Notice of AGM. In addition to the introduction of the 2011 SAYE, the Board proposes the 
introduction of a new Share Incentive Plan (‘2011 SIP’) which allows employees to use their salary to purchase shares in 
the Company. Further details of the scheme are found in the Notice of AGM. 
2001 Executive Share Option Scheme (‘2001 ESOS’) 
The 2001 ESOS is a discretionary scheme and therefore not open to all employees of the group. The award of options 
under the 2001 ESOS is generally focused towards employees who are below main Board level and who do not 
participate in the LTIP. Currently, 2001 ESOS is used to retain, reward and motivate employees with continuous service of 
six months who are part of the leadership team of the group (includes senior managers, managers and team leaders). 
The scheme has been approved by HMRC and options over shares to an individual limit of £30,000 can be awarded 
in the approved element of the scheme. Above £30,000, options are awarded under the unapproved (for HMRC 
purposes) section of the scheme. Overall, awards are limited to 100% of an individual’s base salary. Following changes 
to the scheme approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, the ESOS has a single performance threshold for vesting 
of the options – average growth in earnings per share over the three-year vesting period must exceed inflation 
(measured as RPI) plus 4% per annum. The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement 
of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights. No price is payable upon award in respect of 
2001 ESOS.  
As a result of the review of equity schemes by the Remuneration Committee, the Board is recommending an 
introduction of new ESOS rules (‘2011 ESOS’) which are broadly consistent with the 2001 ESOS, as detailed in the 
Notice of AGM. The Board feels that the scheme continues to offer incentive and motivation to those employees 
below main Board level and proposes to continue with awards on the basis explained above. 
The share options detailed in Table 4 of Section B were granted to Executive Directors prior to 2007 under the 2001 
ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of grant required a percentage growth in the 
Company’s earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of 
grant of the option to the date on which the option first became exercisable. The performance conditions relating to 
the awards to Directors detailed below are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards at 
the same time. Since the grant to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter detailed in Table 4 of Section B, there have 
been no grants to Directors under the 2001 ESOS (both under the unapproved part and the HMRC-approved part), and 
it is the Committee’s current policy that equity-based incentives for Directors will be based solely upon LTIP awards.  
Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
The LTIP is a discretionary scheme and therefore not open to all employees of the group. The LTIP is focused on 
incentivising Executive Directors and senior management. Awards under the LTIP may be made, either through a  
joint-ownership structure or through direct grants, in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares. 
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to 
satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. An award may not be granted under 
the current LTIP after 26 July 2017, when the current scheme expires. No payment (other than in respect of any 
individual recipient electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate) is required for the grant of 
an award.  
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable. The scheme rules, in line with standard industry 
practice, contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability and/or death. In the 
event of a change of control of the group, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the 
discretion of the Committee. 
The upper limit on the market value (as at grant) of awards that an individual Executive Director may receive in any 
financial year is 200% of annual base salary. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, the rules currently allow 
for awards of up to 250% of any employee’s annual base salary.

The Committee continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term performance measure for MITIE 
as it is aligned with the group’s strategy and KPIs. This performance criterion has the advantages of simplicity and 
transparency which the Committee believes enhance the LTIP’s effectiveness as an incentive. Awards will normally 
vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met. All awards are subject to 
performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, less inflation (measured by the retail prices index – RPI), to exceed 
certain performance thresholds over a three-year period. Where EPS growth is less than a ‘lower performance threshold’ 
no awards will vest, awards vest in full when EPS growth is equal to, or more than, an ‘upper performance threshold’, 
vesting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.  
For LTIP awards granted in 2010, the lower performance threshold (at which 25% of an award vests) is RPI + 5% per 
annum and the upper performance threshold is RPI + 10% per annum. Table 5 in Section B provides details of the 
performance targets governing the vesting of LTIP awards granted in prior years.  
As announced on 30 March 2010, the Committee approved the accelerated vesting of LTIP awards granted in 2007, 
in line with the plan rules. This decision was taken by the Committee after thorough and considered reflection and did 
not result in any additional costs to the Company. The upper performance threshold applicable to the 2007 LTIP award 
was assessed to have been achieved and consequently the awards granted in 2007 vested in full. On 26 July 2010 
(the normal vesting date), the Committee assessed the extent to which the performance conditions applicable to the 
award had been satisfied, confirming that no shares were to be clawed-back and approved the transfer of legal title. 
LTIP awards granted to, and exercised by, the Executive Directors are set out in Table 5 of Section B below.  
Share dilution 
The Company manages dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of  
all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes (the LTIP, ESOS and SAYE) and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes 
(the LTIP and ESOS). In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available ‘headroom’ on 
a ten-year flat-line basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.  
LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 
2007 and the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2008. The potential dilution of the Company’s issued share capital 
is set out below in respect of all outstanding awards granted under the Company’s equity-based incentive schemes 
which are to be satisfied through the allotment of new shares. 
Table 4: Share dilution at 31 March 2011 
 
Current total 
dilution
All share plan (maximum 10%)  8.1%
Discretionary share plans (maximum 5%) 4.3%

The graph below shows the total shareholder return performance of MITIE shares compared with the FTSE 250 and 
FTSE 350 Support Services indices over a five-year period to 31 March 2011. The Committee is of the opinion that these 
comparators provide a clear picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable 
size as well as a specific group of companies within the same sector. Total shareholder return is calculated according 
to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and assumes that 
all dividends are reinvested. 
The market price of the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2011 was 196.5p. The highest and lowest prices during the 
year were 241.1p and 188.7p respectively.  Governance Accounts

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

 
The benefits of the Executive Directors who are members of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
are based on a pensionable salary capped at £123,600. The Company made contributions to the group’s defined 
benefit scheme on behalf of the three Directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10% (2010: 10%) of the 
value of the benefit cap of £123,600. In addition, the three directors received a salary supplement of 20% of salary 
(2010: 20%) in lieu of pension contributions following approval of the Remuneration Committee, in order to bring the 
value of their benefits in line with market practice. 
Suzanne Baxter is not a member of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme as the scheme was closed 
to new entrants in 2005, before she joined the group. It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee that the value 
of the pension benefits provided to Suzanne Baxter should mirror the value of the pension benefits provided to the other 
Executive Directors under the capped defined benefit arrangements, albeit that her benefits are provided through a 
separate defined contribution arrangement. Following an assessment of the value of her defined contribution pension 
scheme assets as at 31 March 2010, no pension contributions were required for Suzanne Baxter for the year ended 
31 March 2011 (2010: 13.5% of base salary). In addition, Suzanne Baxter received a salary supplement of 20% of base 
salary (2010: 20%) in lieu of pension contributions following approval of the Remuneration Committee, in order to 
bring the value of her benefits in line with market practice. 

In accordance with the Register of Directors’ interests, the rights of the Directors to subscribe for and their holdings 
of shares in MITIE Group PLC are as set out in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

3 The market price of the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2011 was 196.5p. The highest and lowest prices during the year were 241.1p and 188.7p respectively.  
The Directors acquired a conditional joint beneficial interest with the MITIE Employee Benefit Trust 2008 in the shares awarded under the LTIP in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  
The full beneficial interest will transfer to the Director only if the performance criteria applicable to the award are met.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

For the year ended 31 March 2011 
We have audited the Group financial statements of MITIE 
Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2011 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and the related notes 1 to 37. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2011 and of its profit for the year 
then ended; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
− certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
− the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ 
report: Corporate governance statement in relation to 
going concern; 
− the part of the Corporate governance statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review; and 
− certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2011 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been 
audited.

Basis of preparation 
The group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted for use in the European Union and therefore the group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ report: Corporate Governance statement, the roup’s financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The group’s financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which are required to be measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 except for the 
adoption in the year of:  
− IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (revised 2008); adoption of this revised standard has resulted in changes to the initial 
recognition and subsequent measurement of deferred contingent consideration. The standard also requires all 
acquisition related costs to be recognised as period expenses in accordance with the relevant IFRS. The revised 
standard applies to all of the group’s business combinations that occurred on or after 1 April 2010. Adoption of this 
revised standard has resulted in a reduction in profit before tax of £0.3m and a reduction in net assets of £0.2m; and 
− IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (revised 2008); changes in a parent’s ownership interest 
in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders’ equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised on such transactions and goodwill is not re-measured. Any difference between the change in the non-
controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and 
attributed to the owners of the parent. Adoption of this revised standard had no impact on profit before tax but 
resulted in a reduction in net assets of £4.8m. 
The following amendments and interpretations are also effective for the first time in the current year but have had no 
impact on the results or financial position of the group: 
− IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’;  
− Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions’; 
− IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ – consequential amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3; 
− IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ – consequential amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3; 
− Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – classification of rights issues;  
− Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ – eligible hedged items; and 
− Amendments resulting from April 2009 Annual Improvements to IFRSs. 
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective (and in some cases have not yet 
been adopted by the EU): 
− Amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement’; 
− IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’; 
− Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ – transfers of financial assets; 
− IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’; 
− Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ – recovery of underlying assets; 
− IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’;  
− IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’; 
− IAS 28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’; 
− IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’; 
− IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’; 
− IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’; 
− IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; and 
− Amendments resulting from May 2010 Annual Improvements to IFRSs. 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material financial 
impact on the group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.

Significant accounting policies under IFRS 
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the group’s IFRS financial information are set 
out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries. 
The financial statements of the parent ompany and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (with the exception of the acquired Dalkia companies). Adjustments are made in the 
consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist between UK GAAP and IFRS. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, have 
been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.  
Interests of non-controlling interest shareholders are measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets and liabilities recognised. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in 
a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders’ equity. No gain or loss is recognised on such transactions and 
goodwill is not re-measured. Any difference between the change in the non-controlling interest and the fair value of 
the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are 
classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, 
which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Where applicable, the consideration for an acquisition includes any assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in such fair values are 
adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they result from additional information, obtained within one year from 
the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. All other subsequent changes 
in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39, 
either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as equity are not recognised. 
Any business combinations prior to 1 April 2010 were accounted for using the standards in place prior to the adoption of 
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) which differ in the following respects; transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
formed part of the acquisition costs; contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the group had a present 
obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable; and subsequent 
adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part of goodwill. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.  
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. It is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is 
not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
c
78 MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 
1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Software and development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is 
probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can 
be measured reliably. 
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue represents income recognised in respect of services provided during 
the period (stated net of value added tax) and is earned predominantly within the United Kingdom. 
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at 
the balance sheet date. Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour 
hours and tasks are delivered and direct expenses incurred. In other cases, where services provided reflect a 
contractual arrangement to deliver an indeterminate number of acts over the contract term, revenue is recognised 
on a straight-line basis unless this is not an accurate reflection of the work performed. Where a straight-line basis is 
not appropriate, for example if specific works on contracts represent a significant element of the whole, revenue is 
recognised based on the percentage of completion method, based on the proportion of costs incurred at the balance 
sheet date relative to the total estimated cost of completing the contracted work.  
Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and 
estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end. Profits are recognised on long-term contracts 
where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. In calculating this, the percentage of completion 
method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost. Cost includes direct staff costs 
and outlays. Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are 
forecast. 
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less 
amounts billed on account. To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are 
included in creditors as gross amounts due to customers. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Leasing 
Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the 
lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged directly against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. Any lease incentives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period for which the 
group has contracted to lease the asset, together with any further terms for which the group has the option to continue 
to lease the asset if, at the inception of the lease, it is judged to be reasonably certain that the group will exercise the 
option.  Governance Accounts

Foreign currency 
The financial statements of each of the group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that 
business. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the 
date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, 
are included in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items 
carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of  
non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, 
any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Income and expenses are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the group’s hedging and translation reserve. On disposal of a 
foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation 
shall be recognised in the income statement.  
Retirement benefit costs 
The group operates and participates in a number of defined benefit schemes. In respect of the schemes in which the 
group participates, the group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation 
which is for a fixed period only. 
In addition, the group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying 
employees. 
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in 
the statement of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised, based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
 
80 MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less expected residual value of the assets over their estimated useful 
lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property – over 50 years 
Leasehold improvements    – period of the lease 
Plant and vehicles    – 3–10 years 
Annually the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition 
and location. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and estimated selling costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where 
appropriate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the 
contractual rights and obligations are discharged or expire. 
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the group’s past experience of collecting 
payments, the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable 
changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade 
receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits 
and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities comprise certain trade and other payables and financing liabilities including bank and other 
borrowings and are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost with the exception 
of derivative financial instruments which are either classified as fair value through profit and loss or may be accounted 
for using hedge accounting. Bank and other borrowings are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction 
of transaction costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The group uses derivative financial instruments including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign 
exchange contracts to manage the group’s exposure to financial risks associated with interest rates and foreign 
exchange. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value, determined by reference to market rates, at each 
balance sheet date and included as financial assets or liabilities as appropriate. The resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event 
the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.  
The group may designate certain hedging instruments including derivatives as either fair value hedges, cash flow 
hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the 
group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. 
Fair value hedges 
Hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are 
recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement relating to the hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. 
Cash flow hedges 
Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in cash flows that are 
attributable to a particular risk associated with either a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction. The 
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity within the group’s translation and hedging 
reserve. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised 
hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset 
or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. Hedge accounting is 
discontinued when the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or 
loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
Hedges are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the foreign currency exposure to changes in the 
group’s share in the net assets of a foreign operation. Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the group’s translation and hedging reserve. 
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains or losses on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss 
in the same way as exchange differences relating to the foreign operation as described above.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the group expects some or all of a 
provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the 
income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Bid, mobilisation and pre-contract costs 
Rendering of services 
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of the 
costs is virtually certain. 
The confirmation of the preferred bidder for a contract by a client is the point at which the award of a contract is 
considered to be virtually certain. Costs incurred after that point, but before the commencement of services under the 
contract, are defined as mobilisation costs. These costs are capitalised and included within trade and other receivables 
on the balance sheet provided that the costs relate directly to the contract, are separately identifiable, can be 
measured reliably and that the future net cash inflows from the contract are estimated to be no less than the amounts 
capitalised.  
The capitalised mobilisation costs are amortised over the life of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis, or on a 
basis to reflect the profile of work to be performed over the life of the contract if the straight-line basis is not considered 
to be appropriate for the specific contract to which the costs relate. If the contract becomes loss making, any 
unamortised costs are written off immediately. 
Construction contracts 
In the case of construction contracts, pre-contract costs that are direct costs associated with securing a contract and 
which can be separately identified and measured reliably are included in the cost of the contract when the realisation 
of income from the contract is virtually certain. Their treatment is as for mobilisation costs above.  
Share-based payments 
The group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and 
awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest. Save As You Earn (SAYE) options are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute 
to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the related expense. 
The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has 
applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005. 

Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management 
has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity. 
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are discussed below. 
Measurement and impairment of intangible assets 
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future 
cash flows and the selection of suitable discount rates. Determining whether goodwill and other intangible assets 
are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and also 
the selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values. The carrying value of goodwill 
and other intangible assets is £397.7m (2010: £391.4m) at the balance sheet date; see Notes 13 and 14. Management 
do not consider that any reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment.  Governance Accounts

Measurement of provisions and defined benefit pension obligations  
The group’s provisions (per Note 28) comprise deferred contingent consideration and insurance reserve. 
The measurement of provisions and defined benefit obligations requires judgement. In particular, the calculation 
of defined benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, 
future returns on assets and future contribution rates. The present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance 
sheet date is £126.8m (2010: £180.1m); see Note 35.  
The sensitivity of defined benefit pension obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown below:

Business segments 
The group manages its business on a service division basis. These divisions are the basis on which the group reports its 
primary segmental information. 
The financial data below reflects the performance of our four divisions in the organisational structures that applied 
during the year. On 1 April 2010, the acquired Dalkia FM business and our Engineering Maintenance business, 
which were previously in the Asset Management division, were restructured to bring together our technical facilities 
management proposition within a new operating division branded Technical Facilities Management. Furthermore, the 
Engineering Contracting offering of our Asset Management division was combined with our Property Management 
business to consolidate its proposition. The acquired Dalkia FM in Ireland business was incorporated into Facilities 
Management with effect from 25 June 2010. 
The comparative data below in respect of the year ending 31 March 2010 has been adjusted to reflect the 
reorganisation. Revenue and operating profit before other items for the year ending 31 March 2010 for Dalkia FM and 
Engineering Maintenance of £344.8m and £15.5m respectively have been excluded from the comparative data below 
for Asset Management and included within the comparative period disclosures for Technical Facilities Management. 
In addition, revenue and operating profit before other items for the year ending 31 March 2010 for Engineering 
Contracting of £201.2m and £4.9m have been excluded from the comparative data below for Asset Management 
and included within the comparative period disclosures for Property Management.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that 
are expected to benefit from that business combination. Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs, which align with the

* Re-presented in the structure which applied during the year, see Note 4. 
The group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value 
in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and 
direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry 
growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future 
changes in the market. 
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board for 
the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2% 
(2010: 2%) per annum. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs, which are based on the Company’s Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital, are shown below. The same rate is applied to all CGUs, reflecting that all CGUs have the same access 
to the roup’s treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations and that no CGU demonstrates levels of 
risk that are significantly different from those experienced by the group as a whole.

Customer relationships are amortised over their useful lives based on the period of time over which they are 
anticipated to generate benefits. These currently range from six to eight years. Other acquisition related intangibles 
include acquired software, trade names and non-compete agreements and are amortised over their useful lives 
which currently range from three to ten years. Software and development costs are amortised over their useful life 
of between five and ten years, once they have been brought into use.

Before accepting new customers, the group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customer’s 
credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring are updated as appropriate. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the group considers any change in the credit quality of the 
trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is 
limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further 
credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debt. The average credit period taken on sales of 
services was 40 days (2010: 38 days). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

subsidiary, which are not readily available for the general purposes of the group. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high  
credit-ratings assigned by recognised international credit-rating agencies and are managed through regular review.  Governance Accounts

In addition the group has £0.4m (2010: £0.5m) of capital losses.  
The UK Government announced a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011, which 
was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011. The reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities to reflect the rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse has resulted in a deferred tax credit 
of £0.5m to the income statement. The UK Government has indicated that it intends to enact further reductions in the 
main tax rate of 1% each year down to 23% by 1 April 2014. Future rate reductions would further reduce the UK deferred 
tax assets and liabilities recognised but the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at the time.

With the exception of derivative financial instruments and the private placement notes, all financial liabilities are held 
at amortised cost. The Directors estimate that their carrying value approximates their fair value. Derivative financial 
instruments, which are included in financing liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as 
hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied (see Note 25). The carrying value of the private placement notes 
at 31 March 2011 includes a fair value adjustment for interest rate and currency risk of £2.1m. The fair value of the 
private placement notes is not significantly different from their carrying value.

Private placement notes 
On 16 December 2010, the group issued US$96.0m and £40.0m of private placement (‘PP’) notes in the United States 
Private Placement market. The PP notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with other senior unsecured indebtedness 
of the group. In order to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations and to manage the group’s finance costs 
through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, the group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps. The swap 
contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings and are considered to be highly effective. 
The amount, maturity and interest terms of the PP notes are as shown below: 
Tranche Maturity date Amount Interest terms Swap interest
7 year 18 December 2017 US$48m US$ fixed at 3.39% £ fixed at 3.88%
7 year 18 December 2017 US$48m US$ fixed at 3.39% £ LIBOR + 1.26%
9 year 18 December 2019 £40.0m £ fixed at 4.38% n/a
The weighted average interest rates paid during the year on the overdrafts and loans outstanding were as follows:

At 31 March 2011, the group had available £132.3m (2010: £121.2m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in 
respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. The facilities have an expiry date of January 2012. The loans 
carry interest rates which are currently determined at 0.4% over LIBOR. Details of the group’s contingent liabilities are 
provided in Note 32.  
The group renegotiated its banking facilities in March 2011 and its new committed facility of £250m will be available for 
drawdown in July 2011, subject to the approval of an amendment to the Articles of Association at the forthcoming 
AGM to clarify the definition of borrowing limits. Until that point, the group’s existing committed banking facility of £230m 
remains available for use by the group. The new committed facility will remain in place until September 2015. The group 
also has further overdraft facilities of £40m.  

The group’s Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group. 
These risks include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The group seeks to minimise 
the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The use of financial 
derivatives is governed by group policies and reviewed regularly. Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments. 
Hedging activities 
Cash flow hedges 
The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Bi-annual fixed interest 
cash flows arising over the periods to December 2017 and denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market 
are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in sterling. The group also holds a number of forward 
exchange currency contracts designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions. All cash flow hedges 
were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2011. 
Fair value hedges 
The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. Fixed interest cash 
flows denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for floating interest cash flows 
denominated in sterling. All fair value hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2011. 
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations 
Included in bank loans at 31 March 2011 was a borrowing of €9.5m (2010: nil) which has been designated as a hedge 
of the net investment in the Republic of Ireland business of Dalkia FM in Ireland and is being used to hedge the group’s 
exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment. Gains or losses on the translation of the borrowing are transferred 
to equity to offset gains or losses on the translation of the net investment.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


Derivative financial instruments 
The carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date were as follows: 
 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated 
based on a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments. 
Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability; and  
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on 
observable market data.  
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into level 2. 
The cross currency interest rate swaps are net settled and other contracts are gross settled. 
Foreign currency risk 
The group has limited exposure to transactional foreign currency risk from trading transactions in currencies other than 
the functional currency of individual group entities. The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately 
and will enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate any significant risks. 
The group has some exposure to translational foreign currency risk from the translation of its operations in the Republic 
of Ireland and other European territories. The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately.  
In addition, on 16 December 2010, the group issued US$96.0m and £40.0m of private placement (‘PP’) notes in the 
United States Private Placement market and this has been fully hedged into sterling using cross currency interest rate 
swaps (see Note 24). 
Interest rate risk  
The group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. The group’s Treasury function reviews its risk 
management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order to 
manage interest rate risk. Having issued US$96.0m and £40.0m of private placement (‘PP’) notes in the United States 
Private Placement fixed rate market on 16 December 2010, the group has swapped US$48m into floating rate debt 
(see Note 24). 
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit after tax for 
the year ended 31 March 2011 and reserves would decrease/increase by £0.6m (2010: £0.3m).

Credit risk  
The group’s credit risk to all of its banks and financial counterparties is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally 
reported quarterly. The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis. 
The group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. 
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are 
net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event 
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. In addition, 
where appropriate, certain debts are subject to credit insurance. 
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers. 
Liquidity risk 
The group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the 
group’s assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations. Bank facilities which allow for appropriate 
headroom in the group’s daily cash movements are then arranged. Details of our bank facilities can be found in 
Note 24.

Market risk  
The group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. The group’s Treasury function reviews its risk 
management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order 
to manage interest rate risk. Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments. 
Capital risk management  
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity. The capital structure of the group 
consists of net (debt)/funds per Note 27 and equity per the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The group’s capital structure is reviewed regularly. The group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital 
requirements with the exception of those applicable to the group’s captive insurance subsidiary, which is monitored 
on a regular basis.

repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. All lease obligations 
are denominated in sterling. 
The fair value of the group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. The group’s obligations under 
finance leases are protected by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


The Company is party with other group companies to cross guarantees of each other’s bank and other borrowings, 
commitments and overdrafts of £ .0m (2010: £270.0m). 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims that are in the 
ordinary course of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either 
individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the group’s financial position. 
Deferred contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been accrued at the Directors’ best estimate of the likely 
future obligation of £4.5m (2010: £12.9m) per Note 28. The actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of 
£6.9m (2010: £32.4m) dependent upon the results of the acquired businesses. 
In addition, the group and its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance, issued 
by financial institutions on its behalf, amounting to £34.9m (2010: £23.4m) in the ordinary course of business. These are 
not expected to result in any material financial loss.

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the group for certain of its office properties and hire of vehicles 
and other equipment. These leases have average durations ranging from three to ten years. No arrangements have 
been entered into for contingent rental payments. 

Equity-settled share option schemes 
The Company has four share option schemes: 
The MITIE Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP was introduced in 2007. The awards of shares or rights to acquire shares (the awards) are offered to a small 
number of key senior management. Where offered as options the exercise price is nil. The vesting period is three years. 
If the awards remain unexercised after a period of four years from the date of grant, the awards expire. The awards 
may be forfeited if the employee leaves the group. Before the awards can be exercised, a performance condition 
must be satisfied; the number of awards that vest is determined by a sliding scale above the Retail Price Index per 
annum compound growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. 
The MITIE Group PLC 1991 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day 
period immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised 
after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves 
the group. No options have been granted under this scheme since August 2001. 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day 
period immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised 
after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves 
the group. Before options can be exercised, the performance condition that must be satisfied is that the percentage 
growth in earnings per share over a three-year period must be equal or greater than 10.0% per annum compound in 
respect of awards prior to July 2007 and 4.0% above the Retail Price per annum thereafter.

The MITIE Group PLC 2001 SAYE scheme 
The SAYE scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is not less than 80.0% of the market value of the shares 
on the day preceding the date on which invitations to participate in the scheme are issued. For options granted prior 
to September 2009, the vesting period is five years. For options granted in September 2009 and thereafter, the vesting 
period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of vesting, the options 
expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the group.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 206p 
(2010: 234p). The options outstanding at 31 March 2011 had exercise prices (other than nil in the case of the LTIP) 
ranging from 117p – 254p (2010: 117p – 254p) and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.4 years 
(2010: 4.6 years). In the year ended 31 March 2011, options were granted in June, July and August 2010 in respect 
of the LTIP, SAYE and Executive share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options 
granted on those dates was £4.4m. In the year ended 31 March 2010, options were granted in June, July and August 
2009 in respect of the LTIP, Executive and SAYE share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the 
options granted on those dates was £4.7m. 
The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are 
as follows: 
 2011 2010
Share price (p) 191–230 133–230
Exercise price (p) 0–254 0–254
Expected volatility (%) 28–36 27–36
Expected life (years) 3–6 3–6
Risk-free rate (%) 1.49–5.25 2.42–5.25
Expected dividends (%) 2.22–3.93 1.43–3.30
Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes. The expected life 
is based upon historical data and has been adjusted based on management’s best estimates for the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
 
106 MITIE Group PLC 
Annual Report and Accounts 201 1


Defined contribution schemes 
The group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees. The assets 
of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in funds controlled by the scheme providers. The group 
paid employer contributions of £8.1m (2010: £7.2m) during the year. As at 31 March 2011, contributions of £0.5m 
(2010: £0.5m) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. 
Defined benefit schemes 
Group defined benefit scheme 
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme where MITIE 
Group PLC is the principal employer.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the group. Contributions to the scheme are charged to the 
income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees’ working lives with the group.  
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0% and 66% of final salary 
on attainment of a retirement age of 65. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are funded 
schemes. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the group scheme’s assets and the present value of their defined benefit 
obligations was carried out as at 1 April 2008 by Mr Chris Bamford, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, from AON 
Consulting Limited. The next triennial valuation is due to be carried out as at 1 April 2011. 
Other defined benefit schemes 
Grouped together under ‘Other schemes’ is one (2010: one) scheme in which the group is a participating employer 
and a number of schemes to which the group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers’ 
defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees. These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each 
balance sheet date. The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past 
service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
For the Admitted Body Schemes, which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the group will only 
participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts. The group is required to pay regular contributions as 
decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes’ Schedule of Contributions. In a number 
of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess recovered from the body that the 
employees transferred from. In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the group will be required to 
pay any deficit (as determined by the Scheme Actuary) that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme. 
Assumptions 
Following the announcement in the June 2010 budget, the UK government has announced that it will use the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI) to determine the level of future statutory 
pension increases. As CPI is lower than RPI, the application of CPI to the valuation of future pension liabilities results in 
a reduction in the value of pension obligations on the balance sheet. The move to a CPI based valuation base affects 
certain of the group’s defined benefit pension liabilities. The financial implication of this has been treated as a change 
in defined pension benefits and recognised as a negative past service cost in the income statement. As a result of this 
change, a credit of £4.1m has been recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2011.

The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return of each asset 
class. The expected return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses. 
The return on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term bonds. The expected return on property has 
been set equal to that expected on equities less a margin. The expected return on other assets is the rate earned by 
the scheme on cash and alternate assets. 
The sensitivity of defined benefit obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown in Note 2. 
Amounts recognised in administrative expenses in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows:

The pension schemes have invested in property occupied by the group with a fair value of £3.9m (2010: £3.9m) 
generating rental of £0.3m (2010: £0.3m). At 31 March 2011 the pension schemes held no MITIE Group PLC shares 
(2010: nil). The pension schemes have not invested in any other assets used by the group. Transactions between 
the group and the pension schemes are conducted at arm’s length. 
The mortality for the group schemes is based upon up to date tables which project mortality improvements in the 
future. For a male aged 65.0 years the expected life is 89.0 years (2010: 87.4 years) and for a female aged 65.0 years 
the expected life is 92.0 years (2010: 89.8 years). Mortality for the other schemes is that used by the relevant 
scheme actuary.

We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2011 which comprise the Company Balance 
Sheet and the related notes 38 to 51. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
− the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and 
− the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
− adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
− the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
− certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2011.

For the year ended 31 March 2011 
 

Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by company law. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and law.  
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ report: Corporate governance statement, the Company’s financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.  
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
charged so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis 
as follows: 
Plant and vehicles  3–10 years 
Software and development costs 5–10 years 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed 
the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is charged to the profit and loss 
account, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based upon tax rates 
and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date Timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they 
are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation 
of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates 
where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

 

Financial instruments  
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts are recognised in the profit and loss account where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the profit and loss account and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.  
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options 
and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Save As You Earn (SAYE) options are treated as 
cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the 
related expense. Options over the Company’s shares awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are 
accounted for as a capital contribution within the carrying value of Investments in subsidiary undertakings. 
Pensions  
Pension costs represent amounts paid to one of the group’s pension schemes. For the purposes of FRS 17 ‘Retirement 
Benefits’ the Company has been unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the group defined 
benefit pension scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore the Company is accounting for contributions 
to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Note 35 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the 
details of the IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ net pension liability of £3.0m (2010: £10.5m).  

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and 
loss account for the year. MITIE Group PLC reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 March 2011 
of £32.9m (2010: £10.1m, which included £4.7m of non-distributable profits that arose from internal restructuring during 
the year). 
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £50,000 (2010: £50,000).  
Detailed disclosures of Directors’ remuneration and share options are given in the audited section of the Directors’ 
remuneration report contained in the consolidated financial statements.

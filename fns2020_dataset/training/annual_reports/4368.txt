STRATEGIC

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE
01 I am delighted to write to you following 
another successful year at DMGT. The 
results we have delivered are a testament 
to the quality of our assets, the creativity 
of our workforce and the entrepreneurial 
approach of our management team. 
DMGT remains at the forefront of the 
international business-to-business (B2B) 
and consumer media sectors. We have a 
diverse asset portfolio which has delivered 
a strong underlying performance and total 
shareholder returns (as shown in the charts 
on page 03).
On behalf of the Board and as the largest 
shareholder in DMGT, I would like to thank 
Martin Morgan and his management 
team for continuing to expand our B2B 
companies and develop our consumer 
media presence.
The management strategy, fully endorsed 
by the Board, is focused on building a 
global growth company in the media and 
B2B markets we serve. DMGT’s operating 
margin has improved from 13% in 2009 to 
17% in 2014. This is due to the combination 
of the improving consumer margin and the 
increased proportion of the business that is 
B2B (as shown in the charts on page 03).
In the financial year covered by this report, 
this strategy helped deliver organic growth 
and returns on our recent investments. 
As a result, adjusted earnings per share rose 
by 12% to 55.7 pence. DMGT generated 
healthy cash flow, and the Board is 
recommending a 7% increase in the final 
dividend per share for 2014.
At the operating level, the benefits of 
our global footprint, entrepreneurialism 
and creativity were evident across 
our businesses. 
In consumer media, the Mail titles 
consolidated their position as pioneers 
of quality popular journalism. MailOnline 
continued to win new global audiences, 
whilst increasing its editorial coordination 
with Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday. 
Advertising revenues have remained solid 
and our print titles have gained market 
share despite the challenges faced by 
traditional print media.
Among our B2B assets, RMS maintained 
its leading position for catastrophe risk 
modelling. We took the decision to delay 
the deployment of RMS(one) during the 
year, which reflected a determination to 
roll out this technology only when it fully 
meets clients’ expectations. Your Board 
regrets the impact the delay in the launch 
of RMS(one) has had on us, as shareholders, 
and the executive team is working hard to 
support RMS to deliver on its revised plan.
We saw further expansion in our 
information businesses. The acquisition of 
Decision Insight Information Group (DIIG), 
a leading property search group in the UK 
and Ireland, reflects our ability to make 
acquisitions that will deliver further growth. 
At dmg events, we successfully increased 
the frequency and geographic presence 
of flagship events which have continued 
to be the must-attend exhibitions and 
networking opportunities for their 
respective communities. 
Meanwhile, Euromoney is improving its 
digital capabilities through the launch of 
its Delphi content management system. 
The project will enhance coordination 
and the use of technology across the 
Euromoney portfolio.
During the financial year, DMGT unlocked 
significant value from the sale of Evenbase 
and through the IPO of Zoopla Property 
Group Plc, in which we remain a supportive 
and engaged financial investor. We also 
made a number of acquisitions to 
strengthen our B2B information capabilities. 
The twin approach of organic investment 
and bolt-on acquisitions has continued to 
diversify the Group by business area 
and geography.
DMGT will continue to pursue international 
expansion in high-growth markets. In the 
period covered by this Annual Report, 
I witnessed those growth opportunities 
at first hand with a visit to our businesses 
in Asia. I was delighted to see how well 
dmg information has established itself, with 
its hub office in Singapore. Our expansion 
continues in other geographies, with 
Euromoney acquiring Mining Indaba, 
an investment forum in South Africa, 
whilst dmg events has expanded its 
overseas businesses to include Mexico 
and Morocco.
The implementation of our Group strategy 
is overseen by the Board, which continues 
to maintain high standards of governance. 
The Governance Report (pages 40 to 50) 
sets out the framework for operating 
performance and shareholder value that is 
central to the growth of DMGT. The strategy 
is overseen by a Board of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors with relevant skills 
and experience. The Board’s commitment 
to diversity is explained in the Corporate 
Governance section of this report.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT At the senior management level, 
remuneration and incentives are aligned 
with performance. The value creation 
metrics and related payments are set 
out in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 51 to 73.
The operational performance and 
strategic vision set out in this Annual 
Report demonstrates that we have the 
right strategy in place and the right 
management to deliver it. At the same 
time, the family control of DMGT means we 
take a long-term perspective, creating an 
environment to drive sustained returns for 
all investors.
Throughout its history, DMGT has relied 
upon the talent, experience and skills of 
its employees. As Chairman of the Board, 
I want to thank all our staff for their 
dedication and hard work. 
The media and business information 
markets continue to change rapidly. 
DMGT is well positioned to participate in 
future developments and withstand market 
volatility. The Board remains confident 
in DMGT’s long-term growth prospects.

HOW WE MAKE MONEY
Our revenue models
1 .  S u b s cr i pt i o n 
Our B2B businesses have a strong 
subscription revenue component with 
high renewal rates demonstrating the 
strength of our client relationships.
2 .  A dv e r t i s i ng
Growth in our digital advertising 
revenues continues to offset weakness 
in print advertising. Enhanced user 
engagement drives advertiser 
interest in increasingly sophisticated 
advertising formats.
3. Circulation
Circulation revenues are generated 
from sales of Daily Mail and The Mail 
on Sunday newspapers, which 
continue to gain market share in  
a declining market.
4. Events attendance  
and sponsorship
Exhibitor and delegate fees and 
sponsorship revenues are earned from 
the growing portfolio of trade shows 
run by dmg events and from 
By harnessing technology, we can create 
new insights and allow customers to use 
our information in ways that best serve 
their needs.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL For customers
Our deep understanding of 
customer needs enables us 
to create content that gives 
our businesses a 
competitive edge and 
informs our customers.
For shareholders
We have a strong track 
record of generating a 
positive return. Investment 
of strong cash flow and our 
active portfolio management 
drive sustainable earnings 
and dividend growth.
For employees
We back talent, making 
it a priority to identify, 
develop and cultivate 
entrepreneurs within our 
business and through 
acquisitions.
OUR FIVE STRENGTHS GIVE DMGT 
A UNIQUE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Entrepreneurial heart
that fosters constant innovation,

Devolved and diversified
Group structure which gives our businesses 
freedom within a framework and ensures 
that they remain close to their customers.
Family ownership
which enables the Company to continually

entrepreneurial risks and make investment 
decisions for the long term.

5. Transactions
dmg information’s revenues from its 
property information business are 
influenced by property transaction 
volumes; they are “quasi-subscription” 
in nature due to their regularity 
and frequency.
Our approach
Leveraging expertise; we use our 
knowledge and experience to replicate 
business opportunities and develop our 
businesses across borders.
Freedom within a framework: we give our 
businesses autonomy to make the right 
decisions due to their close relationships 
with their customers, which drives product 
innovation. In exchange we set clear 
targets and demand financial discipline.
Incentives for management: we 
encourage entrepreneurship, fostering a 
sense of ownership and accountability and

GOVERNANCE ADAPTING TO 
CONTINUOUS CHANGE
• Technological change is 
accelerating at a pace never  
seen before and so is the speed  
at which consumers are adopting 
new technology. 
• It took 30 years for electricity and 
25 years for telephones to reach 10% 
adoption but tablet devices have 
achieved this rate within five years. 
• The ‘internet of things’ – networks 
of sensors to collect data, monitor 
and optimise processes – will drive 
productivity across a range 
of industries.
• Mobile continues to be a major 
trend, with data traffic set to 
increase nearly elevenfold 
between now and 2018. 
• Automation will disrupt traditional 
roles. Many manual tasks have the 
potential to be delivered through 
robotics. Intelligent software systems 
can increase the productivity of 
knowledge workers. 
• The entire landscape is becoming 
ever more global, with around five 
billion people forecast to have 
access to the internet by 2025.
DMGT and innovation
As an entrepreneurial company 
strongly focused on digital growth, 
DMGT keeps one step ahead by 
continually fostering innovation and 
embracing new ideas. At the same 
time, our family heritage encourages 
the long-term thinking needed to 
invest for the future. Our decentralised 
approach enables us to remain close 
to customers, gaining greater insight 
and understanding into exactly 
what they value, engage with and, 
ultimately, want to buy. 
DMGT comprises of a portfolio of businesses 
working across diverse marketplaces. Each has its 
own individual characteristics as well as sharing 
common features and trends.
The commonalities and characteristics found across DMGT’s portfolio define 
the nature of the environment in which we operate and create a framework 
when setting and implementing our strategy. These are: 
• Fast paced and frequently changing
• Technology driven, with constant innovation
• Customer centric
• Content and information driven
• International
Other features of our marketplace are the competitive and consumer 
environments. Through our decentralised structure, we remain close to our 
customers and markets, allowing innovation and adaptability to drive growth 
opportunities across the Group. 
COMPETITION
Some of our more specialist B2B businesses operate in specific niches which 
mean they are often the only major operator in that sector. Where our 
businesses operate in more competitive sectors we focus on innovation, 
ensuring we remain relevant and essential.
Our consumer media brands operate in perhaps the most competitive of 
marketplaces. The number of digital news providers continues to grow and 
compete with our print titles and websites for customers and advertising 
revenues. dmg media is fortunate to have consumer titles which benefit from 
being trusted brands with significant scale and audience reach enabling it 
to retain and, in some instances, grow its market share.
CUSTOMERS
Across our B2B businesses customers tend to demand high-value services and 
come from primarily the insurance, property, education, energy and finance 
sectors. We prefer to form long-term relationships with our customers by 
working with many of them on a subscription basis where we achieve high 
renewal rates.
The largest number of customers is in our consumer media business. We reach 
nearly 30 million people a month or 59% of the adult population in the UK. 
Our customer base outside the UK is growing as MailOnline continues to 
attract global audiences, especially in the US.
Our devolved and decentralised structure is essential in ensuring that our 
businesses remain nimble and close to their customers, therefore anticipating 
and meeting their ever-changing needs. 
TRENDS
When considering the factors most likely to impact our diverse marketplaces 
we have identified four major trends. We ensure that the implications of these 
trends are considered both as opportunities and as risks. More detail on how 
we manage the risks can be found on pages 30 to 33. 
CONTINUOUS 
INNOVATION

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
MARKET OVERVIEW • The amount of data available to 
businesses is growing rapidly and 
customers’ demand for real-time 
information is also increasing. 
• Companies are beginning to see 
their data as a revenue source and 
using advanced analytics to 
produce actionable insights. 
• At the same time, as internet use 
grows so does the issue of 
cybersecurity. Despite excellent 
security practices employed by 
many cloud providers, these services 
are likely to be prime targets for 
attacks by cybercriminals.
• Emerging and growth markets will 
continue to strengthen their 
economic power. By 2050 the GDP 
of the E7 (China, India, Brazil, Russia, 
Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) is set 
to be double that of the G7 (US, 
Japan, Germany, UK, France, Italy 
and Canada). 
• The trend for urbanisation continues, 
with 75% of the world’s population 
forecast to be living in cities by 2050, 
with Africa and Asia leading 
the way. In 1990 there were 
10 megacities (those with more 
than 10 million inhabitants) in the 
world. By 2030 this is forecast to rise 
above 40.
• The supply of talent is shifting at a 
time when demand is increasing. 
Mature economies are not able 
to find the talent they need, 
just as emerging markets are 
increasing their demand for highly 
educated workers. 
• The labour pool is shrinking, 
especially in terms of those qualified 
to take advantage of big data 
and analytics. 
• The concept of a job for life is 
being challenged. Skills learnt now 
will become out of date in a few 
years’ time, so the need for 
continuous education will 
become more important.

DMGT and data
As a provider of valuable data to 
customers all over the world, DMGT 
is strongly positioned to benefit from 
these trends, and we will continue to 
create optimisation tools to automate 
the flow of information. We recognise 
the increasing importance customers 
place on real-time insights and 
are investing and innovating in 
this area. We are highly aware of 
the cybersecurity threat to our 
businesses, as well as to those of our 
customers, and the need to maintain 
constant vigilance.
DMGT and talent 
As a successful global employer able 
to offer a wide range of exciting 
opportunities, we are well positioned 
to attract talent and understand the 
need to constantly re-educate our 
people. As an organisation, we 
champion our strong and enterprising 
culture in order to attract and retain 
recruits, particularly those starting 
their careers.
DMGT and global change
Understanding cities and their shifting 
demographics is critical to reaching 
urban consumers and the demand 
for information to do this will grow. 
Urbanisation will also increase 
demand for property and energy, 
already key market areas for DMGT 
companies. In terms of the shift in 
economic power, we continue to 
invest in growth markets, particularly 
Asia, seeking out new opportunities 
and establishing joint ventures. In our 
mature markets we remain agile. 
Rather than opting for a short-term 
strategy, we ensure that we adapt 
and innovate for the long term.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE Introduction and Strategy
DMGT has delivered another year of strong 
performance with continued growth from 
the B2B companies and excellent profit 
performance from consumer media. 
Strong organic growth from investment 
and innovation and active portfolio 
management have ensured the effective 
use of shareholders’ capital. 
DMGT has pursued a consistent strategy 
of growing its B2B companies, developing 
its consumer businesses and diversifying 
internationally into high-growth markets. 
We measure the success of this strategy 
through our key performance indicators 
. There is an update on how these 
have progressed over the past year on 
pages 14 and 15 of the Strategic Report. 
The performance over the past year has 
been encouraging and with our stronger 
balance sheet we face the future with 
increasing confidence. 
Financial performance
DMGT has delivered another year of strong 
performance in 2014. Group underlying 
revenues rose by 5% and underlying 
operating profit increased by 15%, at an 
operating margin of 17%. Although our 
reported results have been negatively 
impacted by the strength of the British 
pound against the US dollar, we are 
pleased to report that the adjusted profit 
before tax and earnings per share was 
in line with market expectations. Further 
information can be found in the Financial 
Review (pages 26 to 29). 
Our performance in the year reflects good 
growth from the B2B operations and an 
excellent profit performance from the 
consumer media business, dmg media. 
The Group has delivered strong cash flows 
and executed successful disposals. As a 
result the year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio 
(1.5 times) was comfortably below the 
Group’s preferred upper limit of around 
2.0 times. DMGT’s increased financial 
strength has enabled the Group to invest 
in our businesses, make acquisitions, 
conclude the share buy-back programme 
and early debt repayment, as well as 
increase the dividend. 
In March we took the decision to postpone 
the launch of RMS(one), the real-time 
software as a service risk management 
platform being developed by RMS. 
The principal reasons were that product 
performance was unsatisfactory and 
that it had become clear that more 
development was required to meet 
customer expectations. A thorough 
review of the product’s design was carried 
out and based on a new simplified 
architecture, and one which will utilise 
a range of the latest technologies, the 
launch is now planned for late 2015. 
We regret the failure to deliver RMS(one) 
in accordance with the original timetable 
and the impact that this has had.

strategy and objectives and an overview of 
performance. Further information on each 
of our operating businesses can be found

Strategic ambition
Over the past five years, DMGT has 
transformed into a more focused B2B 
information and consumer media group, 
generating growing underlying revenues 
and sustainable profits. This transformation 
has been delivered through:
• growing our B2B companies with organic 
growth enhanced by both acquisitions 
and investment;
• developing our consumer media 
businesses through the strength of the 
Mail brand across a range of consumer 
platforms and creating an effective 
and lower cost operating structure; and
•  diversifying internationally through our 
B2B operations and MailOnline.
Our consistent strategy is pursued by 
the Group’s operating businesses: RMS, 
dmg information, dmg events, Euromoney 
Institutional Investor (Euromoney) and 
dmg media. 
We aim to deliver compelling proprietary 
content for both specialist B2B and 
consumer audiences. Our customers 
trust us to deliver vital information when 
and where they need it. We recognise

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW the opportunities in fast-changing 
markets where we are utilising digital 
innovation in an ever more interactive 
and real-time manner. 
Our devolved and diversified operating 
structure ensures that our entrepreneurial 
philosophy can thrive with effective 
strategic decision making resulting from 
business leaders being close to their 
markets. DMGT continues to derive 
significant advantage from its long-term 
family ownership, creating an environment 
in which strong sustainable returns can be 
achieved based on a prudent view of risk. 
Active portfolio management and strong 
financial discipline are important aspects 
of DMGT’s strengths with notable 
developments over the past year coming 
to fruition, as described throughout 
this report.
The significance of our B2B businesses has 
continued to increase. As a result of this we 
have decided to bring together the B2B 
companies, RMS, dmg information and 
dmg events, under a single division called 
dmg b2b. This will allow us to bring common 
management discipline to this area of 
DMGT as we have done with our consumer 
facing business through the previous 
formation of dmg media. 
Suresh Kavan is the Chief Executive Officer 
of dmg b2b and I am its Chairman. 
Our individual businesses, such as RMS, 
will continue to be run by their CEOs.  
We will also continue to report the financial 
results of each of the three areas within 
dmg b2b (RMS, dmg information, 
dmg events) individually.

Strategic priorities 
In order to deliver on our strategic 
ambitions, we are focused on five strategic 
priorities, which are listed above and 
expanded on pages 12 and 13.
Fostering innovation to deliver 
organic growth
By creating an entrepreneurial 
environment in which innovation thrives, 
DMGT develops compelling content which 
is relevant and trusted. Our approach to 
fostering innovation is through organic 
investment and bolt-on acquisitions. 
During the year there have been a 
number of significant organic investments. 
These include RMS(one), a real-time risk 
management platform, with a programme 
of incremental deliverables to Joint 
Development Partner clients being 
planned for late 2015. Within dmg 
information, investment has been made 
at Genscape, Hobsons and Trepp with 
resultant new product launches such as 
Hobsons’ Naviance Curriculum, and 
Trepp’s Trepp Trade. Euromoney has 
delivered a new digital content platform, 
Delphi, which will enable faster growth at 
many of its businesses. On the consumer 
side, further investment has been made 
at MailOnline and Wowcher. 
Maintaining rigorous and active  
portfolio management
During the year there were a number 
of significant developments with both 
acquisitions and disposals being made. 
We are also increasingly taking influential 
minority stakes as a way of making new 
additions to the portfolio. Our overall aim is 
to create a balanced revenue stream by 
market sector and geography to ensure 
the resilience of the Group’s long-term 
growth trajectory by an effective use of 
shareholders’ capital.

INFORMATION
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Various acquisitions were made to expand 
the depth and breadth of our B2B activities. 
dmg information expanded its property 
information services through acquiring 
Decision Insight Information Group (DIIG), 
Genscape further developed its energy 
information services through acquiring 
the US-based Energytics, dmg events 
expanded its sector reach by acquiring 
Quartz Coatings, Euromoney acquired 
Infrastructure Journal and the Mining 
Investment Events Division of Summit 
Professional Networks (Mining Indaba) 
enhancing its product offering in the 
metals and mining sector. 
In October 2014 we disposed of Lewtan, 
part of dmg information. The business was 
sold to maintain our strategic priority to be 
a rigorous and active portfolio manager 
and to dispose of businesses when they 
have a higher value to another owner.
During the year, the transformation of 
dmg media has led to the disposal of 
Evenbase, the digital recruitment business, 
and a reduction in our stake in the 
Zoopla Property Group Plc (ZPG) through 
an Initial Public Offering. We are pleased 
with the return on capital achieved on 
both these businesses and we will retain 
our remaining c. 32% stake in ZPG for the 
foreseeable future. 
Influential stakes in businesses of strategic 
importance were made by Hobsons in iProf 
in India, by dmg information in Skymet, 
also in India, and Genscape’s investment 
in Petrotranz, which was increased to just 
over a 50% stake in November 2014. By 
using our expertise in developing young 
businesses, we believe we can build these 
initial stakes into valuable long-term growth 
opportunities. Further information on 
our joint ventures and associates can 
be found in the Financial Review on 
pages 26 to 29.
We retain a balanced capital allocation 
approach. We now have increased 
flexibility made possible by our 
strengthened balance sheet, to create 
shareholder value. While organic 
investment remains our first priority, 
supported by bolt-on acquisitions, we 
will also continue to identify targeted 
acquisitions in adjacent markets and new 
sectors. These investments will be balanced 
against delivering real dividend growth, 
pension fund contributions as well as further 
returns in the form of share and bond 
buy-backs. 
We have a consistent approach to 
regularly evaluating the strength of 
our existing portfolio as well as new 
opportunities which are summarised in 
DMGT’s investment criteria table on the left.
Driving international growth
Growth in new geographies and sectors 
is a long-term ambition and further 
progress was made during 2014. Our 
non-UK revenues now account for 47% 
of total revenues with 26% coming from 
North America and 21% from the Rest of 
the World and non-UK revenues grew at 
an underlying rate of 9%.
We are progressively establishing offices 
and investing in businesses across Asia, 
Africa and South America.
• RMS has established a sales office in 
Singapore and China to expand into 
the Pacific region, complementing its 
well-established business in Japan. 
• dmg information’s new regional offices in 
Singapore and New Delhi have brought 
a number of our operations together 
and are creating new momentum. 
• Genscape will be starting operations 
in Japan. 
• dmg events is expanding in India and 
South East Asia and its Energy division 
is establishing itself in Mexico and looking 
to expand its presence in this region.
• Entry into Africa is being led by exhibitions 
and conferences, in particular by dmg 
events in energy as well as Euromoney in 
the mining sector through its acquisition 
of Mining Indaba.
We remain confident that there is 
considerably more international growth 
potential to unlock over time.
Using technology to enable growth
Technology is a business enabler for our 
proprietary content through platform 
development or from exploiting device-
led opportunities. In the past year, there 
have been a range of new platform 
developments. For example, Hobsons’ 
“ Our customers trust us to deliver 
vital information when and 
where they need it.”
Martin Morgan, Chief Executive
MEETING DMGT’S 
INVESTMENT CRITERIA
We have a consistent and 
considered approach to 
investments. We look to 
invest in businesses which:
•  have the potential for 
high rates of organic 
growth;
•  are international 
in reach;
•  have innovative 
products, quality 
content and deep 
customer insight;
•  are market leaders;
•  have entrepreneurial 
and creative leadership;
•  can benefit from 
DMGT’s long-term 
perspective; and
•  meet our financial 
criteria.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Radius and Euromoney’s Delphi which 
are creating new business opportunities. 
In the consumer media environment, 
understanding how technology can 
harness the value of scalable audiences 
through developing new apps for mobile 
devices and linking with social media are 
ongoing development areas for MailOnline 
and Wowcher. 
One way in which we measure our ability 
to harness technology has been through 
monitoring the proportion of our revenues 
from digital sources. In 2014, we have 
seen a further increase in the digital 
share of Group revenue to 46%  . 
The proportion of digital revenues is 
expected to continue to grow. 
Attracting and developing  
entrepreneurial talent 
Creating a culture where innovation 
thrives is vital in attracting and developing 
entrepreneurial talent. We believe that the 
quality of leadership will dictate the pace 
and success of the Group’s future growth. 
Our businesses continue to achieve 
external recognition with a range of 
awards over the past year reflecting the 
depth and strength of talent at DMGT. 
DMGT has established a strategy on how 
to recruit, retain and develop its talent 
to ensure ongoing success. One of the 
main initiatives has been the Leadership 
Development Programme which almost 
100 senior leaders have attended this year. 
It addresses the fundamentals of how 
technology, market dynamics, innovation 
and customer challenges can be 
harnessed. Hackathons, based in London 
and New York, were held to stimulate 
technical innovation. To reflect the growing 
importance of product management, 
the first project management workshop 
was held.
It is important to adapt our remuneration 
arrangements to reflect fast-moving 
market conditions and the Group’s 
longer-term investment horizon. Details of 
our approach to training, management 
and remuneration are set out in detail in 
the Corporate Responsibility Review 
(pages 35 to 37) and in the Remuneration 
Report (pages 51 to 73). 
Trends affecting DMGT
DMGT’s markets remain challenging, not 
only from an economic perspective but 
also due to the pace of technological 
change and patterns of consumption in 
both B2B and consumer environments. 
Technology is enabling businesses to 
innovate on faster cycles and often at 
lower cost than before, which is creating 
new opportunities. Demand for vertical 
specialities and the ability to analyse and 
use data in real-time on a scale previously 
unknown, is a powerful trend and one 
we intend to exploit. We believe that the 
quality and interpretation of data will 
become increasingly important and 
one that can be driven by harnessing 
technological innovation and by deeply 
understanding customer needs.
The continued exponential growth of the 
consumer internet economy linking to 
social media and accessing information 
across an ever-increasing number and 
variety of devices is an important trend 
and one which DMGT is already exploiting. 
We recognise that ongoing innovation 
will be required to maintain our strong 
market positions. 
More information on the trends affecting 
DMGT can be found on page 08 of the 
Strategic Report. 
Share price
The price of DMGT’s A Ordinary Non-Voting 
Shares (A Shares) has increased by 1% from 
£7.62 on 30 September 2013 to £7.68 on 
30 September 2014, compared to a 3% 
increase for the FTSE All-Share Index over 
the year.
Outlook
The Board remains confident that the 
Group has excellent long-term growth 
prospects. DMGT has created a diverse set 
of businesses which together provide a 
sustainable platform for long-term growth. 
The financial performance in 2015 will be 
adversely impacted by investment in 
RMS(one), one of dmg events’ largest 
events, Gastech, not occurring in the year 
and by the disposal of the Evenbase digital 
recruitment business during 2014.
Given our increased financial strength, 
we are in a position to capture growth 
opportunities through further investment 
and acquisitions. Our teams of talented 
entrepreneurs have the ability to navigate 
their way through challenging market 
conditions to exploit growth opportunities 
and deliver long-term shareholder value. 
DMGT’s outlook remains positive and we 
look forward to making further progress 
in 2015.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE RMS continues to be a market leader in 
catastrophe modelling. RMS has taken clear 
strategic actions to create a sound future 
for the business. The roll-out programme 
for RMS(one), the groundbreaking new 
risk management environment, has been 
redefined. Both the core business and 
RMS(one) are expected to underline RMS’s 
long-term growth prospects.
Business model
RMS is a world leader in catastrophe 
modelling, providing critical risk 
management solutions to hundreds of 
financial institutions around the world. RMS 
offers information and analysis to insurers, 
brokers and reinsurers and its services are 
increasingly in demand from new sectors 
and organisations.
Revenues are derived mainly from annual 
subscriptions, with recurring revenue 
renewal rates of 95%. RMS has healthy 
operating margins reflecting the high value 
its customers place on its products and 
services and the strength of the company’s 
market position.
Performance highlights
RMS produced solid results with underlying 
revenue growth of 4% to £172 million. 
Reported revenues were down 2% 
reflecting the adverse impact of the 
strength of the British pound versus the 
US dollar. The core modelling business 
saw continuing good demand for its 
subscription services and overall renewal 
rates remained above 95%. 
We did not deliver RMS(one) when we said 
we would, and we very much regret that 
we let down clients, our hard-working 
team, and you, our shareholders. A revised 
plan has been implemented which will 
result in a programme of incremental 
deliverables to Joint Development Partner 
clients during 2015. At a minimum, delivery 
of RMS’s first high-definition models to the 
broader client base is expected by late 
2015. RMS expects that this lower risk, 
phased approach will lead to staged 
utilisation by RMS’s broader client base.
The delay in the launch of RMS(one) 
impacted our financial performance. 
Details are set out on page 26 in the 
Financial Review. 
RMS continued to innovate in the 
catastrophe modelling market producing 
highly competitive models. Recent releases 
included the US and Canada Severe 
Convective Storm Models, the China and 
Hong Kong Typhoon and Coastal Flooding 
and the US Hurricane and Coastal Flooding 
models. These products have been well 
received by customers and beneficially 
influenced RMS’s performance in the year.
In Capital Markets, structural changes in 
the industry are creating opportunities 
for RMS. Pioneering a new approach to 
modelling indemnity catastrophe bonds, 
RMS facilitated the launch of a high-profile, 
innovatively structured Catastrophe Bond 
which commanded good levels of 
demand in the market.
When completed, RMS(one) will be the 
first and only real-time exposure and risk 
management environment and is a major 
development for the industry (see pullout 
box). Following the postponement of its 
launch, the approach to the development 
of the product changed during 2014 with 
certain elements of the existing software 
being improved and simplified in order 
to enhance the product’s performance, 
functionality and openness. 
Strategic priorities
The strategic focus for RMS has been to 
sustain the market position of its core 
modelling capabilities alongside 
developing RMS(one), which will 
reinforce the future of the business.
RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS
Risk Management Solutions (RMS) is a vibrant company, 
leading and developing the industry it helped create 
25 years ago with innovative risk management solutions. 
Its entrepreneurial founder still leads the company, 
which has been part of DMGT since 1998.

Key developments
• Launch of new storm models
• The delay of RMS(one) and continued 
investment in the product
Fostering innovation to deliver  
organic growth 
The vitality of the business has been 
demonstrated this year with several new 
initiatives and developments. 
RMS(one) continues to be the major 
strategic development and has the 
potential to open up a new wave of 
modelling capabilities, products and 
clients. By the end of 2015, RMS(one) 
aims to make available the industry’s 
first High-Definition models. The RMS(one) 
eco-system is attracting a robust set of 
partners who are creating new third-party 
catastrophe models to extend the choice 
available to clients for a market-leading, 
comprehensive risk management solution. 
RMS announced an exciting partnership 
with the Risky Business initiative. Launched 
in October 2013, it aims to quantify and 
publicise the economic risks the US faces 
from the impacts of climate change. RMS 
joined the initiative as a content partner, 
and intends to further develop methods 
to model climate change risk that foster 
market-driven solutions.
In July 2014, a public-private partnership 
with the United Nations and The World Bank 
was announced as part of a new RMS 
initiative to expand access to its 
catastrophe models for governments in 
developing and developed countries.
RMS announced a partnership in 
September 2014 with The Rockerfeller 
Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities initiative 
which will allow cities in the 100RC Network 
access to the RMS(one) exposure and risk 
management platform as well as RMS

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATING BUSINESS REVIEW catastrophe models to help them make 
well-informed decisions about managing 
and mitigating natural hazard risk.
Driving international growth
RMS derives over 40% of its revenues from 
clients in North America, with the balance 
coming from around the world, mainly 
Bermuda, Europe and Asia. The new RMS 
office in Singapore creates a base from 
which to expand into Australia, Japan 
and China over the longer term. Initial 
developments have included establishing 
a sales operation with a new emerging 
market customer base of domestic Asian 
companies. Changes and consolidation 
in the insurance industry in Japan also 
provide good growth opportunities for RMS.
Using technology to enable growth
RMS(one) will be a groundbreaking 
technological innovation that will transform 
risk management. Redefining our rollout 
programme and refocusing the business 
were difficult steps to take but represent a 
key stage in RMS’s understanding of both 
the complexities of a major IT initiative and 
the commitment to deliver what is right for 
DMGT, RMS and its customers.
Attracting and developing 
entrepreneurial talent
RMS has been nurturing a global 
community of talent with a particular 
emphasis on enhancing the quality of 
the catastrophe modelling team, which 
increased in size by 25% last year. As part 
of the refocusing of RMS(one)’s direction, 
a reorganisation of the business resulted 
in a reduction in staff of just under 10%, 
primarily in software engineering, along 
with the recruitment of key new talent and 
leadership and a concerted effort to focus 
critical work behind top existing internal 
talent. Appropriate retention and incentive 
plans have been put in place as part of the 
overall approach to attracting, retaining 
and developing the right capabilities 
across the RMS organisation.
Risks
The most significant risks for RMS are those 
relating to the launch and subsequent 
performance of RMS(one). RMS is 
dependent on a small number of third 
parties for platform and application 
development. Non-performance by one or 
more of these third parties could jeopardise 
the planned release of RMS(one), the 
quality of the final product, or subsequent 
client adoption rates. Controls in place to 
reduce this risk include additional Board 
governance, financial incentives and 
contract milestones, and these relationships 
are constantly monitored and reviewed.
To mitigate the development risks, RMS has 
in-sourced expertise and resources from 
highly specialised partners for platform 
and for application development. RMS’s 
in-house team continue to have the major 
role in the development, launch and sales 
of RMS(one). The risk from a loss of key talent 
remains relevant. 
Additional risks relating to RMS(one) are that 
the cloud infrastructure does not meet client 
usage and service level commitments.
Priorities in the year ahead
The main focus for the RMS management 
team in 2015 will be the continued 
development of RMS(one). RMS is 
committed to delivering a product which 
meets and then exceeds clients’ needs 
and expectations, and one which will 
transform the long-term growth prospects 
of the business.
Alongside this, RMS will maintain a vigorous 
programme of catastrophe modelling 
development, responding to the global 
climate change debate and other 
important risk themes. Two important core 
model releases for RMS in early 2015 will be 
updates to the European Windstorm and 
North Atlantic Hurricane models. RMS is 
also developing the industry’s first High-
Definition models, which will include the 
Japan Typhoon, European Flood, New 
Zealand Earthquake and US Earthquake.
Overall, RMS will ensure that it maintains 
and strengthens its position as a world 
leader in risk management solutions. 
Outlook
RMS expects underlying revenue growth to 
be in the low single digits in 2015. Significant 
RMS(one) revenues and amortisation costs 
are not expected to commence until 
financial year 2016, due to the delayed 
delivery of the product. With the changed 
approach to product development, 
capitalised development expenditure 
in financial year 2015 is expected to be 
materially lower than the £36 million in 
financial year 2014. The combination of the 
reduced capitalisation of development 
costs and committed increases in RMS(one) 
data centre costs will result in RMS’s overall 
operating profit margin being around 10% 
to 15% in financial year 2015. 
“ We are pursuing a vigorous 
programme of catastrophe 
modelling development to 
lead and respond to escalating 
global risk issues including 
climate change.”
Hemant Shah, Co-Founder and CEO
RMS(one): 2015 key actions
 
When completed, RMS(one) will be  
the first and only real-time exposure  
and risk management environment 
for insurers and reinsurers. We are 
implementing a revised plan for RMS(one) 
which will have four key implications:
1)  We do not now expect any new 
meaningful revenues from RMS(one) 
until FY 2016, with a consequent 
adverse impact on profitability 
in FY 2015 (see Outlook section). 
2)  Our immediate focus is to meet the 
needs of our six Joint Development 
Partner clients. We are working 
closely with them on an agile 
programme of incremental 
deliverables throughout 2015. 
3)  We will continue to support existing 
RMS products that are in the market 
for years to come. 
4)  We are continuing to work on the 
schedule of what capabilities will 
be available and when. At a 
minimum, the first high-definition 
models will be released to our client 
base by late 2015.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE dmg information’s companies are experts 
in their field, providing high-value B2B 
content and information services to the 
property, education and energy sectors.
Business model 
Each of dmg information’s companies 
has a strong position in its market niche, 
operating in attractive, long-cycle sectors 
with good growth prospects. Proprietary 
content and vertical expertise, combined 
with a strong focus on class-leading 
content and solutions delivery, ensures 
close customer relationships are built 
and maintained. Around 90% of dmg 
information’s revenues are subscription 
based or quasi-subscription based 
with high renewal rates and healthy 
profit margins. 
Performance highlights
dmg information delivered another year 
of good performance, achieving broad-
based, double-digit growth in underlying 
revenues across most of the portfolio. 
Revenues were £391 million with underlying 
growth of 12%. Reported revenue 
growth was 34% reflecting the benefit of 
acquisitions partly offset by the adverse 
impact of the strength of the British pound 
relative to the US dollar. 
Operating profit increased by an 
underlying 26% to £68 million with an 
operating margin of 17%.
Margins declined compared to the 
previous year due to the acquisition of the 
lower margin Decision Insight Information 
Group (DIIG) (known as SearchFlow) 
and the inclusion, for the first time, of 
loss-making Xceligent as a subsidiary. 
The underlying margin adjusted for 
these increased nicely, reflecting good 
flow-through of profit from new sales.
Achieving the optimal balance of organic 
investment and bolt-on acquisitions is 
an increasingly important element of 
dmg information’s strategy. The business 
continued to actively manage its portfolio 
in the property and energy sectors and 
made strategic investments elsewhere. 
In property, revenues grew by 13% on an 
underlying basis. EDR delivered robust 
growth in the context of a flat US commercial 
property market, supported by the roll-out 
of the EDR Lender Portal, a web-based 
compliance application. Xceligent, the 
provider of verified US commercial real 
estate information, continued to build out its 
geographical footprint. In the UK, Landmark 
and SearchFlow produced strong growth, 
buoyed by the upswing in the residential 
property market and further new 
product initiatives. 
In education, Hobsons grew its revenues 
by an underlying 12%. In the US, Hobsons’ 
services continue to benefit from rising 
demand from high schools and from higher 
education institutions for their enrolment 
services. New product launches included 
Naviance Curriculum, a blended learning 
solution to help students reach their 
long-term career goals using proprietary 
video content. Hobsons’ Australian business 
continued its expansion with a diversified 
product offering through Edumate 
and Naviance. 
In energy, Genscape continued its strong 
growth trajectory providing real-time, 
fundamental production data and analysis 
across the power, oil, gas, agriculture, 
biofuels and maritime shipping markets. 
Underlying revenues rose by 21% with good 
organic growth from its oil, North American 
gas and biodiesel products. 
The financial information businesses, 
Trepp and Lewtan, delivered underlying 
revenue growth of 5%. In the context of 
the continuing challenges faced by the 
financial markets they serve, this was an 
encouraging performance and reflects 
the companies’ strength of market position 
and successful product innovation. 
DMG INFORMATION 
dmg information is a portfolio of  
innovative companies, providing specialist

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATING BUSINESS REVIEW Active portfolio management
Since 2011, dmg information has become 
increasingly focused on strategically 
aligned acquisitions to optimise its 
long-term growth potential. The largest 
of these to date was SearchFlow, for 
£76 million in October 2013, a property 
information company complementary 
to dmg information’s existing businesses. 
Genscape acquired Energytics, a provider 
of information services to energy traders. 
With the Energytics predictive analytics 
services, Genscape is expanding its 
real-time and day-ahead power market 
analytics. Hobsons expanded into the 
Indian education market with the purchase 
of a 10% stake in iProf Learning Solutions, 
a leading learning management and test 
preparation provider.
Lewtan was sold after the financial year 
end. The business was sold to maintain 
our strategic priority to be a rigorous and 
active portfolio manager and to dispose of 
businesses when they have a higher value 
to another owner. Trepp will be classified 
under property information going forward.
Strategic priorities
Fostering innovation to deliver 
organic growth
dmg information continues to invest 
organically to ensure that its companies 
have product and technology foundations 
that can scale with the continued growth 
of the businesses. 
Hobsons further developed its position 
in the education market through the 
launch of Radius, the first Student Lifecycle 
Management solution to proactively 
engage students during recruitment, 
enrolment and through to graduation. 
Trepp consolidated its position in the 
commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) market with the launch of Trepp 
Trade a collaborative workflow solution 
that provides bid list management, analysis 
and colour tracking.
Driving international growth
dmg information continues to expand its 
geographic footprint and has invested in 
regional headquarters in Singapore and 
a centralised office in Delhi, India. Together 
these create the foundations to bolster 
international growth. Within its businesses, 
there is also a focus on international 
growth. With its new office in Kuala Lumpur, 
Hobsons is an early entrant into Asia and is 
seeking to leverage the existing product set 
and services already provided in Australia. 
Additionally, Asia Risk Centre (ARC) the 
independent specialised modelling and 
analytics company in the agriculture 
domain, is now included in dmg 
information’s portfolio, and has offices 
in Singapore, California and Delhi. 
Attracting and developing 
entrepreneurial talent
As a parent group, dmg information nurtures 
an environment where entrepreneurs have 
the freedom to innovate and lead their 
companies in a fast-changing market. 
Given the increasing scale of dmg 
information’s strategic ambitions, there has 
been a renewed focus on enhancing and 
strengthening talent within the individual 
businesses. In particular, Landmark and 
Genscape have expanded their teams to 
ensure the resources are in place to meet 
their growth expectations. 
Risks
The principal risks impacting dmg 
information are those arising from a data 
security breach and the regulation of data. 
Within business information companies 
that are holding significant volumes of 
data, some of which is of a personal nature, 
a data breach could negatively impact 
the reputation of the business and trust of 
its customers. dmg information businesses 
such as Hobsons, Trepp and Genscape 
could be adversely impacted by a data 
breach or cyberattack.
Similarly, any new law or regulation that 
requires the free public provision of energy 
or environmental property information 
would dilute the value of a number of dmg 
information’s businesses such as Landmark, 
EDR and Genscape. 
Other risks relating to dmg information’s 
high-growth businesses include talent 
development and retention, emergence 
of new competitors and failure to identify 
new technological trends in the market.
Priorities in the year ahead
dmg information will continue to execute 
on its strategy with a commitment to: 
organic growth and innovation; a 
continued focus on bolt-on acquisitions; 
and a continuous study of new sectors and 
geographic entry opportunities. It is also 
an active portfolio manager, constantly 
reviewing its businesses for strategic fit.
Outlook
Given the long-cycle nature of the sectors 
served, there will be a bias towards 
long-term investment and decision making 
rather than reflecting short-term trading 
dynamics. Overall, revenues are expected 
to grow by around 10% on an underlying 
basis in 2015. Over the next three years, 
further efficiencies are expected from 
greater scale, although in the near term 
further investment will be required to 
expand our geographic footprint 
and make appropriate technology 
developments. Operating margins are 
expected to remain in the high teens 
in 2015.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE With access to fast-changing market 
environments, dmg events now generates 
growth from almost half a million visitors 
per year, and over 13,000 exhibitors from 
more than 60 countries. An entrepreneurial 
culture backed by investment has 
encouraged extensive innovation which 
has created strong levels of growth. 
Business model
Operating over 70 fairs and conferences 
annually across over 20 countries has seen 
the business establish a balanced and 
diversified global footprint. Many of the 
events are highly regarded, large-scale 
events enjoying strong growth. A market-
focused strategy has enabled fast 
expansion through a clear ability to 
deliver high-quality events in response 
to clients’ needs.
Performance highlights 
dmg events delivered strong results in 2014, 
with underlying revenue growth of 21% and 
underlying profit growth of 29%. Reported 
results benefited from one of the large 
biennial events, Global Petroleum Show 
(GPS), being held in June 2014 but were 
adversely impacted by the stronger 
British pound relative to the US dollar.
dmg events has created a range of 
value-added initiatives which have driven 
demand and expanded the size of the 
existing events. These have included 
adding new sections and demonstrations 
as well as creating educational features 
and additional content. It has also enabled 
the successful increase in the frequency 
of some of the large events, with strong 
performances from Gastech, GPS and 
ADIPEC. The business has also successfully 
operated in a variety of new geographies 
within the ‘Energy and Construction’ 
portfolios, expanding into new countries 
such as Mexico, Kuwait, India and South 
Korea during 2014. 
The ‘Construction & Interiors’ and ‘Hotel 
& Hospitality’ assets have experienced 
dynamic growth particularly with the Big 5, 
INDEX and Hotel Show brands. The Big 5 
Dubai event has established itself as the 
largest construction event in the Middle 
East and Africa, creating successful 
geo-clones in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and 
India. INDEX, a design exhibition, and 
the Hotel show, both Middle East based, 
enjoyed strong growth generated from 
the addition of new event sections 
and features.
Strategic priorities 
Strategic priorities remain focused on 
developing a balanced and diversified 
portfolio of market-leading, branded 
events. Given the growth opportunities 
within the existing portfolio, dmg events 
will remain in the high-spend, long-cycle 
sectors with strong macro trends of ‘Energy, 
Construction & Interiors’ and ‘Hotel & 
Hospitality’. Over the medium term, further 
expansion will be accelerated by entering 
new long-cycle, high-spend related sectors 
in both established and emerging markets. 
Fostering innovation to deliver organic 
growth/Using technology to enable growth 
Our entrepreneurial culture will enable 
continued successful innovation to drive 
organic growth. In addition, adopting the 
latest technologies to enhance the user 
experience, such as apps which enhance 
event navigation and communication, 
in-door positioning and near-field 
communications, will improve the quality 
of events. Through the use of mobile 
technology, using big data from events to 
gain greater visitor knowledge, exhibitors’ 
marketing can be more targeted, scientific 
and therefore more effective.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATING BUSINESS REVIEW Maintaining rigorous and active  
portfolio management
During 2014, investment has been 
allocated to expand existing successful 
sectors. The Quartz Coatings event 
acquisition made in January 2014 
complemented the existing Middle East 
Coatings show. The acquisition, which 
operates in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, 
Mexico and Morocco, is also expected to 
enable cloning of existing events into new 
geographies. In the year ahead, dmg 
events will continue to examine a variety 
of strategic investments and acquisitions 
in either existing or new geographies 
and sectors. 
Driving international growth
dmg events will continue to expand into 
new geographies where appropriate. High 
levels of growth have been generated from 
emerging markets through establishing 
strong stakeholder relationships and by 
carefully identifying markets that are less 
volatile and aligned to dmg events’ 
sectors. In the medium term, dmg events 
expects to expand its presence in the 
following areas:
• North and Latin America;
• South East Asia, India and China;
• Africa; and
• Arabian Gulf.
Attracting and developing 
entrepreneurial talent
A light touch management style, 
supported by recruiting top talent with 
proven entrepreneurial skills, continues to 
help dmg events to grow. Through training, 
backed by mentoring and coaching, 
dmg events constantly aims to create 
leading events teams. Incentive schemes, 
awards and recognition programmes 
are developed to make dmg events the 
preferred events environment for ambitious 
top talent.
Risks
The key risk facing dmg events is reliance on 
venues. dmg events is reliant on third-party 
venues in which key events are run. The loss 
of a key venue shortly before a major show 
could result in a cancelled, or significantly 
curtailed, event with a resultant impact on 
both revenue in the year of cancellation 
and, potentially, in subsequent years. 
Other risks include talent development 
and retention, competitor threats and 
geopolitical unrest or a catastrophe, 
which could affect global travel.
Priorities in the year ahead 
Following a very successful Global 
Petroleum Show in 2014, to meet market 
demand, the event will be moving to 
an annual basis in 2015. The increased 
frequency of this large event will be a 
clear priority for the Energy business. 
The continuing strategy of driving strong 
entrepreneurially led organic growth 
will be accelerated through increased 
investment in new sectors and geographies. 
Outlook
Gastech, one of dmg events’ largest 
events, won’t be occurring during FY 2015 
and the Global Petroleum Show is 
expected to be a smaller event as it 
moves from a biennial to an annual cycle. 
Consequently, reported revenues are 
expected to decline by around 10% 
although, given the range of growth 
initiatives across the dmg events portfolio, 
underlying revenues are expected to 
increase by between 10% and 15%. 
The operating margin is expected to 
be between 20% and 25%.
“ Innovation initiatives and a 
market-focused strategy are 
creating exciting long-term 
opportunities for dmg events.”

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE Euromoney is a major contributor to our B2B 
strategy of achieving international growth, 
particularly in emerging markets. It is 
publicly listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and DMGT owns a c. 68% stake.
Business model
Euromoney is an entrepreneurial B2B 
organisation operating in fast-changing, 
international markets. Investment in its 
Delphi digital platform (see page 23 
for information) enables the long-term 
growth of its products and services, with 
a particular strategic focus on increasing 
the proportion of subscription revenues.
Euromoney is focused on the 
international finance, metals and 
commodities sectors. It provides digital 
research and data, publishes both online 
and print titles and runs conferences, 
seminars and training courses all over 
the world. Half of Euromoney’s revenues 
derive from subscriptions and a third 
from emerging markets. 
Performance highlights
Euromoney continues to operate in 
challenging conditions in several of its 
markets, which impacts its performance. 
Revenues were up by 3% on an underlying 
basis at £407 million. Flat reported revenues 
reflected the benefit of acquisitions offset 
by the strength of the British pound relative 
to the US dollar. The operating margin 
remained stable reflecting tight control 
of underlying costs offset by the planned 
investment in digital publishing, including 
the Delphi platform.
The performance reflects modest growth 
in subscription services, helped by 
improving conditions in the asset 
management sector. There was good 
growth in event sponsorship and delegate 
revenues and profits, in the context of 
challenging financial and commodities 
markets. Advertising revenues were weak 
reflecting the continued pressure on 
global financial institutions. 
By division, Research and Data delivered 
a slight underlying decline in revenues 
through the subscription services of 
BCA and Ned Davis Research (NDR). 
Financial Publishing and Business 
Publishing both produced good revenue 
performances although operating 
margins decreased reflecting the 
investment in the transition to a digital-first 
publishing model. The Conferences and 
Seminars division delivered growth in 
revenues and profits benefiting from its 
exposure to the asset management 
industry. Training revenues declined as 
banking sector customers reduced their 
spending, although margins increased 
slightly following a restructuring undertaken 
in the previous year.
Euromoney has a strong balance sheet 
with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.3 times. 
Investment in the digital transformation 
of Euromoney continued with the launch 
of the first products (BCA Research and 
Global Capital) on its new technology 
platform, Delphi, which was delivered 
on time and on budget. 
Strategic priorities
Euromoney’s overall strategy remains the 
building of a robust and tightly-focused 
global online B2B information business 
with an emphasis on emerging markets. 
Fostering innovation to deliver 
organic growth
Euromoney regards innovation as critical 
to the future success of the business 
and continues to invest in new products, 
services and technology to meet 
increasing digitally driven demand. 
For instance, in response to changes in 
regulation, Euromoney’s Global Capital 
launched a new renmimbi (RMB) data 
and news analysis service on all 
aspects of the internationalisation  
of the RMB market.

There were two significant acquisitions 
in the year. 
Euromoney acquired Infrastructure Journal 
for £13 million in October 2013. Infrastructure 
Journal has been successfully combined 
with Euromoney’s Project Finance business 
to create a comprehensive online source of 
news, analysis and data for the international 
infrastructure market under a new brand, 
IJ Global. The Mining Indaba brand was 
acquired, as part of the £46 million Summit 
Professional Networks transaction, and 
operates the world’s largest mining 
investment forum and Africa’s largest 
mining event. Mining Indaba provides 
Euromoney with an excellent opportunity 
to expand its position in the commodities 
and mining investment markets.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATING BUSINESS REVIEW In November 2014, Euromoney announced 
plans to acquire a 15.5% equity stake in a 
new company incorporated to acquire 
Dealogic Holdings Plc. The investment 
will be funded through the disposal of 
Euromoney’s interests in Capital DATA 
and Capital NET.
Driving international growth
Euromoney’s main offices are in London, 
New York, Montreal and Hong Kong. 
More than a third of its revenues are 
derived from emerging markets, with 
customers in over 200 countries, which 
creates a highly diversified organisation 
by both geography and customer type.
Using technology to enable growth
Investment in technology was a particular 
emphasis in the year. Delphi, the new 
platform for authoring, storing and 
delivering content, is the largest internal 
investment in the company’s history and 
is a significant long-term competitive 
development for the business. It is expected 
to improve the quality and relevance of 
existing subscription products as well as 
increase the speed to market of new digital 
information services. 
The first products launched on the Delphi 
platform include a fully integrated online 
research service from BCA Research. 
Euromoney’s capital markets content 
was combined under a new Global 
Capital brand to create an international 
news and data service on a single, 
device-neutral platform. 
Euromoney is also developing Investor 
Intelligence Network, a private online 
network connecting buyers, sellers and 
intermediaries in asset management 
worldwide. It gives investors sophisticated 
tools to deploy capital. 
Attracting and developing 
entrepreneurial talent
The Capital Appreciation Plan (CAP) is 
Euromoney’s long-term incentive scheme 
designed to retain and reward profit growth 
and is an integral part of the delivery of 
Euromoney’s successful growth strategy. 
At the AGM in January 2014, shareholders 
approved the introduction of the new 
2014 CAP.
A series of training initiatives have been 
started to improve digital capabilities 
across key functions including content 
creation, technology and sales and 
marketing. The programmes are aimed 
at increasing the skills base of the 
Company to give further momentum 
to Euromoney’s growth strategy.

Euromoney holds and publishes large 
quantities of information and data 
including customer, employee and 
commercial data. The integrity, availability 
and security of this information is key to 
the continued success of the business. 
The investment banking sector, particularly 
fixed income, accounts for roughly half 
of Euromoney’s revenues. Challenging 
market conditions have shown few signs 
of improvement and increased regulatory 
pressure on investment banks continues 
to affect trading.
The emergence of new, sometimes 
disruptive technologies and the proliferation 
of social media is changing how customers 
access and use Euromoney’s products and 
services. A failure to respond to these 
changes and migrate the publishing 
businesses from traditional print media to 
interactive, searchable, online products, 
and to keep pace with developments in 
the delivery of events and training, could 
impact on the value of the Group’s 
products and services.
Other risks relating to Euromoney include 
published content risk, portfolio 
management and compliance risk.
Priorities in the year ahead
Euromoney will continue to pursue its 
strategy to accelerate various growth 
opportunities. The exploitation and roll-out 
of the Delphi platform to boost organic 
growth will be a priority in the year. 
Euromoney expects to use its financial 
strength to fund further acquisitions. To 
complement the established and more 
mature assets in the portfolio, Euromoney 
is increasingly looking at earlier stage 
businesses to invest in where opportunities 
are more extensive.
Outlook
The pressures on the investment banking 
sector, which accounts for nearly half of 
Euromoney’s revenues, show no real sign 
of easing. Euromoney’s businesses serving 
the asset management sector have seen 
conditions improve during 2014 and are 
positioned for further growth over the 
coming year. 
“ The Delphi platform has created 
opportunities for Euromoney 
through new product innovation 
and ever-increasing customer 
satisfaction.”
Christopher Fordham, Managing Director
Delphi and BCA Research
Delphi is Euromoney’s group-wide 
content platform to allow its businesses 
to enhance product value and 
generate cost efficiencies.
BCA Research was one of the first 
businesses to adopt Delphi, opening 
up the business to new possibilities:
1)  Customers are now able to search 
and interrogate content across 
geographies and asset classes, 
instantly and online.
2)  Intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces make 
it possible for users to access and 
customise data from multiple 
sources.
3)  BCA is delivering the full potential of 
its information and insight, keeping it 
relevant and vital to its customers.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE dmg media remains close to its customers 
through delivering highly valued content 
with a platform-agnostic approach, a 
model which is increasingly flexible in the 
fast-moving consumer market.
Business model
dmg media’s portfolio of print and 
digital consumer media businesses 
includes two of the UK’s most read paid-for 
newspapers, Daily Mail and The Mail 
on Sunday, and the world’s most visited 
English language newspaper website, 
MailOnline. The Mail brand is the number 
one newspaper brand in the UK and has 
achieved scale in other geographic 
markets, including the US. The portfolio also 
includes Metro, one of the world’s biggest 
free newspapers and Wowcher, one of the 
UK’s largest online vouchering websites. 
Revenues are generated from advertising 
and circulation, with an increasing 
proportion from digital revenue streams. 
The newspaper businesses continue 
to generate the significant proportion 
of profits whilst the digital businesses 
are driving dmg media’s overall 
revenue growth.
Performance highlights
dmg media delivered a good 
performance. Revenues were £796 million, 
in line with the previous year on an 
underlying basis, reflecting a resilient 
newspaper performance and strong 
growth from both MailOnline and 
Wowcher. Operating profits were 
£95 million, an underlying increase of 
28% with a margin of 12%. The increase in 
profitability was a result of stable revenues 
combined with significant cost efficiencies 
in the newspaper businesses.
The newspapers grew profits and 
improved operating margin with strong 
conversion to cash. The newspapers also 
strengthened their position in the market. 
Further investment was committed to the 
digital businesses to drive long-term 
growth, particularly at MailOnline. 
dmg media’s transformation to a focused 
portfolio of assets has involved further 
portfolio management activity, including 
the disposal of Evenbase. It also resulted 
in £20 million of exceptional restructuring 
costs in the year, notably resulting from 
reduced headcount in the newspaper 
businesses and central functions.
Mail titles
Advertising revenues from the Mail titles 
increased by 4% on an underlying basis to 
£252 million, with growth in digital revenue 
more than offsetting declines in print. 
MailOnline (including metro.co.uk)
delivered £62 million of advertising 
revenues, an increase of 46% compared 
to the previous year. The decline in print 
advertising revenues of 5% to £190 million 
reflects the continuing growth in 
competition for advertising budgets 
from other media, particularly digital.
Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday 
increased their average share of the UK 
national newspaper market for the year 
to 22.5% and 21.3% respectively. Total 
circulation revenues were £326 million, 
an underlying decline of 4%. Mail Plus, the 
paid-for online version of Daily Mail and  
The Mail on Sunday, continued to develop 
its product and interactive capabilities and 
had 46,000 subscribers by the year end. 
MailOnline grew its global audience to 
185 million monthly unique browsers and 
11.8 million average daily unique browsers 
in September 2014. The average number of 
monthly unique browsers during the year 
increased by 41% compared to the prior 
year and the average daily unique 
browsers increased by 38%. 
DMG MEDIA 
dmg media’s transformation to a focused 
portfolio of businesses delivering high 
quality, popular content to a scaled 
audience is well advanced.

Key developments
• Investment in MailOnline, in particular 
international expansion
• Delivery of cost efficiencies in the Mail 
Newspapers
• Completion of sale of Evenbase 
(October 2014)
MailOnline continues to focus on 
increasing the size and engagement level 
of its global audience and, in particular, its 
US audience. There were 63 million monthly 
unique US browsers and 3.2 million average 
daily unique US browsers in September 
2014, with average growth during the 
whole year of 45% and 42% respectively.
Metro 
Metro, the free morning newspaper 
targeting urban commuters, remains 
the UK’s third largest daily and one of 
the world’s biggest free newspapers. 
It achieved revenues of £75 million in 
the year, a decline of 3%.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATING BUSINESS REVIEW Wowcher
Wowcher, the daily deals and online 
discounts business, delivered substantial 
growth with revenues increasing by 73% to 
£24 million. With a database of 5.95 million 
subscribers, it is extending its product 
offering to drive future growth. Wowcher 
broke even in the second half of 2014 and 
expects to be profitable during FY 2015.
Evenbase
The Evenbase businesses, which were 
disposed of in 2014, contributed revenues 
of £53 million, with operating profits of 
£15 million.
Strategic priorities
The business remains focused on 
maintaining the profitability of the 
newspapers whilst generating revenue 
growth through its digital businesses. 
dmg media continues to innovate with 
content, product and distribution initiatives 
to develop a scalable global audience, 
whilst remaining committed to the highest 
editorial standards.
Fostering innovation to deliver 
organic growth
MailOnline continued to develop its content 
and product offering, including Fashion 
Finder, Chatterbox, (the eCommerce and 
advertising initiative), enhanced video 
content and an increasing focus on mobile 
applications. Metro’s digital operation, 
metro.co.uk, was transferred into 
MailOnline to drive synergies and maximise 
revenue opportunities whilst delivering 
a differentiated content proposition for 
a younger audience. 
The Mail titles’ marketing strategy combines 
effective content-driven promotions 
utilising the Mail Rewards Club database to 
generate customer information across the 
network. The MyMail portal was launched 
in October 2014, with consumers able to 
view content, earn points and carry out 
eCommerce transactions. The Mail Travel 
platform was also relaunched in 
September 2014 with encouraging 
early results.
Maintaining rigorous and active  
portfolio management
The sale of Jobsite in October 2014 was 
the final step in the disposal of Evenbase, 
following the sale of Jobrapido, OilCareers 
and Broadbean earlier in the year. The sale 
completed dmg media’s exit from the 
digital recruitment market, enabling it 
to focus on the core Mail businesses.
Total proceeds were £152 million 
including £92 million in October 2014. 
The decision to exit the digital recruitment 
market reflects the commitment to active 
portfolio management.
Driving international growth
MailOnline has continued its pursuit of 
international growth with investment and 
expansion in the US, Canada and Australia. 
Nearly 20% of MailOnline’s revenue was 
generated in the US in the year, with 
revenues more than doubling on the 
previous year. It now employs over 160 
people in the North American region, 
where both editorial and commercial 
teams have been strengthened in order 
to drive audience and revenue growth. 
In January 2014, MailOnline launched 
an Australian joint venture with Mi9, part 
of the Nine Entertainment Co, with the 
partnership contributing improved 
advertising relationships and video content. 
Attracting and developing 
entrepreneurial talent
Talent remained a key priority in the year. 
The programme aimed to ensure that the 
right skills, experience and structure are 
in place to implement the exciting future 
of the business. 
dmg media made a number of key 
strategic hires, particularly in digital 
activities, reflecting the developing 
nature of the business. This included 
investment in critical support functions 
such as Technology, Finance and Human 
Resources, which are seen as key enabling 
services to future success. The Graduate 
scheme focused on recruiting specifically 
into a Business Analysis Graduate 
programme to develop dmg media’s 
analytical capabilities.
dmg media received a variety of industry 
awards for editorial excellence as well as 
media and advertising campaigns. 
Risks
The principal risks to dmg media relate to 
the successful execution of the MailOnline 
growth strategy and continued changes 
in the national newspaper market leading 
to an acceleration in any ongoing decline 
of circulation and advertising revenues.
MailOnline continues to grow a significant 
global audience. The MailOnline 
management team is currently focused on 
growing advertising revenue in the UK, US, 
Australia and across the rest of the world. 
The successful delivery of this growth 
requires investment and carries a degree 
of uncertainty. 
As digital media markets have grown, the 
newspaper market has declined. Our print 
titles have consistently outperformed the 
market, successfully managing the decline 
in print revenue and restructuring their cost 
bases, to deliver robust profits. Our industry 
continues to face these challenges 
which present both ongoing risks, and 
also opportunities. 
Other risks faced by individual businesses 
include the failure of key newspaper 
industry-specific suppliers, information 
security, data protection, cyber risk and 
the retention and recruitment of high-
quality staff.
Priorities in the year ahead
The benefits of the portfolio changes, the 
reductions in costs and the investment in 
initiatives to drive growth, will help dmg 
media continue to perform well. While 
downward pressure on newspaper 
advertising and circulation is likely to 
continue, growth in digital revenues and 
the benefits of a more efficient cost base 
are expected to mitigate the impact 
on profitability. 
Outlook 
Investment in our growth businesses will 
continue, particularly at MailOnline where 
the long-term opportunities and potential 
returns are attractive. 
Underlying revenues are expected to be 
stable with operating margins to be around 
12%, in line with last year. 
“ The strength and trust inherent 
in the Mail brand provides 
long-term opportunities for 
dmg media through both print 
and digital formats.”

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE Performance highlights
Adjusted profit before tax rose by 9% to 
£291 million  reflecting a 4% rise in 
operating profit, an increased 
contribution from joint ventures and 
associates and a reduced net finance 
charge. The recommended full-year 
dividend increased by 6% . The review 
shows the balanced nature of DMGT’s 
portfolio of businesses by revenue type, 
sector and geography and emphasises 
the rising contribution to revenues from 
digital operations. 
RMS
This Financial Review would not be 
complete without some comment on RMS, 
given the level of attention that it has, 
quite rightly, received from the investment 
community over the past year. RMS’s profit 
margin in the year fell to 26%, compared to 
32% the previous year, due to incremental 
costs associated with RMS(one), notably 
data centre costs. 
Over the past four years we have been 
capitalising the software development 
costs of RMS(one) and as at the end of the 
year these amounted to £86 million and 
were carried on the balance sheet. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW

In this report, underlying revenue or profit* is revenue or profit on a like-for-like basis, adjusted for constant exchange rates, disposals, closures and non-annual events occurring in 
the current and prior year and acquisitions. For dmg information, underlying growth includes the year-on-year organic growth from acquisitions and excludes ECCTIS, a Hobsons 
business, which was disposed of in January 2014. For dmg events, the comparisons are between events held in the year and the same events held the previous time other than 
ADIPEC, which became an annual event in November 2013 and which is compared to 50% of the revenues and profits of the biennial November 2012 event. For Euromoney, 
no adjustments are made for the timing of events but acquisitions are excluded completely and underlying profit excludes the benefit in both FY 2013 and FY 2014 of the historic 
acceleration of its CAP incentive plan charge. For dmg media, underlying comparisons exclude contract printing revenue, which ceased last year, the central and eastern 
European businesses, which were disposed of last year, Villarenters, Metro Play, OilCareers, Broadbean and Jobrapido, which were disposed of this year, and distribution services, 
which ceased earlier this year. dmg media’s underlying revenues only include the profit but not the gross-up, equivalent to the cost of sales, from low margin newsprint resale 
activities. The disposal of Jobsite, formerly part of dmg media’s Evenbase portfolio, completed in October 2014 and the business is still included in the underlying figures. 
Northcliffe Media is excluded from the DMGT Group underlying comparisons.

All figures are rounded to the nearest million pounds, consequently not all totals equal the sum of the component integers.
Following a review of the appropriateness 
and justification of this carrying value, the 
decision was taken to impair £45 million 
of the cumulative software development 
spend, resulting in the carrying value of 
the RMS(one) asset being reduced from 
£86 million to £41 million. This resulted from 
revisions to the timing of RMS(one) releases, 
following the delay of its launch, and 
anticipated phasing of client adoption. 
In addition to this impairment, which is 
treated as an exceptional item, the 
business incurred £4 million of further 
exceptional costs associated with a 
reduction in headcount, following a 
change in the approach to the 
development of RMS(one). 
As a result of the changed approach, 
capitalised RMS(one) development costs 
in the coming year will be materially lower 
than the £36 million capitalised in FY 2014. 
The reduced capitalisation of expenditure, 
combined with committed increases in 
data centre costs, is expected to result in 
RMS’s overall operating profit margin being 
around 10% to 15% in financial year 2015. 
Given the delay in the launch of RMS(one), 
significant revenues and amortisation 
costs are not expected to commence 
until FY 2016. 
Revenue performance
Group revenues in the financial year 
increased by 5% on an underlying basis 
. On a reported basis, revenues rose 
by 3% and were adversely impacted by the 
strength of the British pound relative to the 
US dollar, an average exchange rate of 
£1:$1.66 compared to £1:$1.56 in the prior 
year. Reported revenues benefited from 
acquisitions made during the year, the 
impact of which outweighed that of 
revenues lost with disposals. 
There was good underlying growth in 
several revenue categories, particularly 
events and digital advertising, which was 
partly offset by the revenue decline in print 
advertising and circulation.
Revenues from B2B businesses, comprising 
RMS, dmg information, dmg events 
and Euromoney Institutional Investor 
(Euromoney), were £1,069 million, 
an underlying increase of 8%. 
RMS grew underlying revenues by 4% to 
£172 million. The core modelling business 
saw continuing good demand for its 
subscription services and overall renewal 
rates remained in excess of 95%. RMS 
continued the development of RMS(one) 
during the year and incremental releases 
to Joint Development Partners are 
expected in 2015 though significant 
revenues are not expected until FY 2016. 
dmg information’s revenues increased 
by an underlying 12% to £391 million in the 
year, buoyed by improving conditions in 
the UK property market and continued 
good growth in its education and energy 
businesses. Reported revenue growth of 
34% reflects the impact of acquisitions 
made during the year.
dmg events’ revenues of £100 million grew 
by an underlying 21%, with the successful 
transition of the ADIPEC event from a 
biennial to annual cycle and good growth 
from the Gastech event.
Euromoney’s revenues increased by 3% on 
an underlying basis to £407 million, though 
reported revenues were stable reflecting 
the strengthening of the British pound. 
Solid growth in subscriptions and events 
was offset by continuing weakness in 
advertising revenues.
Revenues from the consumer business, 
dmg media, were £796 million, stable on 
an underlying basis. Growth in the digital 
businesses, largely MailOnline, offset the 
impact of declining print advertising and 
circulation revenues. 
The charts on page 26 demonstrate DMGT’s 
diverse revenue profile.
Operating profit performance
In the financial year, operating profit 
of £311 million was up by 15% on an 
underlying basis and by 4% on a reported 
basis. The overall operating margin 
remained at 17% , reflecting strong 
growth at dmg media, which improved its 
margin from 10% to 12%, and dmg events, 
offset by reduced margins at RMS and 
dmg information. 
The Group’s B2B operations increased 
overall profit by an underlying 8% to 
£258 million, whilst the profit from consumer 
media was £95 million, an underlying 
increase of 28%. 
The Group’s B2B operations generated 
75% of operating profit and 25% was from 
consumer media. The profit split includes 
corporate costs allocated on a revenue 
basis. Well over half of our profits came 
from outside the UK. 
Financing costs
Adjusted net finance costs, including 
investment income, decreased by 
£4 million to £51 million. Net interest 
payable and similar charges declined 
by 10%, benefiting from the redemption 
of bonds in December 2013. There was 
negligible investment income in the year 
whereas the prior year included a £2 million 
dividend from the Press Association. 
Following its disposal of MeteoGroup, 
“ DMGT aims to deliver sustained 
long-term profitable growth and 
understands the importance 
of reinvesting in the business.”

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC 
REPORT the Press Association paid a dividend 
of £9 million during the year but, given 
the reason for the dividend, it has been 
excluded from adjusted results. 
The pension finance charge, which is 
excluded from adjusted results, was 
£8 million for the year compared to 
£13 million for the prior year. The prior year 
was restated from £15 million of finance 
income following the revision to 
International Accounting Standard 19 –
Employee Benefits [IAS 19 (Revised)].
Exceptional finance costs included a 
£24 million charge for the premium on 
the early redemption, in December 2013, 
of £56 million of 10.0% Bonds, due 2021, 
and £50 million of 5.75% Bonds, due 2018.
Joint ventures and associates
DMGT’s share of the adjusted operating 
profit of joint ventures and associates 
increased from £22 million to £31 million, 
reflecting a £17 million contribution from 
the Zoopla Property Group Plc, in which 
DMGT holds a c. 32% stake, and £15 million 
from Local World, which continued to 
improve its operating margin. The 
contribution from other joint ventures and 
associates was negligible. Xceligent, which 
is in its investment phase, changed from 
being an associate to a subsidiary of dmg 
information in October 2013.
Results before taxation
Adjusted profit before tax rose by 9% to 
£291 million . The statutory pre-tax 
profit for the financial year was £267 million 
compared to £179 million in the prior year.
Taxation
The adjusted tax charge of £59 million 
(2013 £49 million) is stated after adjusting 
for the effect of exceptional items. The 
adjusted tax rate increased from 18.3% 
to 20.1% for the year, primarily due to a 
reduced impact on the rate from tax-
efficient financing and tax deductible 
amortisation in the US. The effective tax 
rate is expected to increase to around 
22% over the next three years.
Profit after tax
Adjusted Group profit after tax and minority 
interests increased by 10% to £207 million. 
Statutory post-tax profit was £283 million, 
compared with £188 million in the prior year.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share 
increased by 12% to 55.7 pence, 
compared with 49.9 pence in the prior year 
. The weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year was 
372.4 million, down from 377.5 million in 
the previous year, as a result of the share 
buy-back programmes announced in 
November 2012 and September 2014.
Exceptional items and amortisation
Exceptional operating costs were 
£72 million in the year, compared to 
£49 million in the prior year. These 
included £27 million of cash items, 
compared to £28 million in the prior year. 
There were £20 million of restructuring 
costs at dmg media, with the reduced 
headcount in its newspaper businesses 
and central functions reflecting the 
considerably more focused portfolio 
of businesses it has become. RMS 
incurred £4 million of restructuring costs 
and a £45 million impairment of the 
RMS(one) software.
The charge for amortisation of intangible 
assets arising on business combinations 
increased by £4 million to £44 million. The 
Group also made an impairment charge 
against goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets of £20 million, including £15 million in 
respect of dmg media’s Jobrapido business 
prior to its disposal.
The Group recorded other net gains on 
disposal of businesses and investments of 
£179 million, compared to a net gain of 
£61 million last year. The gains primarily 
related to the IPO of Zoopla Property Group 
Plc and dmg media’s online recruitment 
businesses, OilCareers and Broadbean.
Capital allocation
The Group’s senior management continues 
to believe that the creation of shareholder 
value over the long term requires a 
balanced and flexible approach to 
investing in growth and returning excess 
capital to shareholders. DMGT benefits 
from the cash generative nature of the 
businesses, proceeds from disposals and 
scope for increasing the level of debt. 
When allocating capital we prioritise 
organic investment, targeting at least 5% of 
revenues each year, followed by targeted 
acquisitions, sustained real dividend 
growth, funding the Group’s pension 
schemes whilst they have an actuarial 
deficit, share buy-backs and, given the 
relatively high coupons on the Group’s 
existing bond debt, bond buy-backs.
Cash flow and net debt
Net debt has increased by £30 million to 
£603 million, and is down from £793 million 
at the half year, reflecting seasonal cash 
flows and disposal proceeds. 
The Group generated operating cash flow 
of £243 million, a conversion rate of 78% of 
operating profits. The conversion rate was 
adversely impacted by increased capital 
expenditure, notably product development 
at dmg information, and increased 
working capital due to reduced trade 
payables. There were net interest payments 
of £53 million in the period and £82 million 
was spent on the DMGT share buy-back 
programmes, including £40 million in 
respect of future payments under incentive 
plans. Active portfolio management

ANNUAL REPORT 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW  continued throughout the year with 
acquisitions totalling £174 million and 
disposals proceeds totalling £253 million. 
Notable acquisitions included DIIG (known 
as SearchFlow), Infrastructure Journal, 
Energytics and the trade and certain assets 
of the Mining Investment Events Division of 
Summit Professional Networks (Mining 
Indaba). Disposals included assets within 
the Evenbase portfolio, namely OilCareers, 
Broadbean and Jobrapido. The disposal 
of Jobsite completed in October 2014 for 
£92 million. DMGT reduced its stake in the 
Zoopla Property Group Plc, through an IPO 
in June 2014, from 52% to 32% and received 
£180 million in proceeds.
DMGT’s principal net debt remains in 
long-term bonds. Following £106 million of 
bond buy-backs in December 2013, at the 
year end the Group had £569 million of 
bonds with £264 million of December 2018, 
£108 million of April 2021 and £196 million 
of June 2027 bonds. The Group also held 
£63 million of other debt and £29 million 
of cash.
Bank facilities were increased by 
£239 million, in March and October 2014, 
to £539 million and, following £149 million 
of bond buy-backs in October 2014, bond 
debt now constitutes less than half of the 
debt available to DMGT. At the year end 
the bank facilities were £489 million, 
of which £430 million was unutilised.
DMGT’s ratio of year-end net debt to 
adjusted profits before interest, depreciation 
and, amortisation (EBITDA) was 1.5 times, 
well below the Group’s preferred upper 
limit of 2.0 times . DMGT regained its 
investment grade corporate credit rating 
from Standard & Poor’s in March 2014 and 
is now rated as BBB-.
Treasury and currency
DMGT maintains sufficient liquidity to 
meet its operational requirements and to 
maintain adequate capital cash flows. 
Financial instruments, including derivatives, 
are used by DMGT in order to manage the 
principal financial risks that arise in the 
course of business. These risks are liquidity 
or funding risks, foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risks and counterparty risks. 
The instruments are used within the 
parameters set by the Investment and 
Finance Committee and approved by the 
Board. The Group’s priority is to address the 
economic impact of financial risks using 
the most efficient or appropriate approach.
Pensions
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes provide retirement benefits for UK 
staff, largely in dmg media. These schemes 
are closed to new entrants. The net deficit 
in the defined benefit schemes increased 
from £208 million at the beginning of the 
year to £212 million at the financial year 
end (calculated in accordance with IAS 19 
(Revised)). Funding payments into the main 
schemes during the year were £50 million, 
including the £13 million final instalment in 
respect of the disposal of Northcliffe Media. 
In February 2014, the Group and Trustees 
agreed a revised funding plan accruing to 
the main schemes through to 2026, totalling 
c. £34 million p.a. to 2020, £28 million p.a. 
to 2022 and then £23 million p.a. thereafter. 
In addition, a contribution equal to 20% of 
any share buy-backs will be contributed 
to the schemes, albeit this will be offset 
by up to £5 million of agreed funding 
contributions each year. Contributions 
will be discontinued should the schemes’ 
actuary agree the schemes are no longer 
in deficit, with the next formal actuarial 
valuation scheduled for 31 March 2016.
There has been no significant change in 
the allocation of the schemes’ investments, 
broadly 75% risk-seeking and 25% non 
risk-seeking. All new UK employees are now 
offered defined contribution pension plans. 
These plans are used to fulfil the Group’s 
obligations under auto-enrolment.
In June 2014 Kevin Abbott was appointed 
Chairman of the Trustees. Kevin is also 
Chairman of the Trustees of Barclays Bank’s 
pension schemes. Kevin replaced Charles 
Wood who had served as Chairman for 
seven years, a period that included five 
actuarial valuations. DMGT would like 
to thank Charles for being an excellent 
steward of the members’ interests.
Capital risk management
The Group’s strategy for capital risk 
management is set out in Note 33 to 
the Accounts.
Share buy-back
DMGT announced a £100 million share 
buy-back programme in November 2012 
and, having acquired £69 million of shares 
in the prior year, the programme was 
completed on 4 September 2014 with 
£31 million of share purchases in the period. 
On 17 September 2014, DMGT announced 
a further £100 million share buy-back 
programme, reflecting the confidence of 
the Board in the growth prospects of DMGT.
Dividends
The dividend policy is to grow dividends 
by between 5% and 7% p.a, in real terms, 
over the long term. The recommended final 
dividend is 14.2 pence which, if approved, 
would make the total dividend for the 
year 20.4 pence, an increase of 6% on the 
prior year.
Financial KPIs  
As part of how we measure success against 
our strategic priorities, we have a number 
of KPIs which are designed to provide key 
measures of performance that are most 
relevant to the Group. These are detailed 
on pages 14 and 15. DMGT and its 
businesses adopted the financial KPIs to 
ensure that the Group delivers continued 
good organic growth; remains highly cash 
generative; reinvests strong cash flow in 
active portfolio management; and offers 
real dividend growth.
DMGT aims to deliver sustained long-term 
profitable growth and understands the 
importance of reinvesting in the businesses 
to support product innovation and the 
effective use of technology. The amount 
spent on organic investment initiatives in 
the year was 7% of revenues. DMGT’s 
success in generating profits across its B2B 
and Consumer operations has enabled 
the Group to make progress against its 
financial KPIs. DMGT remains committed to 
increasing the proportion of revenues from 
digital businesses, from outside the UK and 
from subscription businesses. 
Summary
DMGT delivered record adjusted profit 
before tax in the year, despite currency 
headwinds. The performance in 2015 will 
be adversely impacted by investment in 
RMS(one), the timing of events and the 
disposal of Evenbase. Our strong cash flow 
and flexible capital allocation, along with 
the ability to invest in organic initiatives 
and acquire businesses, both bolt-on 
acquisitions and in new sectors, should 
further help DMGT to meet its financial 
objectives over the long term.
Stephen Daintith
Finance Director
To maintain this performance, 
the Board and management 
undertake to:
• generate underlying revenue growth 
over the course of the business cycle;
• increase Group adjusted profit 
before tax;
• maintain healthy double-digit 
operating margins;
• prudently manage net debt;
• seek sustained earnings per share 
growth; and
• maintain dividend growth in real terms.

Market disruption
Caused by:
• New technologies and products 
e.g. mobile, tablet, cloud and 
big data.
• Globalisation of markets.
• Freely available information 
and content.
• Changing behaviours and 
demands of customers e.g. 
millennials, online adoption, 
digital vs. print, software 
vs. platform and social 
media usage.
• Competitor innovation.
• Market disruption creates 
opportunities as well as threats. 
• As a risk, it affects many businesses 
in the Group, most notably the 
newspapers. 
• Results in falling revenue, margins, 
or the need for significant 
investment to innovate products in 
order to keep pace with changes 
in customer demand, competitors 
and changing behaviours. 
• As an opportunity, disruption 
enables us to move into new 
markets and geographies 
and develop new products 
and businesses.
• The pace of change across all our 
markets has accelerated in recent 
years. DMGT businesses are likely 
to face disruption to their markets 
every year, however a major 
market disruption is only expected 
to occur every five to 10 years.
• The Group’s diverse portfolio 
of businesses and products 
reduces the overall Group 
impact.
• The Board regularly reviews 
the strategy against 
developments.
• The Leadership Team 
monitors markets, the 
competitive landscape and 
technological developments.
• The autonomous culture of 
the Group encourages an 
entrepreneurial approach to 
the development of organic 
growth opportunities and 
new products.
This risk in our 
diversified Group has 
remained relatively 
stable during FY 2014.
Management of portfolio  
and allocation of capital
• Acquisitions fail to yield 
expected value.
• Failure to identify trends in 
the market and identify 
appropriate acquisition 
targets at the right price.
• Failure to identify or successfully 
develop organic growth 
opportunities, for example 
MailOnline.
• Failure to dispose of non-core 
businesses at the right time.
• Underperformance of the Group 
and/or impairment losses. 
• Growth opportunities and 
potential synergies lost by failure 
to identify acquisition targets.
• Diversion of management time 
from other operational matters 
to manage underperforming 
acquisitions.
• The Group completes multiple 
small acquisitions every year, some 
may not perform as expected. 
Larger acquisitions are rarer.
• Adherence to our investment 
criteria and approval by the 
Investment and Finance 
Committee.
• Acquisitions in related 
markets with a high potential 
for growth. 
• Performance of detailed 
due diligence.
• Retention of key employees 
in the acquired businesses.
• Board level monitoring is 
performed post-acquisition.
• Disposals overseen by the 
Board and the Strategy 
Development Director.
The external 
environment and 
rate of acquisitions 
remains stable,  
as a result the risk 
is unchanged.
New product launches and 
developments do not yield 
expected returns
• The Group is constantly 
developing and launching 
innovative new products, 
services and events, including 
enhancements to existing 
offerings. 
• This is a key driver of growth 
for the Group.
• The most significant in recent 
years has been the 
development of RMS(one).
• New products and services may 
not perform as expected, resulting 
in revenue and operating profits 
that are below expectations as 
well as potential impairment losses.
• With a high number of launches 
every year, it is likely that some will 
not perform as expected, however 
it is rare for a single product launch 
to represent a major investment.
• Adherence to our investment 
criteria and approval by the 
Investment and Finance 
Committee.
• Board or specific oversight 
committee monitoring for 
significant investments.
• Product management 
workshop held in 
October 2014.
The most significant 
product launch next 
year will be the staged 
incremental RMS(one) 
deliverables and, 
having experienced 
delays in FY 2014, the 
risk has increased.

PRINCIPAL RISKS Understanding the risks and, just as importantly, the opportunities 
that impact DMGT’s businesses is vital. Effective risk and opportunity 
management saves time and money, and gives assurance  
to management, the DMGT executive team, Risk Committee  
and the Board.
The Group’s risks are categorised as either strategic or operational. Strategic risks are linked to the Group’s 
strategic priorities and impact the whole Group. Operational risks are those arising from the execution of the 
business functions and typically impact on one or more of the operating businesses. Further details of the 
Group’s risk management process, the governance structure surrounding risk and the Risk Committee can  
be found in the Governance Report on page 44.

Securing and retaining the right 
people for senior and business 
critical roles
• The inability to recruit and retain 
talented people could impact 
the Group’s ability to maintain 
its performance and deliver 
growth. 
• Key skills affected by this risk are:
 – Leadership;
 – Entrepreneurship; and
 –  Technology and software 
development.
• Securing and retaining the best 
people in key roles is one of 
the main drivers of business 
performance and growth.
• The inability to find and recruit the 
best people therefore impacts 
DMGT’s operating businesses.
• When key staff leave or retire, 
knowledge, experience or 
competitive advantage may 
be lost if succession plans are 
inadequate.
• At any one time the Group has 
unfilled vacancies for key roles, 
however only a small number of 
roles are deemed to be business 
critical. A significant impact from 
loss of key talent would therefore 
rarely occur.
• Formal approach to 
talent management and 
succession management, 
coordinated centrally 
by DMGT.
• Investment in DMGT 
Leadership Development 
Programme and related 
programmes.
• Payment of competitive 
rewards.
• Alignment of staff incentives 
and Group Strategy.
• Staff performance and 
turnover monitoring.
• Succession and retention 
planning.
• Staff communication. 
The risk has increased 
in RMS as a result of 
the delay to RMS(one) 
but remains stable 
across the rest of 
the Group.
Economic downturn
• UK national newspaper 
advertising revenue is 
impacted by fluctuations 
in the wider economy.
• Euromoney is affected by the 
investment banking sector, 
especially fixed income.
• Property and financial markets 
in the UK and US are similarly 
affected. 
• Lack of growth in other 
key markets.
• A downturn in any of DMGT’s key 
markets, including advertising, 
will impact revenue. 
• If cost savings cannot be made 
to offset falling revenue, profit will 
also fall.
• The likelihood of future impact is 
dependent on external market 
and macroeconomic factors. 
• Diversifying into business 
information and subscription 
revenue streams.
• Investment in strong brands.
• Cross geography and sector 
approach.
The portfolio effect 
reduces the impact 
of individual markets, 
however recent 
growth in the US 
economy reduces the 
outlook for this risk.
US dollar earnings
• A significant portion of Group 
profits arise in US dollars.
• The Group’s functional currency 
is the British pound.
• The strength of the British pound 
compared to the US dollar 
directly impacts earnings 
reported in British pounds.
See Note 33 for more information.
• The pound has strengthened 
against the dollar over FY 2014 
but began to weaken towards 
the end of the year. 
• The impact in the future is 
dependent on global economic 
factors and the proportion of 
earnings arising in US dollars.
• The Investment and Finance 
Committee approve Group 
Treasury Policies.
• Debt is held in proportion to 
currency of earnings as far 
as possible.
The mix of US dollar to 
British pound earnings 
is largely unchanged 
in FY 2014, hence the 
risk remains stable.

Failure or significant delay 
to a major change project 
• The Group undertakes 
change projects every 
year.
• The most significant 
current project is 
RMS(one).
• The planned April 2014 
launch of RMS(one) was 
delayed and will now be 
made available through 
staged incremental 
deliverables during 
FY 2015.
• Increased costs, impairment 
losses and delayed or lower 
revenues can result from a failure 
of, or delay to, a major project.
• This risk has been emphasised 
through the delay of RMS(one).
• A further delay to RMS(one) could 
have a significant impact on 
DMGT’s share price, increase 
the likelihood of further write offs; 
lower adoption rates and reduce 
future revenues.
RMS • Approval by the Investment 
and Finance Committee for 
significant projects.
• Rigorous planning process.
• Ongoing project 
management.
• Monitoring by the local board. 
• Independent third-party 
assessments and reporting to 
the local board for significant 
projects.
• Significant projects are 
reviewed by the Risk 
Committee.
RMS(one) remains 
the largest project 
currently under way.
Information security 
breach or cyberattack 
• Loss of confidential, 
personal or payment card 
information.
• Challenge to the integrity 
of a DMGT product.
• Unavailability of online 
products.
• An information security breach 
would cause reputational 
damage and loss of customer 
confidence, and is likely to result 
in loss of revenue.
• Significant management time 
and cost would be needed to 
investigate and manage the 
incident.
• The risk is relevant to all businesses 
in the Group, especially Hobsons, 
MailOnline, RMS and Euromoney.
• Attacks on Group websites and 
networks are frequent though 
rarely successful. 
All • Group information security 
policy and detailed security 
standards.
• Group policy on business 
continuity planning including 
IT system disaster recovery.
• Oversight by the Risk 
Committee, CTO Council 
and Information Security 
Committee.
• Regular reviews by Risk  
& Assurance.
• Security is reviewed as part 
of every internal audit.
The inherent risk is 
increasing, though 
this is reduced by 
improving security 
controls. As a result 
the net risk is 
considered 
unchanged from 
the prior year.
Reliance on third parties –  
key commercial 
relationships
Key third parties include:
• Data centre and cloud 
software and service 
providers.
• IT development support 
and design of RMS(one).
• Data providers.
• Event venues.
• Newsprint suppliers.
• Newspaper distribution 
and wholesale.
• An operational or financial failure 
of a key supplier could affect 
the ability of DMGT to deliver 
products, services or events with 
a direct impact on financial 
results and management time. 
• DMGT businesses are making 
greater use of third parties, 
especially for software 
development and cloud 
storage solutions, which results 
in an increasing exposure.
• RMS is now increasingly reliant on 
key third parties for a significant 
portion of the RMS(one) project. 
RMS,
dmg media
• Concentrations of risk are 
monitored at Group level.
• Significant time dedicated 
to managing relationships.
• Operational and financial 
due diligence is undertaken 
for key suppliers.
• Where possible, long-term 
arrangements are agreed with 
suppliers to limit the potential 
for volatility.
• Newsprint requirements are 
managed by a dedicated team.
Reliance on third 
parties for aspects of 
the RMS(one) project 
increases the risk in 
the short term.

environment across 
multiple jurisdictions.

Conference held in June 2014 
which focused on data risks.
The new EU Data 
Privacy Regulation 
and an increased 
level of focus on 
privacy and the 
digital society 
globally results in an 
increase in this risk. 
Pension scheme deficit
• The UK newspaper 
business operates defined 
benefit pension schemes.
• Deficits in the schemes are 
ultimately funded by the 
sponsoring company.
• Pension Fund Trustees 
control the investment 
allocation.
• Statutory earnings may be 
affected by funding requirements 
that result from pension deficits as 
a result of lower than expected 
investment returns or changes 
made to the risk profile of our 
investment portfolio.
• Next triennial valuation will 
be undertaken in 2016.
DMGT • The agreed funding plan gives 
certainty over the financial 
commitment for the next 
three years.
• Triennial valuation completed 
in the year and new funding 
plan agreed.
The agreement of the 
three-year funding 
plan reduces 
uncertainty in the 
short term.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE OUR PEOPLE 
One of our five strategic priorities is to secure the right 
people and engage them in pursuit of the mission 
of their business in accordance with our values and 
ambitions. They are encouraged to think creatively 
and be entrepreneurial, to deliver organic growth 
and ensure we are always at the forefront of 
technological development.
We empower our people, not only to 
deliver the best for their business, but also 
to give back to the communities in which 
they live and work.
Training and development 
We understand that to deliver and sustain 
the levels of performance we expect 
(see our Strategic Ambitions on page 11), 
we need to develop our employees and 
also provide them with the opportunities 
to grow and fulfil their potential. 
Each of the operating businesses has in 
place a variety of education and training 
initiatives. We supplement these with key 
Group initiatives, an implicit objective of 
which is to build internal networks and to 
foster peer assistance and collaboration. 
Examples of these are:
• Leadership Development Programme 
(LDP): this is a comprehensive programme 
consisting of two week-long modules 
with a six-month period in between.  
It has been developed and delivered 
in partnership with The Moller Centre, 
Churchill College, The University of 
Cambridge. The programme allows the 
sharing of insights in critical leadership 
areas such as markets and competitive 
landscapes and advances in 
technology. There is particular emphasis 
on the development of coaching skills to 
unleash the talent within our people and 
to develop high-performance teams. 
• Hackathon: in addition to those run locally 
by the businesses, DMGT organised an 
event for technologists and developers, 
delivered simultaneously in New York and 
London. Participants enjoyed insights 
from thought leaders and worked to 
develop various ideas and apps which 
could have commercial value.
• CR Champions network: these are 
individuals who have been recognised 
as championing CR initiatives at their 
businesses. They come together to share 
best practice, to communicate DMGT’s 
CR campaigns and are recognised for 
their efforts. It also acts as a development 
opportunity as the individuals are offered 
exposure to divisional and Group 
Leadership Teams. Detailed profiles of 
our CR Champions can be found on our 
website www.dmgt.com/cr.
Communications/engaging  
with our people
Whilst preserving and respecting our 
decentralised approach, DMGT messages 
are cascaded through a variety of 
communication channels including a CEO 
blog from Martin Morgan; a Group intranet 
that displays Group policies, news stories, 
awards won and CR information; LinkedIn 
to connect DMGT’s corporate profile with 
those of our businesses; and DMGT Daily, 
a daily digital newsletter containing news 
relating to the sectors in which our 
businesses operate as well as significant 
Group news and CR stories.
Culture
We expect our leaders to promote and 
share DMGT values. We appreciate that 
they understand and know what is best 
for their businesses, their people and 
their communities. We encourage 
and leverage the distinctiveness of 
our operating businesses whilst at the 
same time operating within an agreed 
framework of financial and other controls. 
At Group level we have a small head office 
team, based in London, which provides the 
businesses with expertise and experience. 
We encourage synergies between our 
businesses and relationships between our 
people. In this way, we adopt an approach 
that shares best practice across our 
businesses and at the centre.
The strong sense of family heritage, coupled 
with DMGT’s commitment to the long-term 
success of the Company, creates a unique 
working environment which reaches 
each and every one of our businesses 
(see Corporate Governance section on 
pages 41 to 50).
Group policies
We uphold equal opportunities and also do 
not discriminate. Our businesses are required 
to follow DMGT policies that safeguard the 
welfare of our employees. These include 
policies on equal opportunities, anti-bribery, 
our Code of Conduct, entertainment and 
gifts, information security and health and 
safety. We have an active and rolling 
training programme to reinforce 
compliance and to ensure there is a high 
level of awareness of our standards.
The table below sets out the gender 
breakdown of our employees which supports 
our aim to promote equality and diversity, 
we openly share these values through 
our Group Code of Conduct. 
Human rights
We believe that our exposure to the 
associated risks in the context of Human 
Rights frameworks is minimal. DMGT does 
not have a specific HR policy but has a 
number of policies that cover areas such as 
Health and Safety, Bribery and Corruption 
and a questionnaire for evaluating if new 
suppliers are ethical and lawful.

responsibly, valuing our stakeholders and respecting 
the communities we serve and our environment are 
essential for our success. We apply DMGT’s Company 
values to our Corporate Responsibility (CR) activities 
and consider these in the decisions we make. We 
support, encourage and monitor these activities 
ensuring best practice is championed and shared. 
We bring together companies that operate

entrepreneurial behaviour and value 
people who are courageous, curious and

Our commitment to CR is led by the Board. 
Day-to-day management of CR is

defines and implements our CR agenda 
and activities. How the Committee 
operates is outlined in the Corporate 
Governance section on page 50. 
Each Operating Business is represented 
on the Committee. This enables us to 
evaluate risk exposure, monitor progress, 
share best practice and provide guidance 
across the Group.

Our approach
We focus on three areas in our approach to CR: environment; 
our stakeholders; and our people (see page 34).
Environment
Our most significant environmental impact comes from the 
printing plants in our consumer media businesses. The majority 
of our newspapers are now produced at plants designed to be 
as efficient as possible. 
We are, and have for many years been, committed to 
comprehensive and transparent reporting of our environmental 
performance. We have collected CO
2
 emissions data from 
each of our businesses. This data is collated and independently 
reviewed by the environmental consultancy, ICF International, 
which calculates our emissions following the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. The Group’s carbon footprint can be seen in the 
table below. The reduction in the FY 2014 footprint is largely due 
to the closure of the Harmsworth Quays printing facility, and the 
move to a more energy efficient facility at Thurrock.
Our stakeholders
A deliberate part of our CR philosophy is that our businesses should 
play a huge part in their local communities and have a direct and 
immediate impact. We have a list of principles that donations 
adhere to. These are listed on our website (www.dmgt.com). These 
include that charities supported should be small organisations, 
that the donation is multi-year and that there is an employee 
sponsor representing them at DMGT. During the year the Group 
donated £1.2 million to charity. There are countless examples of 
how our employees have been involved in charitable initiatives. 
Indeed, too many to list in this report. However our website,  
www.dmgt.com/cr, lists many of these examples and is 
continuously updated.
In 2014, we continued the Community Champions Awards 
recognising and rewarding the good deeds of DMGT employees. 
The scheme gathered pace during the year with well over 100 
nominations and a new Award category for environmental 
initiatives. The scheme is detailed at www.dmgt.com/cr with 
a video of the Awards ceremonies held in London, New York 
and San Francisco at www.youtube.com/user/dmgtplc.

CR Champions case study
A network of nearly 30 individuals called 
CR Champions represent each and every 
one of our businesses and meet by 
conference call each quarter to discuss 
CR at a grassroots level. 
The CR Champions share ideas, lessons 
learnt from CR initiatives they have 
carried out, and collaborate and share 
best practice. The discussions feed into 
the CR Committee. 
The network is also designed to provide 
an opportunity for some of our most 
talented employees to develop their 
leadership skills.
To find out more about the CR Champions 
network go to www.dmgt.com/cr.
Here are a few of our CR Champions.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE Dominique Trempont and Heidi Roizen 
bring their sector knowledge and industry 
experience to the RMS Operating Board 
and MOL Advisory Board respectively.
As explained in the CEO Review on pages 
10 to 13 we have decided to bring our B2B 
businesses together. This will improve their 
ability to learn from each other and share 
best practice.
Family shareholding 
RCL is a holding company incorporated 
in Bermuda. The main asset of RCL is its 
holding of DMGT Ordinary Shares. RCL is 
owned by a trust (Trust) which is held for the 
benefit of myself and my immediate family. 
Both RCL and the Trust are administered in 
Jersey, in the Channel Islands. The directors 
of RCL, of which there are seven, include 
two directors of DMGT, namely myself and 
John Hemingway.
RCL has controlled the Company for many 
years and maintains that the Company 
should be managed in accordance with 
high standards of corporate governance 
for the benefit of all shareholders, as has 
been the case throughout the period 
of RCL’s control.
RCL has indicated to the Company that its 
intentions for the Company’s governance 
are long term in nature and that it would 
discuss with the Board of the Company 
any material change in its intentions. In 
particular, RCL has confirmed its intention 
that the Company will:
• continue to observe the Listing Principles 
in their current form;
• continue to maintain a securities 
dealing code for certain of its employees 
in the form of the Model Code in its 
current form;
• continue to observe the UK Corporate 
Governance Code on a ‘comply or 
explain’ basis; and
• have an appropriate number of 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
on its Board.
It is also intended by RCL that the 
Company’s independent directors at the 
time will take decisions on behalf of the 
Company in relation to any proposed 
transaction between the Company and 
RCL, or between the Company and an 
associate of RCL, where any such proposed 
transaction would have been a related 
party transaction under Chapter 11 of the 
Listing Rules in its current form.
Details of how we have applied the 
standards of corporate governance 
throughout the year are set out in the 
remainder of this Report. Details of our 
Board members are set out on pages 38 
and 39, including membership details 
of each of our Board Committees.

Chairman’s Statement on Governance 
Strong governance is essential to the way 
we operate throughout the Group. It is a 
key factor in our ability to achieve growth 
in a profitable, responsible and sustainable 
manner and in how we maximise 
shareholder value over the long term. 
In practice, this means that the Board 
establishes parameters within which 
our businesses operate and deliver 
shareholder value.
DMGT’s approach to governance is 
distinctive. The benefits that the family 
shareholding and long-term view bring 
are significant. 
During 2014, strategy has remained a core 
topic of our Board discussions. Areas of 
particular focus include RMS(one), dmg 
information’s strategy and the expansion 
of MailOnline. 
We have continued to draw on the 
expertise of individual Board members 
to the benefit of our operating businesses.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Governance in action
UK Corporate Governance Code (Code)
The Code remains an important part of 
how we operate. The Code allows a 
‘comply or explain’ approach to achieving 
best governance practice. Whilst we 
comply with the majority of the Code 
requirements, we have chosen to deviate 
from the Code in some areas. These are 
detailed below. This allows us to recognise 
the benefits that we continue to derive 
from our heritage, and to take a long-term 
view of our operations. We remain satisfied 
that we continue to operate in 
accordance with high standards of 
governance. We have kept, and we will 
continue to keep, compliance with the 
Code under review and to adapt our 
position as needed.
The composition of the Audit Committee 
has been Code compliant for the majority 
of the year except for a period of three 
months between David Verey retiring in 
February and Kevin Parry joining in May. 
The service contracts of the Executive 
Directors are Code compliant. 
Information required under DTR 7.2.6 is 
provided on page 74 and forms part of 
this Report.
Leadership
The Board has a duty to promote the 
long-term success of the Company for 
its shareholders. This includes: the review 
and monitoring of strategic objectives; 
approval of major acquisitions, disposals 
and capital expenditure; financial 
performance; overseeing the Group’s 
systems of internal controls; governance, 
and risk management and information; 
training and development. More detail on 
how this happens in practice is described 
in the remainder of this Report. 
How the Board operates 
There is a schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board. This details key matters of the 
Company’s management that the Board 
does not delegate. This can be seen on 
www.dmgt.com/corporate-governance. If 
any Director had any concerns about the 
way the Board was operating these would 
be recorded in the minutes. No such 
concerns were raised during the reporting 
period. Day-to-day management is the 
responsibility of the Executive Directors 
and of the executive management of 
the operating businesses.
Delegation of authority
The Board has delegated certain activities, 
under formal terms of reference to Board 
Committees, details of which are set out 
on pages 45 to 50.
Board meetings
There were five scheduled Board meetings 
held in the reporting period. Each year the 
Board holds a meeting where the specific 
focus is on our strategy. This was held in July 
2014. All meetings were held at Northcliffe 
House, London, except the July Strategy 
session and September meeting, which 
were both held in New York. 
Division of Chairman and CEO 
responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive. The Chairman is responsible 
for leading the Board and overseeing 
operations and strategy. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the execution 
of the strategy and the day-to- day 
management of the Group, supported by 
the Finance Director and the executive 
management team.
Leadership Team
The Leadership Team is led by the Chief 
Executive and meetings are attended by 
the CEOs of the operating businesses, the 
Finance Director, the Group HR Director, 
the Strategy Development Director and 
the Chairman. The Leadership Team meets 
regularly throughout the year to discuss 
key issues of common interest with all the 
operating businesses.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors, as members 
of the Board and its Committees, are 
responsible for ensuring the Company 
has sound systems of internal controls, 
an effective risk management process 
and additionally, for monitoring financial 
performance. All Committee Chairmen 
report to the Board on Committee activity 
at each Board meeting.
Independence
The Board has determined that Francisco 
Balsemão, Nicholas Berry, Lady Keswick, 
Kevin Parry, Heidi Roizen and Dominique 
Trempont are independent within the 
meaning of the Code. Francisco Balsemão 
has been on the Board for 12 years. The 
Board has reviewed his independence, 
recognising that longevity of service is only 
one factor to be taken into account. The 
Board is satisfied that he has continued to 
demonstrate independence in terms of 
character and judgement.
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
Provision Code principle Explanation
A 4.1 Composition of the Board The Board has not appointed a Senior Independent Director. It considers that identifying 
such an individual is potentially divisive to a unitary Board and disruptive to the role of the 
Chairman. 
A4.2 Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors did not meet as a group without the Chairman since his 
performance is evaluated by the Remuneration Committee (without the Chairman 
being present).
B1.1 Composition of the Board Less than half of the Board are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board believes 
that its current composition is appropriate taking into account the heritage of the Group, 
the interests of our operating businesses represented on the Board and that a good 
balance is achieved from its Non-Executive Directors in terms of skill and independence. 
The Board keeps this under review.
B2.1 Composition of the 
Nominations Committee
Independent Non-Executive Directors do not comprise the majority of members of the 
Nominations Committee. The Board considers that given the heritage of the organisation 
and the global nature of its business, the members of the Nominations Committee are 
best suited to make recommendations to the Board on all aspects under the 
Nominations Committee’s terms of reference.
D2.1 Composition of the 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee comprises one independent Non-Executive Director, rather than three. 
More details are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 72.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE John Hemingway is not considered to be 
independent as he is a director of RCL. 
David Nelson and Andrew Lane are 
similarly not considered to be independent 
as they are each advisers to the Chairman 
and to RCL. Nevertheless, the Board 
believes that these Non-Executive Directors 
make an important contribution to its 
deliberations and have invaluable 
experience of the Company, its business 
and its staff.
Effectiveness
The Board reviewed its effectiveness within 
the context of the principles and provisions 
of Section B of the Code. In addition to its 
review of independence, the Board 
evaluation process noted separately in 
this Report the following:
• Appointments: the Nominations 
Committee is responsible for referring 
potential appointments to the Board for 
approval and is assisted by the Chief 
Executive and the Group HR Director. 
Further details are in the Nominations 
Committee report on page 49. 
• Time: the time commitment of each 
Non-Executive Director is set out in his/
her Letter of Engagement. Each Letter of 
Engagement is renewed annually both 
following the shareholder vote at the 
AGM and following a review by the 
Nominations Committee to ensure it 
remains in line with best practice.
• Multiple commitments: the Nominations 
Committee recognises that its Board 
members may be directors of other 
companies and that additional 
experience is likely to enhance 
discussions at the Board. Details of any 
additional directorships are on pages 
38 and 39. In addition, we recognise 
that the experience of our Non-
Executive Directors is important across 
our activities. For this reason, Dominique 
Trempont was appointed as a Non-
Executive Director to the RMS Operating 
Board in 2013 and Heidi Roizen to the 
MailOnline Advisory Board, also in 2013. 
Executive Directors are generally 
permitted to hold Non-Executive 
directorships as long as it does not 
lead to conflicts of interest or time.
• Development and information: on joining, 
Directors receive a comprehensive, 
tailored induction programme, which 
includes time with the General Counsel 
& Company Secretary, the Executive 
Directors and a range of senior 
managers across the Group. During the 
year, the Board has received updates 
on key areas of finance and governance 
as well as areas of the business.
• Re-election: in line with the Code, all 
Directors stand for re-election annually 
and will do so at the February 2015 AGM.
Board members have visited and received 
presentations from DMGT’s operating 
businesses on a rolling basis. During the 
year, as part of Directors’ ongoing 
development, these updates were a 
combination of presentations to the whole 
Board and smaller groups as deemed 
appropriate. In particular:
• visits to Trepp, Euromoney, RMS and 
MailOnline, New York;
• dmg information presentations to 
the Board; and
• during 2014 Kevin Parry, as part of 
his induction programme as a new 
Non-Executive Director, participated, 
over a number of days, in meetings with 
DMGT departmental heads, leaders of 
the operating companies as well as 
visiting these businesses and members 
of the Board.
Evaluation
In 2014, the Board undertook a review 
of its own performance and those of its 
Committees, which built on the results of 
the 2013 review. The review was conducted 
through an internal process facilitated 
by the Company Secretary. A revised 
questionnaire was used as a result of 
feedback following the 2013 evaluation 
process where the Board agreed that 
a specific set of questions on the remit 
and key issues facing the Board would be 
more appropriate. In particular, the Board 
considered how it was discharging its 
strategic remit and oversight of the key 
issues facing the Group and its businesses.
Completed questionnaires were 
submitted and reviewed by the Chairman. 
A summary of findings was presented to 
the Board in a manner that did not identify 
individual specific responses ensuring that 
the follow-up discussion with the entire 
Board was open. The responses showed 
that the Board welcomed the process and 
that overall, the Board was happy with the 
progress during the year and that the 
Board and its Committees continue to 
function well.
Actions arising from the evaluation 
included ensuring that time on the Board 
agenda was allocated for:
• reviews of major projects and lessons 
learnt during the year;
• continuing to review the composition 
of the Board through the Nominations 
Committee; and
• continuing to follow-up on key matters 
and actions arising at Board meetings 
and ensuring sufficient time is 
allocated at meetings for discussion 
of these matters.
Board composition and diversity
We have continued to focus on the 
composition of the Board during 2014 
to ensure that we have the right mix of 
members to contribute effectively to 
the development of our strategy and 
how we operate. In particular, to 
continue to enhance the mix of skills 
and expertise represented.
Kevin Parry joined the Board and Audit 
Committee on 22 May 2014. He was 
identified as a candidate by seeking 
recommendations from Board members, 
their contacts and networks. A shortlist 
was prepared on that basis and 
candidates were contacted and the final 
selection was made by the Nominations 
Committee. Following a transitional period, 
he was appointed as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee on 9 December 2014, 
after the year-end process concluded.
Nicholas Berry joined the Investment 
and Finance Committee on 26 June 2014. 
Heidi Roizen stepped down from the 
Risk Committee on 30 September 2014, 
becoming a member of the Remuneration 
Committee on 1 October 2014. 
The Board remains supportive of the 
principles stated in the Davies Report. 
Our view remains that diversity is broader 
than gender. We consider diversity in its 
broadest sense in reviewing how the Board 
operates and its composition. We do not 
see this as solely a compliance issue and 
consider that there is a risk that it becomes 
seen as such. The split of the Group’s profits 
between our US and other businesses, the 
global nature of our operations and the 
range of activities undertaken across the 
Group has been reflected over recent years 
in our Board appointments. Maintaining 
this broad range of appropriate skills and 
experience will continue to be a factor in our 
Board succession planning. Further details 
on our approach is in the Nominations 
Committee report on page 49.
Accountability
Finance and business reporting 
The Board has delegated day-to-day 
responsibility for internal controls to the 
Audit Committee and for risk management 
to the Risk Committee. Further details of 
the activities of these Committees are on 
pages 45 to 48 respectively.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining an effective 
system of internal controls. This system 
provides reasonable rather than absolute 
assurance that the Group’s business 
objectives will be achieved within the risk 
tolerance levels defined by the Board. The 
Group operates on a divisional basis with 
each of the divisions having considerable 
autonomy as regards its operation and 
establishment of internal control systems. 
Overseeing the divisional structure is a 
central management team responsible 
to the Board. Certain functions are 
undertaken centrally, including: Group 
accounting; investor relations; strategy; risk; 
internal audit; corporate tax; treasury; 
insurance; senior management reward; 
and senior recruitment and HR. Euromoney 
Institutional Investor PLC is subject to the 
requirements of the Code in its own right. 
As disclosed in its latest report, it has in 
place its own system of internal controls 
and risk management processes which 
form part of the Group’s overall framework 
of control.
The Directors have excluded joint ventures 
and associates, principally Zoopla Property 
Group Plc and Local World from their 
assessment of internal controls over 
financial reporting, as the Group does 
not have the ability to dictate or modify 
controls at these entities. Controls over 
the recording of amounts in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements relating 
to investments has been assessed and are 
considered as appropriate.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls, the Board has 
considered the controls described below, 
which include financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk 
management systems.
Audit Committee
As described in more detail on pages 45 
to 48, the Audit Committee, on behalf of 
the Board, has responsibility for the regular 
review of internal controls and financial 
risks. It fulfils this by: receiving regular reports 
from internal audit (see below); reviewing 
the results of the key internal controls 
certifications (see below); reviewing 
a summary of internal control findings 
prepared by the Group’s External Auditors 
following their audit procedures; and 
considering significant financial reporting 
issues and approving any changes to 
Group accounting policies, which are 
set centrally.
Risk Committee 
The Risk Committee, described in more 
detail on page 48, oversees the risk 
management processes and considers the 
Group risk register annually. The Committee 
also reviews specific risks and monitors 
developments in relevant legislation and 
regulation and the impact on the Group 
and on its system of internal controls. The 
Committee reports to the Board at each of 
its meetings on its operations to enable it to 
determine the overall effectiveness of risk 
management and the system of internal 
controls as it relates to key risks. 
Investment and Finance Committee
The Investment and Finance Committee, 
described in more detail on page 49, 
evaluates the benefits and risks of 
investment opportunities and financing 
proposals. Above certain defined levels, 
the Board approves programmes relating 
to acquisition and divestment proposals 
and capital expenditure. 
Internal audit
The Group’s internal Risk and Assurance 
(R&A) function provides assurance on the 
operation and adequacy of the internal 
financial control environment across the 
Group’s operating businesses. The Head 
of Risk and Assurance reports on reviews, 
including any follow-up on past reviews, 
to DMGT and Operating Business 
management, and the Audit Committee 
on a regular basis. An annual plan is 
developed each year and approved by 
the Audit Committee. Input, with reference 
to past reviews and key risks, is received 
from divisional and executive 
management, the Audit Committee, 
and External Auditors.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE Confirmation of key internal controls, 
and bribery and fraud assessment
Each Operating Business confirms the 
operation of key internal financial controls 
to Group Finance and R&A annually. The 
purpose of the assessment is to confirm the 
operation of a basic framework of internal 
controls, including anti-fraud controls, 
which are expected to be in place in each 
business unit. They are particularly focused 
on financial controls, and they are intended 
to provide standards against which the 
control environments of DMGT’s business 
units can be monitored. An annual bribery 
and fraud risk assessment review is 
completed at the same time, detailing risks 
and mitigating controls. In each case, the 
R&A team review and follow-up these 
submissions, as appropriate.
Review of relevant and timely financial 
information
Operating Business and DMGT executive 
management regularly review relevant and 
timely financial information. This is produced 
from a management information system 
operated across the Group. It is supported 
by a framework of quarterly forecasts as 
well as annual budgets that are approved 
at a divisional level by the Investment and 
Finance Committee.
Senior Accounting Officer sign-off
The Group Finance Director is the Senior 
Accounting Officer (SAO) and is required, 
by HMRC, to certify that the Company, 
and its subsidiaries, have established and 
maintained appropriate arrangements to 
ensure that tax liabilities are calculated 
accurately in all material respects.
Effectiveness of internal controls
The Directors confirm that they have 
followed the process described above 
to review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls for the period 
to the sign-off of the Accounts. The Board 
confirms that it has not identified any 
material weaknesses or failings during 
this time.
Risk management
The Board considers all significant business 
risks to the Group including financial risk, 
operational risk and compliance risk that 
could undermine achieving the Group’s 
strategy and business objectives. Given 
the Group’s divisional structure, a flexible 
approach to risk management systems has 
been implemented so that each operating 
business can tailor and adapt its risk 
management processes to its specific 
circumstances. This approach, which 
provides an overarching framework for 
acceptable risk parameters, has the 
commitment of the Leadership Team 
and the executive management of the 
Operating Businesses. 
Oversight is provided by the Risk 
Committee. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for the review of financial risks. 
The requisite risk and control capability 
is assured through the Risk Committee 
and Board challenge. A Group-wide risk 
assessment process is managed annually 
by the R&A team, reviewing risk in 
Operating Businesses and risks to  
achieving business plans. 
The results are collated and presented 
to the Risk Committee and an overall 
Group-wide risk plan is derived. This process 
assists managers to identify internal and 
external threats and to prioritise responses 
to those risks. This Group-wide risk 
assessment is aimed at providing the Risk 
Committee with insight into any material 
changes and trends in the risk profile and 
to evaluate whether the system, including 
reporting and controls, adequately 
supports the Board in overseeing key risks.
Principal risks and mitigating actions are  
set out on pages 30 to 33.
Investment opportunities and 
financing proposals
Investment and operating decisions are 
delegated under formal terms of reference 
to the Investment and Finance Committee. 
This Committee works alongside executive 
management to ensure that investment 
decision making and Group strategy 
development operates in accordance with 
best practice. The Committee evaluates 
the benefits and risks of investment 
opportunities and financial proposals up 
to an agreed level, above which the 
Board approves programmes relating to 
acquisition and divestment proposals and 
capital expenditure. Details in respect of 
the Investment and Finance Committee’s 
activities are given on page 49.

GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Fair, balanced and understandable
One of the key governance requirements 
of a Group’s financial statements is for 
the reports to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The coordination and 
review of Group-wide input into the Annual 
Report is a specific project, with defined 
time frames, which runs alongside the 
formal audit process undertaken by the 
External Auditor. The Audit Committee’s 
and the Board’s confirmation of satisfaction 
with the process and the statements being 
made is underpinned by:
• comprehensive guidance being 
provided to the Operating Businesses in 
respect of each of the requirements for, 
and each of their contributions to, the 
Annual Report;
• a verification process in respect of the 
factual context of the submissions made; 
• comprehensive sign-off process by 
owners of all statements made; and
• comprehensive reviews undertaken 
at different levels of the Group with 
the aim of ensuring consistency and 
overall balance.
As a result of this process, the Audit 
Committee and the Board are satisfied 
with the overall fairness, balance and 
clarity of the Annual Report.
Relations with shareholders
Any concerns raised by shareholders in 
relation to the Company and its affairs 
are communicated to the Board through 
regular briefings. Analyst reports are 
circulated to the Board. Feedback 
from meetings held with the executive 
management or the Investor Relations 
team and institutional shareholders, 
are also communicated to the Board.

Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain 
activities to its Committees, as described 
on pages 45 to 50. During the year,  
the following acted as Secretary to  
the stated Committees:
• the General Counsel & Company 
Secretary to the Audit, Investment 
and Finance, and Nominations 
Committees;
• the Head of Reward to the 
Remuneration Committee;
• the Head of Risk and Assurance to the 
Risk Committee; and
• the Assistant Company Secretary to 
the CR Committee.
Audit Committee
Since our AGM on 5 February 2014, I have 
been Acting Chairman of the Committee. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code invites 
the Committee to report on the significant 
issues considered during the year. Further 
details are contained later in the report, 
but the most important issues were:
RMS(one)
• The accounting treatment of the costs 
capitalised in relation to the 
development of RMS(one). 
• The Company announced a delay to the 
launch of RMS(one) in March 2014. Since 
that time the Committee has overseen 
an in-depth review of the accounting 
treatment of costs capitalised and the 
appropriate extent of an impairment 
charge. The review has involved the 
Committee, the CFO and other members 
of the finance team at DMGT, together 
with the External Auditors. This review 
has included testing the financial 
assumptions with key customers.
• Whilst such reviews of the carrying 
value of capitalised assets are of course 
carried out each year, the innovative 
nature of the RMS(one) platform and 
the total spend on it, continues to require 
judgements to be made of the likely 
revenue stream and the speed of 
adoption of the new technology.

following the postponement of the 
launch. This included the establishment 
of a working party consisting of two 
members of the Committee, the CFO 
and senior members of the DMGT 
finance team who worked in conjunction 
with the External Auditors. The working 
party carried out a detailed review of 
expenditure to date, forecast further

the Committee recommended to the 
Board that, subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2015 AGM, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
should be appointed as the Group’s 
External Auditors. 
• To minimise any disruption to the 
audit process and to best protect 
shareholders’ interests, a handover 
process has been ongoing since 
September 2014.
• As Acting Audit Committee Chairman, 
I would like to thank Deloitte LLP for their

GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT • The Committee reviewed and updated 
its Terms of Reference to reflect best 
practice and to minimise the potential 
for overlap or gaps with its remit and 
that of the Risk Committee.
• The Committee discussed Senior Finance 
Officer appointments at Group 
businesses.
• The Committee confirmed that it had 
complied with its Terms of Reference 
throughout the year.
• The Committee reviewed its membership 
and confirmed that it had complied with 
the Code for the majority of the year.
• The Committee confirmed, that in 
accordance with the provisions of 
the Code, each of David Nelson and 
Kevin Parry had recent and relevant 
financial experience.
Looking ahead, the Committee believes 
that it is important to remain focused on 
the audit and assurance processes 
within DMGT. 
The key activities for the forthcoming 
year are:
• strategic review of our internal audit and 
assurance plan to ensure alignment and 
support of the Group’s plan;
• ensuring that there is a clear plan for the 
remit and work of each of the Audit and 
Risk Committees and how these activities 
will interrelate, and accountability;
• continuing the progress made to date 
around internal controls, assessment 
and audit follow-up plans; 
• continuing to ensure that accounting 
developments are communicated to, 
and applied by, the Committee in line 
with best practice; and
• continuing the review of accounting 
judgements in respect of material 
projects.
External Auditor’s independence, 
objectivity and non-audit services
The Company’s policy on the External 
Auditor’s independence is consistent with 
the ethical Standards set out by the Audit 
Practices Board in the UK. The Committee 
reviews independence on a regular basis. 
This is designed to ensure that:
• the External Auditor does not act as a 
manager or employee of the Group;
• there is separation between the 
interests of the External Auditor and 
the Group; and
• the External Auditor is not required to act 
as an advocate for the Group.
The independence review is conducted 
by a review of compliance with policies in 
place in the Group and within the audit firm 
to maintain independence and objectivity. 
The findings are shared with the Committee. 
The Committee, having reviewed the 
report prepared by the External Auditor 
on its relationships within the Group and 
the review by management, is satisfied 
that the External Auditor’s objectivity has 
not been impaired. The External Auditor is 
required to assess periodically that it, in its 
professional judgement considers itself to 
be independent. This has been done at 
each Committee meeting. In particular, 
the Committee requires that details in 
respect of audit and non-audit services 
are provided to it to ensure that the 
Group’s policy on the provisions of non-
audit services by the External Auditor 
has been followed. 
The definition of non-audit services 
adopted by the Committee complies with 
the ethical Standards issued by the Audit 
Practices Board in the UK. The Committee, 
having reviewed the activities during the 
reporting period, is satisfied that the policy 
has been complied with and that the 
External Auditor remains independent. 
Details in respect of the non-audit fees paid 
are in Note 5 on page 105.
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for making recommendations to the Board 
on the independence and reappointment 
of the External Auditor. As noted above, 
the Committee had recommended 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be 
appointed at the 2015 AGM. 
Significant and material issues 
The Committee has considered a number 
of material issues during the year, including:
• recognising that accounting impacts 
arising from the delay of the RMS(one) 
launch, as noted on page 46, a working 
group was formed to specifically 
review any judgements made and the 
appropriate accounting treatment;
• policy and practice in respect of 
internally generated assets, including 
RMS(one). The RMS(one) project is the 
largest such project undertaken by the 
Group where internal costs have been 
capitalised. As such, specific attention 
has been warranted to the treatment 
of costs incurred; 
• impairment considerations of goodwill 
and intangible assets. Whilst this is 
undertaken each year, the Committee 
considers that it is important to ensure 
that a consistent and robust approach 
is taken; 
• The External Auditor, as part of its 
assurance process, confirmed that it is 
considered to be independent and 
objective. The Committee agreed 
with this assessment and no matters of 
concern were raised. During the year, 
the External Auditor presented its plans 
for the interim review and the year-end 
audit and the Committee approved the 
scope of work to be undertaken. The 
External Auditor also presented its report 
on internal controls which provided a 
benchmark for additional improvements.
• During the course of the year, the 
Committee met with the External Auditor 
and the Head of R&A without the 
presence of management. 
• The Committee received regular 
updates on the status of any litigation 
matters and trends across the Group.
Governance
• The External Auditor has been providing 
audit services since 2001 when it won 
a competitive tender to replace the 
incumbent firm. The current audit partner 
was appointed in 2011 following the 
rotation of the previous partner. 
• The Company conducted a tender 
process for its audit services during the 
year. A sub-set of the Committee and 
management participated in panel 
presentations from four audit firms and 
made a recommendation to the 
Committee for approval. A consistent 
table of evaluation criteria was utilised 
as part of the process. The benefit of 
a new approach from a different firm 
was balanced against the impact 
of a transition period when selecting 
a new firm. As a result of the tender 
the Committee recommended 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
be appointed.
• The effectiveness review of the external 
audit process was carried out through a 
Client Satisfaction Survey to obtain views 
of senior finance management and 
certain Committee members. This 
included a review of the planning, 
execution and reporting activities along 
with the assessment of the quality and 
leadership of the external audit teams 
involved in any audit. The results were 
presented to the Committee to assist 
in the review of the effectiveness of 
the audit process for the prior year. 
No material issues were raised. 
• The Committee carried out a review 
of the R&A function, which concluded 
that the department was effective.

The Committee has paid specific

these were managed, trends and areas

REMUNERATION REPORT
Chairman’s statement on remuneration 
Key decisions made by the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) during the 
year were:
Bonus payments for FY 2014
DMGT has delivered another year of strong 
performance. Group underlying operating 
profit increased by 15% at an operating 
margin of 17%. However, in light of the 
delayed release of RMS(one) and the 
associated impairment charge, the 
Committee decided that the annual 
bonus for those Executive Directors with 
responsibility for B2B would be reduced by 
25%. This decision was made with the full 
support of the Executive Directors affected. 
Full details can be found on pages 53 
and 63.
Paul Dacre
Paul Dacre’s remuneration for the past year 
was agreed in 2008 in recognition of the 
fact that Mr Dacre had agreed to work 
beyond DMGT’s retirement age at that 
time. In the ensuing five years, under his 
aegis as Editor-in-Chief, Daily Mail and The 
Mail on Sunday significantly out-performed 
the market; MailOnline has become the 
worlds most visited English language 
newspaper website with a major presence 
in the US; and Metro is one of the world’s 
biggest free newspapers. However, Daily 
Mail and The Mail on Sunday continue to 
face a challenging print newspaper 
market and this has required strategic focus 
on operational efficiencies and a more 
integrated approach across the business.
In the light of this, Paul Dacre requested that 
his remuneration be more directly linked  
to the overall success of the business. To 
achieve this, he has waived his contractual 
right to a salary increase of the higher of RPI 
or 5% each year. He has also waived his 
annual salary supplement of £500,000.
The Committee has agreed that Paul 
Dacre will receive a 3% salary increase 
with effect 1 October 2014 and that,  
in line with other Executive Directors, in the 
future he will receive an annual award 
under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Awards will vest after three years with the 
performance conditions focused on the 
delivery of strategic objectives for the Mail 
titles. Accordingly, an amendment to the 
remuneration policy is proposed, to make 
Paul Dacre an annual LTIP award of 70% 
of salary. To effect this, approval is sought 
for changes to the LTIP.
Salary review FY 2015
A salary increase of 3% was awarded to 
all Executive Directors with effect from 
1 October 2014. This is in accordance with 
general salary budgets across the Group. 
Vesting of the 2010 LTIP award
The award for Martin Morgan vested based 
on results against targets over the period 
from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2013. 
The Committee considered that good 
progress had been made against the 
strategic targets and judged the outcome 
to be 37.5%, slightly higher than the 35% 
estimated vesting in last year’s report. 
Details are shown in table 4.1 on page 54 
and table 6.1 on page 56.
Vesting of the 2007 LTIP award
DMGT’s total shareholder return (TSR) 
ranked fourth against a competitor group 
of 12 companies, resulting in the award 
vesting at 120%. Details are shown in table 
4.2 on page 55.
Awards under the 2012 LTIP
The Committee considers that the four LTIP 
strategic objectives continue to reflect the 
aims of the Group and progress against 
these will ensure that Executives are 
aligned with delivering a strong underlying 
performance and long-term sustained 
returns for shareholders. The strategic 
objectives are: 
• to grow B2B business; 
• continue to invest in strong brands of 
digital consumer media, particularly 
MailOnline; 
• grow sustainable earnings and 
dividends; and;
• increase the Company’s exposure to 
growth economies and to international 
opportunities.
Each year, the Committee reviews 
progress against the strategic targets 
and I am pleased to be able confirm that 
DMGT remains on track for achieving 
these objectives.
Divisional incentive schemes
We considered our long-term incentive 
arrangements. In particular, we 
considered the plans for RMS in light of the 
postponement of the launch of RMS(one) 
to ensure that they focus and motivate 
employees, rewarding them for the 
achievement of strategic priorities.
New appointment to the Committee
The Committee is pleased to confirm the 
appointment of Heidi Roizen with effect 
from 1 October 2014. Heidi Roizen brings 
considerable experience from the US, 
digital media and entrepreneurial 
environments.

30 September 2014 and included in the single figure table 1 on page 53 are shown below. The performance measures are either 
adjusted pre-tax profits or strategic objectives. In the light of the delayed release of RMS(one) and the associated impairment charge, 
the Committee decided that the annual bonus for those Executive Directors with responsibility for B2B would be reduced by 25%. 
This decision was made with the full support of the Executive Directors affected. A reduction was not applied to the part of 
Lord Rothermere’s bonus which is paid in replacement of an LTIP. The resulting bonus amounts are shown in the table below:

Annual report on remuneration table 4.1: Outcome of LTIP awards in FY 2013 
The vesting of the LTIP awarded to Martin Morgan in FY 2010, for which the performance period ended on 30 September 2013, was 
judged to be 37.5% which was a slight increase compared to the estimated vesting of 35% in last year’s report. The amended number 
of resulting shares and their value are reflected in table 6.1 on page 56 and in the single figure table 1 on page 53. There was no 
change to the 2013 LTIP outcome for Kevin Beatty.
There is no LTIP value for performance at or below threshold; maximum value is 100%. The award is not realisable until the matching 
awards have vested in December 2016. No dividends accrue on this award. The measures were chosen to reflect the strategic aims 
of DMGT set in 2010. The Board considers the targets to be commercially sensitive and they will not be disclosed.

Annual report on remuneration table 4.2: Outcome of LTIP awards in FY 2014 
The LTIP awarded to Lord Rothermere, Martin Morgan and David Dutton in 2007, for which the performance period ended on 
31 December 2013, vested to the level set out below. DMGT ranked fourth against its comparator group of 12 companies resulting  
in a vesting of 120%. 
There is no value for performance at or below threshold; maximum value is 300%. Due to vesting taking place during a close period, 
the award was not realised until 23 June 2014 at a share price of £8.31. No dividends accrue on this award. The measures were chosen 
to reflect DMGT’s relative performance against a comparator group over the period 2007 to 2013. The amounts shown at realisation 
are reflected in the single figure table 1 on page 53.

REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
Introduction
In accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2013, shareholders are 
provided with the opportunity to endorse the Company’s remuneration policy through a binding vote. The current policy was agreed 
at the AGM on 5 February 2014. The binding vote on our intended Directors’ remuneration policy will be put to shareholders at the AGM 
on 4 February 2015 (see page 77) and the policy will be operated, as described, from that date.
Policy applied to Executive Directors
The Committee aims to structure remuneration packages which motivate and retain Executive Directors and are appropriate to their 
level of responsibility. The Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account  
of commercial demands, changing market practice and shareholder expectations. Accordingly, the Committee is proposing some 
amendments to the remuneration policy for FY 2015 which are shown below:
Policy report table 1: Executive Directors’ basic fees and salary
Purpose To recruit, retain and reflect responsibilities of the Executive Directors and be competitive with  
peer companies.
Operation Reviewed annually for the following year taking into account contractual agreements, general 
economic and market conditions and the level of increases made across the Group as a whole.
Benchmarking is performed periodically and our intention is to apply judgement in evaluating  
market data.
Levels Annual increases are in line with average UK-based employees, subject to particular circumstances 
such as changes in roles, responsibilities or organisation, or as the Committee determines otherwise 
based on factors listed under ‘Operation’.
Policy Amendment: Paul Dacre receives a contractual salary increase of the higher of RPI or 5%. 
This contractual increase has been waived by Paul Dacre from 1 October 2014. In future Paul Dacre’s 
salary increases will be considered and awarded in line with those of the other Executive Directors.
Maximum is set at a level the Committee considers appropriate taking account of the individual’s skills, 
experience, performance and external environment.
Performance framework Subject to satisfactory performance throughout the year.
Implementation Increases to base salaries for Executive Directors in FY 2014 were in line with average levels of increase 
for UK employees across the Group at 3%.
Other employees Base salary increases elsewhere in the Group are set at a business level, taking into account economic 
factors, competitive market rates, roles, skills, experience and individual performance. The change in

Policy report table 4: Executive Directors’ annual bonus
Purpose To focus Executive Directors on the delivery of financial performance and strategic objectives creating 
value for the Company and shareholders.
To reward individual contribution to the success of the Company.
Operation Up to 100% of total bonus opportunity is based on financial performance at corporate and business unit 
level. Up to 50% of total bonus opportunity is based on performance against strategic non-financial 
objectives. The bonus weightings applied for each of the Executive Directors may vary from time to time 
and may include financial targets relating to their specific business. The bonus weightings for FY 2014 are 
detailed in table 2.1 on page 53. The weightings that apply to the bonus may vary if the Committee 
determines that it is appropriate in order to achieve the strategic aims of the business.
Performance is measured separately for each item as shown in tables 2.2 and 2.3 on page 54. 
Annual incentive payments do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Annual bonus plans are discretionary and the Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to 
payments up or down if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant doing so. The adjustments 
that were applied to the FY 2014 bonus are described in the implementation section of this table.
Levels For Lord Rothermere, maximum opportunity is 180% of salary; for Martin Morgan and Stephen Daintith, 
maximum opportunity is 100% of salary; for Kevin Beatty maximum opportunity is 60% of salary and for  
David Dutton maximum opportunity is 50% of salary. On-target bonus is 50% of maximum in all cases.
There is normally no payout for performance at threshold.
The performance range sets a balance between upside opportunity and downside risk and is  
normally based on targets in accordance with the annual budget.
Performance framework Bonuses are subject to the achievement of profit targets for B2B, Consumer and DMGT overall. Outcome 
against strategic objectives also contributes towards the bonus for Martin Morgan, Stephen Daintith 
and Kevin Beatty.
The selection and weighting of performance measures takes into account the strategic objectives  
and business priorities for the year. The weightings that are applied to the FY 2014 bonus targets are  
as reported in table 2.1 on page 53.
Strategic objectives are agreed by the Committee and may be non-financial.
The Board considers the specific targets for each measure to be commercially sensitive and they will not 
be disclosed. Performance against targets in the year that bonus awards are made will be disclosed.
Implementation Annual bonus payments for FY 2014 are reported in detail in tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 on pages 53 and 54.
The Committee applied its discretion for the FY 2014 bonus and agreed that a reduction of 25% of 
the calculated bonus was appropriate in light of the delayed delivery of RMS(one). This reduction 
has been applied to all of the bonuses for Executive Directors with operational responsibility for B2B. 
For Lord Rothermere, this reduction was applied to the first 50% of his on-target bonus opportunity, 
with the remaining 40% being in lieu of him receiving an LTIP.
For FY 2015, the financial measures and weighting for each measure will be the same as FY 2014 for 
Stephen Daintith, Kevin Beatty and Martin Morgan.
Lord Rothermere and David Dutton will have 30% of their bonuses determined by the outcome of B2B 
financial targets, 30% by the outcome of Consumer financial targets and 40% by the outcome of DMGT 
overall financial targets. 
Other employees Many other employees participate in some form of cash-based annual incentive, bonus or 
commission plan.
The annual incentive plan for the Executive Directors forms the basis of the annual incentive plan for the 
head office Executives. Plans across the Group are designed and tailored for each business, with the 
purpose of incentivising the achievement of their annual targets.

Policy report table 5: Executive Directors’ bonus deferral
Purpose To provide an element of retention and align Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders.
Operation The current plan was adopted by the Board in November 2012. Awards are delivered through a grant 
of nil cost options.
A proportion of some Executives Directors’ annual bonus is deferred for a period of two years.  
Annual bonus deferral requirements are reported in detail in table 3 on page 54.
Following the exercise of an award, a cash payment with a value equivalent to the sum of all of the 
dividends declared for the award between the grant date and the date of delivery of the shares will 
be made.
Under the rules of the bonus deferral plan adopted in 2012, clawback of vested and unvested awards 
is possible in the event of material misstatement of information or misconduct.
Levels Martin Morgan, Stephen Daintith and Kevin Beatty are required to defer any above-target annual 
bonus into nil cost options for two years.
Lord Rothermere and David Dutton are not required to defer any part of their bonus.
Performance framework No further performance conditions are imposed. This is reflective of market practice.
Implementation The nil cost option awards made under the plan for FY 2013 are shown in table 5 on page 55. The cash 
amounts that apply for the FY 2014 bonus are shown above table 5 on page 55. Bonus deferral 
requirements remain as stated in table 3 on page 54.

REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors
Policy report table 6: Executive Directors’ Long-Term Incentives
Purpose To focus Executive Directors on the delivery of strategic priorities creating long-term value for the 
Company and shareholders.
To encourage long-term shareholding and commitment to the Company.
To link corporate performance to management’s reward, drive long-term earnings and share  
price growth.
 Operation The current plan was approved by shareholders on 6 February 2012. Awards are delivered through  
a Conditional Share Award.
Policy Amendment: Awards generally have a five-year vesting period, but a shorter period may apply 
if the Committee determines it to be appropriate having regard to the relevant strategic imperatives. 
The extent of vesting at the end of the performance period is determined by the measurement of the 
extent to which performance targets have been met.
The Committee has discretion, within the Plan Rules, to make adjustments taking into account 
exceptional factors that distort underlying business performance. 
Following the realisation of an award, a cash payment with a value equivalent to the sum of all of the 
dividends declared for the award between the grant date and the date of delivery of the shares will 
be made.
Under the rules of the 2012 LTIP, clawback of vested and unvested awards is possible in the event of 
material misstatement of information or misconduct.
Levels Martin Morgan, Stephen Daintith and Kevin Beatty are eligible to receive a standard award of 100% of 
salary annually. Policy Amendment: Paul Dacre is eligible to receive a standard award of 70% of salary 
from FY 2015. Lord Rothermere and David Dutton do not participate in the LTIP.
The Plan Rules allow for a maximum award to be made of up to 300% of salary in exceptional 
circumstances. As detailed during shareholder consultation when the Plan was adopted, a 100% 
payout at target performance (which is above threshold) is envisaged.
Performance framework In accordance with the Plan Rules, the Committee may set different performance measures, in terms 
of type of measure and the weighting given to each measure, for awards granted on different dates, 
provided that such measures are aligned with the Company’s strategic goals and with the interests  
of its shareholders.
The performance measures are designed to reflect progress towards the achievement of key strategic 
goals which may vary from year to year.
The Committee sets targets in accordance with its strategic planning. The Board considers the specific 
targets for each measure to be commercially sensitive. Performance against targets will be disclosed 
at the time the awards vest.
Implementation The awards made under the LTIP in 2013 is reported in detail in table 7 on page 57. No changes were 
made to the awards made under the LTIP policy in FY 2014. The strategic goals for the FY 2013 and 
FY 2014 awards (to Martin Morgan; Stephen Daintith and Kevin Beatty) are:
• grow B2B business;
• continue to grow and invest in strong brands of digital consumer media – particularly MailOnline;
• grow sustainable earnings and dividends; and
• increase the Company’s exposure to growth economies and to international opportunities.
The 2014 LTIP award to Paul Dacre will (subject to approval of the policy and LTIP changes at the AGM) 
vest after three years with the performance conditions focused on the delivery of strategic objectives 
for the Mail businesses.
Awards made in 2007 which vested in 2014 were made under the 2001 LTIP and were fully realised in 
June 2013. Details of the performance measures and the outcomes against targets for both awards are 
shown in tables 4.1 and 4.2 on pages 54 and 55. Outstanding awards will continue to vest according 
to the Rules of the Plans they were awarded under. Details of outstanding awards and their status are 
shown in detail in table 7 on page 57. No adjustments were made for performance periods ending 
in 2013 or in 2014.
The award made to Stephen Daintith on recruitment vested in January 2014. Details of the outcome 
of the award are shown in table 7 on page 57.
Other employees The LTIP for the Executive Directors forms the basis of annual awards for the head office Executives.
Plans for Executives in other businesses across the Group are considered and approved by the 
Committee. Plans are designed to be appropriate to the stage of development of the business and to 
incentivise the achievement of the mid- to long-term strategic aims of the business in which they operate.

Executive Directors
Policy report table 8: Executive Directors’ policy on payment for loss of office
Policy on setting  
of notice periods
The Company normally sets the notice period of Executive Directors as 12 months, but may decide to vary 
this in circumstances it deems appropriate.
How termination 
payments  
are determined
On termination, the Company will normally make a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) which is equal to the 
aggregate of: the basic salary at the date of termination for the applicable notice period; the pension 
allowance over the relevant period; the cost to the Company of providing all other benefits (excluding 
pension allowance and bonus) or a sum equal to the amount of benefits as specified in the Company’s 
most recent Annual Report and a bonus payment calculated in accordance with the service contract of 
the Director. The treatment of the Long-Term Incentive Plan on termination will be in accordance with the 
rules of the Plan and, where appropriate, at the discretion of the Committee.
The Company may pay the PILON either as a lump sum or in equal monthly instalments from the date on 
which the employment terminates until the end of the relevant period. If alternative employment (paid 
above a pre-agreed rate) is commenced, for each month that instalments of the PILON remain payable, 
the amounts, in aggregate (excluding the pension payment), may be reduced by half of one month’s 
basic salary in excess of the pre-agreed rate.
All leavers have to exit DMGT SharePurchase+ and either sell or transfer their shares. If identified as a  
‘Good Leaver’ , under the rules of DMGT SharePurchase+, no tax or NICs are paid.
Discretion If identified as a ‘Good Leaver’ , for the purposes of the bonus, the Committee may determine that the 
leaver’s contribution was significant in early or high achievement of targets, in which case, it may decide  
to make a payment which is equivalent of up to a full year bonus.
If identified as a ‘Good Leaver’ under the deferred bonus Plan Rules (including those identified at the 
discretion of the Committee), outstanding awards shall vest in full on the normal vesting date or on such 
earlier date as the Committee may determine.
If identified as a ‘Good Leaver’ under the LTIP rules, (including those identified at the discretion of the 
Committee), outstanding awards may be exercised, either on the normal vesting date or on such earlier 
date as the Committee may determine, to the extent that they have vested. If, in the judgement of the 
Committee, greater progress towards achievement of targets has been made as a result of the 
performance of the Leaver, it may, at its absolute discretion, decide to vest up to 100% of the  
outstanding award.
The Committee may also agree to make payments in respect of statutory employment claims, legal fees, 
outplacement and accrued holiday or sick leave.
Policy report table 9: Executive Directors’ recruitment policy
Principles When appointing or recruiting Executive Directors, the Company will normally aim to set remuneration at a 
level which is consistent with the remuneration policy in place for other Executive Directors and the previous 
incumbent of the role.
Details The main components of remuneration will be salary, bonus, long-term incentives, pension (or cash pension 
allowance), benefits (which may include those relating to relocation such as: flights; immigration costs; 
relocation allowance; shipping and storage; temporary living accommodation; housing allowances; 
annual leave travel; international medical insurance cover; legal and tax services; school fees; school 
search; movement of pets; termination of car leases and costs of replacement goods) and compensation 
for loss of earnings from his/her previous employment that are forfeited in order to take up the role.
The approach for each component will be to try to set each in line with the remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors, except that the approach in respect of compensation for forfeit of remuneration in 
respect of a previous employer will be considered on a case-by-case basis taking into account all relevant 
factors such as performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the performance period 
remaining and the form of the award.
Maximum In order to secure the best candidate for the role, the Company may need to pay more than its existing 
Executive Directors. The maximum level of variable remuneration that may be granted will be 200% of 
salary under the bonus plan and 300% under the LTIP (these limits already apply to the existing bonus and 
LTIP plans). Pre-existing contractual agreements for internal candidates may be maintained on recruitment 
to an Executive Director role.

Policy report table 10: Executive Directors’ shareholding guidelines
Purpose To align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders.
Operation Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a substantial shareholding in the Company.
Shares which have been awarded subject to deferral or satisfaction of performance measures are not 
included in the calculation of the value of the Executive Director’s shareholding.
Levels The Committee recommends a minimum shareholding of 1.5x (150%) salary. 
There is no time frame over which the guidelines should be met.
Implementation No change in the policy on shareholding guidelines in the year.
Directors’ interests are reported in detail in table 13 on page 71.
Other employees There are no share ownership guidelines below Executive Director level, although UK employees are 
encouraged to become shareholders in the Company by participating in the DMGT SharePurchase+,  
the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan.
Policy report table 11: Policy on external appointments for Executive Directors
The Company allows its Executive Directors to take a very limited number of outside directorships. Individuals retain the payments 
received from such services since these appointments are not expected to impinge on their principal employment. Martin Morgan 
was appointed to the Board of the City of London Investment Trust on 1 March 2012 and receives a fee of £25,000 p.a.
Policy report table 12: Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee receives annual updates on the views and best practices of shareholders and their representative bodies and 
notwithstanding the Company shareholder structure, takes these into account. The Committee seeks the views of shareholders on 
matters of remuneration that it thinks shareholders are interested in. A good example of this was the adoption of the 2012 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan, when major shareholders were consulted. 
Policy report table 13: Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
Pay and employment  
conditions elsewhere  
in the Company
The Committee considers conditions elsewhere in the Group when making decisions on remuneration 
matters affecting the Executive Directors. The Committee receives a report annually on the salary budget 
for each business. The Committee makes reference, where appropriate, to pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group, (whilst remaining aware of the variety of jurisdictions and markets in 
which it operates) when determining annual salary increases and to external evidence of remuneration 
levels in other companies.
Employee consultation 
and comparison

Note
Lord Rothermere does not attend any part of a meeting while matters affecting his own remuneration are discussed.
Remuneration Committee role and activities
The Committee’s responsibilities include Group remuneration policy; setting the remuneration; benefits and terms and conditions of 
employment of the Company’s Executive Directors and other senior Executives. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on 
the Company’s website. 
The Committee is chaired by Lord Rothermere with Committee members Nicholas Berry; David Nelson and from 1 October 2014, 
Heidi Roizen. The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) recommends that a Remuneration Committee should be composed 
entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that, as the beneficiary of the Company’s largest shareholder, 
Lord Rothermere’s interests are fully aligned with other shareholders. The Committee is confident that its make-up ensures that it carries 
out all aspects of its role with proper and appropriate regard to long-term shareholders’ interests and that this alignment is, in fact, 
stronger as a direct consequence of its membership.
The Committee spends a large portion of its time reviewing the remuneration and incentive plans of businesses which are diverse both 
in geography and sector. There are a variety of incentive plans requiring significant consideration and oversight, which are designed 
to reflect business type and stage of development, the market it operates in and aims to incentivise the delivery of its strategic plan. 
The Committee’s objective is to combine the necessary attention to short-term financial performance, through annual bonus plans, 
with a stronger focus on the fundamentals that drive long-term growth, through long-term incentive schemes.
In November 2014, the Committee conducted a formal review of its effectiveness and concluded that it had fulfilled its remit and had 
been effective in the year.
Risk and reward
During the year, the Committee reviewed and confirmed that the plans in operation throughout the Group did not incentivise excessive 
risk and, in particular, that the remuneration incentives in the Company are compatible with its risk policies and systems.

Annual report on remuneration table 18: Advice to the Remuneration Committee
During 2014, the Committee was advised by MM&K, a specialist remuneration adviser, who was appointed by the Committee. 
MM&K also provided the Company with advice on share schemes, provided market data of remuneration levels for other companies, 
particularly in the media field and advice on best practice. Greenhill Associates also provided advice in relation to valuation of 
subsidiaries for the purpose of long-term incentive schemes.
The Committee regularly evaluates the contribution of its advisers and reviewed the scope of arrangements for its external advisers 
in July 2013. It concluded that the advice that it received from MM&K and Greenhill was independent and reappointed MM&K as its 
adviser. Fees paid to advisers to the Committee in relation to remuneration advice are shown below.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE Other statutory information
Required information can be found in 
the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 37, 
which is incorporated into this Report by 
reference. Information on the environment, 
employees, community and social issues 
is given in the Corporate Responsibility 
Review on pages 35 to 37.
Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report contains certain 
forward-looking statements with respect 
to principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group. By their nature, these statements 
involve risk and uncertainty because 
they relate to events and depend on 
circumstances that may or may not 
occur in the future. There are a number 
of factors that could cause actual results 
or developments to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied by those 
forward-looking statements. No assurances 
can be given that the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable as they can 
be affected by a wide range of variables.
The forward-looking statements reflect the 
knowledge and information available at 
the date of preparation of this Annual 
Report and will not be updated during the 
year. Nothing in this Annual Report should 
be construed as a profit forecast. 
Tangible fixed assets and investments
The Company’s principal subsidiaries 
are set out on page 170. Changes to 
the Group’s tangible fixed assets and 
investments during the year are set out 
in Notes 22 to 25. There was no material 
difference in value between the book 
value and the market value of the Group’s 
land and buildings.
Directors
The names of the Directors, plus brief 
biographical details are given on pages 
38 and 39. Each Director held office 
throughout the year, David Verey retired 
from the Board at the 2014 AGM. Kevin 
Parry joined in the year.
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all of the Directors will 
stand for re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) on 4 February 2015.
Principal activities
A description of the principal activities of 
the Group and likely future developments 
and important events occurring since the 
end of the year are given in the Strategic 
Report on pages 02 to 37.
Results and dividends
The profit after taxation of the Group 
amounted to £283 million. After excluding 
the £20 million element attributable to 
non-controlling interests, the Group profit 
for the year attributable to owners of the 
Company amounted to £263 million. The 
Board recommends a final dividend of 
14.20 pence per share. If approved at the 
2015 AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 
6 February 2015 to shareholders registered 
in the books of the Company at the close 
of business on 5 December 2014. Together 
with the interim dividend of 6.20 pence per 
share paid on 4 July 2014, this makes a total 
dividend for the year of 20.40 pence per 
share (2013 – 19.20 pence).
Directors’ interests
The number of shares of the Company and 
of securities of other Group companies, in 
which the Directors, or their families, had 
an interest at the year end, are stated in 
the Remuneration Report on page 71.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Executive Directors of the Company, 
together with other employees of the 
Group, are potential beneficiaries of the 
DMGT Employee Benefit Trust (Trust) and, as

2014, the Trust’s shareholding totalled 
2,196,080 A Shares.
Between 30 September 2014 and 
9 December 2014 the Trust transferred 4,903 
A Shares to satisfy the exercise of awards 
under employee share plans.
Significant shareholdings
As at 9 December 2014, the Company had 
been notified of the following significant 
interests of the issued Ordinary Shares:
Rothermere Continuation Limited 100% 
The Board regards holdings in the 
Company’s securities of greater than 15% 
to be significant. There are no significant 
holdings in the Company’s A Shares other 
than those shown in the Remuneration 
Report on page 71.
Share capital
The Company has two classes of shares. 
Its total share capital comprises 5% of

of £0.7 million in order to match obligations 
under various incentive plans. The 
consideration paid for these shares was

programmes, shares purchased during 
the year represented 1.6% of the called-up 
A Share capital as at 30 September 2014.
On 9 December 2014 the Company held 
5 million Treasury Shares following the 
cancellation of 22,716,762 Treasury Shares 
on 25 November 2014.
Details of allotments of share capital which 
arose solely from the exercise of options are 
given at Note 37.

buy-back programme, the Company

External Auditor and disclosure of 
information to the External Auditor

no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s External Auditor is unaware.

they ought to have taken as Directors in 
order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s External Auditor is 
aware of that information.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT Directors’ indemnity
A qualifying third-party indemnity (QTPI), 
as permitted by the Company’s Articles 
of Association and Sections 232 and 234 
of the Companies Act 2006, has been 
granted by the Company to each of the 
Directors of the Company. Under the 
provisions of the QTPI the Company 
undertakes to indemnify each Director 
against liability to third parties (excluding 
criminal and regulatory penalties) and to 
pay Directors’ costs as incurred, provided 
that they are reimbursed to the Company 
if the Director is found guilty or, in an action 
brought by the Company, judgment is 
given against the Director.
Going concern
A full description of the Group’s business 
activities, financial position, cash flows, 
liquidity position, committed facilities 
and borrowing position, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future 
development and performance, is set out 
in the Strategic Report, particularly the 
Financial Review on pages 26 to 29 and 
in the notes to the accounts on page 88.
The Group has significant financial 
resources and the Directors, having 
reviewed the Group’s operating budgets, 
investment plans and financing 
arrangements, have assessed the future 
funding requirements of the Group and 
compared this to the level of committed 
facilities and cash resources. The Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ Report 
on Remuneration and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
and the parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and parent Company 
Financial Statements respectively; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial Statements and the Directors’ 
report on Remuneration comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of Financial Statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. Each of the Directors confirms 
that, to the best of his/her knowledge:
• the Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; and
• the Strategic Report contained on pages 
02 to 37 includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
it faces.
Relationship agreements
Daily Mail and General Trust plc entered 
into a Relationship Deed with Euromoney 
Institutional Investor plc on 16 July 2014 and 
Zoopla Property Group Plc on 5 June 2014 
in accordance with the Listing Rules and 
have acted in accordance with the terms 
of the Deeds since execution.
Charitable and political donations
The Company made charitable donations 
of £1.2 million during the period. In the 
prior year, the Company donated over 
£1.3 million. No political donations were 
made during the period.
Principal risk factors
These risks and how they are being 
managed or mitigated are shown on 
pages 30 to 33. The Directors have 
reviewed the Group’s principal risks 
including those that would threaten 
the Group’s business model, future 
performances, solvent or liquidity.
Events after the balance sheet date 
9 December 2014 
Details are provided in Note 44.
Material contracts
Group companies undertake business 
with a range of customers and suppliers. 
There is no dependence on any particular 
contractual arrangement other than those 
disclosed in Note 40 as regards ink and 
printing, where arrangements are in place 
until 2020 and 2024 respectively to obtain 
competitive prices and to secure supplies.
As regards the Group’s principal 
commodity, newsprint, arrangements 
are made biannually with a range of 
suppliers to ensure the security of supply 
at the best available prices, having regard 
to the need for the necessary quality. 
Particularly in light of its strategy to create 
a diversified international portfolio of 
businesses, the Group is not dependent 
on any supplier of other commodities for 
its revenue or any particular customer. 
Distribution arrangements are in place 
to ensure the delivery of newspapers to 
retail outlets.
Creditor payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors (2013 
nil). The Group is responsible for agreeing 
the terms and conditions including terms 
of payment under which business 
transactions with the Group’s suppliers are 
conducted. Whilst the Group does not 
follow any single external code or standard, 
in line with Group policy, payments to 
suppliers are made in accordance with 
agreed terms and conditions.

GOVERNANCE Employees
Details in respect of employees are in the

Articles of Association
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association. Any changes to the 
Articles of Association must be approved 
by the shareholders in accordance with 
the legislation in force from time to time.
The Directors have authority to issue and 
allot A Shares pursuant to article 9 of the 
Articles of Association and shareholder 
authority is requested at each AGM. The 
Directors have authority to make market 
purchases of A Shares. This authority is also 
renewed annually at the AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles of Association permit the Board 
to authorise any matter which would 
otherwise involve a Director breaching his 
duty under the Companies Act 2006 to 
avoid conflicts of interest.
When authorising a conflict of interest the 
Board must do so without the conflicting 
Director counting as part of the quorum. 
In the event that the Board considers it 
appropriate, the conflicted Director may 
be permitted to participate in the debate, 
but will neither be permitted to vote nor 
count in the quorum when the decision is 
being agreed. The Directors are aware that 
it is their responsibility to inform the Board of 
any potential conflicts as soon as possible 
and procedures are in place to facilitate 
disclosure. The Board reviews its position 
on conflicts of interest annually and at 
such other times as are appropriate.
Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant 
agreements that would take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid. 
However, certain of the Group’s third-party 
funding arrangements would terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company.
The Company does not have agreements 
with any Director or employee providing 
compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a 
takeover bid, except for provisions in the 
rules of the Company’s share schemes 
which may result in options or awards 
granted to employees to vest on  
a takeover.
Transactions with Directors
No transaction, arrangement or 
agreement required to be disclosed in 
terms of the Companies Act 2006 and 
IAS 24, ‘Related Parties’ was outstanding

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
members of Daily Mail and General 
Trust plc
Opinion on Financial Statements of 
Daily Mail and General Trust plc 
In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2014 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the parent Company Financial 
Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Financial Statements comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
related Notes 1 to 45, the parent Company 
Balance Sheet and the related Notes 1 to 
17. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group Financial Statements is applicable 
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of 
the parent Company Financial Statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB
As explained in Note 1 to the Group 
Financial Statements, in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to apply 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). In our opinion the Group 
Financial Statements comply with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB.
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have 
reviewed the Directors’ statement on 
page 75 that the Group is a going concern. 
We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ 
use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the 
Financial Statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material 
uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to 
the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement 
described below are those that had the 
greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and 
directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. The list of these risks remains 
consistent with the prior year: 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible 
assets, property plant and equipment, 
joint ventures and associates 
As set out in Notes 20 and 21, the Group 
has £765 million of goodwill and a further 
£361 million of other intangible assets on the 
balance sheet as at 30 September 2014. 
Management is required to carry out 
an annual impairment test, which is 
judgemental and based on a series 
of assumptions. 
Impairment charges of £65 million were 
recorded in the year, of which £45 million 
related to computer software within 
RMS (RMS(one)). 
We challenged management’s assumptions for each of their impairment reviews, 
particularly focusing on the future cash flow projections, discount rates, long-term 
growth rates and the sensitivities described in Notes 20 and 21 to the Financial Statements. 
To do this we:
• used internal valuation specialists to independently develop expectations for discount 
rates used;
• reviewed Board-approved budgets and forecasts, as well as assessing the historical 
accuracy of management’s forecasts; and
• compared long-term growth rates against external market data where applicable.
We particularly focused our attention on the Group’s capitalised development costs in 
RMS. In respect of the impairment model for this asset we assessed the reasonableness of 
the incremental revenues anticipated to arise from, and the rate of migration of existing 
customers to, the new platform being developed. We considered the time frame and 
future costs for completion of the development, the future operating cost base and the 
discount rate used.
Accounting for acquisitions and disposals 
The Group has made a number of 
acquisitions and disposals in the period, 
which are set out in Notes 16 and 17. 
The accounting for each of these involves 
judgement and is based on assumptions 
about the fair value of assets and liabilities 
acquired, and the consideration paid 
or received. 
Acquisitions in the period totalled 
£165 million and disposals £64 million. 
We carried out testing of all significant sale and purchase agreements made in the year. 
In particular we focused on:
• the appropriateness of management’s identification of assets acquired;
• assessing the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, including auditing 
management’s methodologies, challenging management’s assumptions over royalty 
rates, attrition of customers, useful economic lives and future cash flow projections; 
• verified the consideration paid for acquisitions, including any deferred or contingent 
consideration and the allocation of that to the individual assets acquired; and
• for disposals, verified the assets and liabilities disposed of, the costs of disposal and 
consideration received.
We have also evaluated the presentation and disclosure of the transactions within the 
Group Financial Statements.

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
GOVERNANCE
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude 
of misstatement in the Financial Statements 
that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £10 million (2013 £10 million), which 
is less than 5% of adjusted profit before 
tax and non-controlling interests, and less 
than 5% of statutory profit before tax. The 
methodology for materiality assessment 
remains consistent with prior year. Pre-tax 
profit has been adjusted for items disclosed 
in Note 13, notably impairment charges, 
amortisation of intangible assets arising 
on business combinations and profits 
on disposal of businesses. We consider 
this adjusted measure to be used by 
management and investors as a key 
driver of business value and a focus  
for shareholders.
We agreed with the Audit Committee 
that we would report to them all audit 
differences in excess of £200,000 
(2013 £200,000), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that 
we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the Financial Statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit scope included audit 
work in all five divisions of the Group. 
Within these five divisions we have 
identified 24 locations (2013 24) of audit 
interest. Twelve of these were subject to full 
audit procedures (2013 12), and five were 
subject to specified audit procedures 
(2013 six) where the extent of our testing 
was based on our assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s business 
operations at those locations. These 17 
locations represent the principal business 
units within the Group’s five reportable 
segments and account for 83% of the 
Group’s total assets (2013 88%), 94% of the 
Group’s revenue (2013 95%) and 95% of the 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition 
The Group’s policy on revenue recognition 
is set out in Note 2 to the Financial 
Statements. 
The risk is focused on accounting for new 
forms of contract or changes to existing 
contracts and this varies for each type 
of business. 
We reviewed significant new revenue contracts to identify any unusual terms that would 
indicate a different revenue recognition criteria should be required. 
We tested the timing of revenue recognition in relation to existing contracts and the 
treatment of discounts, as well as assessing whether each was recognised gross or net 
depending on the contractual arrangements. This testing was performed by a 
combination of substantive testing, analytical procedures and assessing the revenue 
recognition policies.
Presentation of adjusted earning measures 
The Group makes a number of adjustments 
to profit which are detailed in Note 13 to 
the Financial Statements. 
This remains a significant risk, particularly 
over the completeness and validity of 
adjusting items. The Group’s adjusted 
operating profit remains the key 
performance metrics for external 
stakeholders. 
We note that the FRC has recently issued guidance on the use of adjusted measures and 
in light of that considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made to derive the 
adjusted profit measures set out in Note 13. We have assessed whether these adjustments 
were appropriately supported and presented on a consistent basis.
Capitalisation of internally generated 
IT costs 
As set out in Note 21, the Group capitalised 
£72 million of IT costs in the year to 
30 September 2014. These costs need 
to satisfy the requirements of IFRS for 
capitalisation and any costs which do 
not meet these requirements should 
be expensed in the period in which 
they occurred.
We carried out testing relating to the costs capitalised in respect of the internally 
generated intangible assets set out in Note 21 to assess whether they meet the criteria 
of IAS 38, Intangible Assets. 
A particular area of focus was on costs capitalised in respect of RMS(one), particularly 
challenging management on whether any costs represented inefficiencies due to the 
postponed release of the product. 
Recognition and measurement of 
deferred tax assets 
As set out in Note 36 to the Financial 
Statements the deferred tax asset totals 
£180 million. This remains a key area of 
focus due to the significance of the 
balance and reliance on forecast 
taxable profits for recognition.
We considered the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and estimates 
in relation to the likelihood of generating suitable future taxable profits to support the 
recognition of deferred tax assets described in Note 36. Our work:
• considered management’s supporting forecasts and estimates; and
• involved the use of tax specialists in concluding on the Group’s ability to utilise future 
taxable profits in the manner planned.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on pages 45 to 48.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and not 
to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the Financial Statements is not modified with respect to any 
of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.

Group’s adjusted profit before tax 
(2013 98%). They were also selected 
to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks 
of material misstatement identified above. 
At the parent entity level we also tested 
the consolidation process and carried 
out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team follows a 
programme of planned site visits that is 
designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or another senior member of the 
group audit team visits the majority of the 
full scope locations at least once a year. 
This year, the Group audit team visited 
seven of the 12 full scope locations. For the 
remaining components we attended key 
meetings by phone and discussed findings 
with component auditors. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the Financial 
Statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the parent Company Financial 
Statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also 
required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not 
in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required 
to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with ten provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.
Our duty to read other information in the 
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited Financial 
Statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider 
whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ Statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm 
that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
Financial Statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We 
also comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures 
are effective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review 
team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an Auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the Financial 
Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the 
Financial Statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Financial 
Statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of 
the Financial Statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited 
Financial Statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
1  Basis of preparation
DMGT is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 180.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared for the year ending 30 September 2014 (2013 year ending 30 September 2013).
Other than Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, Metro and Wowcher businesses, the Group prepares accounts for a year ending on 
30 September. Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, Metro and Wowcher businesses prepare financial statements for a 52 or 53 week financial 
period ending on a Sunday near to the end of September and do not prepare additional financial statements corresponding to the 
Group’s financial year for consolidation purposes as it would be impracticable to do so. The Group considers whether there have been 
any significant transactions or events between the end of the financial year of these businesses and the end of the Group’s financial 
year and makes any material adjustments as appropriate.
The significant accounting policies used in preparing this information are set out in Note 2. 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the 2013 Annual Report, with the 
exception of a restatement of results, described below and as amended, where appropriate, by new or amended IFRS described 
below.
The Group’s financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries together with the 
Group’s share of all of its interests in joint ventures and associates. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
within the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 33. 
As highlighted in Notes 32 and 33 to the financial statements, the Company has long-term financing in the form of bonds and meets its 
day-to-day working capital requirements through bank facilities which expire in March 2019. The current economic conditions create 
uncertainty particularly over the future performance of those parts of the business that derive a significant proportion of revenue from 
advertising. The Board’s forecasts and projections, after taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group is expected to operate within the terms of its current facilities. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will have access to adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
2  Significant accounting policies
The following new and amended IFRSs have been adopted during the year: 
• IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements
• IFRS 11 Joint arrangements
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities
• IFRS 13 Fair value measurement
• IAS 27 (Revised) Separate financial statements
• IAS 28 (Revised) Investments in associates and joint ventures and improvements to IFRS 2009–2011 cycle
• Amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32
• Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets
• Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting
• Investment entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27)
The above standards and amendments to existing standards have not had any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IAS 19 (Revised), Employee Benefits
IAS 19 (Revised) impacted the measurement of various components in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated 
disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. The standard replaces the finance cost on the defined benefit obligation and the 
expected return on plan assets with a net finance charge or income, based on the defined benefit liability or asset and the discount 
rate, measured at the start of the period. This has increased the finance charge in the Consolidated Income Statement with an equal 
and offsetting movement in actuarial gains and losses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

published but are only effective for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014. The new pronouncements 
are listed below:
• Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (effective 1 January 2016)*
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective 1 January 2016)*
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2017)*
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)*
* Not yet endorsed for use in the EU.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent arrangement, 
measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted through the Consolidated Income 
Statement. All other changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in 
accordance with the relevant IFRS. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the date of the acquisition that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is a maximum of one year.
Business combinations achieved in stages
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair 
value at the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts 
arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that were recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified 
to the Consolidated Income Statement where such treatment would be appropriate if the interest were disposed of.
Purchases and sales of shares in a controlled entity
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity increases, the non-controlling interests’ share of net assets, excluding any allocation of 
goodwill, is transferred to retained earnings. Any difference between the cost of the additional interest and the existing carrying value 
of the non-controlling interests’ share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings.
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity decreases, but the Group retains control, the share of net assets disposed, excluding 
any allocation of goodwill, is transferred to the non-controlling interests. Any difference between the proceeds of the disposal and the 
existing carrying value of the net assets or liabilities transferred to the non-controlling interests is recorded in retained earnings.

2  Significant accounting policies continued
Disposal of controlling interests where non-controlling interest retained
Where the Group disposes of a controlling interest but retains a non-controlling interest in the business, the Group accounts for the 
disposal of a subsidiary and the subsequent acquisition of a joint venture, associate or available-for-sale investment at fair value on 
initial recognition. On disposal of a subsidiary all amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Business combinations occurring prior to 4 October 2009
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, other than non-current assets and liabilities 
of disposal groups which are recognised at fair value less costs to sell. Where an adjustment to fair values relating to previously held 
interests (including interests which were equity accounted under IAS 28, Investments in associates) is required on achieving control,  
this is accounted for as an adjustment directly in equity.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Where control is achieved in more than one exchange transaction, goodwill is calculated separately for each transaction based on the 
cost of each transaction and the appropriate share of the acquiree’s net assets based on net fair values at the time of each transaction.
The interest of non-controlling interests in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Purchase and sale of shares in a controlled entity occurring prior to 4 October 2009
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity increases, no adjustments are recorded to the fair values of the assets already held on 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The Group calculates the goodwill arising as the difference between the cost of the 
additional interest acquired and the increase in the Group’s interest in the fair value of the subsidiary’s net assets at the date of the 
exchange transaction. Any difference between the cost of the additional interest, goodwill arising and the existing carrying value 
of the non-controlling interests’ share of net assets is adjusted directly in equity.
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity decreases, which does not result in a change of control, the Group increases the 
non-controlling interests’ share of net assets by the book value of the share of net assets disposed. Any profit or loss on disposal of 
the share of net assets to the non-controlling interests is calculated by reference to the consideration received, the book value of 
the share of net assets disposed and a proportion of any relevant goodwill in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position relating 
to the subsidiary.
Accounting for subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective 
date control is obtained or up to the date control is relinquished, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and for acquisitions 
post 3 October 2010 following adoption of IAS 27 (Revised 2008), Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements the non-controlling 
interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. 
Prior to the adoption of IAS 27 (Revised 2008) losses attributable to non-controlling interests in excess of the non-controlling interests’ 
share in equity were allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interests have a 
binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover such losses. When the subsidiary subsequently reports profits, 
the non-controlling interests do not participate until the Group has recovered all of the losses of the non-controlling interests it 
previously reported.
Interests in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to 
joint control, that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent 
of the parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint 
control over those policies.

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are incorporated in the Group’s results using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture and associate, less any 
impairment in the value of investment. Losses of joint ventures and associates in excess of the of the Group’s interest in that joint venture 
or associate are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the joint venture or associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included 
within the carrying amount of the investment.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other 
than sterling are translated into sterling using exchange rates prevailing on the period end date. Income and expense items and cash 
flows are translated at the average exchange rates for the period and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The Group records foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign operations within the translation reserve in equity.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each period end date, monetary items denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the period end date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the 
date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the 
Consolidated Income Statement for the period. 
Goodwill, intangible assets and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations after transition to IFRS are treated 
as part of the assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate. Goodwill which arose pre-transition to 
IFRS is not translated.
In respect of all foreign operations, any cumulative exchange differences that have arisen before 4 October 2004, the date of transition 
to IFRS, were reset to £nil and will be excluded from the determination of any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets acquired arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and are translated at the closing exchange rates on the period end date.
Goodwill arising before the date of transition to IFRS, on 4 October 2004, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has 
not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired. Intangible 
assets are tested separately from goodwill only where impairment indicators exist. The Group has no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, 
known as cash-generating units (CGUs). If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit, pro-rated on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit, but subject to not reducing any asset below 
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all of the Group’s CGUs are measured at the higher of value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated by discounting future expected cash flows. These calculations use cash flow projections 
based on management-approved budgets and projections which reflect management’s current experience and future expectations 
of the markets in which the CGU operates. Risk adjusted pre-tax discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 9.5% 
to 17.2% (2013 7.4% to 15.0%, 2012 11.3% to 30.7%), the choice of rates depending on the market and maturity of the CGU. The Group’s 
estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has not changed significantly from the previous year. The projections consist of 
Board-approved budgets for the following year, three-year plans and growth rates beyond this period. The long-term growth rates 
range between 0% and +3% (2013 0% and +3.0%, 2012 -3.0% and +3.0%) and vary with management’s view of the CGU’s market 
position, maturity of the relevant market and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which it operates.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is charged immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not  
subsequently reversed.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible 
asset arising from the Group’s development activity, including software for internal use, is recognised only if the asset can be separately 
identified, it is probable the asset will generate future economic benefits, the development cost can be measured reliably, the project 
is technically feasible and the project will be completed with a view to sell or use the asset. Additionally, guidance in Standing 
Interpretations Committee (SIC) 32 has been applied in accounting for internally developed website development costs.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, when the asset is available 
for use, and are reported net of impairment losses. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which it was incurred.
Licences
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. 
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, being three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that 
are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs and directly attributable overheads are capitalised as intangibles. 
Computer software which is integral to a related item of hardware equipment is accounted for as property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
At each period end date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may 
be impaired.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged 
to the Consolidated Income Statement on a reducing balance or straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets from the date they become available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Publishing rights, titles and exhibitions 5 – 30 years
Brands 3 – 20 years
Market and customer related databases 3 – 20 years
Customer relationships 3 – 20 years
Computer software licences 2 – 5 years
Impairment of intangible assets
At each period end date, reviews are carried out of the carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the 
impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, value in use estimates are made 
based on the cash flows of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its net carrying amount, the net carrying amount of the asset 
or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior 
periods, for an asset other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of that asset. In assessing whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for 
an asset other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased, the Group considers, as a minimum, the following indications:
(a) Whether the asset’s market value has increased significantly during the period;
(b)  Whether any significant changes with a favourable effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the 
near future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which the 
asset is dedicated; and
(c) Whether market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have decreased during the period, and those decreases 
are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating the asset’s value in use and increase the asset’s recoverable amount materially.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their cost, less any subsequent 
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than property, plant and equipment under construction using the 
straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years
Short leasehold premises the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 – 25 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land
Investment property
The Group transfers property from property, plant and equipment to investment property when owner occupation ends. Investment 
properties are stated in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation 
and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of these assets, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Group uses 
the Average Cost method in the dmg media segment and the First In First Out method in the remaining segments.
Pre-publication costs
Pre-publication costs represent direct costs incurred in the development of titles prior to their publication. These costs are recognised 
as work in progress on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to the extent that future economic benefit is virtually certain 
and can be measured reliably.
Marketing costs
Marketing and promotional costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position includes cash, short-term deposits and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.

Revenue
Group revenue comprises revenue of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. Revenue is stated at the fair value of consideration, 
net of value added tax, trade discounts and commission where applicable and is recognised using methods appropriate for the 
Group’s businesses. 
Where revenue contracts have multiple elements (such as software licences, data subscriptions and support), all aspects of the 
transaction are considered to determine whether these elements can be separately identified. Where transaction elements can be 
separately identified and revenue can be allocated between them on a fair and reliable basis, revenue for each element is accounted 
for according to the relevant policy below. Where transaction elements cannot be separately identified, revenue is recognised over the 
contract period. 
The principal revenue recognition policies, as applied by the Group’s major businesses, are as follows:
• Subscriptions revenue, including revenue from information services, is recognised over the period of the subscription or contract.
• Publishing and circulation revenue is recognised on issue of publication or report. 
• Advertising revenue is recognised on issue of publication or over the period of the online campaign.
• Contract print revenue is recognised on completion of the print contract. 
• Exhibitions, training and events revenues are recognised over the period of the event. 
• Software licence revenue is recognised on delivery of the software licence or over the period of the licence if support is unable to be 
separately identified from hosting and revenue allocated on a fair and reliable basis.
• Support revenue associated with software licences and subscriptions is recognised over the term of the support contract.
• Long-term contract revenue is recognised under the Percentage of Completion method according to the percentage of work 
completed at the period end date. 
Operating profit before exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets arising on business combinations and impairment of property, plant and equipment and investment property
The Group discloses as operating profit, profit before exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets arising on business combinations, share of results from associates and joint ventures, other 
gains and losses, investment income and finance costs, but after amortisation of internally generated and acquired computer 
software. The Directors believe that this measure is useful to readers as it shows the results of the Group’s operations before contribution 
from joint ventures and associates and because it excludes one-off gains and losses on disposal of businesses, properties, finance items 
and similar items of a non-recurring nature.
Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses comprise profit or loss on sale of trading investments, profit or loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, 
impairment of available-for-sale assets, profit or loss on sale of businesses and profit or loss on sale of joint ventures and associates.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is 
included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Dividends 
are recognised as a distribution in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the 
period in which they are paid.
Borrowing costs
Unless capitalised under IAS 23, Borrowing Costs, all borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the 
period in which they are incurred. Finance charges, including premiums paid on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs and 
discounts related to borrowings, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Consolidated Income Statement using the 
effective interest method.

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Retirement benefits
As permitted by IFRS 1, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group elected to recognise all cumulative 
actuarial gains and losses in the pension schemes operated by the Group at 4 October 2004, the date of transition to IFRS. Pension 
scheme assets are measured at market value at the period end date. Scheme liabilities are measured using the Projected Unit Credit 
method and discounted at a rate reflecting current yields on high-quality corporate bonds having regard to the duration of the liability 
profiles of the schemes.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities 
is recognised as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are 
taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects 
of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial 
assumptions and what has actually occurred. For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
Projected Unit Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out triennially. In accordance with the advice of independent 
qualified actuaries in assessing whether to recognise a surplus, the Group has regard to the principles set out in IFRIC 14.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, including the current service cost, 
any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements. The interest cost less the expected return on assets is also charged 
to the Consolidated Income Statement within net finance costs. 
Since the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit plans cannot be allocated to individual entities on a fair and reasonable 
basis, the scheme’s assets and liabilities are not attributed to reporting segments and the pension charge in each segment in the 
segmental analysis represents the contributions payable for the period.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax for the year.
The current tax payable or recoverable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
Consolidated Income Statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never 
be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using the UK and foreign tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the period end date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are set off and stated net in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority or on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising in investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Goodwill arising on business combinations also includes amounts corresponding to deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of 
acquired intangible assets. A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes 
exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each period end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, 
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end date, and is not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are set off when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there 
is a legally enforceable right to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and liability simultaneously and where the Group intends to 
net settle.
Financial assets
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale investments
Investments and financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under 
a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the time frame established by the market concerned, and are 
measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale. Where securities are held-for-trading purposes, 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to 
be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
The fair value of listed securities is determined based on quoted market prices, and of unlisted securities on management’s estimate 
of fair value determined by discounting future cash flows to net present value using market interest rates prevailing at the period end.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific 
financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below:
Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the Group’s bonds are subject to fair 
value hedge accounting as explained below and this portion is adjusted for the movement in the hedged risk to the extent hedge 
effectiveness is achieved. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the period end date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the 
contract period exceed the forecast income receivable. The provision is calculated based on cash flows to the end of the contract. 
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property 
becoming vacant. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and employees. Equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant.  
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based 
vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a binomial pricing model which is calibrated using a Black-Scholes framework. The expected life used in 
the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
96
DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each period end 
date for cash-settled share-based payments.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based Payments to all equity instruments granted after 7 September 2002 but 
not fully vested at 4 October 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Investment in own shares
Treasury Shares
Where the Company purchases its equity share capital as Treasury Shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is recorded as a deduction from shareholders’ equity until such shares are cancelled, reissued 
or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from the sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Employee benefit trust
The Company has established an employee benefit trust (EBT) for the purpose of purchasing shares in order to satisfy outstanding share 
options and potential awards under long-term incentive plans. The assets of the trust comprise shares in DMGT and cash balances. The 
trust is administered by independent trustees and its assets are held separately from those of the Group. The Group bears the major risks 
and rewards of the assets held by the EBT until the shares vest unconditionally with employees. The Group recognises the assets and 
liabilities of the trust in the consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from 
shareholders’ equity. Consideration received for the sale of shares held by the trust is recognised in equity, with any difference between 
the proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In addition to the judgement taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, management 
has made the following judgements concerning the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
Forecasting
The Group prepares medium-term forecasts based on Board-approved budgets and three-year outlooks. These are used to support 
judgements made in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements including the recognition of deferred tax assets in different 
jurisdictions, the Group’s going concern assessment and for the purposes of impairment reviews. Longer-term forecasts use long-term 
growth rates applicable to the relevant businesses.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of an impairment of intangible assets should be 
recorded requires an estimation of the value in use of the relevant CGU. The value-in-use calculation requires management to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and compare the net present value of these cash flows using a suitable discount 
rate to determine if any impairment has occurred. A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable 
businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows (Note 20). The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the 
period end date was £1,125.3 million (2013 £1,056.8 million, 2012 £968.5 million) after a net impairment charge of £64.7 million 
(2013 charge of £8.3 million, 2012 charge of £19.4 million) was recognised during the year (Notes 20 and 21).
Acquisitions and intangible assets
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to allocate purchase consideration to the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with any excess consideration representing goodwill. Determining the fair value of 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired requires significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect 
to cash flows and unprovided liabilities and commitments, including in respect to tax, are often used. The Group recognises intangible 
assets acquired as part of a business combination at fair values at the date of the acquisition. The determination of these fair values is 
based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the 
assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Additionally, management must estimate the expected useful economic 
lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.
Contingent consideration payable
Estimates are required in respect of the amount of contingent consideration payable on acquisitions, which is determined according 
to formulae agreed at the time of the business combination, and normally related to the future earnings of the acquired business. 
The Directors review the amount of contingent consideration likely to become payable at each period end date, the major assumption 
being the level of future profits of the acquired business. The Group has made a provision for outstanding contingent consideration 
payable amounting to £20.2 million (2013 £26.2 million, 2012 £6.6 million).
Contingent consideration payable is discounted to its fair value in accordance with applicable IFRS. For acquisitions completed 
prior to 4 October 2009, the difference between the fair value of these liabilities and the actual amounts payable is charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement as notional finance costs with remeasurement of the liability being recorded against goodwill. 
For acquisitions completed since 4 October 2009, movements in the fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in Financing.

Contingent consideration receivable
Estimates are required in respect of the amount of contingent consideration receivable on disposals, which is determined according 
to formulae agreed at the time of the disposal and is normally related to the future earnings of the disposed business. The Directors 
review the amount of contingent consideration likely to be receivable at each period end date, the major assumption being the level 
of future profits of the disposed business. The Group has outstanding contingent consideration receivable amounting to £2.7 million 
(2013 £5.4 million, 2012 £1.2 million). During the year the Group received £0.3 million of previously unrecognised contingent consideration.
Contingent consideration receivable is discounted to its fair value in accordance with applicable IFRS. 
Adjusted profit
The Group presents adjusted earnings by making adjustments for costs and profits which management believes to be exceptional 
in nature by virtue of their size or incidence or have a distortive effect on current year earnings. Such items would include costs 
associated with business combinations, one-off gains and losses on disposal of businesses, properties, finance costs and similar items 
of a non-recurring nature together with reorganisation costs and similar charges, tax and by adding back impairment of goodwill and 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on business combinations. See Note 13 for a reconciliation of profit before tax 
to adjusted profit. 
Share-based payments
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date 
of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The key assumptions used in 
calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, 
and expected option lives. Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; 
this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers. See Note 41 for further detail.
Taxation
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure which 
makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group 
and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group accounts for 
unresolved issues based on its best estimate of the final outcome, however, the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that 
the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and, therefore, impact the Group’s results and future 
cash flows. As described above, the Group makes estimates regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to losses based 
on forecasts of future taxable profits which are, by their nature, uncertain.
Retirement benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations prepared by the Group’s actuaries. This involves 
making certain assumptions concerning discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to 
the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions and the resulting estimates 
are reviewed annually and, when appropriate, changes are made which affect the actuarial valuations and, hence, the amount

3 Segment analysis
Following disposal of regional newspaper assets the Group’s business activities are split into five operating divisions: RMS, dmg 
information (previously known as business information), dmg events (previously known as events), Euromoney and dmg media 
(previously known as national and local media). The dmg media division includes all of the Group’s newspaper assets – both print and 
online and all comparative data relating to national and local media have been aggregated into this heading. These divisions are the 
basis on which information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, which has been determined to be the Group 
Board. The segment result is the measure used for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment and represents profit earned by 
each segment, including share of results from joint ventures and associates but before exceptional operating costs, amortisation and 
impairment charges, other gains and losses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues are included within the Strategic Report 
on pages 02 to 37.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the reportable segments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies described in Note 2.
Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market prices.

(i) In December 2013 the Group bought back £49.7 million notional of its 2018 bonds and £149.2 million notional of its 2021 bonds, 
incurring a premium of £24.4 million (Note 32). 
 On 22 September 2014 the Company announced its invitation to holders of its outstanding £165.0 million 2021 bonds and its 
outstanding £349.7 million 2018 bonds to tender their bonds for purchase by the Company for cash. On 30 September the Company 
announced the results and cash price payable of validly tendered 2018 and 2021 bonds. The total cash price payable by the 
Company amounted to £193.1 million, including a premium of £39.9 million, which was paid on 1 October 2014. The derecognition 
of this financial liability and provision for premium payable has not been recorded in these financial statements since the financial 
liability was not extinguished until post year end as prescribed by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The finance charge on the discounting of contingent consideration arises from the requirement under IFRS 3 (2008), Business 
Combinations, to record contingent consideration at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach.

Total tax charge on the profit for the year 13 (21.5) (31.2)
The net prior year credit of £2.9 million (2013 charge £4.3 million), arose largely from the agreement of certain prior year issues with tax 
authorities and a reassessment of the level of tax provisions required, and a reassessment of temporary differences.
Adjusted tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items (adjusted 
tax charge) amounted to a charge of £58.6 million (2013 £48.8 million) and the resulting rate is 20.1% (2013 18.3%). The differences 
between the tax credit and the adjusted tax charge are shown in the reconciliation below:

In calculating the adjusted tax rate, the Group excludes the potential future deferred tax effects of intangible assets and goodwill (other 
than internally generated and acquired computer software) as it prefers to give the users of its accounts a view of the tax charge based 
on the current status of such items.
Tax on other exceptional items includes a net charge of £nil (2013 £0.8 million) relating to the derecognition of further tax losses and 
the reassessment of other temporary differences which are treated as exceptional due to their material impact on the Group’s adjusted 
tax charge.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
The Group defines EBITDA as adjusted operating profit before exceptional operating costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. EBITDA is broadly used by analysts, 
rating agencies, investors and the Group’s banks to assess the Group’s performance. 
The Group’s internal target of Net Debt to EBITDA cover is no greater than 2.0 times whilst the limit imposed by its bank covenants is no 
greater than 3.75 times. The bank covenant ratio uses the average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt. The resultant Net Debt 
to EBITDA ratio is 1.53 times (2013 1.56 times, 2012 1.65 times). Using a closing rate basis for the valuation of Net Debt, the ratio was 
1.54 times (2013 1.53 times, 2012 1.62 times).

Basic earnings per share of 70.6p (2013 43.6p) and diluted earnings per share of 69.3p (2013 42.5p) are calculated, in accordance with 
IAS 33, Earnings per share, on Group profit for the financial year of £228.6 million (2013 £120.9 million) as adjusted for the effect of dilutive 
Ordinary Shares of £0.7 million (2013 £0.3 million) and earnings from discontinued operations of £34.3 million (2013 £43.7 million) and on 
the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, as set out below.
As in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative measure 
gives a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings per share of 55.7p (2013 49.9p) 
are calculated on profit for continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets, amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations, other gains and losses and exceptional financing 
costs after taxation and non-controlling interests associated with those profits, of £207.4 million (2013 £188.2 million), as set out in Note 13 
above, and on the basic weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.

(i) The amount of goodwill which is deductible for the purposes of calculating the Group’s tax charge amounts to £nil.
(ii) During the year the Group increased its interest in Xceligent Inc. held by the dmg information segment and obtained control. 
(iii) The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent consideration relating to 
acquisitions in the year is £nil to £19.7 million. Certain contingent consideration arrangements are not capped since they are based 
on future business performance (Note 35).
 The contingent consideration has been discounted back to current values in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. 
In each case, the Group has used acquisition accounting to account for the purchase.
If all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been 
£1,820.9 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £261.3 million. This information takes 
into account the amortisation of acquired intangible assets together with related income tax effects but excludes any pre-acquisition 
finance costs and should not be viewed as indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisitions had 
actually been completed on the first day of the financial year.
Total losses attributable to equity holders of the parent since the date of acquisition for companies acquired during the year amounted 
to £2.1 million.
Goodwill arising on these acquisitions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the Group’s 
products in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.

(2013 £11.3 million) related to nil (2013 1.2 million) shares in Euromoney. Additionally the Group’s interest in Euromoney increased by 
1.0% following Euromoney’s acquisition of 1.8 million of its own shares during the period. Under the Group’s accounting policy for the 
acquisition of shares in controlled entities, no adjustment has been recorded to the fair value of assets and liabilities already held on the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The difference between the cost of the additional shares and the carrying value of the 
non-controlling interests’ share of net assets is adjusted in retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings in the year was a credit 
of £2.3 million (2013 £16.1 million charge).

20 Goodwill continued
The Group’s policy on impairment of goodwill is set out in Note 2.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of IAS 36, Impairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds an individual 
goodwill item relating to a CGU that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15.0% of the total net book value, in comparison with 
the Group’s total carrying value of goodwill.
The only significant items of goodwill included in the net book value above relate to BCA, a business within Metal Bulletin in the 
Euromoney segment and Genscape in the dmg information segment. 
Genscape has a carrying value of £80.3 million (2013 £76.2 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of £34.2 million 
(2013 £28.5 million). The carrying value of Genscape has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36. 
The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including: 
(i)  Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2014. The Directors believe these to be reasonably 
achievable;
(ii) Subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business;
(iii) A pre-tax discount rate of 12.5%; and
(iv) Long-term nominal growth rates of 3.0%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £118.8 million (2013 £75.6 million). For this 
business the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal 
to the carrying value the discount rate would need to increase by 6.59% to 19.09% (2013 by 5.36% to 17.86%) or the long-term growth 
rate would need to reduce by 11.14% to -8.14% (2013 by 6.82% to -3.82%).
BCA has a carrying value of £142.6 million (2013 £142.8 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of £50.9 million 
(2013 £56.5 million). The carrying value of BCA has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36. The methodology 
applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including:
(i)  Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2014. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable;
(ii) Subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business;
(iii) A pre-tax discount rate of 9.5%; and
(iv) Long-term nominal growth rates of 0%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £155.3 million (2013 £109.0 million). For this 
business the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal to 
the carrying value the discount rate would need to increase by 10.3% to 19.8% (2013 by 9.3% to 18.8%) or the long-term growth rate would 
need to decline by 28.9% to -28.9% (2013 by 24.8% to -24.8%).
The carrying values of the Group’s significant items of goodwill in relation to material business combinations, which the Group considers 
to be those which have a purchase consideration in excess of £100.0 million, are further analysed as follows:

ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The RMS(one) intangible asset has a carrying value of £41.2 million (2013 £52.2 million) which has been determined using a value in use 
calculation in line with IAS 36. The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources 
of information including:
(i)  Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2014. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable;
(ii) Cash flows over the six years post launch;
(iii) The rate at which Core clients start to use the RMS(one) platform;
(iv) A pre-tax discount rate of 14.7%; and
(v) Long-term nominal growth rates of 3.0% in the Core business.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount was lower than the total carrying value by £44.6 million (2013 exceeded 
carrying value by £203.7 million). Accordingly, an impairment charge was recorded in the year amounting to £44.6 million.
The methodologies applied to the Group’s CGUs when testing for impairment and details of the above impairment charge, are set out 
in Note 2.

Committed borrowing facilities
The Group’s bank loans bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Group’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA. 
Additionally each facility contains covenants based on a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover ratio. EBITDA 
for these purposes is defined as the aggregate of the Group’s consolidated operating profit including share of results of joint ventures 
and associates before deducting depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, before 
exceptional items and before interest and finance charges and the ratio is shown in Note 33. These covenants were met at the relevant 
test dates during the year.
During the period the Group renegotiated its committed bank facilities for a further five-year term. Of these facilities £145.0 million are 
denominated in sterling and £344.4 million (US$558.0 million) are denominated in US dollars although drawings are permitted in all 
major currencies. The terms of the new facilities are substantially the same as those of the existing facilities.

The Group’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts and 
movements in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using 
the effective interest method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £2.3 million (2013 £3.1 million, 2012 £3.5 million), the unamortised 
premia £7.1 million (2013 £7.7 million, 2012 £9.2 million).
The fair value of the Group’s bonds have been calculated on the basis of quoted market rates.
In December 2013 the Group bought back £49.7 million nominal of its 2018 bonds and £149.2 million nominal of its 2021 bonds incurring 
a premium of £24.4 million.
On 22 September 2014 the Company announced its invitation to holders of its outstanding £165.0 million 2021 bonds and its outstanding 
£349.7 million 2018 bonds to tender their bonds for purchase by the Company for cash. On 30 September the Company announced the 
results and cash price payable of validly tendered 2018 and 2021 bonds. The total cash price payable by the Company amounted to 
£193.1 million, including a premium of £39.9 million, which was paid on 1 October 2014. The derecognition of this financial liability and 
provision for premium payable has not been recorded in these financial statements since the financial liability was not extinguished 
until post year end as prescribed by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Further details of the Group’s borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29.
Loan notes
The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately LIBID to LIBID minus 1%. The loan notes are repayable 
at the option of the loan note holders with a six-month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33 Financial instruments and risk management
The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial instruments 
are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for 
speculative purposes. Full details of the Group’s treasury policies are set out in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders’ funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the Group are able 
to continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Debt management
The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile. The Group’s principal sources 
of funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities. The Group is mindful of its credit rating, currently 
BBB- and ensures it has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account 
the Group’s holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist. The Group aims to maximise 
the term and flexibility of indebtedness and retain headroom in the form of undrawn committed bank facilities of approximately 
£100.0 million. Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in 
that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Group’s bond issuances together with its bank facilities will be sufficient to cover the likely medium-term 
cash requirements of the Group.
Associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements. In all 
cases such financing is non-recourse to the Company.
The Group’s internal target of Net Debt to EBITDA cover is no greater than 2.0 times whilst the limit imposed by its bank covenants is no 
greater than 3.75 times. The bank covenant ratio uses the average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt. The resultant Net Debt 
to EBITDA ratio is 1.53 times (2013 1.56 times, 2012 1.65 times). Using a closing rate basis for the valuation of net debt, the ratio was 1.54 
times (2013 1.53 times, 2012 1.62 times).
Cash and liquidity risk management
The Group monitors its cash balances to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet operational requirements as they fall due. 
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due 
consideration to credit risk. 
Market risk management
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements. 
Interest rate risk management
The limit imposed by the Group’s bank covenants is at least 3 times EBITDA to net interest. The actual ratio for the year was 7.73 times 
(2013 6.66 times, 2012 6.72 times).
The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes 
in interest rates. Group policy is to have 70% to 80% of interest exposures fixed with the balance floating. This is achieved by issuing fixed 
rate sterling bond debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate interest into floating rate. Derivatives 
are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist. 
The derivatives in place to meet Group policy are as follows: 
(i)  Fixed to floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Group’s bonds; changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised 
in the income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements in the hedged 
risk to the extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the income statement. These interest rate swaps amount 
to £73.9 million (2013 £73.9 million, 2012 £108.9 million) with the Group paying floating rates of between 0.53% and 0.91% (2013 0.51% 
and 1.86%, 2012 0.63% and 1.86%).
(ii)  Fixed to floating interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedging instruments; changes in the fair value of the swaps are 
recognised in the income statement. These interest rate swaps amount to US$67.0 million (2013 US$67.0 million, 2012 US$67.0 million) 
with the Group receiving floating US dollar interest at rates of between 0.23% and 0.25% (2013 0.25% and 0.38%, 2012 0.38% 
and 0.47%).
(iii)  Cross currency fixed to fixed interest rate swaps; these amount to £64.7 million/US$105.0 million (2013 £72.4 million/US$128.0 million, 
2012 £158.4 million/US$ 288.0 million) resulting in the Group paying fixed US dollar interest at rates of between 6.01% and 6.04% 
(2013 6.01% and 6.07%, 2012 4.40% and 6.07%).
(iv)  The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps. These amounted to US$100.0 million notional (2013 US$100.0 million, 
2012 US$100.0 million) at rates of between 2.20% and 2.75% (2013 6.00%, 2012 6.00%).

CONTINUED
33 Financial instruments and risk management continued
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs 
calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 30 September 2014. The fair value of long-term borrowings has been 
calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other than that 
of the parent company. The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating 
borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps and forward contracts as net investment hedges, hedging the Group’s overseas 
investments.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to financial 
instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s customer base is diversified geographically and by segment with customers generally of a good financial standing. 
Before accepting any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customers’ credit quality and sets credit limits by customer. The 
average credit period is 38 days (2013 39 days, 2012 43 days). The Group considers the credit risk of trade receivables to be low, although 
the Group remains vigilant in the current economic climate. The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, 
although the Group does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances. The Group makes an allowance for bad and doubtful 
debts specific to individual debts. This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles 
and past default experience.
The Group’s receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Institutional counterparty risk
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments. As a result, credit 
risk arises from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are unsecured. The amount 
of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged. The Group also 
has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. 
Credit risk is controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment 
banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them. 
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are banks with high 
credit ratings. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any “AA” counterparty or £10.0 million for “A” 
rated counterparties. The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the date the derivatives are entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured to fair value at each reporting date. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established 
estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models. The Group designates certain derivatives as:
(i) Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (fair value hedges); or
(ii) Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations (net investment hedges).
To qualify for hedge accounting, each individual hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and 
documented at its inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest 
rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the year together with the changes 
in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. When the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.

Cash flow hedges
The Group’s policy is to use certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from certain firm 
commitments or forecast highly probable transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that 
the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are 
included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until 
the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 30 September 2014. All amounts deferred in equity at the year end are 
expected to impact the Consolidated Income Statement in the next 18 months when the related cash flows are expected to occur.
Net investment hedges
The Group seeks to manage the foreign currency exposure arising on retranslation of the reporting entity’s share of net assets of foreign 
operations at each reporting date by designating certain derivative financial instruments and foreign currency borrowings as net 
investment hedging instruments.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity in the 
translation reserve. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in equity to the 
extent that the hedging relationship is effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement 
for the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the Consolidated Income Statement on 
disposal of the foreign operation.
All net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 30 September 2014.

In managing the Group’s interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations. However, 
changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on the Group’s results.

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 30 September 2014 it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in interest rates would have reduced the Group’s finance costs by 
£0.5 million (2013 decreased by £3.9 million, 2012 increased by £1.2 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised 
directly in equity. This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings,  
net of any interest rate swaps, at the year-end date.
At 30 September 2014 it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in interest rates would have increased the Group’s finance costs by 
£4.8 million (2013 increased by £5.7 million, 2012 reduced by £1.1 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised 
directly in equity. This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings,  
net of any interest rate swaps, as at the year end date.
At 30 September 2014 it is estimated that a 10.0% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net gain taken 
to equity by £38.9 million (2013 £26.5 million, 2012 £49.1 million) and increased the net loss taken to income by £1.3 million (2013 £1.4 million 
reduction, 2012 £nil). A 10.0% weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have reduced the net gain taken to equity by £44.3 million 
(2013 £29.3 million, 2012 £53.6 million) and increased the net loss taken to income by £3.0 million (2013 £1.8 million, 2012 £nil). This sensitivity 
has been calculated by applying the foreign exchange change to the Group’s financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
foreign exchange rates.
At 30 September 2014 it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would 
lead to a decrease in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of £1.2 million (2013 £0.2 million, 2012 £nil).
At 30 September 2014 it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The key input into the significant level 3 financial liabilities is the future profitability of the businesses to which the acquisition put options 
and contingent consideration relate. The range of possible outcomes for the fair value of these options is £13.7 million to £130.4 million 
(2013 £1.2 million to £92.1 million).
A one percentage point increase or decrease in the growth rate in estimating the expected profits results in the acquisition commitment 
and contingent consideration liability at 30 September 2014 increasing or decreasing by £0.4 million and £0.4 million respectively with 
the corresponding change to the value at 30 September 2014 charged or credited to the Income Statement in future periods.
34 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a number of pension schemes under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees. The total net 
pension costs of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2014 were £28.9 million (2013 £31.1 million, 2012 £35.3 million).
The schemes include funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, in addition to a number of 
defined contribution pension arrangements. The defined benefit schemes in the UK, together with some defined contribution plans, 
are administered by trustees or trustee companies.
In compliance with legislation the Group commenced automatic enrolment of relevant employees into defined contribution pension 
plans from September 2013. This process will continue to be staged progressively and will be complete during 2016.
Defined benefit schemes
Background
The Company operates two main defined benefit schemes, the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS) and the Senior Executive Pension 
Scheme (SEPF), both of which are now closed to new entrants. Benefits accrued up to 31 March 2011 were accrued on a final salary 
basis, but with the value of those benefits having been delinked from pensionable salary. Existing members still in employment can 
continue to accrue benefits in the scheme on a cash balance basis, with members building up a retirement account that they can 
use to buy an annuity from an insurance company at retirement.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the Scheme Actuary. As a result of the valuations of 
the main schemes as at 31 March 2013 the Company makes annual contributions of 12.0% or 18.0% of members’ basic pay (depending 
on membership section) for HPS and 28.5% of pensionable pay for SEPF. Following the results of the latest triennial valuation, the 
Company agreed recovery plans involving a series of annual funding payments, and in accordance with both these and prior 
arrangements, payments of £23.1 million were made on 4 October 2013; £13.0 million on 31 January 2014 and £7.0 million on 28 February 
2014. A further payment of £28.7 million was made subsequent to the year end and in accordance with the agreed payment date of 
5 October 2014. Between October 2014 and October 2026 further annual payments have been agreed amounting to £334.6 million 
(excluding the balloon funding payment referred to below in connection with the Limited Partnership investment vehicle). The 
Company considers that these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period. Both the ongoing 
contributions and Recovery Plan will be reviewed at the next triennial funding valuation of the main schemes due to be completed 
with an effective date 31 March 2016.
In February 2014 the Company agreed with the Trustees that should it continue its share buy-back programme it would make additional 
contributions to the schemes amounting to 20% of the value of shares bought back. Contributions of £5.9 million relating to this 
agreement were made in the year to 30 September 2014. 
The Company also has a defined benefit obligation relating to the DMGT AVC Plan (the Plan) which is closed to further member 
contributions. The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Plan, carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2011, showed 
a funding deficit of £5.6 million. The Trustees and the Company have agreed that this funding shortfall will be removed through the 
expected investment returns, with no further contributions required from the Company. The 31 March 2014 valuation results are 
expected to be finalised in early 2015.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Limited Partnership investment vehicle
The Company enabled the Trustee of the HPS to acquire a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle (LP). The LP 
has been designed to facilitate payment of part of the deficit funding payments described above over a period of 15 years to 2026. 
In addition, the LP is required to make a final payment to the scheme of £150.0 million or the funding deficit within the scheme on an 
ongoing actuarial valuation basis at the end of the 15-year period if this is less. For funding purposes, the interest held by the trustee 
in the LP will be treated as an asset of the scheme and reduce the actuarial deficit within the scheme. However, under IAS 19 the LP  
is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore is not included in the disclosures below.
The figures in this Note are based on calculations using membership data as at 30 September 2014 along with asset valuations and 
cash flow information from the schemes for the year to 30 September 2014.

The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a 
company can recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position. Having taken account of the rules of the schemes, 
the fact that the schemes remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and cash contributions, 
the Company considers that recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its Statement of Financial Position would be in accordance with 
the interpretations of IFRIC 14. In 2013 and 2012 all schemes were in deficit.
The deficit for the year, set out above, excludes a related deferred tax asset of £42.8 million (2013 £42.3 million, 2012 £74.6 million).

The discount rate for both scheme liabilities and the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year end date on high-quality 
corporate bonds. All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on ‘CMI’ 
projections but with a long-term rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.25% per annum. Allowance is made for the extent to 
which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.
The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year is approximately 17 years (2013 17 years).
The table below illustrates examples of the assumed average life expectancies from age 60 for the principal schemes:

There are significant risks in connection with running defined benefit schemes; key risks are highlighted below:
Discount rate risk
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate 
bond yields. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation, although this will 
be partially offset by an increase in the value of corporate bonds held by the schemes. 
Inflation rate risk
A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore increased inflation will result in a higher defined 
benefit obligation. The Trustees have sought to acquire certain assets with exposure to inflationary uplifts in order to negate a proportion 
of this risk.
Life expectancy risk
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme members. 
An increase in assumed life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation. Regular reviews of mortality experience 
are performed to ensure life expectancy assumptions remain appropriate.

Investment risk
This is a measure of the uncertainty that the return on the scheme’s assets keeps pace with the discount rate. The schemes hold a 
significant proportion of equities and similar ‘growth assets’, which are expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term.

The Group expects to contribute approximately £39.1 million to the schemes during the year to 30 September 2015 including the deficit 
funding payments described above.
UK defined contribution plans
The Group has introduced a number of PensionSaver group personal pension plans that have replaced the trust-based defined 
contribution pension plans previously offered to employees. These plans create a consistent pensions savings vehicle across all Group 
segments. The benefits for all members of the trust-based plans are currently being transferred to individual policies held in the 
member’s own name. This transfer is expected to complete by the end of November 2014, following which the scheme will be wound 
up. Insured death benefits previously held under this trust have already been transferred to a new trust-based arrangement specifically 
for life assurance purposes.
The aggregate value of the group personal pension plans and the remaining trust-based defined contribution pension plans was 
£76.7 million (2013 £65.8 million, 2012 £50.3 million) at the year end. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year 
amounted to £5.7 million (2013 £3.0 million, 2012 £1.9 million).
Overseas pension plans
Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group segments operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America 
and Australia. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to £3.7 million (2013 £2.9 million, 2012 £1.4 million).
Pension arrangements for executives
The Group operates a contributory defined benefit scheme for senior executives (including some Executive Directors), details of 
which are included in the above disclosures. However, no Executive Directors accrued further pension during the year.

The uncertainties surrounding and the nature of the Group’s contingent consideration provisions are disclosed in critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Note 2). The maturity profile of the Group’s contingent consideration provision

The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent consideration relating to 
acquisitions in the year is £nil to £19.8 million. Certain contingent consideration arrangements are not capped since they are based 
on future business performance.

Australia 11.2 12.7 5.4

These losses have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that 
sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered 
probable that these assets will be recovered. Of these assets £6.6 million (2013 £nil, 2012 £nil) have expiry dates between 2021 and 2034.
Included in the credit to income of £4.0 million (2013 £5.4 million, 2012 £15.1 million) is a charge of £0.2 million (2013 £1.5 million, 
2012 £9.3 million) relating to discontinued operations.
Included in Other deferred tax are deferred tax assets of £nil (2013 £nil, 2012 £1.7 million) in respect of capital losses and deferred 
tax liabilities of £nil (2013 £nil, 2012 £1.7 million) in respect of revaluations and rolled over gains and £0.4 million (2013 £0.4 million, 
2012 £0.4 million) in respect of financial instruments. The £nil credit to equity (2013 credit of £0.1 million, 2012 charge of £1.9 million) 
relates entirely to financial instruments.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £61.1 million (2013 £54.8 million, 2012 £79.1 million) which relates to revenue losses where 
there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future. There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset 
relating to capital losses carried forward of £88.4 million (2013 £92.4 million, 2012 £62.4 million). Of these assets £8.6 million (2013 £nil, 
2012 £nil) have expiry dates between 2022 and 2033. 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £219.0 million (2013 £177.5 million, 2012 £117.2 million) relating to the 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences 
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 30 September 2014 represent only 
the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, 
principally as a result of a dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

The Group’s most significant leasing arrangements relate to rented properties. The Group negotiates lease contracts according to the 
Group’s needs with a view to balancing stability and security of tenure and lease terms with the risk of entering into excessively long 
or onerous arrangements. Of the Group’s rented properties, the most significant commitment relates to the head office premises at 
2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT. This lease expires on 25 December 2022.

The Group entered into arrangements with its ink suppliers to obtain ink for the period to September 2018 at competitive prices and to 
secure supply. At the year end, the commitment to purchase ink over this period was £53.7 million (2013 £65.1 million, 2012 £76.8 million).
The Group has entered into agreements with certain printers for periods up to 2022 at competitive prices and to secure supply. At the 
year end, the commitment to purchase printing capacity over this period was £61.9 million (2013 £59.1 million, 2012 £68.6 million).
Contingent liabilities
The Group has issued standby letters of credit of £1.8 million (2013 £1.2 million, 2012 £2.4 million).
The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and vigorously defends against claims received. The Group 
makes provision for the estimated costs to defend such claims when incurred and provides for any settlement costs when such an 
outcome is judged probable.
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against Euromoney and three of its employees in respect of an article 
published in one of Euromoney’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995. The writs were served on 
Euromoney on 22 October 1996. Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount claimed on the two 
remaining writs is Malaysian ringgit 82.6 million (£15.5 million). No provision has been made for these claims in these financial statements 
as the Directors do not believe that Euromoney has any material liability in respect of these writs.
41 Share-based payments
The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration schemes to Directors and certain employees. The principal schemes comprise 
share options under the DMGT, Euromoney and within dmg information, RMS, Genscape and Trepp Executive Share Option Schemes 
(ESOS), the Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan and the Company’s LTIP . Share options are exercisable after three years, subject in 
some cases to the satisfaction of performance conditions, and up to 10 years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market 
value of the respective shares at the date of grant. Details of the performance conditions relating to the DMGT schemes are explained 
in the Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 73.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, IFRS 2, Share-based payments applies to grants of shares, share options or other 
equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005. 
The charge to the Consolidated Income Statement is as follows:

The fair value of share options for each of these schemes was determined using a Black-Scholes model. Full details of inputs to the 
models, particular to each scheme, are set out below. With respect to all schemes, expected volatility has been estimated, based upon 
relevant historical data in respect of the DMGT A Ordinary share price. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability.
The Group did not reprice any of its outstanding options during the year.

subject to a nine-month holding period, which was subsequently removed during 2007. The stock issued under the plan is subject to 
put or call options where DMGT has the right to settle in DMGT A Ordinary Shares or cash. The options plan classification changed from 
a cash-settled plan in June 2005 to an equity-settled plan following this change of settlement feature of stock issued under the plan. 
After 30 September 2011 options under the 2001 and 2005 plan are no longer awarded.
During the year ended 30 September 2011 RMS introduced the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
Under the EIP options and Restricted Stock Units (RSU) were awarded to senior management. Under the LTIP RSUs were awarded to key 
employees. The options and RSUs were granted at market value under both plans. The options vest based on the conditions of time and 
Company performance at three and five years from date of grant. The options lapse after seven years from grant date. The RSUs under 
both plans vest annually over three years.
A 2014 Equity Award Plan (the Plan) was introduced during the year ended 30 September 2014. Under the Plan options and RSUs, both 
time and performance based, are granted to employees who are deemed to be in a position to contribute to the long-term success 
of RMS.
The RSU expense is determined by the fair market value of RMS stock at the date of grant. The expense is amortised using an 
accelerated method. Under this method the RSUs are equally allocated to each of the three annual vesting components and 
the related expense is amortised over 12, 24, and 36 months respectively.

Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2014 (CAP 2014)
The CAP 2014 was approved by Euromoney’s shareholders on 30 January 2014 as a replacement for CAP 2010. Each CAP 2014 award 
comprises two equal instalments: an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25 pence each in Euromoney for nil consideration 
and a right to receive a cash payment. The value of the awards is linked directly to the growth in profits over the performance period. 
The award pool comprises a maximum of 3.5 million Euromoney shares and cash of £7.6 million, limiting the cost of the scheme to 
£41.0 million over its life. Awards will vest in three equal tranches, subject to the performance conditions, and lapse to the extent 
unexercised by 30 September 2023.

Euromoney Share Option Plan (CSOP 2014)
Euromoney’s shareholders approved the CSOP 2014 at the Euromoney AGM on 30 January 2014. The CSOP 2014 was approved by 
HM Revenue and Customs on 31 March 2014. Awards were granted under the CSOP 2014 on 20 June 2014. Each CSOP 2014 option 
enables each UK participant to purchase up to 2,688 shares and each Canadian participant to purchase up to 8,963 shares in 
Euromoney at a price of £11.15 per share, the market value at the date of grant. The options vested and became exercisable at the 
same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2014. The CSOP 2014 has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 
2014. The number of CSOP 2014 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2014. The CSOP 
2014 is effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2014 award. The CSOP 2014 options have an exercise price of £11.15 which 
will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which is in place and results in a net gain on these options being delivered in the 
equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same gain had been delivered using the CAP 2014 options. The amount of the 
funding award will depend on the Euromoney share price at the date of exercise.

Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2010 (CAP 2010)
The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by Euromoney shareholders on 21 January 2010 as a direct replacement 
for CAP 2004. Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal elements – an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25 pence each 
in Euromoney at an exercise price of 0.25 pence per Ordinary Share, and a right to receive a cash payment. 
The award pool comprised 3,500,992 Euromoney Ordinary Shares with an option value of £15.0 million and cash of £15.0 million, limiting 
the total accounting cost to £30.0 million over its life.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches. The first tranche of awards became exercisable in February 2013 on satisfaction of the primary 
performance condition in 2012. The second tranche became exercisable in February 2014 in which the primary performance condition 
was again satisfied. The vesting of the second tranche is subject to an additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of 
the second tranche of awards, requires the profits of each business in the subsequent vesting period be at least 75% of that achieved 
in the year the first tranche of awards became exerciseable. The options lapse to the extent unexercised by 30 September 2020. 
The number of options received under the share award of CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from 
the 2010 Euromoney Share Option Plan.
The CAP 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present 
value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option used in the models 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.

Euromoney Share Option Plan (CSOP 2010)
In parallel with the CAP 2010, Euromoney’s shareholders approved the CSOP 2010 at Euromoney’s AGM on 21 January 2010. The CSOP 
2010 was approved by HM Revenue and Customs on 21 June 2010 and granted on 28 June 2010. The CSOP 2010 option enabled each 
participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in Euromoney at a price of £6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant. Any CSOP 
options that did not fully vest in the first tranche of the CAP 2010 award vest at the same time as the second tranche of an individual’s 
CAP award, but only where the CSOP 2010 is in the money. The CSOP 2010 has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010.

The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010, the CSOP is 
effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award. The CSOP 2010 options have an exercise price of £6.03 (1), which will 
be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain (2) on these options delivered in the equivalent number 
of shares to participants as if the same award had been delivered using £0.0025 CAP options. The amount of the funding award will 
depend on Euromoney’s share price at the date of exercise. Because of the above and the other direct links between the CSOP 2010 
and the CAP 2010, including the identical performance criteria, IFRS 2 combines the two plans and treats them as one plan (vesting in 
two tranches). As such, the long-term incentive expense recognised in the year for the CSOP 2010 and CAP 2010 options (including the 
charge in relation to the cash element) was a credit of £0.3 million (2013 £1.9 million, 2012 £8.1 million).
(1) Exercise price of Canadian CSOP is £5.01.
(2) Net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of Euromoney’s shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price (£6.031) 
multiplied by the number of options exercised. 
* Exercise price excludes the effect of the funding award.
Cash-settled options
Euromoney has liabilities in respect of three share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 payments as cash settled. These consist 
of the cash element of the CAP 2010 scheme, options held by employees over new equity shares in Internet Securities Inc., a subsidiary 
of Euromoney and, from 2011, options held by employees over equity shares in Structured Retail Products Limited (previously Arete 
Consulting Limited), a subsidiary of Euromoney. The total carrying value at 30 September 2014 included in the Statement of Financial 
Position is a liability of £0.1 million (2013 £7.4 million, 2012 £14.6 million). Of these schemes, options with an intrinsic value of £0.1 million 
(2013 £nil, 2012 £3,000) had vested but are not yet exercised.

The Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2004 (CAP 2004)
The CAP 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 1 February 2005. Each of the CAP awards comprises 
an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25 pence each in the Company for an exercise price of 0.25 pence per Ordinary Share. 
The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on 
30 September 2014. The initial performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool (a maximum of 
7.5 million shares) was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards. One-third of the awards vested immediately. The primary 
performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from 
the second tranche of options vested in February 2009. The primary performance target was also achieved in 2009 and 1,527,152 
options (including a true-up adjustment of 5,654) for the third (final) tranche of options in 2009 vested in February 2010. The additional 
performance condition was applied to profits for financial years 2010 to 2012 for those individual participants where the additional 
performance conditions for the second and final tranches had not previously been met and 303,321; 244,152 and 39,907 options 
vested in February 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. No further options will vest under this scheme and all outstanding options have 
been exercised.
CAP options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of the grant for the net present value 
of expected future dividend streams up to the date of the expected exercise.

INFORMATION
GOVERNANCE NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET – UK GAAP
1 Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the 
revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as described below, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). The following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies under 
UK GAAP , which have been applied consistently in both the current and prior year.
Profit for the financial year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included 
in these accounts. The Company’s profit after tax for the year, calculated on a UK GAAP basis, was £194.3 million (2013 £1,202.7 million, 
2012 £236.3 million).
Impact of amendments to accounting standards
In the current year certain minor amendments to UK financial reporting standards were issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board. 
The adoption of these amendments has not had any impact on the Company’s accounting policies.
2 Significant accounting policies
Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s reporting currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rate prevailing on the date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation 
of monetary items, are included in the profit and loss account for the year.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment, where appropriate. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing 
differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates 
expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of 
income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. 
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the 
asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Financial instruments disclosures
Financial assets
Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are non interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
17 4
DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the Company’s bonds are subject to 
fair value hedge accounting and this portion of the carrying value is adjusted for the movement in the hedged risk to the extent hedge 
effectiveness is achieved. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right 
to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses 
various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these risks.
The use of financial derivatives is set out on pages 137 to 139 of the Group’s Annual Report. The Company does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Company does not apply hedge accounting except for fair value hedges. Gains and losses arising on derivatives that form part 
of net investment hedge or cash flow hedge relationships in the consolidated financial statements are recorded in the profit and loss 
account in the Company.
Financial instruments – disclosures
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided in FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures which states that disclosure 
in respect of financial instruments is not required in parent company financial statements where such disclosures are included in publicly 
available consolidated financial statements.
Cash flow statement
The Company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS 1 (Revised), Cash Flow Statements and has not presented a cash flow 
statement. A Consolidated Cash Flow Statement has been presented in the Group’s Annual Report.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions of FRS 8 which states that disclosure of related party transactions is not required 
in the parent company financial statements when those statements are presented together with its consolidated financial statements.
Share-based payments
The Company operates the Group’s LTIP and other Group share-based payment schemes, details of which can be found in Note 41 
of the Group’s Annual Report.
Retirement benefits
The Company contributes to defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of its employees. These are 
managed on a Group basis and so the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the defined 
benefit scheme in which it participates on a consistent and reasonable basis. The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no 
segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating 
employers; the contribution rate charged to each employer being affected by the experience of the scheme as a whole. The scheme  
is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the Company. This means that the pension charge reported in these 
financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period. 
Details of the financial position and key valuation assumptions of these schemes can be found in Note 34 of the Group’s Annual Report.

In December 2013 the Company bought back £49.7 million notional of its 2018 bonds and £149.2 million notional of its 2021 bonds 
incurring a premium of £24.4 million.
The Company’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts and 
movements in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the 
effective interest method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £2.3 million (2013 £3.1 million, 2012 £3.5 million) and the unamortised 
premia amounts to £7.1 million (2013 £7.7 million, 2012 £9.2 million).
Details of the fair value of the Company’s bonds are set out in Note 32 of the Group’s Annual Report.
The bonds are subject to fair value hedging using derivatives as set out in Note 33 of the Group’s Annual Report. Consequently, their 
carrying value is also adjusted to take into account the effects of this hedging activity.
The book value of the Company’s other borrowings equates to fair value.

ShareGift
In the UK, DMGT supports ShareGift, which is administered by the Orr Mackintosh Foundation (registered charity number 1052686) and 
which operates a charity share donation scheme for shareholders wishing to give small holdings of shares to benefit charitable causes. 
It may be especially useful for those who wish to dispose of a small parcel of shares which would cost more to sell than they are worth. 
There are no capital gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is also possible to obtain income tax 
relief. If you would like to use ShareGift or receive more information about the scheme, they can be contacted by visiting their website 
at www.sharegift.org or by writing to ShareGift, 17 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AH.

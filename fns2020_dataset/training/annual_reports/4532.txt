Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Nigel Northridge
Chairman
21 October 2010
I am delighted to be making my ﬁrst statement as 
Chairman of Debenhams. I was honoured to 
accept the role and have thoroughly enjoyed my 
ﬁrst six months. Debenhams is a household name 
operating in a fascinating and highly competitive 
sector. As I said at the time of my appointment,  
I look forward to playing my part in the continued 
success of this great British retailer which has 
demonstrated its strengths by delivering a resilient 
performance over the past two years despite the 
difﬁcult market environment.
Having joined the board in January and assumed 
the chair in April, I have spent much of the last  
few months acquainting myself with Debenhams’ 
business and its people. I believe that only by being 
truly familiar with the business can I, as Chairman, 
know the right questions to ask and fully contribute 
to strategy development. I have obviously spent 
much time with the Company’ s senior management 
team but I have also visited a broad range of our 
stores around the country, met some of our 
excellent people on the front line and spoken  
to some of our customers. Our buying and 
merchandising directors and their teams have 
provided me with a crash course in design and 
fashion retailing to enable me to understand how 
we buy as well as how we sell. I have visited our 
newly acquired business in Denmark and spent 
time with our people who are responsible for the 
multi-channel operations. I have met with head 
ofﬁce functions both in London and Taunton. I was 
also very keen to have the opportunity to meet with 
some of Debenhams’ shareholders in order to gain 
their insight on our Company.
So what have I found? I have found a great business 
with many great people. Seeing our product ranges 
Chairman’s Statement
in store convinces me that our strategy to focus on 
own bought products makes huge sense. It is a 
clear point of difference and having seen the 
margin and proﬁt beneﬁt of this strategy in 2010 we 
should soon see the sales beneﬁt too. Visiting stores 
has also reinforced my opinion that our space 
strategy of opening new stores and refurbishing 
older stores is correct; this is clearly demonstrated 
not only in the fantastic looking stores but also in 
the strong returns on capital achieved. I was 
extremely impressed with Magasin du Nord, which  
I visited along with a group of analysts and 
shareholders, and I am sure the early success we 
have seen from the introduction of Debenhams 
products will continue. Our multi-channel business, 
which brings together our stores and online 
activities, is extremely exciting and providing our 
customers with the ﬂexibility to shop in different 
ways is a pre-requisite for success in this digital age.
As well as the operational side of the business,  
I have been equally impressed by the Company’s 
corporate governance, ﬁnancial, risk management 
and internal controls processes.
Living up to our responsibilities, not least as an 
employer, a retailer, a buyer of goods and a member 
of the community, is one of the most important 
issues we have to address. Y ou can read more about 
our work in this area in the corporate responsibility 
review but I would like to highlight the efﬁcacy of our 
supply chain practices, particularly in relation to 
ethical sourcing, and some of our leading edge 
employee development work in the area of NVQ 
qualiﬁcations. I must also mention some of the 
groundbreaking campaigns we have been involved 
with this year and recommend shareholders look 
at pages 18 to 19 for more information. 
At the heart of corporate governance is the board 
of directors. I am conﬁdent that we have a good 
range of skills and experiences on the board of 
Debenhams and this view is conﬁrmed by our 
annual board review process. I would like to convey 
the board’s thanks to Paul Pindar who retired from 
the board during 2010. Particular thanks are due to 
my predecessor John Lovering who served as 
Debenhams’ Chairman for six years. I would also 
like to welcome Mark Rolfe who has joined us as a 
non-executive director very recently and I am sure 
will play an active and constructive role.
It is far from just the board where Debenhams 
beneﬁts from an extraordinary wealth of talent.  
I have met many dedicated, committed people 
throughout the Company – sales advisors, store 
managers, buyers and merchandisers, head ofﬁce 
personnel – who work extremely hard to make our 
Company successful. On behalf of the board I 
would like to thank them all for their valuable 
contribution, especially through a year of structural 
change in a challenging market environment 
where getting it right has involved so much hard 
work from everyone. Section 2

increased signiﬁcantly. Further, sterling deteriorated 
against the US dollar – a key currency for sourcing in 
many parts of the world, especially China – in the 
autumn of 2009 and spring of 2010, reaching a  
low in May 2010, subsequent to which it has seen 
some recovery.
There were some clear peaks and troughs in terms 
of trading levels through the year. The year started 
well in autumn 2009 but warmer weather in October 
impacted outerwear sales. The peak trading season 
in November and December held up reasonably 
well. There were concerns over the impact of snow 
on the post-Christmas sale but in the event these 
proved to be unfounded. The early summer was 
impacted by the World Cup and customer caution 
ahead of the new government’s emergency budget 
but trading levels recovered to more normal levels in 
July and August. The Republic of Ireland continued 
to be a tough market throughout the year but 
activity levels appear to have stabilised after several 
quarters of decline.
Performance Highlights
Overall, we were pleased with the performance of 
the business in 2010. We said at the outset that it 
was a year of structural change following the 
extensive shift in the sales mix during the last quarter 
of 2009 and therefore a year when we would judge 
the business on proﬁt rather than sales. This was 
borne out in the results for the year which saw 
headline proﬁt before tax increase by 20.6 per cent 
over the prior year to £151.0 million (note: headline 
proﬁt before tax is after adding back £5.7 million  
of amortisation of capitalised bank fees and 
exceptional items of £5.4 million).
Market Conditions
The retail environment remained challenging 
throughout 2010, continuing the cautious trends of 
2009. Consumers were unsettled by downbeat 
ﬁnancial and economic news from around the 
world which had a direct impact on spending 
decisions on the high street. Consumer conﬁdence 
data suggests that consumers were more optimistic 
in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year, reaching a peak 
for the period in February, before falling away in  
the second half (source: Nationwide Consumer 
Conﬁdence Index). On a more positive note, interest 
rates remained low in the UK meaning many 
consumers with mortgages still enjoyed some level 
of higher disposable income which to a certain 
extent offset concerns over unemployment and 
government ﬁnances.
Overall, the total clothing market by value increased 
by 1.3 per cent during 2010. However, this appears  
to have been a function of price increases rather 
than underlying market growth. Average selling 
prices increased by 4.0 per cent whilst volumes 
decreased by 2.7 per cent (source for all data: 
Kantar Worldpanel Fashion 24 weeks market share 
data to 5 September 2010 vs 2009). The increase in 
selling prices accelerated as the year progressed, 
driven by a number of factors, most notably higher 
cost prices in the supply chain, as well as an increase 
in VAT from January 2010. A poor cotton harvest in a 
number of countries led to sharp increases in raw 
cotton prices during 2010 which in turn increased 
the cost of cotton fabrics. Synthetic fabric prices also 
increased. There were capacity concerns in some 
countries such as Bangladesh, which experienced 
some high-proﬁle labour relations issues too. Labour 
costs were also increasing in other countries, most 
notably in parts of China. In addition, freight prices

pleased with the 
performance of  
the business

Product Strategy
The aim of our product strategy is to ensure we have 
the right products available for customers to buy at 
the right time and at the right price. In a crowded 
high street, it is our product strategy that offers a 
point of difference through our unique mix of own 
bought and concession brands.
Over the last 18 months we have been pursuing  
a product strategy that focuses on own bought 
brands – principally private label and Designers  
at Debenhams – rather than concession brands. 
Own bought brands are attractive because they 
generate higher margins than concessions and 
allow us total control over product ranges. For 2010, 
own bought sales accounted for 80.2 per cent of 
total sales (excluding Magasin). Whilst own bought 
sales will vary by store – brand new stores are already 
at over 90 per cent own bought whereas larger, 
older stores will always have a higher concession 
mix – our medium-term target for the whole estate  
is 85 per cent own bought sales, 15 per cent 
concession sales.
Towards the end of 2009, we converted 530,000 
square feet of trading space from concessions to 
own bought. This space increase was achieved in a 
number of ways. First, several new own bought 
brands were introduced, including Mantaray and 
Butterﬂy by Matthew Williamson in womenswear and 
Bluezoo in childrenswear. Secondly, some existing 
brands were extended into other categories, such as 
There was progress on the sales line too,  
with gross transaction value up by 9.6 per cent 
including Magasin du Nord (“Magasin”), the Danish 
department store group acquired during the course 
of the year, and by 1.4 per cent excluding Magasin. 
Like-for-like sales for the year were ﬂat. We said 
throughout the year that like-for-like sales in 2010 
would be impacted by some 1.5 per cent due to our 
strategy of improving gross margins by increasing 
the penetration of own bought sales which involved 
the conversion of over 530,000 square feet of trading 
space from concessions to own bought in the fourth 
quarter of 2009.
Market share gains were made in menswear and 
childrenswear increasing by 50 basis points and 20 
basis points respectively to 5.1 per cent and 3.9 per 
cent. Our overall fashion share increased by 20 basis 
points to 4.6 per cent. Womenswear share was 
impacted by lower sales densities arising out of last 
year’s sales moves and as a result is unchanged at 
5.5 per cent. This impact will fall away as we move 
into the ﬁrst quarter of 2011. (Source for market share 
data: Kantar Worldpanel Fashion 24 weeks’ market 
share data to 5 September 2010 vs. 2009.)
The multi-channel business continued to grow with 
Debenhams Direct sales up 88.4 per cent to £103.8 
million. Much of this growth was driven by our 
ongoing strategy of integrating the store business 
with the online business.
Strategy for Growth: Progress and Plans
Debenhams has a clear strategy for growth which is 
based around four key themes:

further additions to the designer portfolio, building 
on the success of Ben de Lisi’s home launch in 
autumn/winter 2009. House and Home by Lisa 
Stickley arrived in store towards the end of the year. 
Lisa is a specialist home designer who has created 
a fresh, quirky and witty collection for the kitchen, 
breakfast and dinner table and bedroom. Butterﬂy 
Home by Matthew Williamson was introduced at the 
same time, the ﬁrst home collection anywhere from 
the hugely successful catwalk designer. Matthew’s 
home collection stays true to his daring approach  
to colour and pattern, inspired by cultures around 
the world.
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on own 
bought brands, both private label and Designers at 
Debenhams, working towards our 85 per cent target. 
New launches include a new menswear brand  
Fit For Purpose (F.F.P.) which targets 20-35 year old 
male customers, a new development in Designers  
at Debenhams called Edition and a new range  
from Julien Macdonald called Diamond. Women’s 
footwear brand Faith will also be relaunched as an 
own bought brand.

New Stores
Although Debenhams has been a feature on the 
British high street for over 200 years, the store portfolio 
is still relatively immature with 148 department stores 
and 13 of our small format Desire stores in the UK 
and the Republic of Ireland and six department 
stores in Denmark. In addition, there are 60 
international franchise stores in 23 countries. We 
generate strong returns on new stores and believe 
increasing the size of the store portfolio is a good use 
of shareholders’ money. In total, we believe there 
are  up to 240 locations which could support a 
Ben de Lisi from womenswear into homeware. Finally, 
existing brands increased their footprint in existing 
stores and/or were introduced into additional stores. 
In 2010, we have focused on consolidating the 
space moves as well as moving the strategy forward 
by introducing further new own bought brands.
High street favourite Principles was relaunched in 
conjunction with designer Ben de Lisi for spring/ 
summer 2010. Principles had been a successful 
concession in Debenhams but fell into administration 
in 2009 after several years of declining sales. We 
subsequently acquired the brand which led to it 
returning to the high street exclusively in 125 
Debenhams stores as Principles by Ben de Lisi.  
Since launch, Principles has gone from strength to 
strength and for autumn/winter 2010 will be 
extended to all stores.
Our Designers at Debenhams portfolio entered a 
new market during 2010 with the launch of H! by 
Henry Holland for young fashion-focused customers 
in the 16-24 age bracket. We know these customers 
already shop in Debenhams because they buy 
young fashion concession brands and cosmetics 
and so an extensive PR and social media campaign 
accompanied the launch of H! speciﬁcally aimed to 
appeal to the brand’s young target customers.
Increasing the penetration of Designers at 
Debenhams has been a key focus in the home 
department over the past couple of years. In difﬁcult 
economic times when the property market is slow, 
many people look to refresh their homes with new 
accessories and co-ordinates rather than move 
house or undertake major refurbishment projects. 
This plays very much to the strengths of Designers at 
Debenhams for the home. To this end, 2010 has seen

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Debenhams’ city centre store 
in Manchester has recently 
undergone a multi-million 
pound refurbishment to bring it 
up to the standard of a ﬂagship 
store (above and right).
Store Refurbishments
With the slowing of the store pipeline – generally due 
to circumstances beyond Debenhams’ control – we 
are focusing on refurbishing some of our older core 
stores to improve their performance. As with new 
stores, refurbished stores generate strong returns on 
capital, with the current wave expected to generate 
20-25 per cent return on capital. There are two  
main refurbishment formats. The ﬁrst is ﬂagship 
refurbishments which we undertake in large city 
centre heritage stores and market ownership stores 
(i.e. where Debenhams is the only department store 
in a town or city). The programme of works includes 
new ﬂooring, new lighting, a new cosmetics hall 
including new house builds and new services such 
as a new food offer. The average cost of a ﬂagship 
refurbishment is £25 per sq ft and the work takes 
around 120 days. Other stores undergo a store 
upgrade, which focuses on improved space 
utilisation and a visual make-over. These 
refurbishments cost some £20 per sq ft and take 
around 90 days to complete.
In 2010, we undertook ﬂagship refurbishments  
in Glasgow and Manchester (both city centre 
heritage stores) and store upgrades in Swindon and 
Bristol. We have seen good uplifts in terms of sales 
and margins following the completion of each  
of these projects. In 2011, ﬁve major refurbishments 
will be undertaken in time for peak trading,  
namely Leeds City Centre, Merryhill, Milton Keynes, 
Portsmouth and Romford. In the second half of the 
year, refurbishments are planned for another ﬁve 
stores. In total, some 40 stores remain to be 
refurbished and we aim to complete these over the 
next three or four years.
department store in the UK and Ireland and 100 
which could support a Desire store. There is also the 
possibility to add two or three additional stores in 
Denmark and there are many opportunities for new 
international franchise stores,
In 2010, six new stores were opened in the UK. This 
comprised three department stores and three Desire 
stores. The new department stores were a ﬂagship 
store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne (February 2010, 
128,000 sq ft), Carmarthen (April 2010, 59,000 sq ft) 
and Bury, Greater Manchester (July 2010, 71,000 
sq  ft). The new Desire stores were Kidderminster 
(September 2009, 22,000 sq ft), Witney (October 
2009, 14,000 sq ft) and Monks Cross, York (October 
2009, 24,000 sq ft). In addition, Debenhams acquired 
six stores in Denmark through the acquisition of 
Magasin du Nord which completed in January 2010, 
adding 897,000 sq ft. In total, total trading space 
increased by 1,204,000 sq ft in 2010 (after the closure 
of two external locations totalling 11,000 sq ft), giving 
a year-end total of 12,250,000 sq ft, an increase of 
10.9 per cent. Average new space increased by 8.8 
per cent.
Looking to the future, the new store opening  
pipeline has inevitably been impacted by recent 
economic turmoil which has seen a number of 
shopping centre developments in the UK become 
delayed or cancelled. As a result, in 2011 we will 
open two new department stores comprising Bath, 
which opened in September 2010, and Wakeﬁeld 
which is currently scheduled to open in May 2011. 
Further out, there are another 30 contracted or 
possible new store openings.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Amongst the 11 new 
international franchise stores 
opened during 2010 was our

expertise which will again allow it to become more 
price competitive as well as increasing margins. 
Overall, we believe that Magasin’s gross margin, 
which was 32.7 per cent in 2010, will increase by  
500-600 basis points over the medium term which 
will result in its EBITDA margin improving to double- 
digit level over the same time period. We have  
been pleased with the performance of Magasin 
since acquisition. Danish customers are responding 
favourably to the Debenhams’ product ranges 
introduced so far and the performance of the stores 
which have introduced the most Debenhams’ 
merchandise have improved from the worst-
performing stores in the portfolio to the best.
Going forward, we will continue to execute our plans 
for Magasin and we believe it will contribute some 
£13-14 million of EBITDA and £7-10 million of proﬁt 
before tax in 2011.
As part of our aim to extend Debenhams’ 
international reach and build global brands 
proﬁtably, we will evaluate other store acquisition 
opportunities as and when they become available. 
We believe there are other department store chains 
in Europe which could beneﬁt from the same 
approach as we have used for Magasin.
International Franchise Stores
A cornerstone of our international strategy is our 
franchise stores which complement owned assets 
such as Magasin. Franchise stores are particularly 
important in distant and emerging markets where 
the local knowledge of our franchise partner is 
crucial for success.
By the end of 2010 we had 60 franchise stores in 23 
countries, a net increase of eight stores during the 
Store Acquisitions
In January 2010, Debenhams completed the 
acquisition of Denmark’s leading department store 
group Magasin du Nord. This comprised six well-
invested department stores including the ﬂagship 
store in central Copenhagen. The acquisition price 
was £6.7 million. The acquisition of Magasin was the 
third acquisition of stores in recent years, following 
Allders and Roches in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Magasin is an iconic retail brand in Denmark. 
However, it had experienced declining proﬁts for a 
number of years, chieﬂy due to an unstable 
ownership structure which left it cash constrained. 
This resulted in a brand mix comprised chieﬂy of  
low gross margin, high price concession and 
consignment brands which led to an unsustainably 
low proﬁt margin. Private label own bought brands 
accounted for less than 5 per cent of total  
sales. Magasin was an attractive acquisition for 
Debenhams for a number of reasons: it was low cost 
and low risk; we had previous sales experience in 
Denmark through our international franchise stores; 
Denmark can be serviced from our UK distribution 
network; and English is widely spoken in Denmark.  
As well as the improvements we believe we can 
make to Magasin itself, this acquisition also creates 
a platform and business model for further expansion 
of internationally owned assets.
Magasin stores are not being rebranded as 
Debenhams, they will retain their current and  
much-loved branding. Instead, we will be focusing 
on widening consumer appeal and increasing  
margins by introducing selected Debenhams 
private label and Designers at Debenhams brands 
into the stores. Magasin will also beneﬁt from 
leveraging Debenhams’ buying and supply chain  Section 2

Another new innovation in our multi-
channel business is Debenhams TV , a suite 
of online videos to provide customers with 
inspiration and advice.
Multi-channel access points: signiﬁcant progress 
was made in this area in 2010 including the 
introduction of instore ordering to all stores and the 
trialling of self-service kiosks, the launch of collect 
from store and international delivery. Most recently, 
an iPhone app and Debenhams TV , our online video 
facility, have been launched. A euro-denominated 
website for the Republic of Ireland will be introduced 
during the ﬁrst half of 2011.
Multi-channel marketing: our aim is to produce clear 
and consistent messaging across our stores and all 
customer communications. We have been using 
e-mail marketing for some time and have been 
actively increasing the size of our marketing 
database in 2010. We have also been seeking to 
improve search engine optimisation and were 
pleased to be ranked number one for UK fashion 
search in the third quarter of 2010 (source: 
Greenlight). We are fully engaged with social media 
such as Facebook and Twitter. 
Easier customer journey: in 2010 we improved page 
layout and navigation on debenhams.com. We also 
introduced a much cleaner and faster checkout 
process. Looking forward, a new web platform will  
be introduced during 2011 which will improve the 
customer journey further.
Content: we want our online content to reﬂect what 
we are famous for instore: in particular Designers at 
Debenhams, health and beauty and gifting. We add 
new products and ranges to debenhams.com all 
the time and our SKU count online increased by 10.4 
per cent during 2010. Going forward, we will be 
year including market entry in Azerbaijan, Egypt, 
Kazakhstan, Malta and Vietnam.
The stores performed well in 2010, although some 
markets were affected by macroeconomic factors.
Over the medium-term we expect the franchise 
portfolio to expand to 100 stores.
Multi-Channel
Debenhams’ multi-channel business has grown 
strongly over the last two years, with Debenhams 
Direct sales up nearly 150 per cent on a two-year 
basis. As a result, debenhams.com has become  
our largest store and we are now in the top ten 
online retailers for both fashion and home.
By 2014, online is expected to inﬂuence 50 per cent 
of all UK non-food sales whether through browsing 
online prior to buying instore, using click and collect 
or reserve, buying online or using instore ordering 
services. We want to engage with our customers  
fully through all these channels and to make them 
relevant, inspiring and convenient.
Our strategy for multi-channel development is 
based on:
 increasing multi-channel access points;
 effective multi-channel marketing;
 an easier customer journey; and
 improving product content and availability.

Summary and Outlook
2010 was a year of structural change for Debenhams 
and we are pleased with the performance of the 
business. Our focus on margin and proﬁt 
improvement has been successful with both gross 
margin and headline proﬁt before tax moving 
ahead strongly.
Looking forward, the outlook for consumer 
conﬁdence over the coming year remains uncertain. 
It is therefore right for us to be cautious in the way we 
plan and manage the business. There is, however, 
much to be optimistic about for Debenhams. The 
beneﬁts of higher own bought sales will continue to 
be evident in 2011 and future years and now that 
the disruption to sales has annualised, we will look to 
move the sales line ahead as well as continuing 
growth in margins and proﬁts. In particular we would 
expect to see some recovery in our womenswear 
market share in 2011. We are conﬁdent that Magasin 
du Nord will deliver on both the ﬁnancial and 
strategic objectives that we set ourselves when we 
ﬁrst looked at acquiring the business. Multi-channel 
will continue to develop into a truly integrated model 
that serves customers not only in our home markets 
but around the world and takes advantage of new 
technology to drive sales. Strong returns and sales 
uplifts from refurbished stores such as Glasgow and 
Manchester will offset any temporary gaps in the 
store opening pipeline. We will continue to generate 
high levels of cash and will also see lower interest 
costs starting from May 2011 when the new bank 
facility commences. All of this will collectively enable 
Debenhams to make further progress in the ﬁnancial 
year ahead and beyond.
increasing our product content in the footwear, 
electrical, furniture and garden categories. In health 
and beauty, a number of top brands will be available 
online by spring/summer 2011 including MAC and 
Bobbi Brown.
Balance Sheet Management
Ensuring our business has a sound capital structure 
remains an important priority.
The balance sheet has been transformed over the 
past two years, including last year’s capital raising 
through the issue of 404 million new shares to raise 
some £300 million and a debt buy-back programme 
which has bought back a total of £91.6 million over 
the past two years at an average discount of 4.2 per 
cent (of which £30.2 million took place in 2010).
Debenhams is a business that produces strong 
cash generation. In 2010, free cash ﬂow before 
exceptional items amounted to £212.3 million, an 
increase of £55.8 million over the prior year.
In July 2010 we announced that Debenhams’ bank 
facilities had been reﬁnanced, well ahead of the 
April 2011 deadline. The new £650 million senior 
facility comprises a £250 million term loan and a 
£400 million revolving credit facility expiring in 
October 2013 with an option to extend to October 
2014. Although the board did not propose a 
dividend for 2010, it is the board’s intention that 
subject to satisfactory trading and economic 
conditions it will return to paying a dividend at the 
interim stage of the new ﬁnancial year (April 2011) 
at an initial dividend cover of around three times. Section 2

2010 Performance Strategy
Chief Executive’s Review continued
GTV is a measure of overall 
sales for the business, including 
concession sales. The board 
believes it is a good guide 
to the overall activity of the 
Company.
GTV grew by 9.6 per cent during 
2010 including the acquisition 
of Magasin du Nord and by  
1.4 per cent excluding Magasin.
Like-for-like sales provides 
a measure of annual sales 
performance from stores that 
have been open for one year 
or more. This metric is therefore 
an indication of organic 
sales growth.
Like-for-like sales were impacted 
in 2010 by the strategy of 
improving gross margin by 
increasing own bought sales 
penetration. This impact is 
estimated to be c.1.5 per cent.
Headline proﬁt before tax is  
the board’s principal measure 
of proﬁtability.
Headline proﬁt before tax 
increased by 20.6 per cent in 
2010. Over the last two years  
it has risen by 37.1 per cent.  
The board believes this is a 
strong performance given the  
difﬁcult trading environment.
A key element of our product 
strategy is to increase the 
own bought sales mix and 
take advantage of the higher 
margins generated by own 
bought sales over concessions.
The extensive space moves 
undertaken at the end of last 
year resulted in this KPI moving 
ahead well in 2010, towards  
our medium-term target of 
85 per cent. (Note: numbers 
exclude Magasin.)
New store openings are the 
biggest driver of trading space. 
Our disciplined approach to 
capital expenditure on new 
stores ensures we generate 
strong returns from new space.
Trading space increased 
by 1,204,000 sq ft in 2010, 
including 897,000 sq ft arising 
out of the acquisition of 
Magasin. In the UK, six new 
stores were opened.
The development of a 
multi-channel business that 
integrates the store and 
Debenhams Direct activities  
is a key part of our strategy  
for growth.
Online sales increased by 88.4 
per cent in 2010 as the beneﬁts 
of multi-channel development 
began to be realised. A host of 
new features and services were 
launched during the year.
Net debt is the KPI used to 
measure balance sheet 
strength. Ensuring the Company 
has an appropriate capital 
structure to support future 
growth is key to our success.
Net debt reduced further in 
2010 in light of strong cash 
generation within the business. 
Overall, net debt has nearly 
halved over the past two years.

Debenhams ﬁrst with disabled model
Groundbreaking News Debenhams
Debenhams became the ﬁrst high street retailer to break with the taboo of using disabled models in campaign photography during 2010. Following an 
approach from Nikki Fox and Natasha Wood, both disability campaigners and presenters of the hit Channel 4 show How To Look Good Naked With A 
Difference, Shannon Murray, who has used a wheelchair since breaking her neck in her teens, appeared in photography in our store windows and online.
Shannon joined three other models – Kate Fullman, a size 16 model, Tess 
Montgomery, a petite model, and Tokumbo Daniel, a size 10 model – in 
imagery to promote the new Principles by Ben de Lisi range. Following the 
huge response, further campaigns using disabled models are planned.
 
Nikki Fox said: “I am so happy and proud that Debenhams has used  
our disabled model for such a massive campaign. It’s a really big deal.  
If seeing Shannon helps another disabled person, then we’ve done well. ”
Gok Wan added: “We in the UK have the best high street in the world. It’s a 
multi-million pound industry that needs to recognise all shapes, sizes and 
disabilities. Filming How To Look Good Naked has been a life-changing 
experience for me, because I have learnt so much about a community I 
knew existed but have never been involved with. Debenhams is pushing 
the boundaries by producing the ﬁrst ever disabled fashion campaign 
in conjunction with How To Look Good Naked and I hope that one day 
disabilities will be recognised by every chain in the high street. ” 19

Size matters
In February 2010 we trialled the 
use of size 16 mannequins in 
our store windows and asked 
customers what they thought. 
Like most retailers, we generally 
use standard size 10 mannequins; 
however, the majority of British 
women are either size 14 or size 16. 
Signage next to the mannequins, 
which were dressed in the newly 
launched Principles by Ben de 
Lisi collection, read “I’m a size 
16, do you want to see more of 
me?” Debenhams routinely stocks 
womenswear up to size 26.
Susan Ringwood, Chief Executive 
of the charity Beat that aims to 
combat eating disorders, said: 
“Women often feel it is their fault 
that clothes don’t look as good 
on them as in the shop window,  
so we congratulate Debenhams 
on taking this initiative. ”

Debenhams unveils beauty untouched
Debenhams
Debenhams broke ranks with the rest of the high street in 2010 by using un-airbrushed photography to launch this summer’s 
swimwear lines. We believe that overuse of some digital technology to create unrealistic body shapes and ﬂawless skin may 
make women feel insecure about their natural looks and size. As a responsible retailer, we want to help our customers make 
the most of their beauty without bombarding them with unattainable body images. We have been canvassing customers’ 
opinions and will use their feedback when creating future campaigns.
Caryn Franklin, fashion 
commentator and broad-
caster, said: “Retailers 
do have the power to 
take a stance on digital 
manipulation. Fashion and 
beauty imagery that is 
honest is absolutely crucial 
for all women to see. I’m 
delighted that Debenhams 
has taken the lead here 
and customer feedback 
will no doubt validate this 
important step. ”

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The newly 
acquired 
Magasin business 
contributed gross 
transaction value 
of £191.1 million.
Costs
Control of costs continues to be a major focus for 
the business. The main cost categories are store 
payroll, store rent, warehousing and distribution 
costs. Store payroll increased in line with new space 
plus inﬂation of 0.5 per cent, less restructure savings, 
to £283.4 million (2009: £258.2 million). Store rent as 
a ratio to gross transaction value was broadly 
maintained at 6.7 per cent (2009: 6.6 per cent) with 
store rent costs of £172.2 million in 2010 compared 
to £154.4 million in the prior year. Warehousing and 
distribution costs increased by 21.6 per cent to 
£55.1 million (2009: £45.3 million) as a result of higher 
levels of activity in the Direct business.
Stocks
Stock levels were kept extremely tight throughout the 
year in light of the difﬁcult trading conditions and 
the focus on maximising cash margin. Although 
total stock units increased by 2.8 per cent, like-for-like 
unit density decreased by 0.3 per cent. Terminal 
stock at the end of the year was 2.6 per cent, an 
historically low level for Debenhams.
Interest
The net interest charge of £49.8 million for the 
ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010 decreased by  
£11.6 million versus the prior year (2009: £61.4 
million). The decrease is due to the reduction in the 
Group’s level of debt.
Exceptional Items
Net exceptional costs (before tax) of £5.4 million 
were recorded in the year. These comprised: an 
exceptional cost of £9.4 million arising out of the 
restructuring of the business in the Republic of 
Ireland which will ensure the business has the ﬂexible 
and right-sized workforce it needs for the future; and 
Sales
Gross transaction value increased during the 52 
weeks to 28 August 2010 by 9.6 per cent including 
Magasin and by 1.4 per cent excluding Magasin. 
Revenue increased by 10.7 per cent including 
Magasin and 5.3 per cent excluding Magasin.  
The primary drivers of sales growth were new 
department stores, new Desire stores and new 
international franchise stores. Like-for-like sales were 
ﬂat on the previous period, reﬂecting not only  
difﬁcult trading conditions but also the impact of 
lower sales densities arising out of the space shift 
from concessions to own bought product ranges 
which took place in the ﬁnal quarter of 2009.
The newly acquired Magasin business contributed 
gross transaction value of £191.1 million.
Debenhams Direct, the online store, saw its gross 
transaction value increase by 88.4 per cent to 
£103.8 million (2009: £55.1 million), a contribution  
to Group gross transaction value of 4.0 per cent.
International franchise stores increased their sales 
by 4.4 per cent from £63.3 million in 2009 to £66.1 
million in 2010.
Gross Margin
Gross margin increased by 70 basis points over the 
previous year including the lower margin Magasin 
business and 160 basis points excluding Magasin. 
This strong performance was driven by the strategy 
of growing cash margin by focusing on product mix 
and gross margin improvement alongside the 
ongoing focus on tight stock control and markdown 
management.

Cash Flow
Net cash generated from operating activities in the 
year to 28 August 2010 was £207.2 million. This was an 
increase of £48.8 million on the previous year (2009: 
£158.4 million). The increase was due to improved 
trading and positive working capital movements.
Borrowings
The Group’s net debt position was £516.8 million  
as at 28 August 2010, a reduction of £73.5 million 
during the course of the year (£590.3 million as at  
29 August 2009). Repayments against borrowings  
of £100.0 million and £75.0 million were made  
in October 2009 and January 2010 respectively.  
In addition, during the year the Group purchased 
debt with a par value of £30.2 million in the market 
at an average discount of 1.3 per cent.
The process of reﬁnancing Debenhams’ debt 
facilities was completed in July 2010, well ahead  
of the scheduled date of April 2011. The new 
£650 million forward start senior facility comprises a 
£250 million term loan and a £400 million revolving 
credit facility expiring in October 2013 with an option 
to extend to October 2014. A proportion of the debt 
has been hedged into ﬁxed rate ﬁnance and as a 
result it is anticipated that the interest cost net of fees 
will fall from c.7.0 per cent in the 2010 ﬁnancial year 
to c.4.5 per cent during the ﬁrst full year of the new 
facility. The new facility becomes effective on the 
cancellation or expiry of the existing facility which is 
scheduled for April 2011. Associated reﬁnancing 
costs of £10.3 million were incurred and will be 
amortised over the life of the new facility, starting  
in April 2011.

Proﬁts
Gross proﬁt for the year increased from £264.9 million

proﬁt increased from £182.2 million to £195.1 million 
before exceptional costs. Proﬁt before tax and 
exceptional items rose by 20.3 per cent to £145.3 
million (2009: £120.8 million). 
Taxation
The Group’s tax charge after exceptional items of 
£42.9 million on a proﬁt after exceptional items of 
£139.9 million gives an effective rate of tax of 30.7 
per cent. 
Earnings
The basic earnings per share of 7.5 pence per share 
(2009: 10.0 pence) and diluted earnings per share 
of 7.5 pence (2009: 10.0 pence) reﬂect the full year 
impact of 404 million ordinary shares issued on 
26 June 2009.
Dividends
The board has not proposed a ﬁnal dividend for 
2010. Subject to satisfactory trading and economic 
conditions, it is the board’s current intention to 
recommence dividends at the interim stage of the 
2011 ﬁnancial year (April 2011). The board expects 
to adopt a policy targeting an initial level of dividend 
cover of three times adjusted earnings per share.
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure increased during the year to 
£98.6 million from £84.5 million in the prior year.  
The increase reﬂects primarily the acquisition of 
Magasin du Nord.

As we continue our annual footprinting process,  
we will endeavour to expand the boundaries and 
improve data accuracy in order to gain a more 
complete picture of our global impact.
A notable new addition to our footprint scope is 
overseas freight operations. Air, sea and road  
freight are critical links in our supply chain and 
understanding their relative footprint is important  
for managing our global environmental impact. 
Another important addition to the footprint is the 
Magasin stores in Denmark. Magasin was acquired 
in 2010 and as our operational procedures  
become embedded, emissions reduction within 
these stores will become core to our overall carbon 
efﬁciency goals.
The results of our 2010 footprint analysis are shown  
in the following table. This also documents the 
percentage changes from our 2009 footprint, 
providing an indication of year-on-year emissions 
performance.
To ensure a consistent approach, our 2009 footprint 
has been recalculated not only to account for the 
inclusion of additional emissions sources but also 
due to the availability of more accurate energy data 
and relevant carbon conversion factors. Magasin 
store emissions have also been retrospectively 
included in our 2009 base year following the 
acquisition of this business. Our recalculated 2009 
footprint now provides the best reference for future 
comparison because emissions are the lowest since 
we began reporting, the footprint boundary is more 
inclusive than in previous years and the reporting 
period is aligned to our ﬁnancial year.
Introduction
As a retail business, Debenhams’ activities can 
impact the lives of millions of people: our customers, 
our employees, the communities in which we 
operate, those who work in the supply chain and 
their own communities. We have a responsibility to 
all these people and to our planet to try to have  
a positive impact upon them and to take their  
needs into account when we make decisions about 
our business.
A cross-functional steering committee meets 
regularly and as a measure of the importance of 
sustainability issues to Debenhams it has now 
become a committee of the board, chaired by 
Martina King, non-executive director.
Our corporate responsibility work falls into three 
main areas. First, Environmental which covers energy 
usage, including Debenhams carbon footprint 
reporting, waste management and recycling. 
Secondly, the Supply Chain which includes our 
factory approval and audit process, our purchasing 
practices and our involvement with the Ethical 
Trading Initiative. The third category is Workplace 
and Community which covers employment 
practices, learning and development, health and 
safety, charitable work and customer engagement.
Environmental
Debenhams Carbon Footprint 2010
At Debenhams we recognise the importance of 
documenting our emissions sources and 
understanding our ongoing impact on the 
environment. The environmental consultancy AEA 
continues to engage with key stakeholders within 
the business to provide an accurate and robust 
footprint that places the environmental impact of 
our key business operations in context.
The table below summarises our headline carbon 
footprint ﬁgures for 2009 and 2010. Figures are provided 
for both the activities included within the 2009 footprint 
scope and the footprint scope in 2010, which now 
includes Magasin stores and overseas freight 
emissions. Although emissions have increased since 
2009, our carbon efﬁciency has remained stable. This 
is determined by the intensity ratios. However, with the 
acquisition of Magasin, our emissions performance 
per £million of turnover has improved since 2009.

How We Account For Our Emissions
We use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology 
to calculate our footprint. Emissions are deﬁned by 
the following scopes:
Scope 1 – direct emissions from emissions sources 
we control.
Scope 2 – indirect emissions from our electricity 
consumption.
Scope 3 – indirect emissions from products and 
services we use but do not control.
W e apply these scope deﬁnitions using an operational 
control approach. This enables us to claim greater

Note: Intensity ratios for 2009 have been recalculated on the basis of 
the updated footprint. The turnover intensity ratio omits the Magasin 
footprint in 2009 and Magasin emissions are included in the 2010 
ratio, although on a pro rata basis to account for only 42 weeks of 
trading under Debenhams. The ﬂoor area intensity ratio is a total of 
UK and Ireland emissions only and Magasin emissions are omitted.
The resulting ratios demonstrate our emissions 
intensity has improved considerably since 2009 in 
line with our ﬁnancial growth and has remained 
stable as our buildings footprint has expanded.  
This highlights our improving carbon efﬁciency as 
we grow our business.
Focus on Store Energy Efﬁciency
Combined electricity emissions from the UK and 
Ireland have increased on an absolute basis by 
3,641 tonnes since 2009. Electricity in these stores 
contributes 81 per cent of our overall footprint and 
therefore is our most signiﬁcant emissions source. 
However, looking in depth at Debenhams’ store 
performance provides a much greater context 
behind the efﬁciency of energy use.
The following table provides the speciﬁc electricity 
use (kWh/m²) in UK and Ireland stores for those  
that were operational for the entire year (this 
prevents any skewing of ﬁgures resulting from store  
openings). A best practice benchmark for electricity 
consumption is also included to provide a basis for 
performance comparison. 
Stores fuel mix 2010 2009 Best practice*
Only electricity 
(kWh/m²) 218 220 209
Mixed fuel (kWh  
electricity/m²) 178 180 194
Best practice benchmark taken from CIBSE Guide F .
The results demonstrate that even though electricity 
emissions have increased, the efﬁciency per unit has 
still improved since 2009. Compared to industry 
benchmarks, it is clear that electricity use in mixed 
fuel stores is more efﬁcient than best practice while 
With our footprint scope broadened to include the 
Magasin stores and overseas freight operations, our 
total 2010 carbon footprint is now 213,847 tonnes 
CO
2
e. This is an increase of 2 per cent (from 210,505 
tonnes) since 2009. Placing the footprint in context 
of UK and Ireland alone gives a 2010 emissions total 
of 192,988 tonnes CO
2
e. This is an increase of 1 per 
cent (from 190,273 tonnes) since 2009. 
Scope 2 electricity emissions continue to dominate 
our carbon footprint, predominantly as a result of 
operating store lighting, air conditioning and other 
mechanical services. These emissions have 
increased by 2 per cent from 2009, largely due to 
growth in UK stores. 
Scope 1 emissions have decreased by 6 per cent 
since 2009, largely due to a 6 per cent reduction in 
emissions from UK road freight and a 4 per cent 
reduction in UK gas consumption.
Documenting emissions from overseas freight for the 
ﬁrst time allows this supply chain activity to be put 
into context of our wider environmental impact. 
When combined, these freight operations account 
for 6 per cent of our global footprint and, at 83 per 
cent, are the largest contributor to our scope 3 
emissions. The overall increase in scope 3 emissions 
of 8 per cent can be largely attributed to increased 
volumes shipped in overseas freight operations but 
also through increased business travel.
Although absolute emissions have increased by 
2 per cent from 2009, part of our environmental 
strategy involves offsetting our carbon emissions 
from electricity consumption by purchasing from 
certiﬁed renewable sources. As a result, this year we 
have indirectly reduced our emissions by 148,936 
tonnes CO
2
e, offsetting our gross carbon footprint by 
70 per cent. This has subsequently reduced our net 
footprint by 29 per cent from 2009 levels. However,  
we still recognise the requirement to reduce our 
direct impact and will continue to focus investment 
on reducing actual electricity consumption. This is 
advantageous for both the environment and for 
reducing our operational and regulatory costs 
of energy.

that energy 
management

in supporting 
business 
objectives.
Performance
Overall our electricity use increased by 2.3 per cent, 
due to the opening of six new stores, the full year 
effect of last year’s new store openings and the 
refurbishment of a number of large stores which 
required additional working hours. Buildings which 
had been open through the year on a like-for-like 
basis achieved a modest energy saving. We believe 
this was a creditable performance given the  
colder, longer winter and the very warm weather  
in early summer, both of which require additional 
energy usage.
New Store Energy Usage
Our target for new stores is to be 30 per cent more 
energy efﬁcient than the average Debenhams store. 
As we improve our energy efﬁciency throughout the 
estate, the target for new stores gets harder in 
absolute terms. In 2009 we achieved our target. In 
2010, we did not do so, largely because the average 
existing Debenhams store has improved its energy 
use. Our new store design is being further improved 
to get back to ensure we meet our target for future 
new stores.
 New Average

Year kWh/sq ft kWh/sq ft Difference
2009 22.4 34.0 34%
2010 22.9 30.3 24%
Renewable Energy
Since October 2008, our UK stores have been 
supplied with 100 per cent renewable electricity 
from a wind farm in Scotland. Stores in the Republic 
of Ireland and Northern Ireland are supplied with 
grid supply electricity that includes a small element 
of renewable sourcing.
In the UK, DECC’s guidance on reporting “green” 
sources and the methodology of reporting under 
the mandatory CRCEES has diminished the  
beneﬁt of buying from truly renewable sources. 
Consequently, from October 2010, most of our 
supplies will switch to good quality combined heat 
and power electricity as their source.
Raising Awareness of Energy Efﬁciency 
for Employees
We have continued to run awareness campaigns 
with individual store targets and rewards. A form of 
Energy Display Certiﬁcate has been used to convey 
information.
the stores that only use electricity are approaching 
best practice. These results provide positive 
reinforcement of our energy efﬁcient approach to 
store operations. However, we will continue to 
endeavour to focus our strategy on reducing 
absolute electricity emissions.
Conclusions
2010 has seen our footprint boundary widen to 
include recently acquired Magasin stores and also 
overseas freight operations. Although total absolute 
emissions have increased by 2 per cent and 3,343 
tonnes in comparison with 2009, our emissions 
intensity ratios demonstrate an improvement in  
our relative emissions performance. Efﬁciency 
improvements are further highlighted through the 
speciﬁc electricity use in UK and Ireland stores. 
Furthermore, due to our increased purchasing of 
green electricity from renewable sources, we have 
reduced our net carbon footprint by 29 per cent 
and 26,563 tonnes CO
2
e since 2009.
Our ongoing focus will be placed on achieving 
absolute emissions reductions across all three 
scopes. As part of this process, we will look to 
establish meaningful reduction targets for our 
core emissions.

Energy Usage
Debenhams’ energy policy recognises that energy 
management plays an important role in supporting 
business objectives, is aware of the link between 
energy use and environmental stress and is 
conscious of the need to control the use of ﬁnite 
resources. We have recently updated this policy  
to reﬂect our wider corporate responsibility remit  
and our participation in Carbon Reduction 
Commitment. Section 2

to backhauling waste to the DC, all stores also action 
some form of recycling using multi-stream recovery 
units. In 2010 we narrowly missed our target for  
98 per cent of DC waste to be recycled, achieving  
a 97.7 per cent recycling rate (2009: 98.4 per cent). 
We are conﬁdent that we have the systems and 
processes in place to meet the target next year.
Transport and Logistics
Debenhams’ logistics ﬂeet within the UK and Ireland 
is operated by DHL.
In 2010, the fuel usage for delivering products  
from our DC network to our stores decreased by  
6.3 per cent, despite increases in both miles driven 
(up 1.6 per cent) and volume of product delivered 
(up 0.7 per cent). This was achieved through the use 
of Isotrak vehicle tracking and engine management 
monitoring to assess the performance of every 
vehicle and driver in the ﬂeet.
Print Operations
The Debenhams print department is registered to 
use FSC and PEFC paper to produce certiﬁed printed 
material. These standards provide assurance that 
the timber content of the paper is sourced from a 
legal and sustainable source. Since 2008, the print 
department (which trades as Magenta Print & 
Display) has been certiﬁed to ISO14001: 2004 
environmental management system certiﬁcation. 
This demanding, internationally recognised standard 
ensures that we can be conﬁdent that all the work 
undertaken by the department is produced in such 
a way that the environmental impact of production 
is minimised.
A major objective has been to reduce emissions to 
air through a programme of solvent reduction. In line 
with printing industry best practice, new working 
methods have led to a total elimination of IPA 
(alcohol) for all printing undertaken within the 
department, which has led to a 35 per cent 
decrease in VOC (solvent) emissions. 
Supply Chain
Ethical Sourcing
An important part of our sourcing strategy is the 
concept of “right product, right country”. Through 
this, we endeavour to source products in the 
appropriate countries. Our commitment is to ensure 
our products are made in factories which are both 
socially ethical and quality assurance compliant. 
Under the banner of “Do the Right Thing”, store 
targets have been published and regular feedback 
on performance with ideas on how to minimise 
waste have been published.
Carbon Reduction Commitment –  
Energy Efﬁciency Scheme (CRCEES)
As we use more than 6,000 MWh/year of electricity, 
we are included in this mandatory league table 
scheme. Our registration was completed in May 
2010. Our ﬁrst footprint and annual report will be 
produced to meet the Scheme’s timetable in 
June 2011.
During the ﬁrst year of the Scheme, success in the 
league table depends on two “early action” metrics. 
The ﬁrst is gaining the Carbon Trust Standard (CTS) 
– an externally moderated assessment of our energy 
efﬁciency progress – and the second relates to 
progress in installing voluntary “smart” meters to our 
minor electricity and gas supplies. Work is in progress 
to achieve the CTS and install as many “smart” 
meters as is possible within the limits of present 
technology and cost effectiveness.
2011 Energy Reduction Projects
It is our intention to increase our investment in cost-
effective energy reduction projects. Our plan is to 
concentrate on upgraded lighting and temperature 
controls to ensure a comfortable shopping and 
working environment for our customers and staff 
whilst reducing our energy bills and pollution.
Waste Recycling
Debenhams is committed to reducing the amount 
of waste generated by its activities. We seek to  
divert as much waste away from landﬁll as possible 
through a number of recycling schemes.
In 2010 the volume of recyclable materials handled 
at the Peterborough Distribution Centre (DC) from 
both stores and the DC network increased to 6,043 
tonnes, an increase of 581 tonnes or 11 per cent 
over last year. This reﬂects the beneﬁts of our 
investment in  an additional cardboard baler at 
Peterborough which has allowed additional waste 
volumes to be backhauled from our stores to the DC.
Waste studies have shown that the amount of waste 
passed to landﬁll as a result of implementing 
backhauling drops by as much as 80 per cent as 
the bulk of store waste is card and plastic. In addition

with our suppliers and their factories. The process of 
identifying non-compliance throughout our supply 
chain allows us to ﬁlter and reject as necessary. No 
purchase orders can be placed with a new factory 
until it has been approved by Debenhams’ 
Compliance Team and a code reference has been 
made “live” in order to activate an order.
As well as the ethical social compliance audit, part 
of the factory set-up approval process also includes 
a review of documentation and policies to verify 
fundamental Quality Assurance practices are in 
place for each factory. It is now mandatory that a 
Debenhams-speciﬁc technical audit must be 
conducted by SGS before a factory can be 
considered for approval. The technical audit  
veriﬁes: the practices described by the supplier; 
documentation of safety policies and procedures; 
process ﬂow; and the manufacturer’s suitability to 
produce the required product type. For our existing 
supply chain, we randomly request technical audits 
by SGS to support documentation already held  
and visits made by Debenhams’ supply chain 
management team also check that due diligence  
is adhered to.
In 2010, we rejected 86 factories from coming into 
the business for not meeting our compliance 
requirements and Code of Conduct. 272 factories 
were approved as new suppliers.
In addition to the review and assessment of new 
factories, supply chain management continues to 
review and deactivate factories that are no longer 
manufacturing our own bought product.
Our core hub areas account for over three-quarters 
of our business. The two largest areas are China and 
India where 98 per cent of our factories are audited 
with the balance work-in-progress as part of our 
ongoing programme. 97 per cent of our factories in 
Bangladesh, the UK and Turkey are audited with the 
remaining 3 per cent being new factories that are 
currently in the auditing process. All third-party  
audits continue to be unannounced, within a given 
two-week window, and unannounced visits by 
Debenhams’ senior management are a regular 
occurrence. Currently over 50% of our factory audits 
are less than a year old from the date of the actual 
audit, the balance are conducting re-audits and 
fresh audits.
Our suppliers and manufacturers are required to 
adhere to our Code of Conduct and their 
compliance is regularly monitored to ensure that all 
employees involved in the manufacture of products 
for Debenhams work in a well-maintained, safe and 
caring environment. We believe our customers have 
a right to expect every product we sell to be 
produced in a safe and free environment, be 
compliant with our Code of Conduct and that all 
employees are treated with dignity, not exploited or 
discriminated against in any way.
Ethical Trading Initiative
Debenhams has been a member of the Ethical 
Trading Initiative (ETI) since 2001. The ETI was 
established in 1989 and is a tri-partite alliance of 
companies, non-governmental organisations (such 
as Oxfam, Labour Behind The Label and Fair Labour 
Organisation) and trade unions (such as the Leather 
and Textile Federation). It aims to improve the lives 
of workers in global supply chains by promoting 
responsible corporate practices that support this 
goal. The ETI is funded by member contributions and 
a grant from the UK Department of International 
Development. As a corporate member, Debenhams 
works with the ETI and is involved in various activities 
and projects.
Factory Approval and Audit
Debenhams continues to develop and strengthen 
its robust supplier and factory approval process by 
regular monitoring and assessment of its processes 
and functions. The level of data collection and 
analysis for each factory is comprehensive and 
allows us to analyse the performance of our suppliers 
and identify trends.
As part of the approval process, it is a pre-requisite 
that an ethical social compliance audit, conducted 
by our nominated monitoring partner, Société 
Générale de Surveillance (SGS), is submitted for 
review before approval is given to a supplier’ s factory.
We require SGS to use the speciﬁc “SMETA” audit  
tool which is recognised by the ETI, NGOs and other 
retail members of the ETI. This audit tool requires a 
standardised approach with set rules, therefore giving 
us maximum continuity within our programme. It is 
important to note that we do not pass or fail existing 
factories; our approach is the ongoing monitoring of 
factory compliance and supplier practices to 
maintain the highest standards, working together  Section 2
The Business

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Purchasing Practices
We believe that one of the best ways to ensure our 
ethical sourcing goals are met is to embed them 
into the purchasing process. Otherwise, as noted in 
reports by Oxfam, Cafod and Acona, purchasing 
practices can undermine the effectiveness and 
impact of ethical trading programmes by 
inadvertently restricting suppliers’ abilities to uphold 
labour standards. Our company process review 
continues to analyse our end-to-end processes 
in depth and further changes have been made 
to  our purchasing practices in 2010 as a result. 
We  have also continued our “expert” training sessions 
on the elements of ethical auditing and pre-factory 
set up processes, which all employees can attend.  
In addition to this, the standard Debenhams 
induction for all new staff includes an in-depth 
overview of our procedures and requirements.  
We are also continuing to run our London College  
of Fashion buying school programme.
Throughout the course of 2010 brieﬁng sessions with 
all our buying teams have taken place to reiterate 
our requirements, standards and overall ethical 
trading position and policies. Part of these training 
sessions speciﬁcally covers the importance of 
purchasing practices, the impact unplanned 
changes and/or delayed decision making can 
have on the employees in the factories 
manufacturing our products. The process review is 
being driven by the supply chain management 
team, with nominated buying and merchandising 
“champions” to drive progress throughout the 
business. As part of the ETI purchasing practice 
project we met with an NGO called SPYM (Society 
for the Promotion of Youth and Masses) last June in 
India with our Indian partner and two key suppliers 
already producing hand-embellished products for 
Debenhams. We discussed our next steps for further 
development of our purchasing practices work, with 
continuing focus on handwork predominantly in the 
manufacture of womenswear and home products. 
This is an ongoing project with the training of women 
in local communities providing them with an 
opportunity to work close to home, learn a skill, earn 
money to help support their families and in time 
gain an “artisan” card.
As a result of reviewing the audit ﬁndings, corrective 
action plans are tracked and monitored with our 
suppliers and factories. Time scales for remediation 
of corrective actions are agreed, working closely 
with our suppliers to deliver the required 
improvements, which is globally supported with SGS.
Following management’s visits to overseas factories 
to review compliance, we continue to send 
donations of new toys to crèche facilities at factories. 
In 2010 we again have sent toys to children in India, 
China and Bangladesh.
Decent Work Project
Over the past two years we have been working with 
one of our major suppliers in China in a project with 
the ETI called Decent Working Practices. This pilot 
project is proving to be successful and is the ﬁrst 
time any tri-partite group has successfully rolled out 
such a project. The ETI, Wintop of China (our  
partner manufacturer) and China Women’s Working 
Network (a Hong Kong-based NGO) are working 
together with union collaboration from Hong Kong 
and academics from the Hong Kong University.  
The main aims of the project are to establish a 
mechanism for sustainable employee labour and 
management dialogue within the factory to seek 
ways to improve the work environment according to 
the practical circumstances of the factory and the 
expectations of various parties.
The ﬁrst employee elections took place in November 
2009. The successful candidates have been 
representing their fellow employees throughout the 
year. The next elections are due to take place in 
November 2010. The objectives are to seek ways to 
improve the work environment, to increase the 
employees’ participation and awareness of the 
labour law and occupational health and safety and 
to build their conﬁdence and ability to solve labour 
management issues. It also helps to strengthen 
employees’ approval and commitment to the 
factory, reducing labour turnover, which in the 
current climate is extremely important due to the 
lack of skilled workers and labour shortages, 
particularly in the southern part of China.
The project learnings have been shared with other 
ETI members, NGOs and unions and will continue to 
evolve into 2011 with further development for 
continuing projects, which we hope to encourage 
further into our Chinese supply chain.

Workplace and Community
Our People
Debenhams had an average of 27,750 employees 
during 2010 (2009 average: 26,800) in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland. We are pleased to be able to 
continue creating new jobs around the UK as we 
open new stores in cities such as Newcastle-upon-
Tyne which now employs nearly 250 people in the 
store. In addition, Magasin du Nord employs some 
1,200 people in Denmark.
Labour turnover for the UK and Republic of Ireland 
improved slightly from 29.7 per cent in 2009 to 28.6 
per cent in 2010 as some of the positive steps we 
have taken to increase employee retention offset an 
improved labour market.
Gender
 
Length of service
We are always keen to celebrate long service with 
Debenhams. For example, the Banbury store 
celebrated its tenth birthday by holding a 
champagne breakfast for the 20 employees who 
have worked at the store since its opening.
Debenhams is committed to ensuring that every 
individual connected with the Company – whether 
employee, applicant, customer or other third party 
– receives fair and equitable treatment, regardless 
of  their differences. These include but are not 
restricted to:
  gender;

their complex roles and to identify routes to gaining 
knowledge or experience that may be missing. 
Given our extensive growth over recent years, 
opportunities for projects, new store openings, the 
integration of acquired businesses both in the UK 
and abroad have presented many store managers 
with the chance to develop and demonstrate new 
skills. Design Your Future encourages them to bring 
these experiences together and reﬂect on them, 
before determining their future hopes and 
aspirations. Following the launch, every store 
manager has designed a development plan and 
reviewed their portfolio of experiences with their 
regional sales director.
In addition, a small group of high-potential store 
managers and senior store managers have 
embarked on an intensive Design Your Future 
training programme intended to fast track their 
development and support Debenhams’ continued 
organic growth.
Nikki Zamblera, HR Director, has served for many 
years on the board of Skillsmart Retail, the skills  
sector for the council for the industry. Following  
the formation of the Skillshop Network in April 2009, 
Debenhams was very pleased to become the ﬁrst 
national retailer to begin a Retail Skills qualiﬁcation 
trial with the Skillshop network.
Using competencies already mapped to the roles of 
sales advisor and senior sales advisor and working 
with Skillshop, the trial involved 11 stores across 
England offering consistent qualiﬁcations at NVQ 
Retail Skills level 2. Seven more stores have 
subsequently been added and the qualiﬁcation 
has been extended to supervisors wishing to gain  
an NVQ Retail Skills level 3 qualiﬁcation. In less than  
a year we have over 500 learners who have either 
earned their qualiﬁcation or are in the process of 
gaining it. On job coaching and assessment has 
impacted positively on motivation and morale and 
the partnership with Skillshop means that internal 
resources have not been stretched beyond their 
means. Soft measures are easy to gauge but hard 
measures are there too. In 10 out of 11 trial stores 
labour turnover is lower per NVQ trainee than store 
average and absence is substantially lower.  
On average, absenteeism in the trial stores was  
2.4 per cent amongst the NVQ population 
compared with 5.0 per cent for the store average 
and labour turnover was 4.2 per cent for NVQ 
Debenhams welcomes applications for employment 
from disabled people. As part of our policy on 
equality of opportunity, decisions on recruitment, 
training, promotion, pay, terms and conditions and 
leavers are based solely on objective, job-related 
criteria and personal competence and 
performance. We seek wherever possible to make 
reasonable adjustments to ensure that an employee 
who becomes disabled during the course of his or 
her employment is able to continue working 
effectively. This includes: providing equipment or 
altering working arrangements; providing additional 
training; reallocating on a temporary or permanent 
basis some of the employee’s duties to other 
members of staff; transferring the employee to a 
suitable alternative role; and adjusting working 
times. Any such adjustment will be monitored and 
reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it continues  
to be effective.
Debenhams is a member of the Employers’ Forum 
on Disability which seeks to enable companies to 
become disability conﬁdent by making it easier to 
recruit and retain disabled employees and to serve 
disabled customers.
Learning and Development
We have a long-established reputation for 
developing our people and are very proud that  
the majority of management appointments are 
made from within the business.
Skills, internal progression and opportunities for 
people to develop new capabilities and realise their 
potential have always been important to us and this 
year we have embarked on two major initiatives:
  Design Y our Future – a programme for Store 
Managers; and
  a pioneering project to provide qualiﬁcations 
for employees in stores.
Launched at the annual Store Manager Conference 
in April 2010, Design Your Future is a development 
programme that ﬁrmly puts the responsibility for 
growth and progression in the hands of the 
individual. A diagnostic tool kit gives current store 
managers and future store managers the 
opportunity to map and identify gaps in their 
experiences. It helps them to map out and value  
the practical knowledge gained in all the aspects of

recognised, large or small. Our Celebrating Success 
policy encourages managers and colleagues to 
acknowledge the efforts of others and each year 
culminates in the annual Celebrating Success 
Awards where the best of the best are honoured for 
their outstanding achievement in customer service 
or behind the scenes.
This year, once again annual winners from every 
store and each head ofﬁce division spent the day 
relaxing at Alton Towers before being joined by the 
executive directors and other senior managers for 
an evening of celebration and recognition.
Health and Safety
Information on Debenhams’ health and safety policies 
and procedures can be found at the Corporate 
Responsibility section of www.debenhamsplc.com.
In 2010, a key focus for health and safety training 
was the topic of slips and falls which was the subject 
of this year’s annual health and safety week in  
June. By undertaking a comprehensive review of 
incidents, we were able to determine training  
needs for all store employees, including the 
participation of our concession partners and our 
contract cleaning teams.
The maintenance of safety standards and the 
performance of key health and safety tasks form a 
major part of the risk management review. The 
outcome and remedial actions required after risk 
management inspections are followed up by the 
store manager, regional sales director and the risk 
management team. The results of the risk review 
programme indicate an improving store 
performance on matters of health and safety (as 
indicated below).

Anne Seaman, Chief Executive of Skillsmart Retail 
Limited, said: “We are delighted that Debenhams 
has taken the initiative to be the ﬁrst national retailer 
to use the services of the National Skills Academy for 
Retail’s network of retail skills shops which have 
delivered retail qualiﬁcations to their employees. 
Already the beneﬁts of providing qualiﬁcations can 
be seen in the reduction of labour turnover and 
absenteeism. ”
One of our store managers commented:“We have 
noticed a marked improvement in our staff’s 
conﬁdence and business awareness and those 
who are taking part in the qualiﬁcations are offering 
a more professional approach to the business. ” 
The participants themselves are equally enthusiastic. 
One said: “In the future I may want to progress to 
Supervisor. Getting a qualiﬁcation has whetted my 
appetite. ” Another commented: “I now feel more 
conﬁdent and realise my job has many facets I have 
previously taken for granted. Since completing my 
qualiﬁcation I have taken a vital role in the store 
training team, training new starters, using my skills to 
help others. ”
At Debenhams we are now convinced that gaining 
a Retail Skills qualiﬁcation helps individuals to 
enhance their retail skills, develop their knowledge 
and understanding of the business and most 
importantly boosts the conﬁdence and aspirations 
of those who achieve them. As a result, an 
apprenticeship trial is now under way.
Employee Consultation Forum (ECF)
The ECF is a group of elected representatives from  
all areas of the business that meets annually  
with members of the board. The purpose of these 
meetings is to allow our employees the opportunity 
to receive information about Debenhams and to be 
consulted on certain parts of our business activities. 
The representatives elected by stores also meet 
during the year on a local basis to discuss regional 
business issues and to prepare for the national 
annual meeting.

Through our food services division we are a supporter 
of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity. We fully 
support the great work they do, helping people with 
severe allergens and persuading the food industry 
(including catering) of the need to provide detailed 
and accurate allergen information.
We also encourage our employees to support 
charities and since 1999 have worked with Hands 
on Helping supporting the Give As You Earn scheme. 
We now have around 6 per cent of Debenhams 
employees who participate in the scheme.
We support many other charities on a local level 
including medical charities, children’s charities, 
animal charities and a host of local and community 
groups. Amongst those we helped in 2010 were the 
Haiti earthquake appeal, Children First, Dress for 
Success, Macmillan Cancer Support and Wellbeing 
of Women.
In 2010 Debenhams personal shoppers have been 
helping people on the Life Skills Programme. The 
unique partnership between Quintessentially, the 
world’s leading private members’ club and 
concierge service, and The House of St Barnabas,  
a charity supporting the homeless, is guiding those 
affected by homelessness through the acquisition 
and development of life-changing skills. As part of 
their graduation week, all 14 volunteers had a 
personal shopping appointment at Debenhams 
Oxford Street for expert advice on what to wear to 
an interview. We also donated a full outﬁt to each 
volunteer as a graduation present to set them on 
their way to successful careers.
Debenhams Retirement Association (DRA)
The DRA is a registered charity established to provide 
help and support to any of the retired employees in 
receipt of pension who need assistance. There are 
currently over 5,000 pensioners and the charity 
keeps in touch with them using a network of 
pensioner support ofﬁcers who each cover speciﬁc 
areas of the UK. Helplines are provided for those  
in need and funds/grants are available to 
pensioners to buy essential items or in emergency 
circumstances.
The main source of funding is a donation from the 
Company but many stores and head ofﬁce 
departments hold fundraising events for the DRA. 
Reportable Accidents/Incidents in 2010
 
Charities and Community Work
Debenhams is a strong supporter of charities at 
both a national and local level.
Our key national charity is Breast Cancer Campaign 
which we have supported for ten years, raising over  
£2.3 million to date through the sale of special 
products and in-store events. Our main fundraising 
event for 2010 was “Cycle To The Moon” which saw 
store employees and customers aim to cycle the 
225,622 miles distance to the moon during the 
month of October (meaning each store had to 
cycle 47 miles every day). This complemented 
other  activities including a range of exclusive 
T-shirts  designed by Designers at Debenhams 
Jasper Conran, Betty Jackson, Julien Macdonald,  
John Rocha and Matthew Williamson. For 2011, we 
are increasing our fundraising activities for Breast 
Cancer Campaign and are aiming to raise 
£1 million. The theme for the year will be “Step On It” 
which involves a series of walks 46,000 steps long – 
one for each person diagnosed with breast cancer 
in the UK each year.
Another key charity is NSPCC for whom stores raised 
over £225,000 over Christmas 2009 at events 
including those linked to the arrival of Santa Claus 
in store.
Our clothing brand Mantaray continues to be a 
proud supporter of the Marine Conservation Society 
(MCS). Our support for the MCS’s work for clean 
seas, sustainable ﬁsheries and protected sealife is 
not just ﬁnancial. We are also helping in more 
practical ways by encouraging employees and 
customers to take part in voluntary beach cleans 
and surveys, helping to clear the UK’s beaches of the 
tide of litter currently endangering the life of coastal 
wildlife such as seabirds, dolphins, porpoises and 
marine turtles.

“much better” than other retailers they shop at.
76,955 customers said that a member of staff went 
above and beyond their expectation, and we also 
had the opportunity to rescue 2,777 dissatisﬁed 
customers.
59 per cent of customers opted in to receive future 
email promotions adding to our marketing database.
Next ﬁnancial year we will extend the customer 
experience programme to debenhams.com and to 
Magasin stores.
As well as seeking their views, it is equally important 
for us to seek ways to make our customers feel good 
about themselves when so much of the fashion 
business focuses on body shapes and lifestyles 
which are very different from reality for the majority 
of our customers. We have been at the forefront of 
several high-proﬁle campaigns in 2010 which have 
really pushed the boundaries. You can read about 
these on pages 18 to 19. Another new initiative 
launched in September 2010 is The Style List, a 
pioneering campaign featuring models in their  
40s, 50s and 60s. We have teamed up with fashion 
commentator and inclusivity campaigner Caryn 
Franklin to provide an informative fashion destination 
for women who are 40+.
Getting People Back to Work
For several years Debenhams has been involved in 
local programmes which aim to offer opportunities 
to people who are at a disadvantage in the  
labour market, such as lone parents or those on 
incapacity beneﬁt. These programmes aim to raise 
employment rates and reduce the number of 
working people dependent on beneﬁts and operate 
in conjunction with Jobcentre Plus and the Learning 
and Skills Council.
To date, Debenhams has employed over 200 people 
through these programmes in a number of different 
regions, including recent new store openings in 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Carmarthen, Bury and Bath. 
Our involvement has been recognised with a wealth 
of award nominations.
Customers
Our customers are extremely important to us. 
Customer Feedback
We believe that keeping in touch with our customers 
and understanding what they think about 
Debenhams is paramount to achieving our goals. 
Equally important for us is to seek ways to make our 
customers feel good about themselves when so 
much of the fashion business focuses on body 
shapes and lifestyles which are very different from 
reality for the majority of our customers. 
Debenhams Design Team
We have increased the size of our online research 
community, the Debenhams Design Team, to over 
19,000 members. In the last year Design Team 
members have participated in over 35 surveys and 
over 25 online discussions, capturing over 70,000 
individual responses. 
We also ran a series of customer focus groups 
throughout the year to gain feedback on new 
product ranges, including the Principles by Ben de 
Lisi, H! by Henry Holland and B by Ted Baker ranges.
Customer Experience Programme
We continue to invite every customer in Debenhams 
stores to give us feedback on their in-store 
experience.
This year we received feedback from 167,868 
customers, of which 60 per cent were “extremely 
likely” to recommend Debenhams to their friends or

Business Review 
This review has been prepared in accordance with The Companies Act 2006 which requires the Company to set out in this report a 
fair review of the business of the Group during the ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010, including an analysis of the position of the 
Group at the end of the ﬁnancial year and the trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance and position 
of the business. The purpose of the Business Review is to enable shareholders to assess how the directors have performed their duty 
under section 172 of The Companies Act 2006.
The contents of this Directors’ Report, together with the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 16, the 
Finance Director’s Review, the Corporate Responsibility Review and The Board on pages 21 to 37, Risk Management, the Remuneration 
Report and the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on pages 45 to 59 constitute the Business Review and are therefore incorporated 
into this report by reference. Any liability is restricted to the extent prescribed by the Companies Act 2006.
Events Since the Year End
Since the year end Debenhams has opened a department store in Bath. Additionally, the Group has disposed of the long leases  
on six stores and entered into new lease contracts for these stores. Further details of this disposal can be found in note 36 to the 
Financial Statements.
Proﬁt and Dividends
The proﬁt after tax for the ﬁnancial year ending 28 August 2010 was £97.0 million (2009: £95.1 million). The directors are not 
recommending the payment of a ﬁnal dividend. No dividends will therefore have been paid during the year (2009: nil).

writing to the Company Secretary. The Company was authorised by shareholders at the January 2010 Annual General Meeting to 
purchase in the market up to 128,680,629 ordinary shares. Although this authority was not utilised by the Company during the last 
ﬁnancial year, approval will be sought from shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to renew this standard authority 
for a further year. It is the Company’s present intention, should shares be bought back, for them to be cancelled or retained in treasury 
pending a subsequent sale, cancellation or transfer. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury. The Company will 
only buy back shares if the directors believe that it is in shareholders’ best interests and will increase earnings per share.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Changes to the Articles of Association must be approved by special resolution of the Company. New Articles are being proposed at 
this year’s Annual General Meeting to include a provision that will allow the Company to continue to function in circumstances where 
an insufﬁcient number of directors are elected or re-elected at one of the Company’s general meetings, thereby leaving the board 
inquorate. Explanatory notes relating to these changes are included in the appendix to the Notice of Meeting which accompanies 
this report.
The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 holds 1,413,536 ordinary shares in the Company (0.10 per cent); any voting or other 
similar decisions relating to those shares are taken by the trustees, who may take account of any recommendations of the Company.
There are no signiﬁcant agreements to which the Company is a party which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of change of 
control of the Company except that the supplier agreements with certain major cosmetic suppliers contain termination provisions on 
change of control and the Credit Agreement dated 19 April 2006 (as amended by supplemental agreements dated  
28 November 2007, 3 June 2009 and 19 August 2010) contains mandatory prepayment as does the new £650 million Senior Facility 
which starts in April 2011. There are no agreements providing for compensation for directors or employees on change of control. 
Details concerning the impact on share options and share awards held by directors or employees in the event of a change of control 
are set out on page 55 of the Remuneration Report.
Market Value of Properties
The Group has a small number of properties for which it owns the freehold. The directors are of the opinion that the market value of 
these properties at 28 August 2010 exceeded their net book value by approximately £23 million.
Essential Contracts
We have contractual arrangements with many organisations but no one contract is so material as to be essential to our business,  
with the exception of our warehouse operators.
Board of Directors
The membership of the board and biographical details of the directors are given on page 37 and are incorporated into this report 
by reference. The rules governing the appointment and replacement of the board members are set out in the Company’s Articles 
of Association.
Directors’ Indemnities
In addition to the indemnity provisions in their Articles of Association, the Company and other Group companies have entered into a 
direct indemnity agreement with each of the directors and certain other ofﬁcers or senior employees of the Group. The Company also 
maintains directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance which gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against its directors.
Directors’ Interests
The beneﬁcial and non-beneﬁcial interests of the directors and their connected persons in the shares of the Company are shown on

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the Company conﬁrms that, throughout the year ended 28 August 2010 
and as at the date of this Annual Report, it was fully compliant with the provisions of and applied the principles as set out in the 2008 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Further information on the 
Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.
The Board
The board is responsible to shareholders for the strategy and control of the Company. In accordance with good practice there is a 
formal schedule of matters reserved for the board’s decision which is regularly reviewed and this can be found on the Company’s 
website www.debenhamsplc.com. Speciﬁc matters reserved for the board’s consideration include approval of the Company’s 
business model and strategy, the Company’s ﬁnancial statements, major capital expenditure, major acquisitions and disposals and 
changes to governance and business policies.
The board considers at each of its meetings reports which are circulated in advance of the meeting from the executive directors on 
major operational matters. Reports are also made by specialists on general and Company business areas and by other executives 
and external advisers on key business areas. During the year matters covered by such reports included stock management, 
e-commerce, logistics, health and safety, reﬁnancing and the Bribery Act. In addition to the directors, board meetings are attended 
by Nigel Palmer (Retail Operations Director), Nikki Zamblera (Human Resources Director), Suzanne Harlow (Group Trading Director) 
and the Company Secretary. 
The Chairman’s main responsibilities are to lead the board ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects, to facilitate the contribution of the 
non-executive directors and the relationship between them and the executive directors, to set the board’s agenda and when 
necessary to manage relationships and communication with the shareholders of the Company. The day-to-day management and 
achievement of the strategic objectives of the Company is the responsibility of the Chief Executive. There are clear divisions of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive and these are set out in writing and agreed by the board.  
The description of the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive is available on www.debenhamsplc.com.
As at 28 August 2010, the board of Debenhams plc comprised three executive directors, four independent non-executive directors 
and Nigel Northridge, non-executive Chairman. No individual or small group of individuals dominates the board’s decision taking.  
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, since Nigel Northridge was appointed during the year, he will be subject 
to election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”) in 2011.
The executive directors are Rob Templeman (Chief Executive), Michael Sharp (Deputy Chief Executive) and Chris Woodhouse 
(Finance Director). Michael Sharp and Chris Woodhouse will stand for re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, at the 2011 AGM.
The four independent non-executive directors are Dennis Millard (Senior Independent Director), Adam Crozier, Martina King and 
Sophie Turner Laing. Adam Crozier will stand for re-election at the AGM. All the non-executive directors are considered by the board  
to be independent and free from any relationship or circumstances that could affect their independent judgement. 
Since year end the number of independent non-executive directors has increased to ﬁve following the appointment of Mark Rolfe  
on 1 October 2010. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Mr Rolfe will stand for election at the AGM.
The Company is actively considering the provisions relating to the annual re-election of all directors contained in the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code and, in particular, whether and how to implement a policy of annual re-election.
Biographies for the members of the board can be found on page 37 of this report.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Nigel Northridge. The other members are Adam Crozier and Martina King (both of whom 
were appointed members on 1 May 2010) together with Dennis Millard and Sophie Turner Laing. Mark Rolfe, who was appointed to 
the Board on 1 October 2010, is also a member of the Committee. Other individuals such as the Chief Executive, the HR Director and 
external advisers may be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting, as and when appropriate. The Company Secretary also 
attends any meeting in his capacity of Secretary of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for making appropriate recommendations to the board for the appointment of replacement or 
additional directors. It is also responsible for board succession planning and for reviewing board size, structure and composition 
having regard to the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and independence required. The Committee recommends which 
directors should be put forward for re-election by shareholders and reviews each director’s time commitment and other external 
directorships held. The Nomination Committee is also responsible for monitoring and approving any director’s conﬂicts of interest. 
Following a recruitment process facilitated by external search consultants, Nigel Northridge joined the board as an independent  
non-executive director on 1 January 2010 and on 29 January 2010 the Company announced that he was to become Chairman  
with effect from 1 April 2010 following John Lovering’s retirement on 31 March 2010. Mark Rolfe was appointed to the board on 
1 October 2010 following a recruitment process facilitated by external search consultants. This process was managed by the  
Senior Independent Director.
In accordance with Company policy Mr Northridge received a full induction. Such induction aims to enable new members of  
the board to make a full contribution to its discussions, be aware of the business policies in place and to refresh their knowledge on 
corporate governance, best practice and general compliance. On the anniversary of each appointment the induction process  
is reviewed with the respective board member in order to obtain feedback on the induction provided with a view to enhancing  
future inductions. Mr Rolfe is currently in the induction process.
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee’s membership and responsibilities are detailed within the Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 58.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Dennis Millard who has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. The other members are Adam 
Crozier, Martina King and Sophie Turner Laing who became a member of the Committee on 1 May 2010. Mark Rolfe, who was 
appointed to the board on 1 October 2010, is also a member of the Committee. The Audit Committee meetings are also attended by 
the Chairman, the Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management, the external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP , and the Treasurer for the presentation of his report. The Chief Executive periodically attends meetings of the Committee at the 
discretion of the Committee Chairman. The Company Secretary also attends any meeting in his capacity of Secretary of the Committee. 
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to review all ﬁnancial statements and any formal announcements relating to  
the Company’s ﬁnancial performance, to review the Group’s internal and external audit activity and to review and monitor the 
effectiveness of the risk management process and internal controls within the business. In addition to the meetings set out in the 
attendance table overleaf, the Committee met with the Company’s auditor and the Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management 
privately without any management being present.
During the year the Committee has monitored and reviewed the efﬁciency of risk management and internal control, considered the 
external auditors’ performance, resource, independence and objectivity to enable them to recommend to the board their re-election 
as auditors for ﬁnancial year 2011, reviewed all ﬁnancial statements, key accounting policies, the auditors’ report on the year end 
audit and management’s responses to the issues. The internal audit programme and the external audit strategy and scope for 2010 
were also agreed and approved. The Company’s whistleblowing policy was also updated to encapsulate The Bribery Act 2010. 
Treasury and legal reports are also presented to each meeting as necessary. Historically, health and safety reports were also presented 
to each meeting, however these are now delivered to the board. After each meeting the chairman of the Committee reports to the 
board on the matters discussed and raises any signiﬁcant ﬁndings or identiﬁed weaknesses to the appropriate board member. 
Meetings and Attendance
Full attendance is expected at all meetings of the board, its committees and the AGM. Agendas are set by the chairman of the 
meeting and papers are usually circulated to the members one week in advance. The board held ﬁve meetings during the year.

(1)  Three board meetings have been held since Nigel Northridge became a member of the board on 1 January 2010. The Nomination Committee did not meet again in the 
ﬁnancial year under review after his appointment to the Committee on 1 January 2010. The Chairman is not a member of the Audit Committee, however the Committee 
invites him to attend each meeting so long as no conﬂict of interest arises. There have been two meetings of the Committee since his appointment. 
(2) Michael Sharp was unable to attend one board meeting due to a family commitment.
(3)  Adam Crozier was unable to attend one board meeting and one Audit Committee meeting (which were on the same day) due to a schedule clash. The Nomination 
Committee did not meet again in the ﬁnancial year under review since he became a member of that committee on 1 May 2010.
(4)  The Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee did not meet again in the ﬁnancial year under review since Martina King’s appointment to those committees on 
1 May 2010. 
(5)  Sophie Turner Laing became a member of the Audit and Remuneration Committees on 1 May 2010. Since that date the Audit Committee has met once and there were no 
further meetings of the Remuneration Committee in the ﬁnancial year under review.
Where directors have not been able to attend meetings due to conﬂicts in their schedule, they receive and read the papers for 
consideration at that meeting relaying any comments to the Chairman in advance of the meeting where possible.
Information and Support
The Company Secretary facilitates the ﬂow of information within the board and its committees and between senior management and 
the non-executive directors. The Company makes available the necessary resources to develop and update the directors’ knowledge 
and skills in order that they may perform the functions required of a director of a listed company. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is appointed by, and can only be removed by, the board. The Company Secretary 
ensures compliance with board processes and corporate governance. Independent professional advice is also available to the  
non-executive directors and the board committees at the Company’s expense in order to fulﬁl their duties. None of the directors 
sought such advice during the year. Debenhams provides insurance cover and indemnities for its directors and ofﬁcers.
Performance Evaluation
A formal evaluation of the performance of the board, its committees, the individual directors and the Chairman was conducted 
during the year in order to review past performance and to develop future performance. The performance of the internal and external 
auditors was also evaluated.
As in previous years, the evaluation was conducted internally through the circulation of a number of conﬁdential questionnaires 
which covered the key responsibilities and attributes required of members of the board and its committees. These were completed by 
all directors in relation to the board and any committee of which they were a member. The Chairman met with each Director upon 
his appointment as Chairman and he will continue to do that annually as part of the ongoing performance evaluation process.  
The Senior Independent Director will appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The results of the evaluations were collated by the Company Secretary and analysed in detail by the Chairman, the Chairman  
of the relevant committee, the Senior Independent Director and the Company Secretary. The Chairman led the full board in a  
discussion about the results of the board evaluation and a similar session took place in respect of each committee led by the 
Committee Chairman.
The results of the evaluation were satisfactory and concluded that the board and its committees operate effectively and that a sound 
corporate governance framework is in place. Generally the view was that the processes are robust and thorough and feedback  
from various board members has enabled the questionnaire to be tailored so that it will be even more focused in future years.  
The evaluation has led to the Company Secretary putting more structure into training and development needs of the directors and 
also giving better visibility on the anticipated length of meetings.
The results of the evaluation of both the internal and external audit teams is disclosed within the Risk Management section on page 46. Section 3

Corporate Governance continued
Directors’ Conﬂicts of Interest
The Nominations Committee reviewed and considered the interests and other appointments of the board members in August and 
any conﬂicts were considered and approved. Directors have a continuing duty to update any changes to the registered conﬂicts. 
Share Capital and Control
Information which the directors are required to provide pursuant to Section 992 of the Companies Act 2006 can be found on pages 
38 to 39 of the Directors’ Report. 
Auditor Independence 
In order to ensure that an appropriate relationship is maintained with the external auditors, a policy on auditor independence has 
been established and is regularly reviewed. This covers matters such as the requirement that auditors and their staff should have no 
family, ﬁnancial, employment, investment or business relationship with the Company, the employment by the Company of former 
audit employees, the rotation of audit partners and the provision of non-audit services. The Audit Committee makes recommendations 
to the full board in respect of re-appointment annually of the auditors and the board then ensures that this is included on the Notice 
for the Annual General Meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) has a policy that requires the audit partner to rotate off an 
audit client’s account every ﬁve years and this rotation has recently taken place in respect of the Debenhams audit. As regards the 
risk of PwC’s withdrawal from the market, the Company considers that there are sufﬁcient other auditors in the market place should 
this situation ever arise.
The objective of the Audit Committee’s policy in relation to the provision of non-audit services by the auditors is to ensure that the 
provision of such services does not impair the external auditors’ independence or objectivity. An independent report is produced by 
the Debenhams central costs team each quarter during the year detailing all non-audit work, its cost, when it was carried out and 
who instructed it. This information is reported to the Audit Committee at each meeting. 
The Company’s policy identiﬁes three categories of accounting services. The ﬁrst category is audit-related services which the auditors 
are permitted to provide. The second category is prohibited services which the auditors are not permitted to provide. Prohibited 
services are those which might result in the external auditor auditing its own work or making management decisions for the Company 
and services where some mutuality of interest is created or where the external auditor is put in the role of advocate for the Company. 
The third category is “potential” services which the auditors may, in certain circumstances, provide subject to compliance with the 
independence policy. These services include tax advisory services or services where the auditors are acting as the Company’s 
reporting accountant.
£0.2 million was paid by the Company to PricewaterhouseCoopers for non-audit services in respect of advisory services. The audit 
fees paid by the pension schemes were £27,000. 
Relations with Shareholders
The board is responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders. The Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director are always available to meet with major shareholders at their request on relevant issues and the 
Chairman met with several shareholders shortly after his appointment. Formal trading updates were issued on six occasions during 
the year: September 2009 (full year trading update), October 2009 (full year results), January 2010 (ﬁrst half interim management 
statement), March 2010 (ﬁrst half trading update), April 2010 (ﬁrst half results) and July 2010 (second half interim management 
statement). Presentations for shareholders and analysts were held following the announcements of results in October and April with 
conference calls held after all other trading updates. A programme of individual and group meetings and conference calls is 
organised throughout the year at which the Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive, Finance Director and Head of Investor Relations 
discuss the Company’s performance and strategy with shareholders. In 2010, meetings were held in London, Dublin, Birmingham, 
Manchester, Liverpool, Paris, Boston and New York. Analysts and investors were invited to visit the newly-acquired Magasin du Nord 
business in Copenhagen in May 2010. In April 2010, an investor perception study was commissioned in order to gain the views of 
major shareholders and some non-holders on a number of issues including strategy, business activities, ﬁnancial strength, 
management, governance, disclosure and communication. The results of this study were presented to and discussed by the board. Section 3
Management and Governance

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Risk Management
Effective management of risks and opportunities is essential if Debenhams is to deliver its strategic and operational goals, protect its 
reputation and ultimately enhance shareholder value.
The board of Debenhams, which has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control, considers it important that there 
should be a regular and systematic approach to risk issues facing the business in order to provide assurance that strategic targets can 
be met. This approach combines the board’s own assessment of risk with risk factors identiﬁed through organisation-wide risk reviews.
Internal Control
The board is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the internal control systems in place. Such systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives and can only provide a reasonable and not an absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Debenhams maintains a framework of internal controls based on a combination of ﬁve components of the internationally recognised 
COSO Framework for Internal Control, together with other enterprise risk management guidelines and any related guidance provided 
by the Financial Reporting Council. The ﬁve components are:
 Control environment
 Risk assessment
 Information and communication
 Control activities
 Monitoring
Control Environment
The board exempliﬁes the control environment to its stakeholders through its compliance with the Combined Code of Corporate 
Governance, Debenhams’ own internally published risk management strategy, related policies and procedures and, in particular, the 
Debenhams Code of Business Conduct.
Risk Assessment
Risks to the achievement of Debenhams’ strategic and operational goals have been identiﬁed through various organisation-wide 
control environment reviews, the most recent of which was completed in August 2010. Each participant considered the risks to their 
objectives and part of this exercise covered any changes in legislation (i.e. anti-bribery and corruption). The senior management 
team participated in this exercise which considered the business strategy, related objectives, internal and external risks to their 
achievement, together with existing and any new controls required to mitigate those risks. Risks were ranked according to a matrix of 
severity and likelihood of occurrence and the Group’s risk register was updated accordingly.
Information and Communication
The board reviews the key risks and their relevant mitigation strategies annually. In addition, the Audit Committee satisﬁes itself that  
the key risks are being managed effectively and monitored by senior management and that the internal audit plan is focused on 
high priorities.
The internal audit team updates the board on the effectiveness of risk management within each discrete area audited throughout 
the year. Internal audit also highlights any new or emerging risks together with an assessment of how effectively they are managed.
Control Activities
A series of control activities used to mitigate the risks identiﬁed include risk transfer (through a third-party contract), ﬁnancing the risk 
through insurance or consideration by management of re-engineering the process in question.
In addition, only suitably qualiﬁed employees are responsible for each of the functions within Debenhams. Training, performance 
reviews and support mechanisms are in place to ensure standards of performance are maintained.
Monitoring
The risks that have been identiﬁed are monitored through a variety of mechanisms which include: monthly management accounts, 
board meetings, the audit programme, fraud detection systems across point of sale and certain central data repositories, the critical 
and serious risk monitor, internal procedures such as stocktakes and stockﬁle counts, prevention tools such as CCTV and through 
management controls.
In addition, Debenhams operates a number of processes to test its ﬁnancial information and controls. An operating plan is prepared 
in August of each year, shortly before the start of the ﬁnancial year, and a revised forecast is prepared each month of the ﬁnancial 
year which analyses actual performance and highlights variances against the plan. In particular, performance is monitored through 
a series of key ratios. Daily sales, weekly sales and margin and monthly management accounts are prepared, all of which report on 
performance against the operating plan, last year and forecast. A treasury report is made to each board meeting which covers 
matters such as senior operating restrictions and covenant reporting and forecasting (under the Group’s banking facilities), exposure 
to foreign exchange and hedging arrangements, net debt and interest rate hedging, cash ﬂow and cash ﬂow forecasting and 
amounts deposited with counterparties. Section 3
Management and Governance

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Risk Management and Internal Audit
Debenhams’ risk management function includes the internal audit, anti-fraud, insurance and proﬁt protection departments. This 
combination enables the Company to maintain a cohesive approach to all aspects of risk management whilst allowing the internal 
audit team to beneﬁt from the insights that other elements of the function can provide. The internal audit plan focuses on critical and 
serious risk testing of high-priority areas.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of both internal and external audit teams was undertaken by the Company Secretary in August 
2010. The respondents included all members of the Audit Committee, members of the board, function heads, senior retail managers 
and a self-assessment by the Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management.
In relation to the internal audit function, this evaluation considered effectiveness in a number of categories: interaction with the Audit 
Committee, robustness of audit, quality of delivery and quality of team. The categories for external audit were: robustness of audit, 
quality of delivery and quality of people and service. The overall feedback was very positive for both internal and external audit with 
both scoring 93 per cent for effectiveness.
Whistleblowing
All Debenhams’ employees are required to adhere to the Code of Business Conduct, with senior employees required to conﬁrm their 
compliance in writing. This sets out the ethical standards expected by the Company and includes details of how matters can be 
raised in strict conﬁdence. Two main routes are available to employees at all levels within the Company to raise concerns over 
malpractices. The ﬁrst, “Employees’ guideline to problem solving”, encourages employees to talk to their line manager, their manager’s 
line manager or, if still concerned, to call HR Connect (the Debenhams central human resources team) directly. The second route is 
a conﬁdential reporting line through which employees can speak to the Debenhams anti-fraud team. If an employee feels that the 
matter is so serious that it cannot be discussed in any of these ways, s/he should contact the Company Secretary or the Head of 
Internal Audit and Risk Management directly and contact details are provided for all these routes. The Company’s policy on 
whistleblowing and these methods of raising issues of concern are published on the Debenhams intranet and emphasised on 
posters. All serious matters are raised with the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The risks detailed below are the principal risks and uncertainties that may impact Debenhams’ ability to achieve its strategic and 
operational goals. Both external factors, such as the economic environment, and internal factors, such as the retention of key 
management, are included in the risks and uncertainties that could substantially impact performance. Relevant mitigation for each 
risk is also outlined. These risks are presented in no particular order.
It should be noted that any system of risk management and internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Risk Impact Examples of mitigation
External Risk
Consistent fall in 
customer spending  
as a result of economic 
downturn, inﬂation  
or deﬂation
Reduction in gross transaction value 
and a decline in sales on discretionary 
purchases
The board conducts strategic business reviews which 
ensure that management is focused on key priorities 
and cost control. These reviews also focus on the growth 
strategy through new stores, brand development, 
enhanced multi-channel offer and expanding 
international opportunities. 
Competitive pressures  
in existing markets 
inﬂuencing customer 
behaviour
Place pressure on our pricing strategy, 
margins and proﬁtability
Debenhams differentiates its customer offer through its 
unique brand and product mix. An understanding of 
customers and their needs is developed by listening to their 
views, market intelligence and reviewing key performance 
indicators which ensures that pricing is competitive.
Sustained supplier cost 
price increases due  
to rising cost of raw 
materials, labour, etc
Place pressure on margin and  
will also divert ﬁnancial and 
management resources from  
more beneﬁcial uses
Debenhams fosters excellent relationships with its 
suppliers that are mutually beneﬁcial. Both parties work 
towards the objective of optimising fulﬁlment and costs, 
which is measured regularly by management through 
key performance indicators. Alongside this, Debenhams 
develops multiple sourcing routes to ensure pricing 
remains competitive.
Loss of proﬁt or 
additional expenditure 
caused by increased 
energy costs
Place pressure on margin and  
will also divert ﬁnancial and 
management resources from  
more beneﬁcial uses
The Energy Committee works on the key objectives  
to control energy usage, including the impact of the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment scheme. An energy 
hedging policy is in place to provide a higher degree  
of cost certainty.

Risk Impact Examples of mitigation
Strategic Risk
Inability to predict or 
fulﬁl customer demands 
or preferences
Sales will be lower, market share 
reduced and forced to rely on 
markdowns and sales to dispose  
of excess or slow-moving inventory  
or inventory shortfalls on popular 
merchandise
Debenhams utilises market, trend and customer 
awareness research to understand current demands 
and preferences. It delivers these requirements through 
multiple channels including its stores and website.  
To achieve this, Debenhams constantly develops these 
channels and maintains high operational standards  
to differentiate itself from its competitors. Debenhams 
manages stock levels and the supply chain closely  
in order to ensure product newness is maximised.
Departure of key 
personnel and failure to 
attract or retain talent
Signiﬁcantly delay or prevent 
achievement of business plan
In order to attract and retain talent, both succession  
and personal development plans are in place 
throughout the organisation. In addition, target-led 
performance-related incentive schemes exist.
Failure to develop and 
implement the new store 
roll out or acquisition 
successfully
Reduced growth or a decline in  
gross transaction value and may  
be required to write down the value  
of any stock acquired for sale in  
an uncompleted store
Debenhams undertakes research of key markets and 
demographics to identify potential locations to drive 
growth through new space. A full investment appraisal  
is conducted as part of the decision-making process 
and a specialist team has responsibility for end-to-end 
management of each project once the decision is made.
Failure of ethical trading 
policy, poor perception 
in the market on 
corporate responsibility 
matters, or negative 
impact to brand due to 
product quality, supply

The Sustainability Committee works on the key objectives 
such as ethical sourcing, legislative change and 
sustainability matters. The work includes consideration  
of key topics such as Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (WEEE); Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH); and the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC). To ensure that 
Debenhams has the most current information available, 
it is a member of relevant industry bodies that provide 
awareness of changes to standards and legislation. 
Debenhams is an active member of the Ethical Trading 
Initiative (ETI) and expects all suppliers to follow the ETI 
base code and adhere to Debenhams’ own Supplier 
Code of Conduct. A robust approval process is in place, 
to underpin the ETI base code, for the selection of 
factories for both new and existing suppliers. Adherence 
is monitored through regular third-party audits. Factory 
outputs are also checked by the internal Quality 
Assurance team to ensure the integrity of Debenhams’ 
own bought products.
Financial Risk
Risks associated with 
currency, hedging, 
interest rates, credit, 
counterparties and 
ﬁnancial covenants 
under the credit facilities
Hinder ability to adjust rapidly to 
changing market conditions and 
impact earnings and cash ﬂow
Hedging strategy may not adequately 
protect operating results from the impact 
of exchange rate ﬂuctuations or may 
limit any beneﬁt caused by favourable 
movements in exchange rates
Affect available cash and liquidity  
and could have material effect on  
the business, results of operations  
and ﬁnancial condition
Debenhams has a Treasury policy in place which  
covers counterparty limits and hedging for both foreign 
exchange and energy. There is also an internal Treasury 
function which is mandated by the board and audited 
annually. Debenhams closely monitors all aspects of 
working capital to support its objective of deleveraging  
the balance sheet and effectiveness is measured 
regularly by management through a series of key 
performance indicators.
Shortfall in the 
pension fund
Increases in pension-related liabilities 
could impact proﬁt and cash ﬂow
The Trustees carefully monitor the pension fund and 
adjust the investment strategy appropriately with  
any shortfall being brought to the board’s attention. Section 3

A full investment appraisal is conducted as part of the 
decision-making process and must be signed off by  
a board member before any projects are undertaken.  
As part of project governance, a steering committee 
monitors all key areas involved in the delivery of the 
project, a project framework is used, selected projects 
will be reviewed by internal audit and post-investment 
appraisals are undertaken.
Ineffective brand 
awareness and 
marketing programmes
Loss of market share, customer  
loyalty, reduction in gross transaction 
value and a decline in sales on 
discretionary purchases
Debenhams utilises market, trend and customer 
awareness research to understand current demands 
and preferences. This information is used to identify 
speciﬁc segments of the market to target and to form  
a proposal as a marketing campaign. A full investment 
appraisal is conducted as part of the decision-making 
process and must be signed off by a board member 
before any campaign is undertaken. Campaign 
effectiveness is monitored through external feedback 
and internal analysis.
Risks associated with 
leasehold properties  
or former properties for 
which Debenhams may 
have potential liabilities 
in event of default of the 
current tenant
Signiﬁcant alterations in rental terms 
could have a material adverse effect 
on the business, as would failure to 
secure desirable locations
Disputes over reﬁt of stores may lead  
to reinstatement costs being incurred 
and termination of leases may lead  
to dilapidation costs being incurred
Failure to manage asbestos in speciﬁc 
properties may lead to ﬁnes or other

objectives are to maintain excellent third-party 
relationships by ensuring strategies are aligned;  
to have appropriate, unambiguous contracts in place;  
to ensure third parties are ﬁnancially robust; and  
to have contingency plans in place in the event  
of a failure (e.g. conversion of space to own bought

number of participants are members of various relevant 
industry bodies. The Committee receives input from a 
number of specialist teams which focus on discrete 
aspects; these include health and safety, building 
services, buying and merchandising and insurance.  
To support compliance and to maintain high

The Information Security Committee reviews projects  
and key activities for compliance to the relevant 
standards. Debenhams’ compliance to the PCI standard 
is monitored by management and reported to the Audit 
Committee. A number of security tools are employed  
to protect data including encryption, intruder detection 
and data loss prevention.
Fraud Negative effect on reputation and  
will divert ﬁnancial and management 
resources from more beneﬁcial uses
In order to mitigate fraud, Debenhams has a number  
of preventative measures in place, such as accounting 
policies and procedures; systems access restrictions; 
expenditure authorisation levels; and a code of business 
conduct. A variety of monitoring mechanisms are  
used to identify fraudulent activity, including data  
mining across point of sale and head ofﬁce functions.  
In addition, if an employee wishes to report concerns 
conﬁdentially, a whistleblowing policy is in place. Both 
the code of business conduct and the whistleblowing 
policy refer to bribery and corruption as well as theft and 
fraud. As a part of the organisation-wide risk assessment 
process, all management signs an anti-fraud, bribery 
and corruption declaration. Issues identiﬁed are 
investigated and reported to the Audit Committee. Section 3

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
This Remuneration Report for the year ended 28 August 2010 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the 
board for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 January 2011. The report complies with the 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the provisions of the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
On 1 October 2010, Mark Rolfe was appointed as an independent non-executive director and he is a member of the Remuneration, 
Nomination and Audit Committees of the board. Since Mr Rolfe was appointed post-year end, all regulatory disclosures will be 
included within next year’s annual report. The terms of his appointment and remuneration arrangements are in line with those of other 
non-executive directors.
Part 1: Unaudited Information
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the following non-executive directors: Adam Crozier (Committee Chairman), Dennis Millard, 
Sophie Turner Laing, Martina King (who was appointed on 1 May 2010) and Nigel Northridge (who was appointed a member on 
3 September 2010). Details of non-executive directors’ experience and their other roles are set out in the directors’ biography section 
on page 37. The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. There were two meetings of the Committee during the year under 
review. The individual attendance of the directors is detailed in the table within the Corporate Governance Report on page 43.
The Committee has responsibility for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Company Secretary, reviewing the 
bonus structure for senior managers below board level, reviewing the appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy and 
administering all aspects of any share incentives in operation for senior management. The Committee is governed by formal terms  
of reference which are reviewed annually and can be downloaded from the Company’s website at www.debenhamsplc.com under 
the corporate governance section on the investors’ page.
Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) acted as external advisers to the Committee throughout the ﬁnancial year, providing independent advice on 
directors’ remuneration and share incentives. Deloitte also provides industry and comparative employee remuneration data to 
Debenhams’ management. The Company’s Chief Executive, Finance Director and Human Resources Director have also provided 
advice to the Committee during the year but not on matters relating to their own compensation or contracts. Deloitte also provided 
unrelated advisory services in respect of corporate tax planning during the year.
The Remuneration Committee reviews external data produced through surveys and benchmarking from Deloitte about total 
remuneration in other comparable companies, and the elements of that total remuneration, in order to inform its consideration of the 
remuneration of Company executives. 
During the year the Committee:
 Reviewed the executive directors’ remuneration packages;
 Approved the executive directors’ bonuses for 2009;
 Approved the executive directors’ bonus plan for 2010; and
  Consulted with shareholders in relation to performance conditions to be operated for options/awards made under the Company’s 
share schemes during the ﬁnancial year and administered the awards made in November 2009.
Following the year end, the Committee also considered the operation of the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan and consulted with 
shareholders regarding this.
Remuneration Policy
When determining remuneration policy and arrangements for executive directors, the Remuneration Committee considers pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group and that offered by other comparable companies to ensure that the pay of executive 
directors remains appropriate. The Committee particularly takes into account pay increases throughout the Group when determining 
salary increases for executive directors. It is the Company’s policy to provide remuneration packages that will attract, motivate and 
retain high-calibre employees in a competitive retail market and, where possible, to do this in the most cost-effective way for the 
business. In addition to basic salary and pension provision (or equivalent cash contribution), the Company seeks to incentivise its 
executives and senior managers through an annual bonus scheme and through its share incentives when appropriate.
In 2009 there was a pay freeze for all senior management and the executive directors. As disclosed last year, the pay freeze continued 
for the executive directors in 2010 whilst the salary reviews of senior management were reinstated.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Components of Remuneration
Base Salary 
The Committee considers base salary and salary increases for executives based on the median level paid within a group of 
comparable companies of a similar size and complexity and comparable companies in the FTSE 350 Retail sector, as well as 
considering salary increases across the Group’s wider employee population. To ensure the attraction and retention of the quality of 
individuals required to successfully run the business, the Committee’s policy is for base pay to be at or close to the market median of 
companies of a similar size and complexity.
In 2010 executive directors continued to take a pay freeze (there already being no increase in 2009), whereas base salary throughout 
the Group increased by c.2 per cent. The Committee reviewed salaries during the year and concluded that, given the performance 
of executives in recent years, it would be appropriate to give a modest salary increase of 2 per cent with effect from 1 September 2010. 
Salary increases throughout the Group are of a similar level. 
Executive Directors’ Bonus Schemes
2010 Bonus
As disclosed in last year’s remuneration report, the annual bonus scheme for executive directors for 2010 was based on one measure: 
Earnings Before Interest and Tax (“EBIT”) to ensure the executive directors focused on achieving exceptional earnings performance 
and to provide a clear objective in a year where a reﬁnancing of the Company’s debt was anticipated. The maximum bonus potential 
for 2010 was 100 per cent of base salary. Achieving an EBIT before exceptional items of £193.1 million would result in a maximum 
bonus payment of 100 per cent of base salary.
The Company achieved EBIT before exceptional items of £195.1 million (representing growth of 7.1 per cent) which resulted in bonus 
payouts of 100 per cent of salary. The Committee believes that this represents exceptional performance in challenging economic 
circumstances and that the resulting bonus payments reﬂect the value added for shareholders and in particular noted that despite 
the difﬁcult market conditions experienced across the retail sector in the past two years, the Company has delivered ﬁve consecutive 
halves of proﬁt growth.
The Committee has agreed that executives will be given the opportunity to defer up to 50 per cent of their post-tax bonus into shares 
and will be able to earn a matching award under the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan. Further details are provided below.
2011 Bonus
It is intended that the maximum bonus opportunity will remain at 100 per cent of base salary for 2011. Now that the reﬁnancing of  
the business is complete, the Committee has determined that the performance measure for the 2011 bonus will revert to Proﬁt Before 
Tax and will be adopting this metric as a single measure. The Committee believes that this measure is strongly aligned with  
shareholder value creation and will effectively incentivise executives to grow proﬁt on an annual basis. We cannot disclose the target 
for 2011 due to commercial sensitivities, but as for 2010 we will provide details of the target and performance against it in next year’s 
Remuneration Report.
The Company’s Share Incentives
In 2009 the Committee reviewed the performance measures for the PSP and the ESOP . It was agreed that going forward PSP awards 
would be subject to stretching EPS targets and options granted under the ESOP would be subject to performance against ROCE 
targets. The Committee believes that the combined use of performance share awards with an EPS measure and share options with a 
ROCE performance measure effectively incentivises management to achieve both share price and efﬁcient earnings returns, goals 
which are aligned with the Company’s long-term strategy and shareholder value creation. The Committee consulted with major 
shareholders regarding these proposed measures who were generally supportive. Following the review of targets, awards were made 
to Michael Sharp, the Deputy Chief Executive, in November 2009 (the Chief Executive and the Finance Director having elected not to 
receive awards). 
It is intended that the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan will be the primary long-term incentive vehicle for 2010 and it is currently 
intended that no awards will be granted under the PSP or ESOP to directors this year (other than in exceptional circumstances).

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The Debenhams Deferred Bonus Matching Plan (the “DBMP”) 
The DBMP was approved by shareholders in 2006. However, no awards have been made to date under the plan. During the year the 
Committee reviewed the plan and consulted with the Company’s major shareholders regarding its operation. It was agreed that 
executives and approximately 400 members of the management team would be invited to invest to up 50 per cent of their net annual 
bonus earned in respect of 2010 into shares (“invested shares”) which will be held in trust for the duration of the performance period. 
The terms of DBMP provide the ability for the participants to defer 100 per cent of their bonus. However, the Committee determined 
that for the current year participation would be limited to 50 per cent of bonus earned. If the participant remains in service for three 
years s/he will, subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance targets, be eligible to receive a matching share award equal to 
the pre-tax amount of the bonus that has been invested, i.e. in this instance the matching award will have a maximum value of 50 per 
cent of base salary. If the performance target is not met at the end of the performance period, the matching share awards will lapse 
immediately (invested shares will be retained by the participant) and there will no opportunity to re-test the performance condition. 
The Committee determined that for these matching awards earnings per share (“EPS”) would be used as the primary performance 
metric. In addition, the vesting of awards would be subject to the achievement of an underpin level of return on capital employed 
(“ROCE”) performance. The Committee considered that EPS is an appropriate measure as it incentivises strong earnings growth over 
a sustained period which is in line with our long-term strategy and the generation of future shareholder value. The ROCE underpin 
ensures that proﬁt performance remains sustainable and efﬁcient. An absolute EPS growth of 6 per cent per annum over the three-
year performance period will trigger 30 per cent vesting of the matching share award and an EPS growth of 12 per cent per annum 
will trigger 100 per cent vesting. Targets triggered between 6 per cent and 12 per cent would result in vesting of the matching share 
award on a straight-line basis between 30 per cent and 100 per cent. When setting these targets the Committee reviewed internal 
projections, analysts’ expectations and market practice and believes these targets to be sufﬁciently stretching. In addition, no portion 
of the award shall vest unless ROCE exceeds the cost of capital by 2 per cent.
Invitations under the DBMP will create alignment throughout the organisation with executives focusing on a common goal. 
The Debenhams Performance Share Plan (the “PSP”) 
The Committee has discretion to grant awards under the PSP up to a maximum of 200 per cent of base salary to executive directors 
and other senior executives. Up to 250 per cent of base salary may be awarded in exceptional circumstances (e.g. for recruitment). 
Michael Sharp was the only executive director to receive an award under the plan during the year. His award represented 75 per cent 
of his salary. Details of the award are disclosed on page 58 of this report.
Awards under the PSP comprise a right to receive free shares or a nil cost option. The awards normally vest on the third anniversary of 
the date of grant (and in the case of nil cost options must be exercised within six months of vesting) subject to satisfaction of 
performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and generally provided that the 
participant remains in employment. In addition, in order for the award to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that the 
underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufﬁcient to justify the vesting of the award. 
Historically awards have been subject to two performance targets, 50 per cent being based on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share 
growth of the Company above the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over a three-year performance period and the  
other 50 per cent being based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return against the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers 
Index over a three-year performance period. If the performance condition(s) is/are not met at the end of the performance period, 
50 per cent or 100 per cent (as appropriate) of the awards will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant 
performance condition.
As noted above, for awards granted in 2009 to Michael Sharp, the Committee determined that just one performance measure would 
apply, earnings per share growth. The Committee believes that using this sole measure increases focus on delivering strong earnings 
growth and generating shareholder value throughout the performance period. Section 3

  Absolute growth of 10 per cent pa = 100 per cent
   Between absolute growth of 6 per cent and 10 per cent pa = straight-line basis 
between 30 per cent and 100 per cent
No PSP awards vested during the year, the performance condition for November 2006 and May 2007 awards having not being met. 
The awards granted in May 2008 to participants below the board have also lapsed since the performance conditions attaching to 
those awards were not satisﬁed as at 28 August 2010.
The Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan (the “ESOP”)
The Committee has discretion to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees. Options with a face value of up to a maximum 
of 100 per cent of base salary can be granted under the plan. Options may, in exceptional circumstances, be granted with a market 
value in excess of this amount at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Options can be granted in the form of unapproved 
options or Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs approved options (up to the prescribed limit, currently £30,000).
Michael Sharp was the only executive director to receive an option under the scheme during the year. His options (in the form  
of approved and unapproved options) represented 75 per cent of his salary. Details of the options granted are disclosed on page 58 
of this report.
Share options are granted at the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the date of grant and normally become exercisable 
three years after grant, expiring seven years later. The exercise of the options is subject to performance conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted. Historically, options exercised under the ESOP have been subject to the 
Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth of the Company increasing above the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index 
(“RPI”) over a three-year performance period. For the options granted in November 2009 the performance criteria was based upon 
the Company’s Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) exceeding the Cost of Capital. The Committee believes ROCE is an appropriate 
performance condition as it incentivises sustainable, efﬁcient proﬁt performance. In addition, in order for the award to vest the 
Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that the underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Company over the performance period 
is sufﬁcient to justify the vesting of the award. If the performance condition is not met at the end of the performance period the 
options will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
The table below sets out the performance conditions of ESOP options existing during the year:
Date of grant Vesting criteria Performance condition over three-year period
12 November 2007 EPS growth  RPI ≥ 3 per cent pa = 100 per cent vesting 
 against RPI growth
24 November 2009 ROCE  ROCE ≤ Cost of Capital = zero vesting
 against Cost of Capital ROCE > Cost of Capital = 30 per cent vesting
  ROCE > Cost of Capital + 5 per cent = 100 per cent vesting
   Between these points the options vests on a straight-line basis between 30 per cent  
  and 100 per cent
No options under the ESOP were exercised during the year. The options granted in November 2007 to participants below the board 
lapsed since the performance conditions attaching to those options were not satisﬁed as at 28 August 2010.

Debenhams 2006 Sharesave Scheme (the “Sharesave Scheme”)
Under the Sharesave Scheme, employees may be granted an option to acquire shares at a ﬁxed exercise price. At the end of the 
savings period the employee may either exercise the option within six months of the end of the savings period using the savings 
contributions and bonus accumulated or have the savings and bonus repaid. No options have been granted under this scheme and 
there is currently no intention to use the scheme.
The Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan (the “Plan”)
The Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan is an unapproved plan operated by the Company. This Plan is focused at key senior 
managers and executive directors do not participate in this Plan. The ﬁrst tranche of options granted under the Plan was awarded on 
24 November 2009 for nil consideration. These options were granted to a small number of key senior employees below board level to 
retain and incentivise those employees in the short to medium term and have an 18-month vesting period. 
The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 (The “Trust”)
The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 (the Trust) currently holds 1,413,536 shares in the Company. 715,000 shares held in the 
trust were allocated to participants as a result of the grant of options under the Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan. The Trust is 
also to be used to hold the invested shares of participants of the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan (“DBMP”). Dividends receivable on 
the shares held in the Trust, which are not subject to the DBMP , are waived on the recommendation of the Company.

It is the Company’s current intention to satisfy any future requirements of its share schemes in a method best suited to the interests of 
the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market, or, subject to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares. Where the awards are 
satisﬁed by newly issued shares, the Company will comply with ABI guidelines on shareholder dilution. Current levels of shareholder 
dilution are 0.23 per cent (2009: 0.38 per cent) of share capital.
Change of Control
Generally, the rules of the Company’s share schemes provide that in the event of a change of control, awards/options would vest to 
the extent that the performance conditions (where applicable) are satisﬁed at the date of such event. Any such early vesting would 
generally be on a time pro-rata basis.
Pension
The directors are not members of a Company pension plan, except for Michael Sharp who is a deferred member of the Debenhams 
Executive Pension Plan. Full details are disclosed on page 58 of this report. However, under the terms of their contracts of employment, 
the executive directors are entitled to a salary supplement of 15 per cent of base salary in lieu of pension provision. These amounts 
are disclosed in the directors’ emoluments table on page 57.
Performance Graph
The performance graph below shows the Company’s total shareholder return against the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index over the 
period from ﬂotation (3 May 2006) to 28 August 2010. The FTSE 350 has been chosen as Debenhams has been a member throughout 
the period and it is made up of a broad spectrum of retail competitors (including major general retail listed competitors) in the 
principal product areas in which the Company trades.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Letters of Appointment and Service Contracts
Nigel Northridge’ s appointment as Chairman is subject to the terms of a letter of appointment dated 28 January 2010. The appointment 
is for a term of three years ending on 31 March 2013, subject to the Company’s Articles of Association and the shareholders’  
re-election provisions. In addition to time commitment, the annual engagement fee and other business interests, the Chairman is 
permitted to hold the ofﬁce of a director or Chairman of certain named companies provided that any such appointment does not 
interfere with his position at the Company. 
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment from the Company covering matters such as duties, time commitment, fees 
and other business interests. The appointments of Adam Crozier and Dennis Millard may be terminated by either party giving one 
month’s notice. Sophie Turner Laing and Martina King are appointed for a term of three years ending on 31 July 2012, subject to the 
Company’ Articles of Association and shareholders’ re-election provisions. 
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the board and are made up of an annual fee for acting as a non-executive 
director of the Company together with additional fees for membership of and chairing a board committee. There is a further fee for 
acting as Senior Independent Director (“SID”). The non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration 
which is reviewed annually. The fees are set to reﬂect the time which they are required to commit to their duties, their experience and 
the amounts paid to non-executive directors in comparable companies. Fees for the non-executive directors remained frozen for 
2010, however their total fee increased due to each non-executive director agreeing to become members of all committees of the 
board effective 1 May 2010. Martina King joined the Nomination and Remuneration Committees, Sophie Turner Laing joined the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees and Adam Crozier joined the Nomination Committee. In addition, upon the resignation of Paul Pindar 
on 30 April 2010, Dennis Millard assumed the position of Senior Independent Director.
Details of the letters of appointment of the Chairman and the non-executive directors are set out below and the terms are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business hours and at the AGM.

Rob Templeman, Chris Woodhouse and Michael Sharp entered into service agreements with the Company on 3 May 2006. Each 
agreement is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months’ written notice. It is the Company’s policy that the notice 
periods of executive directors’ should not exceed one year. The Remuneration Committee has considered the ﬁnancial consequences 
of early termination of directors’ service contracts; in order to limit and provide certainty in the event of termination of a contract 
without cause, the directors’ contracts contain liquidated damages clauses. If the Company terminates the employment without due 
notice, other than in circumstances such as gross misconduct or other immediate justiﬁable cause, the Company is required to make 
a payment equal to the aggregate of the executive director’s basic salary and the value of their contractual beneﬁts for the notice 
period together with a payment equal to the average of the annual bonus paid to the executive director in the two bonus years prior 
to the termination of employment. The liquidated damages clause within service agreements of any future executive directors 
appointed to the board will exclude the requirement to make a payment by reference to any bonus payments made prior 
to termination.
Executive directors are entitled, in addition to salary, to other beneﬁts or equivalent cash allowances, the value of which is set out in 
the table of directors’ emoluments. Such beneﬁts include company car and fuel as well as life, medical, dental and personal accident 
insurance together with product discount and personal ﬁnancial advice. 
Rob Templeman and Chris Woodhouse’s contracts permit each of them to hold up to two non-executive directorships in non-
competing companies and to retain payments received in respect of those other directorships. Chris Woodhouse, who is Group  
non-executive Chairman of Gondola Group Limited, retained fees of £150,000 (2009: £170,000).

Financial Statements and Notes

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors have elected 
to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements respectively; and
 prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement Pursuant to Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.1.12
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are detailed on page 37, conﬁrm that to the best of his/her knowledge:
 the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the Group; and
 the Directors’ Report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Debenhams plc for the year ended 28 August 2010 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 59, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation 
of the Financial Statements. 
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion the Group Financial Statements: 
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 28 August 2010 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year 
then ended; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the Group Financial Statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group Financial Statements.
Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 the Directors’ Report, set out on pages 38 to 40, in relation to going concern; and 
  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review.
Other Matter 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial Statements of Debenhams plc for the year ended 28 August 2010 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010
1 Basis of Preparation and General Information
Introduction
Debenhams plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Company No. 5448421). The address of the registered ofﬁce is Debenhams plc, 1 Welbeck Street, London W1G 0AA.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the “Group” or the “Debenhams Group”) is the sale of fashion 
clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home. The Group trades from department stores and small store 
formats in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, on the internet and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its Financial Statements for the ﬁnancial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
The principal companies within the Group during the ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010 are disclosed in note 35.
Basis of Preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
including International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as 
adopted for use in the EU. The Consolidated Financial Statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010 and 29 August 2009 
have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
The preparation of the Financial Statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
during the reporting period. Although these results are based on management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, 
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates (see note 5).
2 Accounting Policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies are described below.
Consolidation
The Financial Statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries include 
all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies. The existence and effect of potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control. They are de-consolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where these have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s 
Income Statement or Balance Sheet to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of 
value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession and consignment sales are recognised when goods 
are sold to the customer. Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card. Internet sales are recognised when the goods are 
despatched to the customer. Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group are recognised on the redemption of the 
gift card or gift voucher.
It is the Group’s policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and 
provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Segmental Reporting
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” requires segment information to be presented based on what is reported to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker. The Group has identiﬁed the executive management board as its Chief Operating Decision Maker and has identiﬁed one 
operating segment, Retail.
Interest Recognition
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
Dividend Distribution
A ﬁnal dividend distribution to the Company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company and Group’ s Financial Statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Retirement Beneﬁt Costs
The liability or asset recognised in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the 
deﬁned obligation at the balance sheet date. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outﬂows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling and that have terms to 
maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the Income Statement 
and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the 
employees remaining in service for a speciﬁed period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution scheme in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark and a stakeholder scheme in the UK. 
Contributions to these pension schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they fall due. Differences between contributions 
payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

2 Accounting Policies continued
Share-Based Payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is 
measured at the date of grant. The Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each 
class of award, a Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or Binomial pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, 
the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (at nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are events or transactions which, by virtue of their size or nature, have been disclosed in order to improve a reader’s 
understanding of the Financial Statements.
Foreign Exchange
a) Functional and Presentational Currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the Group’s presentational currency.
b) Group Companies
The results and ﬁnancial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet;
  income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates 
of the transaction); and
 resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
c) Transactions and Balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Differences on exchange are taken to the Income Statement. Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes
69
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
2 Accounting Policies continued
Taxation
Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable proﬁts for the ﬁnancial period using tax rates that are in force during the period. Taxable proﬁt differs 
from net proﬁt as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or 
loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals  
of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity,  
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leased Assets
a) Finance Leases
Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. 
Finance leases are classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial liability and measured at amortised cost. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception 
of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease. The resulting lease obligations are 
included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b) Operating Leases
All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed ﬁxed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is 
determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Business Combinations
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. All costs directly attributable to an acquisition are expensed 
to the Income Statement.
Identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired in a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date; provided they meet 
the conditions set out in IFRS 3 (Revised) “Business Combinations”. The excess of cost over the Group’s share of identiﬁable net assets 
acquired is recognised as goodwill. If, after reassessment, the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of assets acquired, the 
excess is immediately recognised in the Income Statement.
Intangible Assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
net identiﬁable assets of the acquired subsidiary. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not 
amortised but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units on a regional 
basis for the purpose of impairment testing.
b) Other Intangible Assets
Acquired licences and trademarks are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, not to 
exceed ten years.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and 
that the software generated will generate economic beneﬁt, are capitalised as an intangible asset. The software is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over its useful economic life, being three to eight years.
Property, Plant and Equipment
It is the Group’s policy to hold properties at cost less accumulated depreciation, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, 
on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use:
Freehold land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings 1 per cent 
Long leasehold land and buildings including landlords’ ﬁxtures and ﬁttings 1 per cent or life of lease if shorter 
Short leasehold land and buildings including landlords’ ﬁxtures and ﬁttings Life of lease 
Retail ﬁxtures and ﬁttings 4 – 25 per cent 
Ofﬁce equipment 10 – 12.5 per cent 
Computer equipment 14 – 33
1
/3 per cent 
Vehicles 25 per cent or life of lease
The assets’ useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each ﬁnancial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the Income Statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction. These assets comprise stores, which are under 
construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use. Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant 
and equipment are made when the store opens. No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction. Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes
71
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
2 Accounting Policies continued
Impairment Testing
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject 
to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash 
generating units). Non-ﬁnancial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed at each reporting date for possible 
reversal of the impairment.
Available-for-Sale Investments
The Group classiﬁes its investments as available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets in accordance with IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement”. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial investments are non-derivative assets. They are included in non-current assets unless 
management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Investments are recognised at fair 
value plus any transaction costs.
The fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated 
at the spot rate at the reporting date.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in equity.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale. Concession 
inventories are not included within inventory held by the Group.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost less provisions for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash 
ﬂows discounted at the effective interest rate. The movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original 
maturities of approximately three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classiﬁed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs that are facility costs are recognised initially at fair value, and are amortised over the term of the facilities using the 
effective interest rate on the committed amount of each facility.
Debt Repurchase
The nominal value of debt repurchased has been accounted for as a loan redemption, reducing net borrowings at the balance sheet date. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010
Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes
72
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
2 Accounting Policies continued
Trade Payables
Trade payables, deﬁned as ﬁnancial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more 
likely than not an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are 
measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Promotional activities – Provisions for promotional activities such as the cosmetics loyalty scheme are recognised where the Group has 
a legal or constructive obligation to provide a customer with goods or services.
Restructuring – Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to affected parties.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Derivatives
Derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting 
gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being 
hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash ﬂow hedges).
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well 
as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, 
both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective 
in offsetting changes in cash ﬂows of hedged items.
i) Cash Flow Hedges
The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the Income Statement which 
will be affected by the underlying hedged item. Forward exchange contracts designated as cash ﬂow hedges are de-designated 
and subsequently classiﬁed as “held for trading” when the underlying forecast transaction is recognised in the Financial Statements.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when 
the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance Sheet or in the Income Statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting 
is discontinued. Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is held in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When 
a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
reclassiﬁed to the relevant line of the Income Statement, which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii) Derivatives That Do Not Qualify For Hedge Accounting
Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Income Statement within interest payable and other charges. Section 4

New Standards and Interpretations
During the year the Group adopted the following new standards, which have had an impact on the Group:
  IAS 1 (revised) “Presentation of Financial Statements” requires that the Group presents either one performance statement – 
“Statement of Comprehensive Income”; or two statements – “Income Statement” and “Statement of Comprehensive Income”.  
The Group has elected to present two statements. IAS 1 also requires the presentation of a “Statement of Changes in Equity” to be 
presented with the same prominence as all other statements. The Financial Statements have been prepared using these 
revised disclosures.
  IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” requires a management approach to the reporting of segmental information. Further details regarding 
the adoption of this standard and the new disclosures required are set out in note 3.
  IFRS 3 (revised) “Business Combinations” requires some signiﬁcant changes to the way business combinations are accounted for. 
All costs associated with business combinations are expensed directly to the Income Statement. Additionally any changes to 
contingent consideration classiﬁed as debt must now be dealt with through the Income Statement subsequent to acquisition.
  IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments – Disclosures”. The amendment requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurement and 
liquidity risk. Full disclosures are set out in these Financial Statements. Transitional provisions of the amendment to IFRS 7 have been 
applied, i.e. comparatives have not been disclosed for the fair value hierarchy.
The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for the ﬁrst time this year; however these have no signiﬁcant impact 
on the Group:
 IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements”
 IFRIC 14/IAS 19 “The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction”
 IFRIC 15 “Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate”
 IFRIC 16 “Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation”
 IFRIC 17 “Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners”
 IFRS 2 (amendment) “Share-based Payments” “Amendment to Vesting Conditions and Cancellations”.
 IAS 23 (Revised) “Borrowing Costs”
 IAS 27 (Revised) “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”
 Amendment to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” relating to puttable ﬁnancial instruments and obligations arising  
 on liquidation

IFRS 9 has not yet been adopted by the European Union.
The Group is currently considering the implications of the adoption of these standards and interpretations. They are not expected to 
have a material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.
3 Segmental Reporting
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” with effect from 30 August 2009. IFRS 8 requires disclosure of the operating 
segments which are reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The CODM has been identiﬁed as the executive 
management board, which includes the executive directors and other key management. It is the executive management board that 
has responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Group’s reportable segment has been identiﬁed as Retail. The operating segment Magasin is not a reportable segment as it does 
not exceed 10 per cent of Group revenues, proﬁts or gross assets; however, this information has been presented voluntarily within the 
segmental analysis below. The segments are reported to the CODM to operating proﬁt level, using the same accounting policies as 
applied to the Group accounts.
The Group has elected to adopt early the 2009 amendment to IFRS 8, which is effective for periods commencing on 1 January 2010. 
This amendment states that an entity should only disclose a measure of segment assets when one is provided to the CODM.  
No analysis is provided to the executive management board of the assets and liabilities of each operating segment within the 
monthly reporting pack. Section 4

4 Gross Transaction Value
Revenue from concession and consignment sales are required to be shown on a net basis, being the commission received rather 
than the gross value achieved on the sale. Management believes that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross 
basis before adjusting for concessions, consignments, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide 
to the overall activity of the Group.

5 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁnition, seldom 
equal the related actual results. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next ﬁnancial period are discussed below.
Estimated Impairment of Goodwill
The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2. The 
recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The method requires an estimate of 
future cash ﬂows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash ﬂows. Actual 
outcomes could vary.
Taxation and Deferred Taxation
The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark. At each ﬁnancial period end, judgement is 
required in determining the provision for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best 
estimates at the balance sheet date.
Signiﬁcant judgement is also required in determining the deferred tax on developer’s contributions, fair value losses and gains, 
retirement beneﬁt assets and liabilities and other provisions. The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the best 
estimate at the balance sheet date.
Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of the above matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. The ﬁnal outcome of some 
of these tax items may give rise to material proﬁt or loss and/or cash ﬂow movements.
Share-Based Payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated 
level of vesting being reviewed annually by management. The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 30.
Pension Liability
The Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt schemes’ pension liability, which are assessed each period by actuaries, are based on key assumptions 
including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, inﬂation, future salary and pension costs. These assumptions, individually 
or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions; additional information relating to this 
is disclosed in note 24.
Estimated Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment
The Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each ﬁnancial period end.  
The Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs. Section 4

11 Taxation continued
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 budget statement. The Finance (No2) Act 
2010, which was substantially enacted on 20 July 2010, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28 per 
cent to 27 per cent from 1 April 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum 
to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014. These further changes had not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore 
not included in these Financial Statements.
As at the balance sheet date, the effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate enacted in the Finance (No 2) Act 2010 has been 
to reduce the net deferred tax asset recognised at 28 August 2010 by approximately £0.3 million. This £0.3 million decrease has been 
recognised partly as an increase to proﬁts in the Income Statement (£0.1 million) and partly as a loss in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income of £0.4 million in line with the treatment of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the net deferred tax asset.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1 per cent per year to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014 are expected to be 
enacted separately each year. The overall effect of the further changes from 27 per cent to 24 per cent, if applied to the deferred tax 
balances at 28 August, would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately £0.8 million.

The directors are not proposing a ﬁnal dividend in respect of the ﬁnancial year ended 28 August 2010 (2009: nil pence per share). The 
ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 30 August 2008, which was paid in the year ended 29 August 2009, absorbed £4.3 million 
of shareholders’ funds.
13 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has one class of dilutive potential 
ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares during the year.

Impairment Test for Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. 
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of Cash-Generating Units (“CGUs”) split 
on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill. This allocation was primarily undertaken 
subsequent to the acquisition in December 2003 of the Debenhams stores by Debenhams plc. The CGUs are set out below:

Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
14 Intangible Assets continued
For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations. 
These cash ﬂow projections are based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by management covering a ﬁve-year period. The key 
assumptions used in these projections are sales growth and discount rates. The projections also assume that the change in sales  
mix from concessions to own bought stock will result in improved gross margins. The ﬁve-year plan is built up using management’s 
previous experience and incorporates management’s view of current economic conditions and trading expectations. Cash ﬂows 
beyond the ﬁve-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of no growth after year ﬁve. The growth rates do not exceed 
the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate. The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the 
value-in-use was 8.0 per cent (2009: 8.0 per cent) and reﬂects the speciﬁc risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the 
market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The 
discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates. Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom on a region 
by region basis, and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would not cause an impairment write down to goodwill.
As a result of the impairment review, as at 28 August 2010, no impairment of goodwill has been required (2009: nil).

(1) Term loan facility includes unamortised issue costs of £10.8 million (2009: £8.6 million).
The Group’s credit facilities include a term loan of £555.6 million (2009: £800.0 million) and a Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) of  
£250.0 million (2009: £250.0 million) both expiring and repayable in April 2011. The RCF facility was not drawn at 28 August 2010 or  
29 August 2009. Interest rates are based on LIBOR and denominated in sterling. In October 2009 a prepayment on the term loan of 
£100.0 million was made. A further £75.0 million voluntary repayment of the term loan was made in January 2010.
The Group has also taken advantage of current credit market conditions to buy back its debt in the market. During the year the Group 
purchased debt with a par value of £30.2 million (2009: £61.4 million).
During the year the Group has complied with its covenants relating to its credit facilities.
Issue costs, which mainly relate to facility costs, are being amortised over the term of the facilities at the effective interest rate based 
on the committed amount of the term loan. The amortisation charge relating to the issue costs of the credit facilities for the year 
ended 28 August 2010 was £5.7 million (2009: £4.4 million).
The Group signed a new forward starting facility in July 2010, comprising a term loan of £250.0 million and a Revolving Credit Facility 
of £400.0 million. The new facility is available to the Group from April 2011, upon expiry or cancellation of the existing facility, and 
expires in October 2013 with an option to extend to October 2014. Additional reﬁnancing costs of £10.3 million were incurred in the 
year, of which £7.9 million has been capitalised against debt representing the proportion of the facility that is expected to be drawn 
down. The balance of £2.4 million is included in prepayments at 28 August 2010. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

i) Property Lease Obligations
In 1988 a number of properties were sold to a bank on 125-year leases at peppercorn rentals. The Group subsequently entered  
into full tenant and landlord repairing sub-leases for 125 years. At the year-end the following amounts remained outstanding under 
the leases:

  £m £m
Principal  37.7 37.7
Accrued interest  5.0 8.1
Outstanding liability  42.7 45.8
The rentals payable are structured so as to give the lessors a ﬁnancing return linked to LIBOR in the ﬁrst 25 years and, in the following 
ten years, a LIBOR linked return together with the repayment of capital. Thereafter, market rentals are payable subject to revision every 
ﬁve years. In the early years, the amounts payable are below LIBOR and in the later years are in excess of LIBOR. The ﬁnancing costs 
are, however, allocated over the 25-year period so as to achieve an annual funding cost which is consistent with LIBOR. The Group has 
limited rights up to the 25th year of the leases to vary the terms of the leases to buy out the rental obligations based on the properties’ 
original sales proceeds. The leases are reﬂected in ﬁxed assets at their cost to the Group.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group disposed of six of the nine properties. Further details of the disposal can be found 
in note 36 to the accounts.

22 Financial Risk Management
a) Financial Risks and Treasury Management
The Group conducts its Treasury activities within the remit of a Treasury Policy, which outlines approved policies, procedures and 
authority levels. The board delegates its responsibility for reviewing and approving Treasury Policy to the Audit Committee. Reports are 
prepared monthly covering all areas of treasury activity and policy compliance and are reviewed by the Finance Director. The board 
and Audit Committee receive regular reporting covering Treasury activities and policy compliance. Group Treasury manages the 
Group’s funding requirements and ﬁnancial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, available-for-sale 
assets, trade receivables and trade payables. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise ﬁnance 
for the Group.
Group Treasury uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Group’s ﬁnancing and 
currency risk arising from the Group’s operations. The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks, which include:
  funding and liquidity risk;
  credit risk;
  foreign exchange risk; and
 interest rate risk.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows:
i) Funding and Liquidity Risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufﬁcient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying 
business, Group Treasury aims to maintain ﬂexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group ﬁnances its operations by a combination of retained proﬁts, debt ﬁnance and leases. The objective is to ensure that there 
is sufﬁcient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash ﬂow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the Group’s net contractual undiscounted cash ﬂows in respect of non-derivative 
ﬁnancial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.

ii) Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group may suffer ﬁnancial loss through default by customers or ﬁnancial institutions. The Group has no 
signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk. Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of 
products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions 
are limited to high credit-quality ﬁnancial institutions. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one 
ﬁnancial institution. Cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with counterparties with a credit 
rating of A- or A3 or higher as assigned by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s respectively. The carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets 
recorded in the ﬁnancial statements net of any provision for losses represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
iii) Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with 
respect to the US dollar, the euro and to a lesser extent the Danish kroner.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group Treasury. 
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. 
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with 
a settlement of up to two years. Forecast cash ﬂows are hedged to the extent that those cash ﬂows are deemed highly probable. The 
Group regularly reviews the need to hedge foreign exchange exposure arising from the proﬁts, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling 
businesses, hedging those exposures to the extent that they are considered appropriate for hedging.
A gain of £4.3 million (2009: £27.9 million) was reclassiﬁed from equity to the Income Statement within cost of sales during the year in 
respect of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ﬂow hedges.
The notional value of open forward foreign exchange contracts at 28 August 2010 was £425.0 million (2009: £258.5 million). The net 
fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts at 28 August 2010 are £6.4 million (2009: losses of £1.6 million). This will 
be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next two years.
During the year there were no contracts reclassiﬁed to “held for trading” due to cash ﬂow hedges being ineffective.
iv) Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. The Group’s current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that 
expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Group’s business plan and the ﬁnancial covenants under 
its facilities. The aim is to reduce exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an 
appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the ﬂexibility to minimise early termination costs. The Group’s interest 
rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target ﬁxed percentage of 75 per cent, with a 15 per cent tolerance (60-90 per cent). Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes
89
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
22 Financial Risk Management continued
a) Financial Risks and Treasury Management continued
iv) Interest Rate Risk continued
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of ﬂoating rate debt and interest rate swaps. These are usually 
matched with speciﬁc loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Group’s main interest rate exposure is from the ﬂoating rate loans under the credit facilities. At the year end the Group’s hedged 
borrowings amounted to £302.5 million, being 51 per cent of the Group’s total borrowings. Following the reﬁnancing in July 2010, the 
Group is currently reviewing its longer term interest rate hedging arrangements and as part of this process, subsequent to 28 August 2010, 
additional hedging has been put in place such that the hedging level has increased to above the minimum 60 per cent required 
by policy.
Interest Rate Swaps
The Group’s interest rate swaps switch interest from ﬂoating rates to ﬁxed rates. The Group’s interest rate swap portfolio is summarised 
as follows:
 Notional Rate 
 £m % Maturity
Interest rate swaps 302.5 1.654–5.373 November 2011 to October 2013
The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps at 29 August 2009 was £727.5 million. The net gains and losses on these swaps, 
which are deferred in equity, will reverse through interest in the Income Statement over the life of the swaps. During the year a loss of 
£6.8 million was transferred from equity to the Income Statement within interest payable in respect of a portion of an interest rate swap 
that was closed during the year.
Financial Liabilities and Assets
The interest rate proﬁles of ﬁnancial liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from ﬂoating to ﬁxed rates, used to 
manage interest were as follows:

(1) Debt issue costs of £10.8 million (2009: £8.6 million) are excluded from the ﬁnancial liabilities above.
Fixed sterling ﬁnancial liabilities comprise the hedged portion of the term loan of £302.5 million and £4.0 million of accrued interest 
at 28 August 2010. The weighted average interest rate on the ﬁxed rate borrowings as at 28 August 2010 was 5.2 per cent (2009: 7.4 
per cent), with the weighted average time for which rates are ﬁxed being 2.9 years (2009: 1.0 years). Floating rate borrowings are 
interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR. Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates. 
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classiﬁed as ﬁxed if there were derivative ﬁnancial instruments hedging the ﬂoating rate interest 
for more than one year.

v) Other Price Risk
The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date. At the year end, 
if the valuations had been 10 per cent higher/lower when all other variables were held constant:
 net proﬁt would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classiﬁed as available-for-sale investments; and
  other reserves would decrease/increase by £0.3 million (2009: £0.4 million) for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value 
of available-for-sale investments.
b) Capital Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, provide returns 
for shareholders and beneﬁts to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider: the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, the return 
of capital to shareholders, the issue or sale of shares; or the sale of assets to reduce debt.
The Group routinely monitors its capital and liquidity requirements through leverage ratios consistent with industry-wide borrowing 
standards, maintaining suitable headroom to bank facility covenants and credit market requirements to ensure ﬁnancing requirements 
continue to be serviceable.
c) Fair Value Estimates
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows. The fair value of forward 
currency contracts has been determined based on discounted market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their 
book values. In the case of the Group’s loans due in more than one year, the fair value of ﬁnancial liabilities for disclosure purposes is 
estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ﬂows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities to their fair 
values at the year end.
d) Sensitivity Analysis
The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on proﬁt of a range of possible changes in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The range of sensitivities chosen, being 1 per cent movement in the interest rate or 5 per 
cent movement in sterling when compared to US dollar and euro, reﬂects the Group’s view of potential changes to these risk variables 
which existed at the year end.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates 
in relation to all the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments. The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and 
existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement. The table below illustrates the estimated impact on 
the Group as a result of market movements in interest rates in relation to all the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments that are expressed in 
currencies different to that of the functional currency.

Fair Value Measurement
The Group has adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 which requires ﬁnancial instruments to be grouped into a fair value hierarchy 
based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the hierarchy are:
 Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) based on active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
  Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, 
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
 Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following table shows the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities as measured at fair value at 28 August 2010:

24 Retirement Beneﬁt Obligation
The Group operates deﬁned beneﬁt type pension schemes, being the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan and the Debenhams 
Retirement Scheme (together “the Group’s pension schemes”), the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Both pension schemes were closed for future service accrual from 31 October 2006. The closure to future accrual will not affect the 
pensions of those who have retired or the deferred beneﬁts of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006. Future 
pension arrangements are provided through a money purchase stakeholder plan or a deﬁned contribution scheme for the employees 
in the Republic of Ireland. 
In accordance with the recovery plan for the Group’s pension schemes, the Group has agreed to contribute £5.8 million per annum 
from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011 increasing by annual RPI from the year to 31 December 2009 to fund past service beneﬁts.  
The Group has also agreed to contribute a further £7.0 million from 1 April 2011 until 31 August 2021, increasing by annual RPI from 
the year to 31 December 2009. If the Company pays or declares a dividend during the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011, the

28 Acquisition of Magasin du Nord (“Magasin”)
On 7 November 2009 the Group entered into an agreement to purchase 100 per cent of the shares of A/S Th. Wessell & Vett,  
Magasin du Nord (‘Magasin’), a company registered in Denmark owning six department stores. Consideration of DKK 56.8 million 
(£6.7 million) was paid in cash. The Group ﬁnalised the post closing issues related to the purchase of Magasin in July 2010. Costs of 
£1.0 million were incurred on the acquisition of Magasin; these costs are included within exceptional administrative expenses in the 
Income Statement.
Restructuring costs of £1.8 million were incurred subsequent to the date of acquisition and have been charged to exceptional 
administrative expenses during the year.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is set out below:
   Fair value 
Recognised assets and liabilities of Magasin at 7 November 2009   £m
Property, plant and equipment   12.6
Intangible assets   2.2

Trade and other payables   (35.8)
Bank overdrafts and borrowings   (2.3)
Total   13.5
Fair value of consideration transferred   (6.7)
Bargain purchase credit   6.8
The Group has recognised a bargain purchase credit within other exceptional operating income, of £6.8 million, relating to the 
acquisition of Magasin, as the fair value of the net assets was in excess of the amount paid. The Group considers that the bargain 
purchase credit arose due to the economic climate at the time of the acquisition.
Total trade and other receivables include contractual lease deposits of £17.4 million at the date of acquisition. These amounts have 
been presented as non-current assets within other receivables. Trade and other receivables are all stated at fair value.
The impact on the results of Debenhams plc for the period from acquisition to 28 August 2010 is to increase revenue by £103.6 million 
and increase operating proﬁt before exceptional items by £1.5 million.
Magasin demerged certain business activities on 31 October 2009. Prior to this date Magasin reported all businesses as one unit 
within its management accounts. For this reason it has not been practicable to estimate the effects of the acquisition of Magasin on 
the results for the full 52-week period to 28 August 2010.

A description of the nature and purpose of each reserve is set out below:
Share Premium Account
On admission to the London Stock Exchange, the Company issued 358,974,359 shares at £1.95, generating proceeds of £700.0 
million. Costs directly associated with the issue of the new shares totalled £17.1 million and in accordance with the Companies Act 
these costs were set off against the premium generated on issue of the new shares. 
Merger Reserve
The merger reserve of £1,200.9 million exists as a result of the 2005 Group reconstruction. 
On 26 June 2009, a share issue was completed and 404.0 million ordinary shares with a total nominal value of £0.04 million were 
issued for net consideration of £303.8 million. The share issue was effected through a structure which resulted in a merger reserve 
arising under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. During the year ended 28 August 2010 this amount was transferred to retained 
earnings following the settlement of this structure. 
Reverse Acquisition Reserve
The reverse acquisition reserve exists as a result of the method of accounting for the 2005 Group reconstruction. In accordance with 
International Accounting Standards, the 2005 Group reconstruction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition. 
Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve represents the change in fair value of all interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts which have 
been designated as cash ﬂow hedges. 
Other Reserve
The other reserve represents the change in fair value in respect of the Group’s available-for-sale investments (see note 16) and 
exchange differences arising as part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation. 
Retained earnings
During the year ended 28 August 2010 the discount arising on the repurchase of the term loan of £2.4 million was recycled to the

i) The Debenhams Performance Share Plan (the “PSP”)
The PSP is intended to facilitate the retention of senior executives of the Company by enabling executives to receive shares provided 
that they remain in the Group. An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be 
exercised within six months of vesting. No payment is required for the grant of an award. An award under the PSP will comprise an 
option to receive free shares or nil cost options with performance conditions attached. Awards under the scheme have been made 
since May 2006.
Options Granted on 7 May 2008
The vesting of half of the shares granted is dependent on Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth. In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based 
Payments” this is classiﬁed as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value. The vesting of the 
remaining half of the shares is dependent upon Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over a three-year period when compared to total 
shareholder return of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index. The fair value of the PSP options granted for this proportion of the award is 
calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation model assuming the inputs shown in the table below.
Options Granted on 24 November 2009
The vesting on the shares granted under this plan is dependent on Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth. In accordance with IFRS 2 
“Share-based Payments”, this is classiﬁed as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value.  
The fair value of the PSP options granted for these awards is calculated based on a Black Scholes model assuming the inputs shown 
in the table below.

In accordance with the plan rules, options issued in November 2006 and May 2007 have lapsed during the year as neither the EPS 
nor the TSR performance conditions were met.
ii) Executive Share Option Plan (the “ESOP”)
The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees. These options will normally become exercisable 
following a three-year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have 
been satisﬁed. Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately 
preceding the date of grant.
Options Granted on 12 November 2007
The vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on EPS growth and the fair value of the share options has been calculated 
using a binomial model. The key assumptions are set out in the table below.
Options Granted on 24 November 2009
The vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) growth and the fair value of

In accordance with the plan rules, options issued in November 2006 and May 2007 have lapsed as the performance conditions 
associated with these options were not met. 
The weighted average exercise price of the ESOP at 28 August 2010 was 95.1 pence (2009: 146.4 pence).
iii) Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”)
The SIP allows the Company to grant options to a small number of key, senior employees below board level, whom the Company 
wishes to retain and incentivise in the short to medium term. The options currently granted under the SIP have an 18-month vesting 
period based on the employee’s continued employment and are granted with no exercise price.
The fair value of the SIP options granted is calculated based on a Black Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below:

At the year-end the Group gave guarantees in the normal course of business which related to an insurance letter of credit for 
£5.0 million (2009: £5.0 million) and a duty deferment guarantee of £6.3 million (2009: £6.4 million).
The Group is subject to litigation from time to time as a result of its activities. The Group establishes provisions in connection with 
litigation where it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and, where it is more likely that not an outﬂow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Since these provisions, which are 
reﬂected in the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements, represent estimates, the ﬁnal resolution of any such matters could have a 
material affect on the Group’s operating results and cash ﬂows for a particular reporting period. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Gross Transaction Value
Revenue from concessions and consignment sales is required to be shown on a net basis, being the commission received rather than 
the gross value achieved by the concessionaire on the sale. Management believes that gross transaction value, which presents 
revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, consignments, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, 
represents a good guide to the overall activity of the Group.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements of Debenhams plc for the year ended 28 August 2010 which comprise 
the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Parent 
Company Financial Statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the Financial Statements.
Opinion on Financial Statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 28 August 2010;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the Parent Company Financial Statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Parent Company Financial Statements. 
Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
  the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements of Debenhams plc for the year ended 28 August 2010.

1 Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
These Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with UK GAAP using the historical 
cost convention as modiﬁed by ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through proﬁt 
and loss. These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards within the United 
Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ﬂow statement in accordance with FRS 1 (revised 1996) 
“Cash Flow Statement”.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” from disclosing related party transactions with 
entities that are part of the Debenhams Group.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently during the year, are set out below.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment Testing
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject 
to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and value in use.
Borrowings
All borrowings are stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue costs together with 
ﬁnance costs, are charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the term of the borrowings. Finance costs represent a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates that are in force during the period.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the taxable proﬁts and the results as stated in the Financial 
Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only 
when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be taxable proﬁts from which 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Dividend Distribution
A ﬁnal dividend distribution to the Company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s Financial Statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Share-Based Payments
Where the Company has granted options over the Company shares to employees of its subsidiaries, a capital contribution has been 
deemed to be made by the Company. This is then recharged to the subsidiary and is based on the fair value of the options issued 
spread over the options vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that 
are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued

Section 4
Financial Statements and Notes
110
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010
1 Accounting Policies continued
Derivatives
The derivative instruments used by the Company to manage its interest rate risk are interest rate swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at 
fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective 
hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly 
probable forecast transactions (cash ﬂow hedges).
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ﬂows of hedged items.
i) Cash Flow Hedges
The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the proﬁt and loss account 
which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when 
the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance Sheet or in the proﬁt and loss account.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting 
is discontinued. Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is held in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When 
a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
reclassiﬁed to the relevant line of the proﬁt and loss account which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii) Derivatives That Do Not Qualify for Hedge Accounting
Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the proﬁt and loss account.
2 Proﬁt and Loss Account
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not 
presented a proﬁt and loss account for the Company alone. A loss of £883.0 million is attributable to shareholders for the ﬁnancial 
year ended 28 August 2010 (2009: proﬁt £70.9 million).
The contracts of employment for all the executive directors are held by Debenhams plc. The total cost of employing the directors is 
disclosed in the Remuneration Report. 
Auditors’ remuneration of £0.1 million (2009: £0.1 million) is borne by another Group undertaking.

Investment in Subsidiary Undertakings
As part of the Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer which was announced on 4 June 2009, the Company acquired 89 ordinary 
shares at a price of £1 per share and 250,000,000 preference shares at a price of £1.255 per share, amounting to £313.6 million,  
in Kylie (Jersey) Limited, a Jersey incorporated company. During the year ended 28 August 2010 the preference shares in Kylie (Jersey) 
Limited were redeemed.
In accordance with FRS 11 “Impairment of ﬁxed assets and goodwill” the carrying values of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings 
have been compared to their recoverable amounts represented by the value in use to the Company. The review has resulted in an 
impairment of £970.8 million (2009: nil). As in previous years the impairment has been charged to the proﬁt and loss account, which 
is set off in full by a reserves transfer from the merger reserve. The discount rate used in the calculation to arrive at the valuation was 
8.0 per cent (2009: 8.0 per cent) on a pre-tax basis.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 28 August 2010 are shown in note 35 of the Debenhams Group Financial

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 budget statement. The Finance (No. 2) Act 
2010, which was substantially enacted on 20 July 2010, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28 to 27 
per cent and has been reﬂected in these Financial Statements. The proposed future changes in the years to 2014 bringing the rate 
from 27 to 24 per cent have not been applied. The effect of these changes would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by £0.2 million.
Deferred tax provided on the fair value gains represents the deferred tax on the derivatives that qualify for cash ﬂow hedges.

Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve represents the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps which have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges.
Merger Reserve
The merger reserve was created as a result of the Company acquiring the Baroness Group Holdings Limited Group on 24 May 2005. 
The merger reserve represents the difference between both the nominal value of the share capital and loan notes issued by the 
Company and the fair value of Baroness Group Holdings Limited Group at the date of acquisition less any subsequent adjustments 
as a result of an impairment. During the year to 28 August 2010, an impairment was made of £970.8 million resulting in a transfer from 
the merger reserve to retained earnings (see note 4).
On 26 June 2009 the share issue in relation to the ﬁrm placing and the placing and open offer was completed and 404.0 million 
ordinary shares with a total nominal value of £0.04 million were issued for consideration of £303.8 million, net of issue costs of £19.4 
million. The issue was effected through a structure which resulted in a merger reserve arising under Section 612 of the Companies Act 
2006. These shares have been redeemed during the year resulting in a transfer from the merger reserve to the proﬁt and loss account 
of £303.8 million.
Proﬁt and Loss Account
No dividends were paid by the Company during the year ended 28 August 2010.

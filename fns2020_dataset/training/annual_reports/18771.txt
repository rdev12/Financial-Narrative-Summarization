inland Homes is an established land regeneration business, focused 
on developing sites in southern England for residential and mixed 
use projects. Our foundations have been built on a proactive and 
decisive approach to identifying the right land opportunities, and our 
ability to navigate the complex planning system and maximises the 
potential of the final development.
Our versatile structure, relatively small team, local insight 
and opportunistic approach gives us a competitive advantage, 
ensuring we can react fast to secure the sites we want at a price 
that maximises returns. Once secured, our knowledge of and 
relationships with local authorities, and the wealth of experience in 
our land team, means that we are able to secure the right planning 
consent for the sites we own and manage.
Our ambitious developments, combining style, comfort and 
sustainability for a wide social demographic, deliver appropriate 
rewards for our business, our stakeholders, our shareholders and 
the local community. 
increasingly, we are utilising our own land bank to grow our 
housebuilding operations and this growth will continue to optimise 
our revenue profile.

CHaIr Man’ S
STATEMEn T
The performance of the business has been outstanding with all our strategic objectives 
having been achieved. These include increasing our housebuilding completions, 
substantially growing our land bank and achieving industry-leading margins.
Private unit completions (including those managed on behalf of DGvl ) more than doubled 
to 114 (2013: 55) with 436 units under construction across nine development sites. The 
unmet demand for homes in the UK continues to grow, a situation that is exacerbated by 
the continuing shortage of supply. The demand in the south and south east of England, 
where the Group operates, is particularly strong and is demonstrated by the forward sales 
position, for both inland and DGvl , of £54.6m in respect of units which have been reserved 
or where contracts have been exchanged. This places us in a strong position and we would 
expect that our net borrowings, which at the year end amounted to £28.8m (2013: £3.90m), 
to reduce significantly over the next six months as a result of these forward sales, along 
with a number of planned land disposals.
The number of building plots sold in the year, including plots sold 
by DGvl , was 169 (2013: 451) reflecting our strategy to grow our 
housebuilding activities. Despite the land disposals and unit completions, 
i am pleased to report that the land bank has also increased by 61.9% 
since 3 October 2013 to 3,734 plots (including those managed on behalf 
of DGvl ) of which 1,318 plots have planning permission. This pipeline of 
residential plots is anticipated to result in future gross development value 
of £1.1bn. in addition to these plots the land bank contains commercial 
space which currently generates annual rental income of £605,000.
The Group’s operating expenses increased as we continued to invest in personnel, in line 
with our growing turnover and profitability. 
Given the Group’s strong earnings, growth and forward sales position, the Board is 
proposing to increase the dividend by 122.2% to 0.60p (2013: 0.27p) per share subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM which is to be held on 1 December 2014. The final 
dividend will be paid to shareholders on 9 January 2015.
i would like to take this opportunity to thank our small, entrepreneurial and highly 
motivated team for all their hard work which has been reflected by these highly 
commendable and record results. They also continue to create inspiring development 
opportunities that i have no doubt will stand the Group in good stead over future years.

Our local insight and established 
relationships mean that inland Homes is 
always aware of opportunities to increase 
its land bank. we have particularly strong 
ties with central l ondon agents, the MoD 
and other Government organisations, 
which frequently lead to new deals. 
Sites of varying value and size located 
around the M25 and the south and 
south east of England remain our 
priority. intensive legal, financial and 
land research is carried out at the 
identification stage, supported by our 
in-house architect and a number of 
planning/architectural consultants. 
Research into key factors such as local 
employment and transport links also 
influences our decisions.
Our appraisals and due diligence 
minimise risk and reinforce the land’s 
potential, ensuring that we fully 
understand the opportunity and that only 
sites with the right risk/reward balance 
are selected for acquisition. Payment 
terms for the land we buy can be deferred 
for up to three or four years with land 
being released to inland Homes as and 
when payment is made.
aCqu Ire  
l An D
Our flexible structure and motivated, 
close-knit team combine to enable 
us to make swift and astute decisions 
concerning the land that we buy. As well 
as the more usual sites we acquire for 
development, we also target strategic 
parcels of land where we consider that the 
site will be key to securing further land or 
development opportunities in the future. 
Government organisations and vendors 
generally sell to developers that can 
make a success of the land acquired, 
deliver much needed housing and meet 
potential future contractual terms 
such as overage. in that respect, inland 
Homes has a reputation for meeting 
and exceeding these expectations, thus 
strengthening our case when making 
offers on new land acquisitions.
Sites acquired can often deliver short 
term returns through the sale of surplus 
assets or rent from tenants (acquiring 
sites can sometimes mean that inland 
Homes becomes a short term landlord 
until new development has begun).

Once a site is acquired, work begins to

the needs of all affected parties — 
Government, l ocal Authorities, local

Our expertise in designing sites involves 
detailed surveys, public consultations and

Homes are designed to deliver the 
maximum value for our stakeholders.
inland Homes produces comprehensive 
development proposals that are 
supported by robust financial viability

Applications are further leveraged by our 
ability and experience in delivering ‘green’ 
sites that are energy efficient and offer 
carbon reductions. we typically allow 
18 to 24 months to secure a planning 
permission for a newly acquired site.
We are proud of the developments we plan and design, and 
are always looking to create communities attractive to future 
residents. Delivering on our commitment to quality and comfort, 
developed sites feature open spaces, play areas and immaculate

Historically, once consent has been 
achieved, inland Homes would sell the 
site with outline planning permission to 
developers or housing associations for a 
short term return. w hilst we remain keen 
to further our housebuilding operations, 
where appropriate this strategy will 
continue. 
we have good relationships with our 
land-buying customers and most 
transactions happen once the necessary 
ground remediation (removal of pollution 
and contaminants) has happened and 
the infrastructure has been installed. A 
‘serviced site’ contains all the necessary 
drainage and roads, etc. already in place. 
As housebuilders ourselves, we know how 
to meet the needs of potential developers 
in order for them to be able to move 
quickly. 
Those developing on parts of our sites 
are required to follow our ‘Design Code’ 
for consistency. This ensures the site 
has a look and feel in keeping with the 
development as a whole and with the 
local area.
Deve LOP aLL Or Part OF 
THE SiTE
w hile portions of our sites are still sold 
to other developers, inland Homes 
is increasingly using its land bank to 
grow as a housebuilder. By installing 
infrastructure and selling parts of a site, 
whilst carrying out our own housebuilding 
on other parts, we are delivering 
additional revenue in the medium term. 
Our customers for land are major 
housebuilders, medium tier and smaller 
local developers and our homes are 
acquired by private purchasers as owner 
occupiers or as investors. we also 
have strong relationships with Housing 
Associations and investors in the private 
rented sector. 
value is returned to inland Homes either 
as milestone payments as construction 
takes place, or as payments when units 
are completed, both of which provide 
regular cash flow. l arge projects 
usually require a ‘mixed use scheme’, 
where inland Homes will develop the 
commercial plots that are then let to 
tenants. value is realised by managing 
the asset for a short period of time before 
selling the investment to a third party.

w ith greater gross margins achieved on 
our own housebuilding, building a whole 
development ourselves takes longer but 
maximises the revenue a site can deliver 
over the long term. inland Homes has 
substantially increased its housebuilding 
activities over the recent past and we 
expect this to continue.
we have forged strong relationships with 
main contractors and third parties that have 
a reputation and track record for delivering 
stunning homes. By agreeing fixed-price 
contracts upfront we are minimising 
risk during the construction stage, with 
payments only being made on valuation 
certificates provided by surveyors who have 
assessed the on-site progress made by the 
contractors on our behalf.
As well as delivering value, we are 
proud of the developments we plan 
and design, and are always looking to 
create communities attractive to future 
residents. Delivering on our commitment 
to quality and comfort, developed sites 
feature open spaces, play areas and 
immaculate landscaping to suit the needs 
of a wide variety of people.
We take a collaborative approach to 
the whole process of developing a 
site, from planning to completion, 
by maintaining a dialogue with our 
partners and contractors.

Our
STRATEGy
Inland Homes has a clear strategy focused on maximising the 
value of its land bank, realising value at appropriate stages during 
the development cycle to support ongoing sustainable growth and 
therefore delivering shareholder value. 
Our strategy focuses on four key goals:
1
increase the size of our land bank year on year
2
Continue the core activity of plot sales to other developers to 
generate cash to fund our operations
3
Maximise the value from our land bank by expanding our 
housebuilding programme
4
Maintain borrowings at a manageable level through a strong 
focus on cash management and vendor financing
w ith strong demand for land in the south and south east of England, we will continue 
to capture land trading margin by selling brownfield land with planning permission 
to developers. At the same time, we are growing and utilising our capabilities as a 
housebuilder (436 units now under construction). we look to extract value using the 
appropriate option available to us through the value chain, with a focus on the cash needs 
of the business. Making use of equity, debt funding and vendor financing, we will grow 
the business by capitalising on buoyant market conditions and achieving better margins 
through housebuilding, whilst maintaining a sound working capital position. 
w ith short, medium and long term value releasing options available, we will support our 
strategy of expanding the land bank year on year. we will continue to meet the needs of 
our customers and build on our strong relationships with institutional purchasers. Our 
outsourcing model makes the business agile and quick to capitalise on market conditions, 
enabling us to easily scale-up or scale-down when appropriate. 
Adding to our team of industry experts we have invested in additional resources including 
planners, architectural designers, project managers, and sales and marketing people to 
build extra capacity to support our growth journey as housebuilders, which will provide 
more regular earnings for shareholders.

q&a On Strateg Y  
wi TH STEPHEn wi CKS
Could you explain the strategic logic behind the recent expansion of 
your housebuilding activity and can we expect more of it in the future?
inland Homes is all about extracting maximum value from its well-located land bank. Our 
strategy of acquiring brownfield sites at the pre-planning stage and its long track record of 
planning success, positions the Group as a housebuilder with exceptional skills in large scale 
brownfield development. n ow that market conditions in the sector have returned to normal 
it makes sense for us to secure the additional development margin that can be achieved 
through the housebuilding process. The Group is intending to increase its housebuilding 
activities with the short term objective of building approximately 500 units per annum.
Inland Homes’ land bank currently stands at 3,734 plots. What’s your 
target, in both the short and medium term? Is the end game for Inland 
to grow the landbank to a size that makes the Company a takeover 
target for a bigger, national housebuilder?
The Group’s target is to have a land bank of approximately 5,000 plots within the next 12 
months. The Group is now firing on all cylinders. we have some fantastic development 
opportunities in the land bank and other housebuilders would naturally be interested in 
our activities. we are not expecting to be taken over in the foreseeable future.
How much more value are you likely to extract from Drayton garden 
village? and when do you expect to fully complete and exit the project?
w ith our current housebuilding phase we expect to extract 2.8p per share (net of tax), 
however with the prospect of a large forward sale of over 200 apartments for private 
rented, we could extract up to 5.0p per share (net of tax) from this development.
Which of your projects do you expect to be the primary cash generators 
in the current financial year?
There are a number of projects that will generate cash in the current financial year. The 
notable ones are expected to be woolwich, Drayton Garden village and our west Plaza 
development in Ashford, Middlesex.
What role do you feel the private rented sector has to play in solving the 
nation’s housing shortage? Is this an area that Inland Homes is exploring?
w ith affordability becoming a big issue in the south east the private rented sector should 
play a big part in creating new opportunities for people to rent good quality housing with 
perhaps more certainty of tenure.
What does next year’s general election, and a potential change of 
government, mean for the housebuilding industry?
All the political parties have now woken up to the importance of supporting increased 
housebuilding. My personal ‘worst nightmare’ would be a l ib-Dem/l abour coalition led  
by vince Cable!

You have increased the dividend significantly. How did you determine 
the level?
The Board wanted to ensure that the dividend was progressive, in line with its intention 
announced at the time of our 2012 results. The amount was neither driven by dividend cover 
or yield, but determined in consideration of the Group’s cash requirements for the foreseeable 
future. The yield based on the current share price is approximately 1.3% and although this 
is above the average yield from all AiM companies, the Board believes that the majority of 
investors are seeking growth and not a dividend yield.
Has securing finance become any easier in recent times?
Procuring development finance for housebuilding has become relatively easier for inland 
Homes than a few years ago. However, obtaining funding for land with or without planning 
consent is extremely difficult. Although one or two entrants have emerged for land finance, 
the Group endeavours to structure its land acquisitions by the use of 
vendor financing or from its own cash resource.
given the increase in the group’s housebuilding activity, 
should we expect net debt to continue to rise? What kind 
of level would you be comfortable with?
Debt levels have increased in line with the expansion of our housebuilding activity as 
expected by the Board. The Group expects borrowings to reduce by the half year due to 
a significant number of legal completions of residential units and some land sales. The 
Group’s borrowings are controlled by a gearing covenant imposed by the Zero Dividend 
Preference shareholders. The Board would be comfortable with an average gearing 
of 30%, although there may be times when a planned increase will take place where a 
reduction could be forecast within a short period of time.
What are your expectations for nav and profit growth for the current 
financial year?
we expect profits to continue to increase with both stated and underlying net asset value 
continuing to grow at a very respectable rate. The consensus forecast in the market, for 
profit before tax for the year ending 30 June 2015, is £12m.
It’s very difficult to ascertain a ‘true’ nav value for Inland, given assets 
are held on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Could you not revalue your portfolio annually or provide some 
guidance to investors?
Accounting Standards preclude the Group from revaluing its stock and work in progress in the 
accounts. As an indication to investors of the potential unrealised value within the land owned 
by the Group, the average cost per plot of £38,000 should be compared to the open market 
value of consented plots. As a general rule of thumb, the value of a consented plot equates 
to 30% of the value of the home. Based on the average UK house price of £274,000 this could 
result in a consented plot value of approximately £82,000.

How do Inland discover new plots of land?
The land team at inland are constantly researching and approaching landowners to source 
new development opportunities. The most common way we come across potential sites 
for acquisition is through our extensive and strong network of connections and contacts 
with vendors, landowners and agents. Over the last 20 years we have worked hard at 
establishing and maintaining relationships. My land team and i, often accompanied by 
Stephen w icks, our CEO, frequently identify and personally meet with agents to build new 
relationships. inland also advertise nationally in the trade press. it has always been a strict 
policy of inland to conduct ourselves with the utmost integrity and so to behave reliably, 
transparently and professionally. Our due diligence before signing any contract means 
that we are always upfront with our business partners, and deliver the agreed services as 
promised. This is proven in our strong track record, which has led to positive long term 
relationships, where organisations return to us time and again. Many new opportunities 
for buying land are generated in this way.
Who are some of these key relationships with?
Much of the brownfield land we acquire has previously been used by the public sector, 
from hospitals to military bases. The Government has responded to the nationwide 
housing shortage by providing the impetus to the public sector to release more land for 
housebuilding. One of the key sources of land for us has been the Ministry of Defence, 
from whom we have acquired four sites. This is an example of an ongoing relationship 
where demonstrating our ability to deliver has led to further opportunities.
we also attract and retain relationships with individual agents with our flexible business 
model, which means we can involve them throughout the process of developing a site.
w hen an agent introduces us to a land opportunity, we can offer them multiple fees beyond 
the introductory fee. if we go on to sell the land we can utilise their services again, or 
similarly if we build homes on the site they can act as agents for selling the properties.
What is the strategy for deciding which sites to purchase?
we undertake extensive research on all prospective acquisitions, involving input from 
various colleagues across inland’s departments. it is essential that we quickly identify the 
sites with potential, so that we utilise our expertise efficiently, commencing detailed due 
diligence on only the most promising and suitable opportunities.
we assess on average 15–20 sites a week to see whether they meet our criteria on a 
planning, technical and financial basis. Of these, those that are suitable are discussed 
with our architectural, planning and technical teams, who undertake further due diligence. 
Only around 10% of opportunities are taken beyond this stage. The land and planning 
teams then debate the various opportunities that a given site presents and how it fits 
into our strategy for growing our land bank. This might include considering whether it 
can generate sufficient dwelling numbers and whether the site location can be exploited 
strategically, by opening up further opportunities with adjoining land or unlocking further 
sites in the area. By the time we have decided to pursue a site, we have completed a 
comprehensive analysis that provides both us and our partners with clarity on our position.
17
we have added 17 sites to our land 
bank over the last year. Significantly, 
we have also begun to expand our land 
portfolio to include strategic sites.

MARKETPl ACE
Throughout 2014, the UK housing market has shown continuing signs of improvement. The 
number of transactions has increased and the pent up demand has subsequently seen 
prices rise. 
in the south-east of England where inland Homes predominantly operates, the Office for 
n ational Statistics (On S) found that property prices have soared by 11.6% in the year to 
August 2014. w ith growth in employment expected in the south east over the next decade, 
housing demand and prices are set to continue rising.
Government schemes such as Help to Buy, Build to Rent and the Builders Finance Fund 
have seen new housing supply rising, with new housing starts at 137,780 in the 12 months to 
June 2014, up by 22% compared to the year before.
However, there are currently insufficient new houses being built to keep up with the growing 
demand, which is estimated at over 250,000 units p.a., and demand is approximately double 
what is being built. with an ageing population meaning fewer occupants 
per property, the long term shortage of homes is likely to continue.
in terms of buyers, Government schemes such as Help to Buy are 
building on these signs of recovery. The Help to Buy home ownership 
scheme will run until 2020. Over half of the 114 private completions this 
year used this scheme. 
There is also the Build to Rent Fund, which was launched to stimulate new private rented 
housing supply. it is anticipated that the fund will be used to finance the building of over 
200 apartments at DGv being sold to a PRS investment fund.
The UK Government’s reforms to make the planning system less complex and easier to 
understand has recently resulted in a change of legislation to promote office to residential 
conversion under “prior approval notification” procedures, and this has been useful on one 
of the Group’s projects.
inland Homes sells the majority of its houses to UK purchasers. However, recently it sold 
14 apartments from the west Plaza, Ashford, Middlesex development to customers in 
Hong Kong. There is evidence that overseas demand for UK property is strong, with 15% of 
all new buildings in l ondon now purchased by foreign buyers.
With growth in employment expected 
in the south east over the next 
decade, housing demand and prices 
are set to continue rising.

This was another outstanding year of progress for Inland Homes.
we are benefiting from better market conditions with improved mortgage availability, 
together with a boost for homebuyers from the Government’s Help to Buy initiative. Of the 
114 private legal completions, 62 purchasers used the funding provided by the scheme. 
The core activity of our business remains the acquisition of predominantly brownfield land 
acquired without planning permission. we have also made a decision to supplement our 
brownfield activities with a number of longer term strategic sites where land is secured 
under a long term option at a discount to market value. The land portfolio includes six 
such sites with the potential for 620 plots.
Since last year’s report a number of substantial milestones were achieved in our site 
acquisition programme, namely:
ra F Stanbridge, Leighton buzzard, bedfordshire
•	 Former MoD site with consent now achieved for 175 plots plus 
commercial space
r eading r oad, Henley, Oxfordshire
•	 Former commercial site with scope for 55 plots
Lily’s Walk, High Wycombe, buckinghamshire
•	 Former gasworks with scope for 200 plots plus commercial space
queens r oad, High Wycombe, buckinghamshire
•	 Consent secured for 14 units
t he vale, acton, West London
•	 Builders’ merchants with scope for 100 plots plus commercial space
r ainsford r oad, Chelmsford, essex
•	 Former public house where we have secured consent for 14 units
t iptree, essex
•	 Former sports ground with scope for 40 plots
Meridian, Southampton, Hampshire
•	 Former Tv studios on seven acres with scope for 350 plots
aylesbury, buckinghamshire 
•	 Joint venture with another developer. A 50 acre site to be acquired jointly with scope for 
in excess of 300 plots plus commercial space
Loudwater, buckinghamshire
•	 A five acre investment property site producing income and having development potential 
and of strategic importance for the development of a wider area
Our performance this year 
demonstrates that we have the  
right strategy going forward. The

•	 Financial partners of inland have now completed the purchase of this 100 acre site 
from the Ministry of Defence, who were being challenged by a third party by way of a 
Judicial Review in respect of the sale. This Judicial Review has now been withdrawn. 
Shareholders may recall that inland Homes own the preferred access to this site which 
has been allocated in the l ocal Plan for in excess of 300 new homes. An agreement will 
be concluded with our financial partners in the near future now that the Judicial Review 
has been withdrawn.
The number of residential plots in the land bank of the Group and those separately held by 
DGvl is currently as follows:
Owned or contracted with planning consent 1,070
Drayton Garden village with planning consent 248
Owned or contracted without planning consent 605
Plots controlled or terms agreed 1,811
t otal plots 3,734
w hilst commercial investment and development is not a core activity, current annual 
rental income generated by the land bank now exceeds £600,000. This has been bolstered 
by the lease to Sainsbury’s at DGv that was let on a 15 year term with a starting rent of 
£64,000 per annum.
Of particular note in the year was our development at west Plaza, Ashford in Middlesex 
of 152 apartments. This project is nearing completion with total anticipated revenue of 
approximately £33.0m. 90% of the development is either contracted for sale or legally 
completed.

Planning permission was received for our development of 152 apartments and commercial 
space at Callis yard, woolwich in l ondon. This is a brownfield site which is opposite a new 
Crossrail station and close to the town centre. This planning consent has resulted in a very 
significant increase in the value of the site over its carrying value.
The strategy of acquiring sites in the outer boroughs of l ondon is gathering momentum 
and we were particularly pleased with the unconditional purchase of a builder’s yard 
in Acton, west l ondon which should yield over 100 residential units along with some 
commercial space.
Significant planning approvals or resolutions to grant planning permission gained in the 
year are as follows:

One of our intentions is to make forward sales of the units we construct to organisations 
that specialise in building up private rented portfolios. Heads of terms have recently been 
signed for a substantial development at Drayton Garden village of over 200 homes with an 
institution seeking to build a private rented portfolio in the UK. Construction is intended to 
be financed via the Government’s “Build to Rent” scheme.
we believe that with home ownership now being out of the reach of an increasingly large 
group of the younger population, private rented homes which are properly managed by 
long term landlords will become very popular with home occupiers as well as forming 
an exciting new asset class for institutional investors. inland expects to have substantial 
involvement in this sector using sites from its well located land bank. 
As mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement, these are excellent results but the key factor 
is that we have created a sound platform for growth. in addition, our performance this year 
demonstrates that we have the right strategy going forward.
The Group is in an excellent shape with tremendous momentum behind it as we move into 
the new financial year.
The considerable progress which is being made at inland is entirely due to our small, highly 
motivated team. i would like to thank them for their continued hard work, commitment and 
support in ensuring we deliver our strategy of growth and value for our shareholders.

The Group has produced a record set of results for the year ended 30 June 2014 with 
increasing revenues and profitability from housebuilding. inland’s strategic decision 
to increase the housebuilding activity was well timed to catch both the recovery in the 
housebuilding sector as well as the wider economy. Although debt funding for the 
acquisition of land with or without planning consent has been almost non-existent, there 
are signs of some entrants into this market. Finance for housebuilding has become far 
more readily available and this has assisted the expansion of our housebuilding activities.
The key highlights of our financial performance are:
•	 Revenue has increased by 28.0% to £39.8m (2013: £31.1m);
•	 Profit before tax has increased by 65.7% to £8.6m (2013: £5.2m);
•	 Basic earnings per share has increased by 45.0% to 2.87p (2013: 1.98p);
•	 Dividend per share increased by 122.0% to 0.60p (2013: 0.27p)
•	 n et assets per share increased by 10.1% to 31.6p (2013: 28.7p) 
which excludes the Group’s share of future profit from DGvl , 
currently estimated at 2.8p per share net of tax, and any 
unrealised gains within our land bank;
•	 year end cash balance of £11.2m (2013: £12.2m);
•	 n et gearing (including the accrued ZDP liability) has increased to 45.0% (2013: 6.7%) 
due to a planned increase in housebuilding.
t ra DIng Per FOr Man Ce
Group revenue was up by 28.0% to £39.8m (2013: £31.1m). This included land sales of 
£6.7m (2013: £16.4m), open market unit completions of £18.8m (2013: £11.4m), affordable 
home sales of £2.5m (2013: £nil) and fee income from DGvl of £6.6m (2013: £3.0m). The 
gross margin increased to 39.4% (2013: 24.7%) and the open market unit completions 
generated a gross margin of 27.5% (2013: 21.1%). The average selling price of the private 
units (including those sold on behalf of DGvl ) was £256,000 (2013: £208,000). The Group 
uses main contractors to construct all the units we build and after administrative overheads 
of £4.4m (2013: £2.7m) it has achieved an operating margin of 26.4% (2013: 16.3%). 
Administrative overheads have increased primarily due to an increase in staff costs.
FInan Ce ex Pen Se
As expected, the Group’s net debt has increased to £28.8m in comparison to £3.9m in the 
previous year primarily due to the expansion in housebuilding, and this resulted in the net 
finance expense increasing to £2.5m (2013: £1.4m). The net finance expense is covered 3.5 
times (2013: 3.7 times).
t axat IOn
The total tax charge represents 32.8% of profit before tax. This is significantly higher than 
the UK corporation tax rate because the Group wrote off £469,000 of the deferred tax asset 
due to a reduction in the future rate of corporation tax. £225,000 was also written off as 
a result of a stock and work in progress credit that has been released to cost of sales as 
it was originally subject to a notional interest adjustment due to deferred land payment 
The Group has produced a record set 
of results for the year ended 30 June 
2014 with increasing revenues and 
profitability from housebuilding.

terms. The current year tax charge of 25.3% is also high because of an impairment of the 
fair value of the option over shares in DGvl and the interest accrued to ZDP shareholders 
being disallowed for tax purposes.
earn Ing S Per SHare an D DIvIDen DS
Earnings per share has increased by 45.0% over the previous year to 2.87p (2013: 1.98p). 
The increase is disproportionate to the increase in profit before tax due to the higher tax 
charge in the current year as explained above and a higher level of brought forward tax 
losses available for relief in the previous year.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 0.60p per share for the year ended 30 June 2014, 
subject to approval by the shareholders. This is an increase of 122.2% in comparison to 
the previous year, in line with the progressive dividend strategy adopted by the Board and 
reflecting both the strong set of results as well as the confidence in the Group’s financial 
position. The dividend will be paid on 9 January 2015 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 12 December 2014. The ex-dividend date is 11 December 2014.
CaSH FLOWS
During the year the Group increased operating cash flows before movements in working 
capital by 125% to £11.6m (2013: £5.1m). The increase in investment in land and the 
expansion of the housebuilding activity led to £24.5m of cash outflow from operating 
activities which has predominantly been financed by a planned increase in debt. During 
the year, lenders have continued to remain very cautious in providing funding for land 
irrespective of whether it has planning permission or not. The Group had to therefore rely 
on its own resources as well as vendor financing to fund these purchases. in addition to 
bank debt, the Group raised £1.1m by way of issuing 934,900 Zero Dividend Preference 
shares with a gross redemption yield of 5.57% p.a.

The Group’s inventories increased by 101.8% over the previous year to £90.3m (2013: 
£44.7m) due to the purchase of eight new sites during the year as well as the increase in 
investment due to the number of units under construction. The amount due from DGvl 
has decreased to £10.5m (2013: £13.7m) resulting in a lower amount of trade and other 
receivables. Current liabilities increased from £18.5m to £51.0m as land creditors, trade 
creditors and loan balances have increased. n et gearing at the year end (including the 
accrued ZDP liability) was 45.0% (2013: 6.7%) and net assets increased to £64.0m (2013: 
£57.7m) equating to 31.6p per share. it should be noted that this figure excludes the 
Group’s share of future profit from DGvl , currently estimated at approximately 2.8p per 
share net of tax. it also excludes the unrealised added value accumulated within the land 
bank due to planning permissions achieved on some of the sites.

Drayton Garden Village is a significant development Inland Homes 
has been managing for several years on behalf of DGVL. It is a 
31 acre site, with planning permission for 773 residential units 
and 53,000 sq ft of commercial space, as well as community 
areas including several village greens. The development has 
provided the opportunity for Inland Homes to demonstrate their 
large scale housing construction capabilities, as well as to utilise 
environmentally friendly techniques and features, for which it has 
been recognised.

STUDy 1
Since the purchase of the land in 2009, Inland Homes have 
increased their profit share on the project from 35% to the 
maximum 90%. Inland obtained planning consent within 20 
months of acquisition for 773 residential units plus employment 
and community space with just 8% of the homes being provided as 
affordable housing, a significant reduction from the 50% target set 
by the London Plan at the time and, as such, maximising the value 
of the land. They have co-ordinated and managed the different 
areas and aspects of the site, including the sale of serviced plots 
to other property developers, as well as building a number of the 
homes for DGVL. This strategy has proved successful, enabling a 
staggered release of cash throughout the development process, 
and will be repeated in future projects.
At Drayton Garden village, the Group has accessed the growing private rented sector 
(PRS), through an agreed bulk sale of 205 units to an institution, a strategic move that 
will be repeated in future projects. The government is encouraging investment in PRS, 
to increase the supply of privately rented homes for the expanding rental market. inland 
Homes is seeking to diversify the risk profile of its projects and bring in large numbers of 
early sales.
inland Homes is managing the building of 387 homes within Drayton Garden village. Of 
these, it is overseeing the whole process of building and selling 75 houses and apartments, 
and has been contracted to construct 107 units by Paradigm Housing Association, and 
heads of terms have been agreed for a further 205 units to be constructed for PRS. These 
bulk sales can help release cash during the project, and de-risks the market risk.
The 75 units being built on behalf of DGvl have generated significant interest from buyers. 
The first 32 units released sold above market expectations, and at the release of the next 
group of homes, there was a queue of prospective buyers waiting to access the show 
homes. This scene, unheard of since before the financial crisis, was a testament to the 
desirability of this attractive development.
The project has significantly exceeded Group expectations, aided by the productive 
relationships that DGvl and inland Homes have established with their partners and 
contractors. A significant achievement at this site was securing a contract with E.On for 
the design, construction and maintenance of the energy centre. A fifteen year lease has 
also been secured with Sainsbury’s, benefiting the residents and providing a source of 
income. The external landscape has been completed following a productive collaboration 
with the landscape architects and contractors, and many of the homes have been built. 
A phased move in of residents to completed areas has seen 250-300 families settle into 
their homes, whilst the construction of the remaining homes, to bring the whole project to 
completion, is expected to conclude in 2017.

West Plaza, in Ashford, Middlesex, is an attractive modern 
development of two apartment complexes set around courtyards. 
The site was acquired by Inland Homes for its strong location, 
within two miles of Heathrow Airport and with excellent transport 
links into London. Planning was granted for 152 apartments, and 
construction of the site has progressed well, with the build nearing 
completion six months ahead of schedule.

The project has been planned to progress in four phases, with 
occupants moving into completed sections whilst other areas of 
the site are still in progress. The second phase has recently been 
completed, with new occupants moving in to join those that have 
been there since June. The third and fourth build phases are 
expected to finish in October and December 2014. This strategy 
has several advantages, including the realisation of profitability 
and recouping funds, to improve working capital and the partial 
occupation aiding sales of the remaining homes.
The sales strategy for the complex has been to sell apartments in advance of their 
completion, both to individuals on the open market, and in bulk to organisations. Due to 
the high level of interest and demand the development has attracted, inland Homes has 
been successful in selling the apartments. individual sales have been achieved through 
a combination of footfall - with people engaging with the attractive marketing suite and 
show flats - and online advertising by inland Homes, agents, and third party websites. 
On a sales trip to Hong Kong 14 apartments were sold. inland Homes also achieved a 
significant bulk transaction of 59 residential units to a housing association operating in the 
private rented sector. 
The development of west Plaza has shown several initiatives taken by inland Homes and 
their partners. The main contractor suggested pre-building some of the components 
off-site, before installing them. Having reviewed, assessed and accepted the suggestion, 
this modern technique meant that six months were shaved off the duration of the build, 
to the benefit of both inland Homes and the contractor. Additionally, during the process of 
the build, inland Homes monitored market changes and identified an increased appetite 
for high quality appliances, so modified the designs to include upgraded features. This 
enhanced specification supported the strong demand for the homes at west Plaza.
Another notable feature of the development is its ‘Green’ credentials. Photovoltaic cells 
have been installed onto roofs, and the electricity generated will supply the communal 
areas of the site, with excess energy generated sold back to the grid. This both supports 
the Government target of decentralising electricity generation, and provides an income for 
the development which will contribute towards future maintenance costs.
The success of the project so far has been down to the skills and experiences of both 
the team at inland Homes and the external consultants. Selecting contractors with the 
necessary skills and experiences for this type of project and allocating sufficient internal 
resources to manage the project, has been key to its smooth running. As inland Homes 
moves into more housebuilding projects, it will be critical to draw on the productive co-
operation and relationships that led to the success of the project.
Finally, inland Homes is delighted to announce that west Plaza has been nominated for 
the l ABC ‘Development of the year’ award.

Inland Homes is currently evaluating how best to move forward 
with this site. The Group could sell it, as its value has increased 
significantly since planning permission was received in July 2014. 
The development could also be a prime opportunity for a bulk sale 
to a private rented sector organisation, a growing market Inland 
Homes have previously sold residential units to. These two options 
represent the different time scales in which Inland Homes can 
monetise this asset.
The site has received planning consent for an apartment block with 152 residential units, 
20% of which will be affordable housing. The research for this design involved consultations 
with the Greenwich authorities (including the Head of Regeneration), as well as the local 
community, with whom inland Homes held a public exhibition. There were several factors 
to consider in the planning process, including the treatment of a listed building within the 
site, as well as the balance of this site with the widespread regeneration in the area. The 
experienced team at inland Homes consulted with local groups and put forward a plan that 
was accepted by the local community.
in addition to the apartments, the development will feature a business centre and a gym 
for the residents. in line with the Mayor’s focus on delivering children’s play areas, the 
design team at inland Homes has planned a ground level indoor children’s play area with 
gym facilities. This will provide a dynamic visual front to the building, and utilise the small 
footprint of the site effectively.
This design would contribute to the exciting, rapid regeneration of the area, with homes that 
are highly desirable for their location, transport connections and views. The acquisition of 
this prime land has proven a highly valuable addition to the Group’s land bank.

COMMun It Y
At inland Homes we are committed to building more than just 
homes - we strive to create developments that engage and 
reflect the local community. During the research and planning 
phase for each development we undertake consultations with the 
community, discussing the site and its surrounding environment 
with local groups and town councils. The opinions and requests of 
both the neighbourhood residents and local government bodies 
are collected and considered for the brief that the designers 
and architects base their plans upon. This consultation process 
means that we can develop the site in a way that best reflects the 
different needs of the local community.
As well as building a development that will continue to serve 
the needs of local residents into the future, we are also keen to 
invest in the community through our engagement with charities, 
for example sponsoring community sports teams and mini-
buses for local schools.
CuSt OMer S
it is of paramount importance to inland Homes to deliver a high 
quality service to our customers, from the earliest stages of 
planning, to after the build is complete.
Our house designs are constantly evolving, based upon feedback 
from customers on previous projects and our ever growing 
expertise. we design our developments to meet our customers’ 
needs beyond that of housing, with, for example, outside 
spaces, children’s play areas and gyms. w ithin the homes, we 
offer a choice of interior design options to those who purchase 
our properties in advance of completion.
we manage the handover process, ensuring that the quality of the 
build meets our stringent standards, and providing introductory 
home tours for new residents as well as moving in packs with 
all relevant information. we also co-ordinate aftercare with the 
contractors, manage feedback and respond to any customer 
service issues through a centralised system.
The nature of our work means we will always make an impact on 
the local area. However, through our focus on sustainability, we 
ensure that this is a positive impact, with a careful consideration 
of six key areas. We engage with the needs of the local community, 
and our customers who will eventually join this community; 
we protect the health and safety of our colleagues, as well as 
their development within the Group; and we seek productive 
relationships and innovative technologies that ensure our houses 
and our means for building them last sustainably into the future.

it is extremely important to inland Homes to maintain the 
highest standard of Health and Safety practices, both with 
our own employees, and with all contractors involved in our 
projects. we have rigorous standards which we enforce to 
ensure safe working practices at all of our sites. Employees have 
received Health and Safety training, and we require all external 
contractors who enter our sites to carry a CSCS card at all times 
to indicate that they have also undergone the necessary training.
we have a strong network of Health and Safety advisers. 
Additionally, each site is appointed a Construction, Design and 
Management co-ordinator, who oversees Health and Safety on 
behalf of inland Homes. They prepare a comprehensive Health 
and Safety plan before construction starts, and this is assessed 
alongside the contractor’s Health and Safety and risk plans, 
before a contract is issued. Once work has commenced on 
site, we carry out regular Health and Safety audits, as well as 
assessing monthly reports provided by the contractors.
SuPPLY CHaIn
inland Homes have relationships with a number of contractors 
who specialise in different types of build. it is essential to 
select the correct contractor, both to ensure a high quality 
result, and to draw on their experience and expertise during the 
process. There is a dialogue with the contractors throughout 
the planning and building stages, and we consider suggestions 
on alternative materials or methods for construction. Using 
these suggestions has led to saving money and time on 
several projects, benefiting both us and our contractors, and 
to discovering new techniques that we may return to in future 
projects. This co-operation leads to ongoing relationships, 
which we seek to ensure are mutually beneficial. Our 
collaborative approach delivers high quality buildings.
As well as developing long term relationships with our 
contractors, to further our sustainable supply chain we consider 
the sustainability of materials used on our sites. we clearly 
specify which materials we permit on our sites, and strive to use 
sustainable and locally sourced products where possible, as well 
as experimenting with new sustainable materials.

Our Pe OPLe
Our philosophy of employment is to attract and cultivate raw 
talent, and encourage people to reach their full potential 
by offering them opportunities to grow within our open and 
entrepreneurial culture. we support all of our employees in 
attending conferences and pursuing qualifications that assist 
their professional development. Our number of employees 
has doubled in the last two years to 28, with growth in all 
departments, supporting our move into housebuilding. we plan 
to continue measured expansion in the future to complement 
our strategy, particularly in the establishment of a strategic 
land department.
As we undertake much of our work through outsourcing, 
we are also reliant on the continued development of skilled 
workers outside of the Group. in response to the shortage of 
skilled labourers, we are involved in initiatives to train the next 
generation of workers. in some contracts we specify that our 
contractors must employ apprentices from the local areas. we 
are setting up a mechanism to connect to local colleges, so that 
the students can gain the necessary practical experience on our 
sites to kickstart their careers.

At inland Homes we constantly seek innovative materials and 
methods to improve the environmental performance of our 
properties. we follow each development in legislation and policy 
that guides sustainability in home building, and ensure that our 
projects are at the forefront of environmental sustainability.
we include many features in our buildings to minimise their 
environmental impact, such as rainwater harvesting. we design 
our buildings to perform throughout the year, with insulation 
and air-flow optimisation to aid summer cooling as well as 
retaining warmth in winter. we also seek environmentally friendly 
materials, both using locally sourced supplies where possible, 
and experimenting with innovative new technology such as the 
Durisol block, a building block made of reclaimed softwood, 
bound with concrete. Comprising of more than 90% recycled 
material, and generating no waste during manufacture, the block 
is not only environmentally friendly in production, but also as a 
feature in homes due to its insulating properties.

COMPOSiTiOn
The Group is managed through its Board of Directors. The 
Board comprises the Non-executive Chairman, one other Non-
executive Director, the Chief Executive, Finance Director and the 
Land Director. The Board’s main roles are to approve and review 
the Group’s strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary 
financial and other resources are made available to enable them 
to meet these objectives.
Specific responsibilities reserved to the Board include: setting Group strategy; 
reviewing operational and financial performance; approving certain land acquisitions; 
approving appointments to the Board; and approving policies relating to Directors’ 
remuneration. in addition, the Board reviews the risk profile of the Group and ensures 
that an adequate system of internal control is in place.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman meets 
the Chief Executive and the other n on-executive Director separately as and when 
required to discuss matters of the Board.
One-third of the Directors retire annually by rotation in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and this enables the shareholders to decide on the election of 
their Company’s Board.

The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and keeps them 
informed of all relevant matters on a regular basis. The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer and all applications for employment are considered fully on the basis of 
suitability for the job.

Donations to charitable organisations amounted to £27,000 (2013: £12,000). These 
donations were made to a number of different charities supporting a broad range of 
causes. There were no political donations made during the year (2013: £nil). 
PaYMent POLICY an D Pra Ct ICe
The Group’s policy is for all companies within the Group to agree terms and conditions 
with their suppliers. Payments are then generally made on the basis of this agreement, 
providing the suppliers conform to the terms and conditions stipulated. 
At 30 June 2014 the Group had an average of 74 days’ (2013: 57 days’) purchases 
outstanding in trade payables.
COr POra te g Overnan Ce
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and the guidelines 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012. w hilst AiM companies are not 
obliged to comply with the Code, the Directors intend to comply with the Code so far as is 
appropriate having regard to the size and nature of the various companies making up the 
Group. The Board will take such measures so far as considered appropriate for the Group 
to comply with the Code and, in addition, the Quoted Companies Alliance (QCA) Guidelines 
for AiM companies.
auDIt C OMMIttee
The Audit Committee comprises Terry Roydon (Chairman) and Simon Bennett. The Audit 
Committee meets at least three times a year and is responsible for ensuring that the 
financial performance of the Group is properly reported and monitored and for meeting 
the auditor and reviewing their reports in relation to the financial statements and internal 
control systems. The Group’s auditor provides some non-audit services, but these are not 
considered to threaten their independence. The committee reviews the level of non-audit 
fees on an annual basis. The Audit Committee meetings are also attended by invitation by 
representatives of the Group’s auditor, the Finance Director and the Chief Executive.
Since 30 June 2013 the Audit Committee has met four times to consider the planning of 
the statutory audit and to review the Group’s draft half and full year results prior to Board 
approval and to consider the external auditor’s detailed reports thereon.
Interna L COntr OLS
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such 
a system is designed to manage, but not eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. There are inherent limitations in any control system and accordingly even

the most effective system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control on an ongoing 
basis. Annual budgets are prepared and detailed management reports are presented to the 
Board and used to monitor financial performance and compliance with the Group’s policies 
and procedures. All controls are covered including financial and operational controls to 
manage risk. The Board meetings are also used to consider the Group’s major risks.
r eLat IOn S WIt H SHare HOLDer S
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into 
a dialogue with them. The Chief Executive and Finance Director meet with institutional 
investors within the confines of relevant legislation and guidance.
The Board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation 
by them at the AGM. All Board members are present at the AGM and are available to 
answer questions from shareholders.
Interna L au DIt
The Board reviews from time to time the need for an internal audit function and remains 
of the opinion that the systems of internal financial control are appropriate to the Group’s 
present activities and that such a function is unnecessary.
r eMunerat IOn C OMMIttee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Simon Bennett (Chairman) and Terry Roydon. 
The principal functions of the committee are to determine the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and to determine the remuneration package 
of each Executive Director. The committee also determines long term incentive plans 
and the allocation of share options to the Executive Directors and other employees. The 
Remuneration Committee meetings are also attended by invitation by the Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director. During the year the committee met six times to review the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration package.
The Directors comply with Rule 21 of the AiM Rules relating to Directors’ dealings and take 
all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by the Company’s applicable employees. The 
Company has adopted and operates a share dealing code for Directors and employees in 
accordance with the AiM Rules.

REMUn ERATiOn REPORT
There is no requirement for companies quoted on AIM to produce a 
formal remuneration report. As a consequence, this Remuneration 
Report is produced for information purposes in order to give 
shareholders and other users of the financial statements greater 
transparency about the way in which the Directors of Inland Homes 
are remunerated.
This report sets out the remuneration paid to the Directors for the year ended 30 June 
2014 and sets out the remuneration policy for the forthcoming financial year and beyond. 
COMPOSIt IOn an D r OLe OF t He r eMunera t IOn COMMIttee 
The Board have established a Remuneration Committee which currently consists of 
Simon Bennett, independent n on-executive Director, who is Chairman of the committee 
and Terry Roydon, the Company’s n on-executive Chairman. The role of the Remuneration 
Committee is to determine the specific remuneration package for each of the Executive 
Directors and no Director is involved in any decisions that will affect his own remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee has access to information provided by the three Executive 
Directors of inland Homes, namely Stephen w icks, Chief Executive, n ishith Malde, Finance 
Director and Paul Brett, l and Director and independent advice from external consultants 
where it considers this to be appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee meets formally three times a year and on such other 
occasions as may be required.
POLICY FOr exe Cut Ive DIre Ct Or S’ re Munera t IOn
The policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed to attract, motivate and retain 
high calibre individuals with a competitive remuneration package. The remuneration policy 
takes into account the overall performance of the Company and the individual Executive 
Directors and the prevailing pay structures in the markets in which inland Homes operates.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed to provide a balance between fixed and 
variable rewards, although it is recognised that it is common industry practice for total 
remuneration to be significantly influenced by annual bonuses and long term incentive 
plans. Consequently, remuneration packages for individual Executive Directors comprise 
a basic salary, deferred bonus plan, a long term incentive plan and benefits in kind. in 
agreeing the basic salary and annual bonuses, in addition to the factors outlined above, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account the aggregate remuneration to be received by 
the individual Executive. 
in 2013, in line with best corporate governance and market practice, the Remuneration 
Committee introduced a new deferred bonus plan and a long term incentive plan for the 
Company’s Executive Directors, which have been designed to incentivise the Executive 
Directors to grow the business and maximise returns to shareholders. The latter is known 
as The inland Homes plc 2013 Growth Plan (“2013 l TiP”), which will operate for a period of 
six years and which was approved by shareholders in general meeting in December 2013. 
The key elements of the scheme are set out below.

baSIC SaLar Y
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Remuneration Committee seeks to establish a basic salary for each position 
commensurate with the individual’s responsibilities and performance, taking into account 
comparable salaries for similar companies of a similar size in the same market.
DeFerre D bOnu S PLan 
The Deferred Bonus Plan came into effect on 1 July 2013. Executive Directors can earn 
up to 100% of basic annual salary as an annual bonus. The plan provides for 50% of an 
Executive Director’s bonus to be mandatorily deferred into ordinary shares in the Company. 
Under these arrangements, bonuses would be based on a percentage of the individual 
Executive Director’s base salary as follows: 
•	 50% of salary for “on target” performance; and 
•	 a further 50% of salary for “out-performance”. 
For example, for achieving 90% of on target performance there will be a discretionary 
bonus of up to 25% of salary (and pro-rata between 90% and 100% of on target 
performance) and there will be no bonus for less than 90% of on target performance. 
The target is measured by reference to two equally weighted performance measures, 
namely: 
•	 profit before taxation as compared with brokers’ market forecasts following the 
announcement of the preliminary results of the previous accounting period; and 
•	 net debt levels. 
Once the quantum of the Executive Directors’ bonuses has been calculated, these will be 
settled as to 50% in cash and as to 50% by the issue of ordinary shares of the Company. 
The issue of any ordinary shares awarded under the Deferred Bonus Plan will be deferred 
for three years and will be subject to forfeiture in the event that an Executive leaves the 
Company as a “bad leaver”, but would not be subject to further performance conditions. 
LOng t er M In Cent Ive PLan S
The Company operates both an unapproved share option scheme, which is open to all 
employees of inland Homes and the recently introduced 2013 l TiP for the Executive 
Directors.
Awards under the unapproved share option scheme are made on a periodic basis to 
the Company’s Executive Directors and employees. The share options in this scheme 
vest three years after the date of grant and have an exercise period of seven years. The 
schemes are equity-settled.

REMUn ERATiOn REPORT COn Tin UED
The following is a summary of the principal features and terms of the 2013 l TiP: 
1. Creation of growth Shares 
The plan operates by reference to rights attached to a special class of share in a newly 
established intermediate holding company between the Company and the Group’s 
current trading subsidiaries. The special class of shares are called “Growth Shares”. 
The Growth Shares are qualifying shares for the purposes of the Employee Shareholder 
Status scheme, a recently introduced proposal by the Government, the aim of which is to 
provide tax benefits to employees and Directors who achieve growth for their employing 
companies.
The vesting of the Growth Shares will be subject to performance targets (“Performance 
Targets”) and when such Performance Targets are achieved, a relevant proportion of the 
Growth Shares will vest. 
2. vesting and exchange of growth Shares 
Subject to the Performance Targets being met, the Growth Shares will only vest three 
years after their award and thereafter annually if and when each Performance Target 
is met. After vesting, the Growth Shares may be realised by being exchanged for a fixed 
number of the Company’s ordinary shares. 
The Growth Shares will not carry any entitlement to dividends, capital or voting unless and 
until they vest and are exchanged for shares in the Company. 
3. Performance t argets 
vesting will only occur if specific Performance Targets (which are linked to the share price 
of inland Homes plc over six consecutive performance periods) are met or exceeded for 15 
working days in the relevant performance period. The first performance period will end 20 
working days after the announcement of the Company’s preliminary results for the year 
ended 30 June 2014, being 27 October 2014. The second performance period will commence 
on the day following the expiry of the first performance period and will end 20 working days 
after the announcement of the Company’s preliminary results for the year ended 30 June 
2015 and so on. it is expected that the announcement of preliminary results for each year 
will be in September. Accordingly, each performance period is likely to end in October. 
The target share prices for the 2013 l TiP are based on compounded growth being achieved 
and accordingly, if the Performance Target is missed in one period, the participants’ 
awards can still vest if the required compound percentage of growth is achieved in 
subsequent periods. For instance, if in the first period the Performance Target for that 
period is not met, then the related number of Growth Shares which could have vested may 
still vest in the following period or periods, provided that the Performance Target for those 
periods is achieved, as the target gets increasingly more stretching. 
The first Performance Target has been set as a price of 60.5 pence per ordinary share (the 
“First Target Performance Price”), which has been set at a 30% premium to the share 
price of 46.5 pence per ordinary share (the “initial Base Price”), being the mid price at the 
close of business on 20 December 2013, the date 2013 l TiP was adopted.

Performance Target for each year of the respective years is achieved:
Start date of accounting period
Performance target (Inland 
Homes plc share price)
t otal number of 
Inland Homes plc 
shares
1 July 2013 30% above initial Base Price 2,000,000
1 July 2014 15% compounded 2,000,000
1 July 2015 10% compounded 2,000,000
1 July 2016 10% compounded 2,000,000
1 July 2017 10% compounded 2,000,000
1 July 2018 10% compounded 1,350,504
11,350,504
4. Dilution 
The total number of shares in the Company which may become issuable on the exchange 
of Growth Shares (assuming vesting in full) is 11,350,504, equivalent to 5.6% of the current 
issued share capital of the Company. in order for the maximum of 11,350,504 ordinary 
shares in the Company to become issuable under the 2013 l TiP, the price for each inland 
Homes ordinary share, in the absence of a takeover, will have had to have more than 
doubled before the end of the final performance period (being 20 working days after 
the announcement of the preliminary results for the year ending 30 June 2019), when 
compared with the initial Base Price of 46.5 pence per ordinary share. This increase is 
approximately equivalent to a 14% annual compound rise in the ordinary share price. 
5. Change of Control 
The 2013 l TiP will allow realisation from three years after the award, provided the 
Performance Targets have been met. As is customary, the 2013 l TiP does provide for 
early vesting of Growth Shares in the event of a takeover of inland Homes before the 
expiry of the plan, such that all the Growth Shares will vest, provided that the offer price is 
greater than the share price required to achieve the Performance Target for the relevant 
performance period in which the takeover occurs. 
6. Participants 
The Executive Directors who will participate in the 2013 l TiP and their allocations of 
Growth Shares, is as follows: Stephen w icks 47%, n ishith Malde 38% and Paul Brett 15%. 
in addition, any awards to the Executive Directors under the 2013 l TiP are subject to good 
and bad leaver provisions. 
Ot Her bene FIt S
Depending on the exact terms of each individual Executive Director’s service contract with 
the Company, they are entitled to a range of benefits including either a car allowance or a 
fully expensed company car, contributions to pension schemes, private fuel, private health 
care insurance, permanent health insurance and death in service insurance.

buSIne SS rev IeW
A review of the development and performance of the business during the year and the

Chief Executive’s Review on pages 20 to 22. The Group’s key performance indicators are 
monitored closely by the Board and the details of performance against these are on pages 
38 and 39.

FInan CIaL r ISk Mana ge Ment Obje Ct Ive S an D POLICIeS
All potential areas of financial risk are regularly monitored and reviewed by the Directors 
and management. Any preventative or corrective measures are taken as necessary.
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, cash and trade 
receivables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial 
instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group also provides finance to DGvl as part of its arrangement with that company. The 
main purpose of this financial instrument is to enhance the Group’s return from this project.
The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial 
risks, which are described in more detail below.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk, credit risk and capital risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing 
each of these risks and they are summarised below.

Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to 
meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Flexibility is achieved by loans and overdraft facilities.
Cash flow fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings 
issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Some of the Group’s 
borrowings are at variable rates but the Group does not consider the risk to be significant.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and bank and other 
borrowings. The Group controls the exposure to interest rate fluctuations by ensuring that 
the level of gearing is maintained at a reasonable level.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group trades and deals with counterparties after having considered their 
credit rating. in certain circumstances the Group may seek additional security.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell 
assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital in relation to overall 
financing. Further information can be found in n ote 26 to the Group financial statements.

The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future 
period. it has also considered the risks and uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Directors have considered the present economic climate, the state of the housing 
market and the current demand for land with planning consent. The Group has continued 
to see an increase in demand for consented land in the areas in which it operates. The 
Group has significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions for the sale 
of some of the land within its projects and expects to make sufficient disposals in the 
foreseeable future to ensure it has adequate working capital for its requirements. The 
Directors are satisfied that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet its liabilities as 
and when they fall due for a period of 12 months from signing these financial statements. 
The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the Directors have to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with international Financial Reporting Standards (iFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and have elected to prepare Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. in 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable iFRSs have been followed in relation to the Group accounts 
and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed in relation to the Parent 
Company accounts, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
•	 so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•	 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that 
information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s website. l egislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ

1. aCCOunt Ing POLICIeS
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group financial statements are set out below.
basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments which are 
measured at fair value, and in accordance with applicable international Financial Reporting Standards (iFRS) as adopted by the EU and 
as issued by the international Accounting Standards Board. iFRS13 Fair value Measurement became mandatory for the first time for 
the financial year beginning 1 July 2013 but has had no material impact on the results of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2014.
The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening Statement of Financial Position have also been applied throughout all 
periods presented in these financial statements. These accounting policies comply with each iFRS that is mandatory for accounting 
periods ending on 30 June 2014.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
have been published by the iASB but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first 
period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that 
are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. 
Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been 
adopted early by the group
•	 iFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements
•	 iFRS11 Joint Arrangements
•	 iFRS12 Disclosure of interests in Other Entities
•	 iAS27 (Revised) Separate Financial Statements
•	 iAS28 (Revised) investments in Associates and Joint ventures
Standards in issue but not yet effective
•	 iFRS9 Financial instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
•	 iFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2017)
•	 iAS19 Employee Benefits (Revised June 2011) (effective 1 January 2014)
•	 Disclosures — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial l iabilities — Amendments to iFRS7 (effective 1 January 2014)
•	 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial l iabilities — Amendments to iAS32 (effective 1 January 2014)
n one of the standards above are expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements. The Directors are currently assessing 
the impact of iFRS10 on accounting for the DGvl arrangement but at this stage do not anticipate any material changes. However, as 
iFRS10 specifically requires the question of control to be reassessed on an ongoing basis, this matter will be kept under review.

basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn 
up to 30 June 2014. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Amounts reported in the financial statements of 
subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. The method involves the recognition at fair value of all 
identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not 
they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities 
of the subsidiary are included in the Group Statement of Financial Position at their fair values, which are also used as the basis for 
subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable 
intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
going concern
The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future period. it has also considered the risks and 
uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity risk. The Directors have considered the present economic climate, the state of the 
housing market and the current demand for land with planning consent. The Group has continued to see an increase in demand for 
consented land in the areas in which it operates. The Group has significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions 
for the sale of some of the land within its projects and expects to make sufficient disposals in the foreseeable future to ensure it 
has adequate working capital for its requirements. The Directors are satisfied that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet 
its liabilities as and when they fall due for a period of 12 months from signing these financial statements. The Directors therefore 
consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.
j oint ventures
investments in joint ventures are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method. All subsequent 
changes to the share of interest in the equity of the joint venture are recognised in the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. 
Changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the joint venture are reported in ‘share of profits of joint venture’ in the Group 
income Statement and therefore affect net results of the Group. These changes include subsequent depreciation, amortisation or 
impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities.
r evenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding 
vAT and trade discounts.

Sale of land
Revenue from the sale of land is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied:
•	 the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which is generally when 
contracts have been completed;
•	 the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control 
over the land sold which is generally when the contract has been completed;
•	 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
•	 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
•	 the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Sale of residential units
Turnover is recognised on legal completion, which is generally when the title passes.
Contract income
The Group acts as a main contractor on certain building projects, primarily on behalf of housing associations whilst carrying out 
its s106 obligations. Once the Group considers that the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and profit is 
recognised on the basis of the proportion of the contract that is completed.
Fee income
The Group provides planning and property management services to third parties for a fee. The Group recognises revenue based on 
the fair value and stage of completion of the planning and property management services provided to these customers as at the 
period end, in accordance with iAS18.
Interest
interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the 
interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
r ental income
Rental income derived from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Disposal of assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the Group income Statement. Any revaluation surplus remaining in equity on disposal of the 
asset is transferred to the profit and loss reserve.

Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by the straight 
line method where it reflects the basis of consumption of the asset. The rates generally applicable are:
Fixtures and fittings — 25%
Office equipment — 25%
Motor vehicles — 25%
l easehold property — over shorter of lease term and useful economic life
Material residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued.
Investment property
investment properties are measured at cost and are reviewed annually for impairment. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale 
of an investment property is immediately recognised in profit or loss. As a result, investment properties are not depreciated. An 
investment property shall be derecognised on disposal or when the Directors consider that the status of the property has changed 
to being a development property. w hen a partial disposal or transfer is made, the proportion relating to the disposal or transfer is 
derecognised.
Inventories
inventories consist of land and work in progress and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the 
purchase of sites, the cost of infrastructure and construction works, and legal and professional fees incurred during development 
prior to sale. n et realisable value is estimated based upon the future expected selling price, less estimated costs to sell.
t axation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on 
the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on 
the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business 
combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Temporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint 
ventures unless reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur 
in the foreseeable future. in addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are 
assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Group income Statement except 
where they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income (such as the revaluation of the investment property 
not included in inventories) or directly in equity in which case the related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or equity respectively.

Leased assets
l ease payments (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) applicable to operating leases where substantially all 
the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.
employee benefits
Defined contribution pension scheme
The pension costs charged against operating profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. 
equity-settled share-based payment
All share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the Group financial statements. All goods and services received in 
exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black–Scholes options pricing model. 
w here employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by 
reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group income Statement with a 
corresponding credit to retained earnings.
if vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. n o adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables and financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss. Financial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for 
which they were acquired. 
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
other than those categorised as at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value plus finance costs. Financial 
assets categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through 
the Group income Statement.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets that are either classified as held for trading or are 
designated by the entity as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, the financial 
assets included in this category are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group income Statement. 
Financial assets originally designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss may not be reclassified subsequently.

Financial assets continued
l oans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Trade receivables and loans to associate are classified as loans and receivables. l oans and receivables are measured 
subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in 
their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the Group income Statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate.
interest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in the Group income Statement, regardless of 
how the related carrying amount of financial assets is measured.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or the financial asset 
is transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the 
cash flows of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for 
derecognition if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains 
nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
All financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an 
expense in finance cost in the Group income Statement. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are charged to the Group income Statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added 
to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss where they are classified as held-for-trading or designated 
as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition (including deferred purchase consideration). Financial liabilities are 
designated as at fair value through profit or loss where they eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement (or recognition) 
mismatch.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled  
or expires.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in other short term financial liabilities when the dividends are 
approved in a general meeting prior to the year end date.

equity
An equity instrument is a contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities. Equity comprises 
the following:
•	 ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares;
•	 ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue;
•	 ‘Treasury shares’ represent the purchase of the Company’s own shares and are deducted from total equity as treasury shares  
until they are sold or cancelled where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued – any consideration received is included in 
total equity;
•	 ‘Special reserve’ represents the distributable surplus created by the transfer of an amount from the share premium to rectify the 
deficit on the profit and loss reserve; and
•	 ‘Profit and loss reserve’ represents retained profits.

Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk; liquidity risk; cash flow risk; and fair value interest rate risk. 
The Group’s overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
(a) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. it has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are 
made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the year end date, as 
summarised below:
2014

2013 
£000
Classes of financial assets — carrying amounts
l isted investments held for trading 1 1

Trade and other receivables 13,983 15,085
Receivables due in more than one year 55 55
25,208 28,295
The Group’s policy is to deal with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group’s management considers that all the above financial assets for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit 
quality. The Directors consider that none of the receivables are past due or impaired.

Financial risk factors continued
(a) Credit risk continued
Some of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral. This collateral is a second charge over land owned by DGvl and in the 
opinion of the Directors, it mitigates the credit risk of the DGvl debtor.
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable 
banks with high quality credit ratings.
(b) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring availability of funding through an 
adequate amount of credit facilities. The Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping credit lines available. The Group also 
purchases property under deferred consideration arrangements.
(c) Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to 
cash flow interest rate risk. All the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates but the Group does not consider the risk to be significant.
3. Seg Ment In FOr Mat IOn
in accordance with iFRS8, information is disclosed to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects 
of the business activities in which the Group engages.
in identifying its operating segments, management differentiates between land sales, housebuilding, fee income and other income. 
These segments are based on the information reported to the chief operating decision maker. An analysis of the Group’s results by 
segment are disclosed in n ote 5.
4. Cr It ICaL aCCOunt Ing eSt IMate S an D ju Dge Ment S
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historic experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely 
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
(a) Valuation of inventories
in applying the Group’s accounting policy for the valuation of inventories the Directors are required to assess the expected selling 
price and costs to sell each of the plots or units that constitute the Group’s land bank and work in progress. Cost includes the 
purchase of sites, the cost of infrastructure and construction works, and legal and professional fees incurred during development 
prior to sale. Estimation of the selling price is subject to significant inherent uncertainties, in particular the prediction of future 
trends in the market value of land.
w hilst the Directors exercise due care and attention to make reasonable estimates, taking into account all available information in 
estimating the future selling price, the estimates will, in all likelihood, differ from the actual selling prices achieved in future periods 
and these differences may, in certain circumstances, be very significant. The critical judgement in respect of planning consent (see 
below) further increases the level of estimation uncertainty in this area.

(b) Income taxes
The Group recognises tax/deferred tax assets and liabilities for anticipated tax based on estimates of when the tax/deferred tax will 
be paid or recovered. w hen the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences 
impact the period in which the determination is made. Critical accounting estimates relate to the profit forecasts used to determine 
the extent to which deferred tax assets are recognised from available losses.
(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its 
judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing.
(d) Investment properties
investment properties are reviewed annually for impairment; critical accounting estimates relate to the forecasts prepared in order to 
assess the carrying value.
(e) Discounting on deferred consideration of inventories
The Group discounts deferred consideration of inventories by discounted cash flow method; the Group considers that the cost of debt 
capital is the most appropriate discount rate.
Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies
Inventories
The Group values inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is based on the judgement of the 
probability that planning consent will be given for each site. The Group believes that, based on the Directors’ experience, planning 
consent will be given. if planning consent was not achieved then a provision may be required against inventories. 
Zero Dividend Preference shares
The Group has in issue Zero Dividend Preference shares which are accounted for as debt. ZDP shares are repayable, plus accrued 
interest to date, in the event of a takeover. The Directors consider that the potential early repayment meets the definition of a 
derivative instrument under iAS39. However, they consider that this instrument is closely related to the host contract and therefore 
have not accounted for the embedded derivative separately.
Investments
in December 2008 the Group entered into an Option and Development Services Agreement (the Agreement) with DGvl . The Directors 
have considered the requirements of iAS27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’(revised 2008) and SiC12 ‘Consolidation 
– special purpose vehicles’ and do not believe that the Group has the power to control DGvl . Firstly, the final decision on the funding, 
financial and operational activities of DGvl resides with the director of DGvl himself, including the unilateral discretion over the 
choice of supplier of development services. Secondly, the Group does not have the ability to use any power over DGvl to affect its 
return. The director of DGvl has the unilateral right to determine and control the overall percentage of the profit surrendered to 
the Group; inland has no rights to influence the ultimate percentage it receives, only the ability to influence the overall profit by 
performing development services in an efficient manner. DGvl makes its own decisions regarding the development of the site even 
though the director of DGvl receives property advice to consider and property services from the Group. The Directors also consider 
that the Group does not have the decision making powers to obtain the majority of the benefits and the risks of the activities of 
DGvl as the shareholder of DGvl maintains control as to whether he finances the deferred land consideration payments. The key 
requirement in influencing inland’s profit share is the basis on which deferred consideration is satisfied. This is at the discretion 
of the DGvl director and hence he can improve his profit share, or allow inland to arrange the funding. Therefore, after due 
consideration of the applicable accounting standards and the way in which DGvl and inland operate in reality, the Board is of the 
opinion that inland does not control DGvl . Accordingly, DGvl should not be consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.

The Group is entitled to receive a fee for the provision of planning application services, assistance in obtaining statutory and third 
party consents, assistance in entering into development and construction agreements, assistance in achieving sales, assistance in 
engaging professional advisers, seeking opportunities to generate interim revenues and the potential provision of finance to DGvl 
in respect of the site known as Drayton Garden village. Under the Agreement the Group is entitled to receive an increased share of 
the profits from the development on the basis that the director of DGvl did not have to procure funding to meet the deferred land 
consideration payments. Therefore, the Group is now entitled to receive 90% of all the profits realised from the sale of the property 
over the life of the project.
The Group’s relationship with DGvl is further explained in n ote 13 and balances in n ote 16.
At 30 June 2014 the deferred land consideration had been met in full without the director of DGvl having to procure funding. As a 
result, inland is now entitled to 90% of the profits expected to be realised from the sale of the property over the life of the project. 
83.04% of the total profits are due to the Group for the provision of planning application and property management services 
completed at the balance sheet date and this has to be accounted for under iAS18. 6.96% of the profits are due to the Group for the 
provision of the initial £3m to pay the first instalment of the deferred land payment and is therefore accounted for under iAS39 as 
interest income. 
in calculating the fee for the provision of planning application and property services to DGvl recognised in the year, under iAS18 the 
Group has estimated the following:
•	 total profits (total expected sales less total estimated development costs to completion) to be realised from the sale of the property;
•	 profits would be realised over six years from 1 July 2010;
•	 percentage, where the stage of completion is an appropriate basis for evaluating fair value, of planning application and property 
services provided to DGvl as at the period end with the balance to be provided over the remaining life of the project (i.e. in future 
accounting periods); and
•	 the fair value of completed service components at the year end.
During the year ended 30 June 2014 the Group has recognised £6.6 million (2013: £3.0 million) in revenue within the Group income 
Statement for such services to DGvl .
in calculating the fee for the provision of finance to DGvl , under iAS39 the Group has estimated the following:
•	 total profits (total expected sales less total estimated development costs to completion) to be realised from the sale of the 
property; and
•	 profits would be realised over six years from 1 July 2010.
Under iAS39 the Group has a choice as to how to account for the asset. The Directors consider the most appropriate classification for 
the asset to be ‘loans and receivables’ due to the underlying asset being a ‘non-derivative’ financial asset with fixed or determinable 
payments. The effective interest rate method has been applied in calculating the income in the period. See n ote 16. 
During the year ended 30 June 2014 the Group has recognised £0.26 million (2013: £0.25 million) within interest income in the Group 
income Statement in respect of such fees.

As inland is required to recognise the income based on the development services delivered and as finance income, the results are

The accounting policy for revenue recognition by DGvl is as follows:
Turnover comprises the sale of land acquired for resale, the sale of completed properties, the sale of equipment and materials and 
amounts receivable by the company in respect of other services rendered during the period excluding value added tax. Turnover 
in respect of the sale of land and properties is recognised at the point of completion, when the title passes. Turnover from other 
services is recognised as the service is delivered. Turnover on the sale of equipment is recognised on the completion of the sale.

During the year DGvl identified a purchaser for 107 residential units at Drayton Garden village. The purchaser bought the land but 
would only agree to enter into a build contract with inland l imited. The risks associated with this contract have been substantially 
mitigated by way of a fixed price construction contract with a main contractor. The counterparty risk is negligible as the purchaser is 
a very well financed housing association. Consequently the Group is recognising no margin on this contract and instead is receiving 
its share of the development contribution via the development services fee income from DGvl , which currently stands at 90% of the 
total profit expected to be realised from the development.

On 18 December 2008, inland entered into an Option and Development Services Agreement with DGvl which granted inland l imited 
an option for a consideration of £250,000 to purchase the share capital of DGvl at an exercise price of £1. The initial period of the 
option was for one year from the date of the agreement and this could be extended on up to four occasions to a maximum period of 
ten years by making further payments. During the years ended 30 June 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the option period was extended 
to expire on 15 January 2019 for a total consideration of £1,200,000. in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for financial 
assets, the option has been measured at fair value at 30 June 2014, which resulted in a fair value loss of £822,000 (2013: gain of 
£49,000) that has been recognised in the Group income Statement, resulting in the option being valued at £659,000 below the actual 
consideration paid for the option. The fair value of the option has decreased as the profits are being realised and are available for 
distribution to the shareholder of DGvl . An explanation of the fair value is included in note 27.
The Group’s joint venture in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire has now come to an end. The Group’s 50% share of the profits after tax for 
the period to 30 June 2014 amounts to £613,000 (2013: £676,000) that has been recognised in the Group income Statement.

the 2007 Plan was cancelled and replaced with the 2013 Plan. The redeemable and deferred shares were redesignated as 9,800 
valueless deferred shares of 10 pence each. Further information can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 
61.

options vest three years after the date of grant and have an exercise period of seven years. The schemes are all equity-settled.

The Group has the following contingent liability as at 30 June 2014:
A subsidiary undertaking, Poole investments l imited (formerly Poole investments plc) (“Poole”), ceased to participate in its operating 
subsidiary’s pension scheme when it disposed of former subsidiaries in May 2004. The Scheme’s principal employer, Pilkington’s 
Tiles l imited went into administration on 14 June 2010 and as a result Poole may be liable for a share of the cost of securing the 
liabilities of the Scheme pertaining to its two former employees should there be a deficit on the Scheme’s fund. The Directors 
consider that, as at the balance sheet date, material uncertainty exists over the basis and calculation of any obligation that may fall 
due to Poole. Advice has been sought to clarify the Company’s position. A provision has therefore not been made in the financial 
statements as the basis of any provision cannot be reliably established.

The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Group Statement of Financial Position in 
accordance with the fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance 
of inputs used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
l evel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
l evel 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within l evel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
l evel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair 
value measurement.

(a) Listed securities and debentures
All the listed equity securities and debentures are denominated in Sterling and are publicly traded in the United Kingdom. Fair values 
have been determined by reference to their quoted mid prices at the reporting date. The ZDP shares are carried at their accrued 
value of 111.34p per share (2013: 103.78p) however their closing price on the main market of the l ondon Stock Exchange on 30 June 
2014 was 124.00p (2013: 109.75p). During the year 934,900 shares were issued at a price of 118.5p per share.
(b) Assets not based on observable market data
The option to purchase the share of Drayton Garden village l imited is measured at fair value annually and a fair value loss was 
recognised during the year. The investment property is stated at cost and reviewed annually for impairment. The current carrying 
value is £7.68 million. The investment property was valued by CBRE l td in March 2013 in accordance with the current edition of the 
RiCS valuation Professional Standards, published by the Royal institution of Chartered Surveyors, at £9.64 million. The method used 
involved the calculation of the gross development value of the site (using the comparable method) based on the planning permission 
in place and the resulting residual land value. The key assumptions relate to property prices, construction prices and the extent of 
any remediation required with a profit margin of 17% of gross development value. The Directors consider this to be a reasonable 
approximation of fair value.

1. Pr In CIPaL aCCOunt Ing POLICIeS
basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under 
the historical cost convention. The Directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and consider they remain the most 
appropriate for the Company. The principal accounting policies of the Company have remained unchanged from the previous year.
Investments
investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
equity-settled share-based payment
All share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the 
Black–Scholes options pricing model. w here employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ 
services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is 
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding 
credit to reserves brought forward.
if vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication 
that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. n o adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately 
exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company an obligation to pay more 
tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis.
2. Pr OFIt attr Ibut ab Le t O MeMber S OF t He Parent C OMPan Y
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company’s loss for the year of £1.1 million (2013: profit of £1.4 million) has been transferred to reserves. 
auditor’s remuneration
The audit fees for the Company were £5,000 (2013: £5,000). The auditor’s remuneration for other services is disclosed in n ote 6 to the 
Group financial statements.
Fees paid to the Company’s auditor, Grant Thornton UK ll P, and its associates for services other than statutory audit of the Company 
are not disclosed in inland Homes plc’s financial statements since the Group financial statements of inland Homes plc are required 
to disclose non-audit fees on a consolidated basis.

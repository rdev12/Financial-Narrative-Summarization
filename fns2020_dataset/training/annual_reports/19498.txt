Pensions
The IAS 19 pension position at 29 March 2015 was a surplus of £3,179 million, compared with a surplus of £2,068 million at 28 September 2014 
and £1,723 million at 30 March 2014. The IAS 19 accounting position and key assumptions for the valuation are provided in note 8. 
The process for the triennial valuation of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) at 31 March 2015 has commenced and the outcome will be 
announced in due course. If the assumptions used for the 2012 triennial valuation of RMPP and RMSEPP are rolled forward to 31 March 2015, 
the combined actuarial surplus would be £1,793 million, compared with £1,585 million at 30 September 2014 and £1,422 million at 31 March 
2014. It is this basis that the Pension Trustees and the Company use to assess the ongoing funding needs of these schemes. The increase in the 
surplus was largely driven by the return on assets, in particular due to the increase in the market value of gilts and derivative assets that are 
principally held to hedge inflation and interest rate risk. To support the Company's commitment that, subject to certain conditions, the RMPP will 



Under the 2012 triennial valuation of RMPP the Company agreed to pay ongoing cash contributions of 17.1 per cent of pensionable pay until

Affordability of the Royal Mail Pension 
Plan 
The actuarial cost of providing an additional 
year’s benefit was around £700 million based 
on the Plan’s March 2012 actuarial valuation.
In recognition of the surplus that was created 
by Pensions Reform in September 2013, the 
Group was able to maintain its cash 
contribution at around £400 million a year. 
As part of Pensions Reform, the Group 
committed, subject to conditions, to keep the 
Plan open without further amendment until at 
least March 2018. 
Changes in financial market conditions, or 
demographic or other factors may impact our 
continued ability to fund this commitment.
 
 
The first review of our 
commitment, which will be 
carried out in conjunction with 
the unions, will be completed 
by March 2018.

Being customer focused is one of our three

Employee engagement is one of the key

are doing well and those we need to improve. 
This year, we achieved an improved employee 
engagement score of 56, up from 54 in 
2013-14.
  See KPIs pages 18 – 19.
Engaged employees are essential for the 
customer focused culture that we are building 
at Royal Mail. Engagement is one of the three 
people-related KPIs on our Corporate 
Balanced Scorecard.
Building a dialogue through our internal 
communication channels is a vital aspect 

During 2014-15 we undertook the following

at the forefront of the search for high risk vulnerable

We distribute the charity’s missing people alerts

usually used to track and sign for deliveries. These 
reach 124,000 of our people involved in collection,

We target messages to specific geographic areas to

of the search for a missing person goes national, we 
broadcast alerts across our entire network, leveraging 
our full scale to support efforts to find them.
This is the first time that an organisation has made its

This note explains how these Royal Mail plc Group (the Group) consolidated financial statements have been prepared including information 
on non-GAAP measures and the Directors’ going concern assessment. 
General information

accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union. The UK is the Company’s country of domicile.  
The Company was listed on  on 15 October 2013.

Basis of preparation and accounting 
The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates, and all values are rounded to the nearest whole £million except where otherwise indicated. The consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on an historic cost basis, except for pension assets and derivative financial instruments, which have been 
measured at fair value. 
Presentation of results 
The Group’s ‘Significant accounting policies’ can be found after the notes to the Group financial statements. 
Reported performance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (i.e. on a ‘reported’ basis).  
Non-GAAP performance measures 
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS, the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP), under which the Group reports. The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures assist with the 
understanding of the performance of the business. 
These non-GAAP measures (see page 133) are not a substitute, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but they have been 
included as Management considers them to be an important means of comparing performance year-on-
used within the business for assessing performance. 
 
Going concern  
 the end of 
the reporting year, 29 March 2015, to ensure that there is sufficient headroom to enable the Group to pay its creditors as they fall due.  
The Directors have reviewed business projections, with particular emphasis on the 24 months to March 2017, to consider business cash 
 . The Group’s business activities, 
 2 to 40. 
The Directors have assessed these against committed and undrawn funding facilities (£1,050 million at 29 March 2015) and other liquid 
 million, cash equivalent investments £140 million  million 
at 29 March 2015). Funding facilities and cash and cash equivalents available to the Group are described in further detail in notes 5, 15 
and 16. 
The Directors are satisfied that these facilities, coupled with business projections, show that the Group will continue to operate for the 
foreseeable future.

The bond, issued in July 2014, is shown net of issue discount and fees and at a closing spot rate of £0.737/€. The effective interest rate on 
the bond (2.5 per cent) consists of the interest coupon of 2.375 per cent plus the unwinding of the discount and fees on issuing the bond 
(0.08 per cent). The £300 million Term Loan B and £50 million of Term Loan A were repaid on 15 August 2014 through proceeds raised 
from the bond issue. The bond is designated as a hedge of the net investment in GLS, which has the Euro as its functional currency. During 
the year, a gain of £27 million on the retranslation of this borrowing was transferred to other comprehensive income, which offsets the 
losses on translation of the net investment in GLS. There is no hedge ineffectiveness in the period ended 29 March 2015. 
 t conditions to negotiate amendments to the syndicated b loan facility to 
allow: conversion of the remaining term loan into a revolving credit facility; a reduction to the interest rates charged; and to extend the 
maturity date (to March 2020 with the option to extend for a further two years). This increased flexibility allowed the remaining £250 million 
 , whilst maintaining the same level of facilities.

occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreements. These events of default include non-payment, insolvency and breach of 
covenant relating to interest (excluding arrangement fees), adjusted net debt and EBITDA. It is not anticipated that the Grou
breaching any of these obligations. 
The covenants require the Group to maintain the (leverage) ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA below 3:1 and EBITDA to interest (excluding 
arrangement fees) above 3.5:1. Adjusted net debt consists of net debt plus Letters of Credit (contingent liabilities in respect of the UKPIL 
insurance programme, where the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote
5
) and is adjusted for exchange rate 
movements during the year. The Group’s leverage ratio at 29 March 2015 is 0.4:1 (2013-14 0.7:1). The Group’s ratio of EBITDA to interest 
(excluding arrangement fees) at 29 March 2015 is 40.4:1 (2013-14 31.4:1). As a result, the Group is well within its covenant agreement at 
29 March 2015. 
 
The interest rate chargeable on the s loan facility would increase if more than one third of the facility was drawn and would 
increase if the Group's leverage ratio exceeded 1:1. Under the loan agreement, the maximum interest rate chargeable would be LIBOR plus 
1.45 per cent. The €500 million bond becomes repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the bond agreement. 
These events of default include non-payment and insolvency. The blended interest rate on gross debt for the period to 27 March 2016 is 
forecast to be approximately three per cent.

Current tax 
Substantially all of the current tax charge for the Group is in respect of GLS. UK taxable profits in 2014-15 are almost fully covered by a 
combination of brought forward losses, capital allowance claims and a further statutory deduction in respect of shares awarded to employees 
under the Employee Free Shares scheme. Accordingly, the current tax rate for the Group is 10 per cent. 
Effective tax rate 
The effective tax rate on reported profit is 18 per cent, comprising current tax due on reported profits and deferred tax in relation to 
temporary differences. This rate is below the UK statutory rate, principally because no tax charge has been recognised in relation to property 
disposals, as no tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the grounds that were the assets (into which gains have been rolled) to be 
sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise. 
 
GLS pays tax in a number of territories, with the majority of its profits in the period to 29 March 2015 earned in territories where the tax 
rate is above the UK statutory tax rate. Certain subsidiaries, notably GLS France, remain unable to recognise tax credits on losses made 
during the reporting period. These factors contribute to GLS having a higher effective tax rate for the period than the UK statutory rate.

Net deferred tax liability (466) (142) 
The reported deferred tax position shows an increased overall liability in the reporting period to 29 March 2015. 
This increase in the reported liability is primarily as a result of the deferred tax impact of the increase in UK pension assets as described in 
note 8, which has been reflected in other comprehensive income. 
GLS has deferred tax assets and liabilities in various jurisdictions which cannot be offset against one another. The main balance relates to 
goodwill and intangibles liabilities in GLS Germany, for which the G 
At 29 March 2015, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of £68 million (2013-14 £68 million) comprising £61 million (2013-14 
£63 million) relating to tax losses of £227 million (2013-14 £238 million), mainly in GLS, that are available for offset against future profits if 
generated in the relevant companies and £7 million (2013-14 £5 million) in relation to £33 million (2013-14 £23 million) of UK capital 
losses carried forward. The Group has not recognised these deferred tax assets on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain of its capacity to 
utilise them in the future. 
The Group also has temporary differences in respect of £295 million (2013-14 £307 million) of capital losses, the tax effect of which is  
£59 million (2013-14 £61 million) in respect of assets previously qualifying for industrial buildings allowances. Further temporary differences 
exist in relation to £308 million (2013-14 £214 million) of gains for which rollover relief has been claimed, the tax effect of which is  
£62 million (2013-14 £43 million). No tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the basis that, were the assets (into which the gains 
have been rolled) to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.

 This difference excludes the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (RMSEPP) deficit correction payments of £10 million (2013-14 £10 million). The employer contribution 
cash flow rate forms part of the payroll expense and is paid into the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) (RM section). The contribution rate is set following each actuarial funding 
valuation, usually every three years. These actuarial valuations are required to be carried out on assumptions determined by the Trustee and agreed by Royal Mail 
UK Defined Contribution Scheme 
The Group operates the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan, which was launched in April 2009 and is open to employees who joined the 
Company from 31 March 2008 following closure of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) to new members. 
Ongoing UK defined contribution scheme costs have increased from £25 million in 2013-14 to £38 million, mainly due to an increase in the 
average employer’s contribution rate from 3.8 per cent in 2013-14 to 5.4 per cent.

8. Employee benefits – pensions (continued) 
UK Defined Benefit Schemes 
Royal Mail Group Limited had one of the largest defined benefit pension schemes in the UK (based on membership and assets), called the 
RMPP. On 1 April 2012 (one -13 reporting year) – after the granting of State Aid approval by the European Commission 
to HM Government on 21 March 2012 – almost all of the historic pension liabilities and pension assets of RMPP, built up until 31 March 
2012, were transferred to a new HM Government pension scheme, the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme (RMSPS). 
On this date, RMPP was also sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited each responsible for their own sections 
from 1 April 2012 onwards. 
The transfer left the Royal Mail section (RM section) of the RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis. This means that, using long-term 
 deficit correction payments 
relating to the historic liabilities. All further references in this note to the RMPP, relate to its RM section. 
Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) 
The RMPP is funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds. RMPP includes sections A, B and C, each with 
different terms and conditions: 
Section A is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined before 1 December 1971; 
Section B is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined on or after 1 December 1971 and before 1 April 1987 or for members 
of Section A who chose to receive Section B benefits; and 
Section C is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined on or after 1 April 1987 and before 1 April 2008. Benefits provided are 
based on  
Following conclusion of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the regular future service contribution rate for RMPP, expressed as a percentage 
of pensionable pay, remained at 17.1 per cent. As the valuation showed the Plan to be in surplus, no deficit correction payments are 
currently being made by the Company. The Group expects to contribute around £369 million to the RMPP in respect of normal cash service 
costs in 2015-16. 
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (RMSEPP) 
The Group also contributes to a smaller defined benefit scheme for executives, RMSEPP – which closed in December 2012 to future accrual. 
The Company no regular future service contributions. As agreed in the March 2012 actuarial valuation t s 
deficit correction payments of £10 million per annum until at least the date on which the 2018 valuation is completed (no later than 30 
September 2018). Deficit correction payments in 2014-15 were £10 million (2013-14 £10 million). 
A liability of £2 million (2013-14 £1 million) has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director. 
Pensions Reform 
In June 2013, the Company began a consultation with RMPP members on a proposal to ensure the RMPP could remain open to future 
accrual, subject to certain conditions, at least until the conclusion of the next periodic review in March 2018. Subsequently, on 26 September 
2013, the Company agreed with the RMPP Trustee to implement a Pensions Reform with effect from 1 April 2014. 
The agreed changes due to the Pensions Reform were considered to be a ‘Plan amendment’ which met the IAS 19 definition of a past service 
cost, and as such £1,350 million was recognised in the income statement of the Group for the comparative year ended 30 March 2014.

8. Employee benefits – pensions (continued) 
The surplus in RMPP is assumed to be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions. Therefore, no IFRIC 14 adjustment  
is required. The Directors do not believe that the current excess of pension scheme assets over the liabilities on an accounting basis will 
result in an excess of pension assets on a funding basis. However, the Directors are required to account for the pension scheme based  
on their legal right to benefit from a surplus, using long-term actuarial assumptions current at the reporting date, as required by IFRS. 
The actuarial/cash funding surplus of £1,793 million at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014 surplus of £1,422 million) allows the RMPP to 
remain open for the benefit of the members at least until March 2018, subject to certain conditions (as part of the Pensions Reform 
agreement), without requiring either  
The funding liabilities have increased more than the accounting liabilities since they are calculated by reference to gilt yields which have  
fallen to a greater extent than corporate bond yields on which the accounting liabilities are calculated. As a result, the funding surplus has 
increased less than the accounting surplus. 
The following disclosures relate to the major assumptions, sensitivities, surplus and gains/losses in the RMPP and RMSEPP defined  
benefit schemes. 
a) Major long-term assumptions used for accounting (IAS 19) purposes - RMPP and RMSEPP

 The real discount rate used reflects the long average duration of the RMPP scheme of around 30 years 
4
 The rate of increase in salaries, and the rate of pension increase for Section C members (who joined RMPP on or after April 1987) and RMSEPP ‘all other members’, is capped  
at five per cent, which results in the average long-term pension increase assumption being 10 basis points lower than the RPI long-term assumption 
Mortality 
The mortality assumptions for RMPP are based on the latest Self Administered Pension Scheme (SAPS) S1 mortality tables with appropriate 
scaling factors (106 per cent for male pensioners and 101 per cent for female pensioners). Future improvements are based on the CMI 2012 
core projections with a long-term trend of 1.25 per cent per annum. 
Sensitivity analysis for RMPP liabilities 
The RMPP liabilities are se

The average duration of the RMPP obligation is 30 years (2013-14 28 years).

Risk exposure and investment strategy 
The investment strategy of the RMPP Trustee aims to safeguard the assets of the Plan and to provide, together with contributions, the 
 the investment 
 pursuing a widely diversified approach across asset classes and investment managers. The RMPP uses 
 gnises that 
there is a natural conflict between improving the potential for positive return and limiting the potential for poor return. The RMPP Trustee 
has specified objectives for the investment policy that balance these requirements. 

Plan into a funding deficit, and the Company not being able to maintain its March 2018 commitment, the Trustee aims to hedge in advance the 
funding liabilities which will build up by March 2018. The liabilities projected to accrue to March 2017 have already been hedged – predominantly 
through investment in gilts and derivatives (interest rate and inflation rate swaps) held in Unit Trust pooled investments providing economic exposure 
to gilts. The impact of the Plan’s advance hedging of projected funding liabilities is to increase volatility in the pension surplus due to the return on the 
liability hedging assets not being matched by an increase in the accrued liabilities. As the accrued liabilities get closer to the projected liabilities that 
have been hedged, this volatility will reduce. The increase in the liability hedged assets is predominantly reflected in the Unit Trust values above which 
have increased from £1,864 million at 30 March 2014 to £4,166 million at 29 March 2015. 
The notional value covered by the interest rate swaps (full exposure to the relevant asset class incurred by entering into a derivative contract) 
held in a specific managed portfolio for this purpose at 29 March 2015 is £2.5 billion (at 30 March 2014 £2.3 billion) and the notional value 
covered by the inflation rate swaps at 29 March 2015 is £1.8 billion (at 30 March 2014 £1.5 billion). 
The spread of investments continues to balance security and growth in order to pay the RMPP benefits when they become due.

 Pension interest income results from applying the schemes’ discount rate at 30 March 2014 to the schemes’ assets at that date. Similarly, the pension interest cost results from 
applying the schemes’ discount rate as at 30 March 2014 to the schemes’ liabilities at that date 
 of gilts, which the RMPP Trustee holds as part of its liability hedging strategy. 
This strategy has been agreed with the Company to support the commitment Royal Mail has made to its employees, which is that, subject to certain 
conditions, RMPP will remain open until at least March 2018.  
In addition to the above items which affect the defined benefit asset, additional curtailment costs of £10 million (2013-14 £34 million) were 
recognised in the income statement on a consistent basis with the associated redundancy costs. Estimates of both are included in any 
redundancy provision raised.

This note provides details about the Free Shares awarded to employees, including the associated accounting charge to the Group’s

of shares awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme are also included. 
Employee Free Shares 
Ordinary shares representing ten per cent of the value of the Company were granted free of charge to eligible employees on 15 October 
2013, the date of the Initial Public Offering. These Free Shares are held on behalf of employees in an HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)-
approved Share Incentive Plan (SIP) administered by Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited (Equiniti).  
613 shares were awarded to each eligible full-time employee as their 2013 SIP allocation. The Company allocated a further 116 shares (729 
in total – see below) to eligible full-time employees on 9 April 2014 as a 2014 SIP allocation, subject to them remaining employees of Royal 
Mail Group Limited. 
The 729 total shares awarded to eligible full-time employees comprises the 725 initial, expected allocation of shares and an additional four 
shares resulting from the reallocation of shares forfeited by certain employees who left the Group during the 2013-14 reporting period.

10. Share-based payment (continued) 
Part-time eligible employees have been allocated a pro-rata number of shares. All allocated shares will be equity-settled. 
The fair value of the award of Free Shares is £510 million (including £20 million National Insurance) which is being charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis, adjusted for ‘good leavers’ and forfeitures, over the period of vesting (three years for the 2013 SIP and 
four years for the 2014 SIP, in each case from the award date).  
A charge to the income statement of £169 million (including £6 million National Insurance) has been made for the year ended 29 March 
2015 for both SIP allocations, as they were granted as one award. 
The Free Shares are held in a Trust funded by Royal Mail and may only be distributed to, or for the benefit of, eligible employees. The Trust 
is under the control of the Company and is operating for its benefit. At 29 March 2015 the Trust has been included in these consolidated 
financial statements.

Award of shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The 2013 LTIP is a three-year scheme that vests in March 2016. This scheme is being treated as a cash-settled scheme on the assumption 
that the award will result in cash payment. The fair value of the award reflects the share price at the reporting year end date of 29 March 
2015 at which point the value was £5 million (2013-14 £5 million). 
A further LTIP award was granted to senior management on 31 March 2014 (2014 LTIP). This award is equity-settled with the fair value of

Save As You Earn Share (SAYE) share option scheme 
On 24 July 2014 a SAYE share option scheme was introduced for eligible employees. Under the terms of the scheme the Board permits the 
grant of options in respect of ordinary shares in the Company to those employees who enter into an HMRC-approved SAYE savings contract. 
These contracts are for a term of three years with contributions from employees of an amount between £5 and £59 each month. The 
options purchased may be exercised during the six month period following the end of the contract at a subscription price of not less than 80 
per cent of the average of the mid- ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date.  
A charge to the Group income statement of £1 million has been made for the year ended 29 March 2015 in relation to the SAYE scheme. 
The table below shows the movements in share options during the reporting period.

For SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 429 pence. The weighted average 
exercise price for each of the above categories of share options is 360 pence. 
As a result of the scheme rules for good leavers, 43,850 (2013-14 nil) share options were exercisable at 29 March 2015 at a weighted 
average exercise price of 360 pence.

Financial assets and liabilities – financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise short-term  (including 
bonds), finance leases and cash. The main purposes of these financial instruments are to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the 
business’ operations. The Group has various other financial instruments, such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly 
from operations and are not disclosed further in this section. 
The Group enters into derivative transactions, which create derivative assets and liabilities; principally commodity price swaps, interest rate

The €500 million bond valued at £366 million (2013-14 £nil million) is at a fixed interest rate. Drawings under the s
facilities of £nil million (2013-14 £600 million) are at floating rates but interest rates on £150 million of Term Loan A had been fixed  
over the life of the loan facility by entering into interest rate swaps until the remaining swaps were sold when the term loan was repaid on  
9 March 2015. The combined average maturity date of drawn loans is 2024 (2013-14 average maturity date of 2017). The finance lease 
obligations of £272 million are all at a fixed rate (2013-14 £342 million, all at fixed rate). The total interest bearing financial assets of the 
Group (excluding the non-current investments) of £269 million (2013-14 £395 million), which consist of the fixed and floating rate cash and 
cash equivalent investments, plus the current financial asset investments, are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with an average 
maturity of 31 days (2013-14 an average maturity of three days). These short-dated financial instruments are maturity managed to obtain 
the best value out of the interest yield curve. 
The Group’s policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate financial instruments, combined 
 a high percentage of its net debt fixed.

Foreign currency transaction risk 
 interest payments on the €500 million bond, trading with overseas postal operators for 
carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, and various purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency (all of 
these exposures are in UKPIL). GLS’ reporting currency is the Euro and most of its revenues and profits are Euro based. There is some 
exposure to non- 
 ted internally and any 
remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts. Hedging will not normally be considered for 
exposures of less than £1 million and hedging is normally confined to 80 per cent of the forecast exposure where forecast cash flows are 
highly probable. 
Foreign currency risk translational risk 
The Group’s functional currency is Sterling. GLS’ functional currency is the Euro. GLS Euro profits are converted at the average exchange 
rate for the year, which can result in reported growth or decline that does not relate to underlying performance. GLS’ balance sheet is

UKPIL’s obligation to settle with overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) – 
comprised of US Dollar, Japanese Yen, Sterling and Euro. Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme, which is 
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
UKPIL’s obligations to settle conveyance charges in US Dollars have been hedged to April 2015, when the exposure ends and the hedge 
programme finishes. 
UKPIL has two active hedge programmes (commenced during the reporting period) and two hedge programmes which completed during the 
current and previous reporting period, covering obligations to settle Euro invoices on automation projects.

Liquidity risk 
The Group’s primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  
This is achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows. Typical short-term investments include 
 inuity of 
funding. The unused facilities for the Group of £1,050 million expire in 2020 (2013-14 £800 million expiring in 2018).

The Group targets a capital structure with metrics consistent with an investment grade

amendments to the syndicated loan facility have reduced the cost of debt and extended the average maturity date of the Group’s 
facilities to six years (2013-14 four years) whilst maintaining current levels of liquidity headroom. At 29 March 2015, the Group had 
undrawn loan facilities of £1,050 million (2013-14 £800 million). 
The Group ensures it meets the covenants and other obligations of the loan agreements. The syndicated loan facility covenants require 
the Group to maintain the (leverage) ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA below 3:1 and EBITDA to interest (excluding arrangement fees) 
above 3.5:1. Adjusted net debt consists of net debt plus Letters of Credit (contingent liabilities in respect of the UKPIL insurance programme, 
where the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote

The Group’s leverage ratio at 29 March 2015 was 0.4:1 (2013-14 0.7:1). The Group’s ratio of EBITDA to interest (excluding arrangement 
fees) at 29 March 2015 was 40.4:1 (2013-14 31.4:1).

Capital management (continued) 
The Group is committed to growing dividends. The Board has recommended a final dividend of 14.3 pence per share. Including the interim 
dividend of 6.7 pence per share, this represents a total dividend of 21.0 pence per share for 2014-15. This is a five per cent increase on the 
previous year’s notional dividend of 20.0 pence per share.

As a result of the mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments and the currency and commodity hedge programmes in place, the 
Group 2013-14 £nil 
million erling on consolidation and an 
offsetting exposure on translating the €500 million bond into Sterling at each balance sheet date. The impact of a five per cent strengthening 
of Sterling during the reporting period would have been to reduce the Group net assets by £8 million (2013-14 £34 million).

18. Financial assets and liabilities – additional analysis 
This note provides an analysis of the Sterling carrying values of the financial assets and liabilities held in various foreign currencies,  
 
Table 1 shows all the financial assets and liabilities in detail and on a net basis. Table 2 shows the net amount by currency. Table 3 
shows the respective assets/liabilities by whether they are fixed, floating or non-interest bearing. Table 4 shows the effective interest  
rate and maturity analysed as fixed rate, floating rate and non-interest bearing. 
Carrying amounts and fair values 
Trade receivables, payables, prepayments and accruals have been omitted from this analysis on the basis that carrying value is a 
reasonable approximation of fair value. Pension scheme assets and liabilities are also excluded. Fair values have been calculated using 
 bond price, interest rates, forward exchange rates and commodity prices) and discounted using appropriate 
discount rates. There are no material differences between the fair value (transaction price) of all financial instruments at initial 
recognition and the fair value calculated using these valuation techniques. The fair value of the €500 million bond (non-current) is  
£402 million at 29 March 2015 (2013-14 £nil million Sterling using the 
closing spot exchange rate. The fair value of total ‘Obligations under finance leases’ is £282 million (2013-14 £341 million). For all other 
financial instruments fair value is equal to the carrying amount. The tables below also set out the carrying amount of the currency of the 
Group’s financial instruments:

19. Hedging programmes 
Information regarding the various hedging programmes in place to mitigate volatility in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange 
rates is provided below. 
The hedging programmes use a number of financial derivative products to manage volatility in commodity prices, interest rates and 
 ative asset is 
recognised, and if they are ‘out of the money’ a derivative liability is recognised. Full disclosures are provided in this note even though the 
balance sheet amounts are not material in the context of the Group’s total assets and liabilities. 
The purpose of the Group’s hedging programmes is to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
 e Company to 
choose whether to designate cash flow hedge programmes or not (subject to various tests). The impact of not designating a cash flow hedge 
programme is that 
be deferred into equity. 
The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous reporting years: 
Hedging activities 
i) The diesel fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts 
to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar/Sterling exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases. 
ii) The jet fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to 
hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar/Sterling exchange rates for forecast jet fuel usage. 
iii) The air conveyance hedge programme uses US Dollar forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from US 
Dollar/Sterling exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases. 
iv) Four capital programmes (one of which completed during 2013-14, one of which completed during 2014-15 and two of which 
commenced in 2014-15) use Euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from Sterling/Euro exchange rates 
for contracted capital expenditure on automation projects.

19. Hedging programmes (continued) 
v) The electricity hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from electricity prices. In addition 
the Group uses fixed rate prices contracts with suppliers to set future prices. 
vi) The gas hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from gas prices. 
vii) The interest rate hedge programme uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge the exposure arising from interest rates on borrowings 
under the s . The hedge programme finished when the interest rate swap contracts were sold following the 
repayment on 9 March 2015 of the floating rate term loans. 
viii) UKPIL trades in SDRs with overseas postal operators for delivering UK origin mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK.  
The UKPIL overseas postal operators’ hedge programme uses US Dollar and Japanese Yen forward currency purchase contracts to hedge 
the forecast future net purchases of delivery services. This hedge programme covers the exposure up until the purchases are incurred 
and recognised on the balance sheet. 
The Group had undesignated cash flow hedge programmes for the transactional exposure created by intercompany loans with GLS and the 
exposure of UKPIL to overseas postal operator liabilities for the period after the purchases have been incurred and recognised on the balance 
sheet until the time when they are settled. The derivative balances of these programmes are not material. 
The Group uses the €500 million bond as a hedge of the net investment in GLS, against movements in the Sterling/Euro exchange rate.  
Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of GLS and of the €500 million bond to closing 
Sterling/Euro exchange rates are deferred in equity. These exchange differences would be released from equity to the income statement as 
part of the gain or loss on the sale if GLS were sold. During the year foreign currency exchange gains on the bond of £27 million (2013-14 
£nil million) were deferred in equity. There was no ineffectiveness in the hedge during the year. 
Commodity price hedging 
The Group’s normal operating activities result in the consumption of fuel (both diesel and jet), electricity and gas. The prices of these 
 ce. 
For diesel fuel and jet fuel these price swaps are sometimes entered into on the US Dollar price for the commodity (based upon available 
 ice for the commodity.  
For electricity, the Group also uses fixed price contracts with suppliers to set future prices. 
 or fixed. The Group hedges the cost 
of the underlying commodity and any irrecoverable VAT that is incurred on this cost. It does not hedge any fuel duty. The exposures shown in 
 es at the balance sheet 
date for the unhedged amounts. Fuel duty (and the associated VAT) adds an additional cost of around £100 million to diesel costs each 
reporting year. Total fuel costs for 2015-16 are estimated to be £171 million.

Foreign currency hedging for non-commodity items 
As highlighted in note 14, the Group, where possible, nets exposure to foreign currency internally. The remaining net exposure is hedged with 
external forward foreign currency contracts. For existing currency liabilities, the underlying exposures (e.g. the foreign postal administration 
liabilities) and the derivatives, g that no net gains or losses arise 
in the income statement. For forecast future currency exposures, the derivatives are revalued at the balance sheet date and effective 
movements in value are deferred into equity until the hedged transaction occurs.

The next 12 months’ exposure is calculated as the combination of the cost of settling liabilities during the next 12 months and the cost of 
revaluing unsettled liabilities at the end of 12 months. The GLS intercompany loan was repaid during the year. 
As highlighted in note 14, the Company hedges part of the translational exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries, 
mainly GLS, by designating the €500 million bond as a hedge of the net investment in GLS. 
Derivative values 
At any point in time, the derivatives in these cash flow hedge programmes are either ‘in the money’ which, means the hedged rates are better 
 , or ‘out of the money’ which means the hedged 
money’) and losses (‘out of the money’), as at the balance sheet date are deferred into equity (where the hedge is effective) and an associated 
financial asset or financial liability is created in the balance sheet. The financial asset/liability is released when the derivative matures. The 
amounts deferred into equity are released when the hedged transaction occurs. The following tables show the derivative contracts entered 
into at 29 March 2015 and 30 March 2014 and the associated derivative assets and liabilities.

Other derivatives represent hedges by the Group of other foreign exchange exposures, which are not designated under IAS 39 (including the 
hedge of the trading balance with overseas postal operators and the hedge of intercompany loans with overseas subsidiaries). 
There are timing differences between the maturity of the derivatives and the maturity of the underlying hedged transaction. For example, 
diesel derivatives that hedge the exposure to purchasing fuel in March 2015 mature in April 2015. At 29 March 2015 therefore, the balance 
 sed from the 
hedging reserve to the income statement to match the exposure to purchasing fuel in March 2015. There are differences therefore between 
derivative balances (shown above) and the balance on the hedging reserve.

Transformation provisions (charged as transformation costs) 
Transformation costs provisions of £56 million (2013-14 £136 million) comprise redundancy schemes of £56 million (2013-14 £134 
million), including £6 million release (2013-14 £102 million charge) in respect of the management reorganisation programme. Current 
transformation costs provisions of £53 million are expected to be utilised in 2015-16, with the remainder within two to three years. 
Specific items 
The specific items provisions of £154 million at 29 March 2015 (2013-14 £87 million) include £81 million (2013-14 £62 million) for 
potential industrial diseases claims relating to both current and former employees of the Group. 
Royal Mail Group’s liability in respect of former employees arose in 2010 as a result of a Court of Appeal judgement that held the Group 
liable for diseases claims brought by individuals who were employed in the General Post Office Telecommunications division and whose 
employment ceased prior to October 1981. Consequently, a provision was first recognised in 2010-11. 
The Group has derived its current provision by using estimates and ranges calculated by its actuary, which are based on current experience 
of claims, and an assessment of potential future claims, the majority of which are expected to be received over the next 25 to 30 years.  
The Group has a rigorous process of ensuring that only valid claims are accepted. £3 million of this provision is expected to be utilised in 
2015-16. 
The remaining £73 million (2013-14 £25 million) mainly relates to IT systems costs associated with Post Office Limited separation, of  
which £9 million is expected to be utilised in 2015-16, and French Competition Authority investigation costs, of which £42 million is expected 
to be utilised in 2015-16. An additional £13 million is in respect of a German property tax liability of £4 million, expected to be utilised in 
2015-16, and employer’s National Insurance associated with the award of Employee Free Shares of £9 million, expected to be utilised within 
two to five years. 
The £4 million reclassification relates to a historic provision in respect of legacy property costs and is therefore deemed to be a specific item. 
A further £5 million was charged to specific items in the year in relation to this provision. Of the total provision of £9 million, £1 million is 
expected to be utilised within two to five years and the remaining £8 million over a period greater than five years. 
Other provisions (charged as operating costs) 
‘Other’ provisions of £43 million (2013-14 £45 million) mainly comprise onerous lease obligations, decommissioning costs and estimated 
exposures resulting from legal claims incurred in the normal course of business. The majority of ‘Other’ provision amounts are expected to  
be utilised in 2015-16, with £5 million onerous lease obligations expected to be utilised within two to three years.

The carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations of £182 million (2013-14 £197 million) at the balance sheet date includes 
£177 million (2013-14 £195 million) relating to the GLS business unit. In line with the Group’s accounting policy (see ‘Significant accounting 
policies’), this goodwill has been reviewed for impairment. The carrying value of GLS, excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and 
liabilities, is £434 million (2013-14 £492 million) at 29 March 2015 and the operating profit before transformation costs items is £115 
million (2013-14 £106 million) for the period (note 2). 
The carrying value of GLS (£434 million) represents a multiple of 3.8 (2013-14 4.6) of operating profit before transformation costs. The net 
realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review (i.e. the ‘fair value less costs of disposal’), has been assessed with 
reference to earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector of 6.8. On this basis, the net realisable value has been assessed to be in 
excess of the carrying value. The earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by more than 57 per cent to 2.9 to reduce the net 
realisable value to below the carrying value.

and liabilities are classified in this way when their carrying value is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is 
considered highly probable. Their value in the balance sheet is the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. At the 
reporting date, the balances comprise the assets and liabilities of GLS Germany’s  & Co. KG  
(DPD SL) and certain surplus property assets. 
The balance sheet values of the assets and liabilities held for sale are shown below. The disposal group in this note, as defined in IFRS 5

25. Investment in associate 
This note provides details of the Group’s associate company, including the Group’s share of the revenue, profit and net assets of this 
entity. Quadrant Catering Limited. 
Quadrant Catering Limited (Quadrant), the Group’s 51 per cent owned associate company, has a reporting date of the last day of September 
each year. Accordingly, to ensure that the reported share of the profit of this company aligns with the Group’s reporting year ended 29 March 
2015 (2013-14 30 March 2014 the Company’s management reporting systems, 
although this includes an estimated profit figure for the month of March. 
The majority of Board membership and voting power to direct relevant activities in Quadrant, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, 
providing catering services for the UK businesses, is held by the other investor company. For this reason it is Management’s view that the 
Group does not have power over Quadrant and so it is not considered to be a subsidiary in line with IFRS 10. The Group’s investment in 
Quadrant is held by Royal Mail Group Limited. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of Quadrant to transfer funds to the Group 
 in the form of cash dividends, repayment of loans or advances. 
The Group’s share of Quadrant’s revenue for the reporting year was £16 million (2013-14 £19 million) and its share of Quadrant’s profit 
after tax was £1 million (2013-14 £3 million). This share of profit after tax is credited against ‘Other operating costs’ in the income 
statement. The Group’s share of the net assets of Quadrant at 29 March 2015 was £5 million (at 30 March 2014 £4 million). 
During the reporting year the Group received no dividend (2013-14 £2 million) from Quadrant.

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary 
statements of the major subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. 
All intra-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through negotiation with the respective businesses. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which 
control is no longer held by the Group. Where the Group ceases to hold control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include 
the results for the part of the reporting year during which the Group held control. 
Non-controlling interests represents the portion of profit/loss, gains/losses and net assets relating to subsidiaries that are not attributable to 
members of the Company. The non-controlling interests balance is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from 
parent shareholders’ equity. 
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures 
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are consistent with those in the Annual Report for the year 
ended 30 March 2014, except for the adoption of amended/revised and new accounting standards with effect from 31 March 2014 as 
detailed below: 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements  
This new standard identifies the concept of control as the determining factor in deciding which entities should be included within the 
consolidated financial statements. This standard replaces all the previous guidance on control and consolidation which was given in IAS 27. 
The application of this new standard has no impact on the consolidation decisions made by the Group. 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements  
This standard (which supersedes IAS 31) provides a new set of definitions which reduces the types of joint arrangements that can be 
recognised to two (previously three). The standard also stipulates that equity accounting is mandatory for all participants in joint ventures.  
At the reporting date the Group has no joint arrangements and currently therefore, this new standard has no impact on the financial 
performance or position of the Group. 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities  
This new standard sets out the disclosure requirements arising from the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 standards. This standard requires 
additional disclosures in respect of the Group’s associate investment (note 25), but has no impact on the financial performance or position of 
the Group. 
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amended)  
 and joint ventures to be accounted for using the equity 
method following the issue of IFRS 11. It is already Group policy to account for such entities using the equity method and so this amendment 
will have no impact on the Group. 
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (Amended)  
This amendment was made to clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The 
 therefore has no impact on the Group’s financial position. 
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (Amended)  
This amendment relates to the disclosure of information regarding the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based upon 
fair value less costs of disposal. This amendment to the standard has no impact on the Group’s financial position or related disclosures. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements  
The preparation of consolidated financial statements necessarily requires Management 
significant impact on the financial statements. These estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements are disclosed below. 
Pensions 
The value of defined benefit pension plan liabilities and assessment of pension plan costs are determined by long-term actuarial 
assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates (which are based on the long-term yield of high-quality corporate bonds), inflation 
rates and mortality rates. Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in the Group’s 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group exercises its judgement in determining the assumptions to be adopted, after 
 s are included 
within note 8.

Deferred revenue 
The Group recognises advance customer payments on its balance sheet, relating to stamps and meter credits purchased by customers but 
not yet used at the balance sheet date (note 27). The valuation of this deferred revenue is based on a number of different estimation and 
sampling methods using external specialist resource as appropriate. 
The majority of this balance is made up of stamps sold to the general public. For sales to the general public, estimates of stamp volumes held 
are made on the basis of monthly surveys performed by an independent third party. In order to avoid over-estimation of the typical number 
of stamps held, Management applies a cap to the results to exclude what are considered to be abnormal stamp holdings from the estimate. 
The level at which holdings are capped is judgemental and is currently set at 99 of each stamp type per household. The impact of applying 
alternative capping values on the year end public stamp deferred revenue balance is shown in the table below. 
 Capped Uncapped 
At 29 March 2015 30 
As reported 
99  300 
Public stamp holdings value (£m) 165 198 223 227 
The value of stamps and meter credits held by retail and business customers are more directly estimated through the analysis of sales 
 asing of 
stamps when price changes are announced. 
The results of the above procedures are reviewed by Management 
total accrual is held within current trade and other payables but a portion (which cannot be measured) will relate to stamps and meter credits 
used one year or more after the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax 
Assessment of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future profitability. Such estimation is inherently uncertain 
to various competitive pressures. Should estimates of future profitability change in future years, the amount of deferred tax recognised will 
also change accordingly. Prior to recording deferred tax assets for tax losses, relevant tax law is considered to determine the availability of 
the losses to offset against the future taxable profits. The carrying values of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within note 6. 
Provisions 
Due to the nature of provisions, a significant part of their determination is based upon estimates and/or judgements concerning the future. Of 
the provisions in place the transformation and industrial diseases claims provisions are considered to be the areas where the application of 
judgement has the most significant impact. 
Transformation provisions, including for redundancy and property costs, are derived based upon the most recent business plan for direct 
 plans include 
the expected number of employees impacted, expected rate of compensation per employee, expected period of properties remaining vacant 
and their rental costs as well as expected dilapidation costs.  
The industrial diseases claims provision arose as a result of a Court of Appeals judgement in 2010 and relates to individuals who were 
employed in the General Post Office Telecommunications division prior to October 1981. The provision requires estimates to be made of the 
 t information available as at the year end, which incorporates independent 
expert actuarial advice. The carrying values of the provisions are included within note 20. 
Revenue 
Revenue reported in the income statement is net of value added tax and comprises turnover which principally relates to the rendering of 
services as follows: 
UK Parcels, International & Letters 
Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the delivery of an item is complete. Contracted services that have not 
yet been rendered at the balance sheet date are designated as deferred income. 
Revenue from direct sales of products or services is recognised when services are rendered, goods are delivered and the amount of revenue 
that will flow to the Group can be measured reliably. Where payments are received for a service to be provided over a specified length of 
time, payments received are recognised as deferred revenue and released to the income statement over the period that the service is 
performed. 
 items is complete. Where products are sold 
through third party agents, the revenue receivable is recognised gross with any commission payments being charged to operating costs. 
Revenue relating to public, retail and business stamp and meter sales is recognised when the sale is made, adjusted to reflect a value of 
stamp and meter credits held but not used by the customer. Further details on this ‘deferred revenue’ adjustment are provided in the ‘Key 
sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements’ section above.

General Logistics Systems 
Revenue is derived from specific contracts and is recognised when the delivery of an item is complete. 
Distribution and conveyance costs 
Distribution and conveyance costs relate to non-people costs incurred in transporting and delivering mail. These include conveyance by rail, 
road, sea and air, together with costs incurred by international mail carriers and Parcelforce Worldwide delivery operators and GLS. These 
costs are disclosed separately on the face of the income statement. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity settled, share-based compensation schemes under which the Group receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (shares) of the Company. These include the HMRC-approved (Employee Free Shares) 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme. Both schemes are based on non-
until the employee completes a specific period of service. Share-based payments awarded as part of Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) vest 
 The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an 
expense in the income statement, with a corresponding credit entry in equity, as per the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. The 
total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date on which they are granted. The fair 
value of each award is measur -Scholes model where appropriate. 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. At each balance sheet date before vesting the cumulative expense is calculated, 
representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and Management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of service 
conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance 
sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity. The social security contributions payable in connection 
with the grant of Shares is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction. 
Non-GAAP measures of performance 
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not defined under IFRS, the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP), under which the Group reports. The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures assist with the 
understanding of the performance of the business. 
These non-GAAP measures are not a substitute, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but they have been included as 
Management considers them to be an important means of comparing performance year-on-
the business for assessing performance. 
Transformation costs 
These costs relate to the ongoing transformation of the business, and include voluntary redundancy, project costs and other transformation-
related payments. 
Reported operating profit before transformation costs 
This is the operating profit including the ‘pension charge to cash difference’ operating specific item (see below for definition) and before 
 to determine employee 
incentives. 
Reported operating profit after transformation costs 
This is the operating profit including the ‘pension charge to cash difference’ operating specific item and after transformation costs. 
Operating specific items 
These are recurring or non-recurring items of income or expense of a particular size and/or nature relating to the operations of the business 
that in Management’s opinion require separate identification. These items are included within ‘reported’ results but are excluded from 
‘adjusted’ results. 
These items include: the recurring ‘pension charge to cash difference’ (resulting from the increasing difference between the Group’s income 
statement pension charge and the actual cash cost of pensions, including deficit payments); and other items that have resulted from events 
that are non-recurring in nature, even though related income/expense can be recognised in subsequent periods. These items currently 
include the charge for Employee Free Shares and impairment and legacy costs (for example, movements in the industrial diseases provision). 
Non-operating specific items 
These are recurring or non-recurring items of income or expense of a particular size and/or nature which do not form part of the Group’s 
trading activity and in Management’s opinion require separate identification. These items include profit on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment and businesses, and the IAS 19 non-cash pension interest credit/charge. 
Adjusted operating profit before transformation costs 
This is operating profit excluding the ‘pension charge to cash difference’ operating specific item and before transformation costs. 
Adjusted operating profit margin before transformation costs 
This is operating profit excluding the ‘pension charge to cash difference’ operating specific item and before transformation costs, expressed as 
a percentage of revenue.

This is operating profit excluding the ‘pension charge to cash difference’ operating specific item and after transformation costs, expressed as a

Adjusted earnings per share  
Basic earnings per share, excluding operating and non-operating specific items.
Free cash flow 
Free cash flow is based on statutory (reported) net cash flow before financing activities, adjusted to include finance costs paid and exclude net 
cash generated from the purchase/sale of financial asset investments. 
Net debt 
Net debt is calculated by netting the value of financial liabilities (excluding derivatives) against cash and other liquid assets. 
Underlying change  
Management focuses on movements in volume, revenue, costs, profits and margins on an ‘underlying’ basis. Underlying movements  
 e for non-
recurring or distorting items, which by their nature may be unpredictable. These adjustments are made to the prior year ‘adjusted’ figures  
to derive ‘underlying change’. A schedule of the adjustments to the 2013-14 ‘adjusted’ results to derive ‘underlying change’ is shown in the 
Financial review on pages 29-30. 
Income tax and deferred tax 
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the reporting year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is 
calculated using rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all taxable and deductible temporary differences and unused tax assets and 
losses except: 
 Initial recognition of goodwill; 
 The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss; 
 Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures, where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future; and 
 Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which they can be 
utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent that it is probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow them to be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the tax asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are 
not discounted. 
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if they relate to items that are credited or charged directly to equity, 
otherwise it is recognised in the income statement. 
Earnings per share (EPS) 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the profit/loss from continuing operations (adjusted for 
non-controlling interests’ share of profit) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. The Group EPS is calculated in the 
same way, except that it also includes profit or loss from discontinued operations. 
Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from share-based payment schemes. These potential shares are treated as dilutive only when their 
conversion to ordinary shares would decrease EPS from continuing operations.

Segment information 
The Group’s operating segments are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with 
 t monitors the 
operating results of its main 
assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit before and after transformation costs. 
There is no aggregation of operating segments. The main statutory entities included  
in note 2. 
The operating segments comprise operations in both the UK and other parts of Europe, the latter being relevant to the GLS business unit. 
The UK operations comprise the UKPIL business unit plus the Other operating segment. 
Segment revenues have been attributed to the respective countries based on the primary location of the service performed. 
Transfer prices between segments are set at arm’s length/fair value on a basis of charges reached through negotiation with the respective 
business units that form part of the segments. 
There are no differences in the measurement of the respective segments’ profit/loss and the consolidated financial statements prepared 
under IFRS. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is 
intended use. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-
remaining useful economic lives of assets and their estimated residual values. The useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and 
adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. The lives assigned to major categories of property, plant and equipment are: 
Land and buildings:  
Freehold land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease, 50 years or the estimated remaining useful life  
Plant and machinery 3-15 years 
Motor vehicles and trailers 2-12 years 
Fixtures and equipment 2-15 years 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising at derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. Gains or losses from the 
disposal of assets are 
customer. 
All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of 
those parts replaced is derecognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. 
Goodwill 
Business combinations on or after 29 March 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method. Any 
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising from business combinations is 
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
For the purpose of such impairment reviews, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating units. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill (or cash generating 
unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and its value in use.  
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included in the cost of those entities and therefore not reported in the 
balance sheet as goodwill. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured 
reliably on initial recognition. Intangible assets acquired separately or development costs that meet the criteria to be capitalised are initially 
recognised at cost and are assessed to have either a finite or indefinite useful life. Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life 
and those with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events, or changes in circumstances, indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of 
the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and its value in use.

Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is charged annually to the income statement on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Customer listings 3 to 4 years 
Master franchise licences 7 to 10 years 
Software 3 to 10 years 
Investment in associate 
The Group’s investment in its associate company is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the 
investment is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associates, less 
any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of annual post-tax profits from the associate (netted off other 
operating costs as the values are not material enough for separate disclosure). 
Any goodwill arising on acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s share of 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is included in the carrying amount and not amortised. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather 
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed 
sale within one year from the date of classification. Following their classification as held for sale, the assets (including those in a disposal 
group) cease being depreciated.  
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations, that has been disposed of, or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a single line which comprises the post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation up 
to the date of disposal, and the post-tax gain or loss recognised on any remeasurement of the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell, 
or on disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting discontinued operations. 
Impairment reviews 
Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, assets and cash generating units are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. 
Where appropriate, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or 
cash generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and its value in use. 
Leases 
Finance leases, where substantially all the ris
capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and capital element of the 
lease liability to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the 
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

and rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of 
rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
A leasehold land payment is an upfront payment to acquire a long-term leasehold interest in land. This payment is stated at cost and is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.  
In addition to lease contracts, other significant arrangements or contracts are assessed (by reference to IFRIC 4) to determine whether, in 
substance, they are, or contain, a lease. This assessment is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date, including whether 
the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any non-collectable amounts. An estimate 
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable with the amount of the loss recognised in the income 
statement within operating costs. When a bad debt is recognised, it is written off against the allowance for trade receivables. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating costs in the income statement. 
Inventories 
Inventories are valued on a weighted average cost basis and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct 
expenditure and other costs attrib
engineering spare parts.

Trade payables 
Trade payables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Generally this results in their recognition  
at their nominal value. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are classified as: financial assets at fair 
value through the income statement (held for trading); held to maturity investments; loans and receivables or available for sale financial 
assets as appropriate. Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the  
income statement or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. 
The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting 
date. When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of 
financial instruments not at ‘fair value through the income statement’, any directly attributable transactional costs. The Group only has loans 
and receivables, financial liabilities measured at cost and derivative asset and liabilities.  
The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on their classification as follows: 
Loans and receivables 
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determina 
and have not been designated as either ‘fair value through the income statement’ or available for sale, are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the 
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities are 
initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable issue costs. After initial recognition, non-derivative 
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the 
income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
 short-term deposits (cash equivalents) with an 
original maturity date of three mo
these funds are also categorised as cash equivalents. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of  Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables financial 
instruments. 
Financial assets – pension escrow investments 
Financial assets – investment established to provide security to the Royal Mail 
Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) in support of a deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustee in 2013. 
Financial assets – other investments 
Financial assets – other investments comprise short-term  
an original maturity of three months or more. Short-term deposits are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments. 
Financial liabilities – interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. The €500 million bond is measured at amortised 
cost in Euro and converted to Sterling at the closing spot Sterling/Euro exchange rate. 
Financial liabilities – obligations under finance leases 
All obligations under finance leases are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging programmes 
The Group uses  
of the Group, in line with the Group’s treasury management policies. Such derivative financial instruments are initially stated at fair value. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that

 meet the 
conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to relate to an effective hedge  
is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. 
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, then at the time the asset  
or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement 
of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised 
in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same reporting year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net 
profit/loss, for example when the hedged transaction actually occurs.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that point, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to the income statement for the reporting year. 
Fair value measurement of financial instruments 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: 
Level 1 – . 
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
Level 3 -  
The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.  
 
 ich is substantially the same; and discounted cash flow analysis 
 es for the 
underlying commodity/currency and discounted using quoted interest rates (both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date). 
Hence derivative assets and liabilities are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined within IFRS 13. 
The Group determines whether any transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each 
reporting period. For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of 
 calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent 
interest rates as at close of business on the balance sheet date. For the €500 million bond, the disclosed fair value is calculated as the closing 
 nd price converted to Sterling using the closing spot Sterling/Euro exchange rate. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax 
rate. Accounting estimates used in calculating the provisions are discussed further in the ‘Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical 
accounting judgements’ part of this accounting policies section. 
Dividends 
Distributions to owners of the Company are not recognised in the income statement under IFRS, but are disclosed as a component of the 
movement in shareholders’ equity. A liability is recorded for a dividend when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders but  
not paid at the year end. Interim dividends are recognised as a distribution when paid. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The pension assets for the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value. Liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the 
projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent 
currency and term. The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet. Full actuarial 
valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determined by the Trustees and, with appropriate updates and 
accounting adjustments at each balance sheet date, form the basis of the surplus disclosed. All active members of defined benefit schemes 
are contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State Second pension scheme. 
For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and any gains and losses arising from 
settlements, curtailments and past service costs. The amount resulting from applying the Plan’s discount rate (for liabilities) to the pension 
surplus at the beginning of the reporting year is recognised as net pension interest in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains and 
losses is also recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Group’s contributions are charged to operating profit within people costs in the period to which the

Foreign currencies 
The functional and presentational currency of Royal Mail plc is Sterling (£). The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries in Europe is 
mainly the Euro (€). 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The trading results of 
foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting year, being a reasonable approximation to the actual 
 irectly to the foreign 
currency translation reserve in equity. 
Foreign currency exchange differences arising from translation of the €500 million bond (designated as a hedge of the net investment in 
GLS) to closing Sterling/Euro exchange rates are deferred to the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. These exchange differences 
would be released from equity to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale if GLS was sold. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Currently hedge accounting is not claimed for any monetary assets and liabilities. All differences are

recognised in profit or loss. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of their historic cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the 
dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at 
the date when the fair value is determined.

Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
 the Group financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 29 March 2015 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and  
 the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Royal Mail plc for the period ended 29 March 2015 which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 142, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
Group financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2014-15 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect

apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Recorded revenue is adjusted for sales of stamps and meter

The adjustment is based on external third party surveys. 
We performed controls testing over revenue recognition as well 
as detailed transaction testing, including the timing of revenue 
recognition. 
We challenged Management’s underlying assumptions and 
methodology used in its deferred revenue calculations, as well 
as assessing whether the revenue recognition policies adopted 
complied with IFRS as adopted in the EU.  
We have independently assessed the methodology of the external 
surveys with the use of our internal specialists, including 
consideration of survey size and caps in place to address the impact 
of abnormal holdings. 
We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in

Risk How the scope of our audit addressed the risk 
Accounting and valuation of the Group’s pension 
scheme; (as described on page 52 of the Audit and 
Committee Report and note 8 of the financial statements). 
 
Both the defined benefit schemes (the Royal Mail Pension 
Plan and the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan) are 
sensitive to long-term assumptions which can result in 
material fluctuations in amounts recorded in the financial 
statements.
 ists, 
we challenged Management’s 
in its pension accounting to evaluate the appropriateness of the 
methodology. Specifically, we tested Management’s estimate of the 
discount rate, inflation rates (RPI and CPI), salary increases, 
mortality, retirement age and commutation.
We have agreed the pension schemes assets to independent 
fund manager confirmations as well as sample tested the asset 
valuations.  
We have performed detailed testing on the membership data 
provided by Management to the external actuaries.
We also considered whether the Group’s pension disclosures are 
appropriate and in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the EU. 
Accounting and measurement of the Group’s provisions, 
including costs associated with the French Competition 
Authority investigation and the industrial diseases 
provision; (as described on pages 51 and 52 of the Audit 
and Report and note 20 of the financial 
statements). 
 
The Group’s provisions are based on management’s best 
estimate of outcomes using assumptions that require 
judgement. 
 
The outcome of the French Competition Authority 
investigation ch, the provision in 
the financial statements for the year ended 29 March 2015 
is based on external legal advice.  
 
The value of the provision in relation to the industrial 
diseases is based on external third party actuarial advice.  
We reviewed the Group’s provisions to understand the 
appropriateness of assumptions supporting Management’s 
estimates, challenging Management’s accounting treatment and 
disclosures. 
We have reviewed the external legal advice in relation to the French 
Competition Authority investigation, including consideration of the 
correspondence received from the Authority.  
We reviewed the scenarios presented by legal advisors, which 
included a range of probable outcomes. We reassessed the 
amount considered by Management to represent a best 
estimate of expenditure required, based on legal advice.

challenged Management’s 
to evaluate the appropriateness of the industrial diseases 
actuarial methodology. 
We also considered the completeness of the Group’s provisions 
and contingent liability disclosures and compliance with IFRS as 
adopted in the EU. 
Our application of materiality  
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our 
audit and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material 

 or influenced. We also determine a level of 
performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be 
material for the financial statements as a whole. We determined planning materiality for the Group to be £27.1 million, which is 
approximately five per cent of adjusted profit before tax (2013-14: five per cent of adjusted profit before tax). This provided a basis for
 atement 
and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.  
 with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that 
overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75 per cent of planning materiality, namely £20.3 million. Our objective in 
adopting this approach is to ensure that, together with qualitative considerations, total detected and undetected audit differences do not 
exceed our planning materiality of £27.1 million for the financial statements as a whole.  
We agreed with the Audit and rt to the Committee all adjusted and unadjusted audit differences  
in excess of £1.4 million. We also agreed to report differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.

An overview of the scope of our audit  
 11 components which 
represent the principal business units within the Group’s reportable segments and account for 99 per cent of the Group’s revenue and 
99 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax. Two of these components were subject to a full audit and four were subject to audits of 
specific account balances (together accounting for 92 per cent of revenue and 98 per cent of profit before tax). Five were subject to 
 of 
material misstatement in the Group financial statements. 
 audit was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which 
were much lower than Group materiality. The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been 
designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or his designate visits each of the two full scope locations at least once a year. This 
year, the Group audit team visited the UK and overseas full scope locations. For all full scope entities, the Group audit tea
 participated in the component team’s planning including the component team’s discussion of fraud and error.

annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have

 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

1. Parent Company accounting policies 
Financial reporting year 
The financial reporting year ends on the last Sunday in March and, accordingly, these financial statements are made up for 52 
29 March 2015 (2013-14  
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements of the Company were authorised for issue by the Board on 20 May 2015. 
The financial statements and notes on pages 146 to 148 have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards  
and law, including the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Unless otherwise stated in the accounting policies below, the financial 
statements have been prepared under the historic cost accounting convention. 
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. However, the 
results of the Company are presented in notes 4 and 11 to these financial statements. 
The Compan 
by that standard as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the 
Group under IFRS 7. 
No new UK accounting standards which affect the presentation of these financial statements have been issued. 
Investment in subsidiary 
The investment in subsidiary is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Debtors 
Debtors are recognised with an allowance for any non-collectable amounts, including where collection is no longer probable. 
Adoption of FRS 101 in 2015-16 
In 2012, the FRC, being the standard setting body in the UK, published FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
qualifying entities that prepare their Annual Report and Accounts under EU adopted IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).  
 K entities will be required to adopt this or an alternative 
standard in 2015. Royal Mail plc intends to prepare its accounts under FRS 101 for the first time in 2015. This change is not expected to 
have a significant impact on the Royal Mail plc parent Company accounts. The consolidated accounts for the Group will continue to be 
prepared under full IFRS. The Board considers that it is in the best interests of the Group for Royal Mail plc to adopt FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
 eholders holding in aggregate five per cent or more of the total allotted shares in Royal Mail plc 
may serve objections to the use of the disclosure exemptions on Royal Mail plc, in writing, to its registered office (100 Vic
London, EC4Y 0HQ) not later than 30 September 2015 and, if so received, Royal Mail plc may not use these disclosure exemptions. 
2. Directors’ emoluments 
The Directors of the Company are not paid any fees by the Company for their services as Directors of the Company. The Directors are paid 
fees by other companies of the Group. These emoluments are disclosed in the Group financial statements. 
3. Auditor’s remuneration 
The auditor of the Company is not paid fees by the Company. The auditor of the Company is paid fees by other companies of the Group.  
This remuneration is disclosed in the Group financial statements (note 13). 
4. Profit and loss account 
The Company is a non-trading company. The profit for the period of £207 million (2013-14 £4 million loss) is primarily in respect of  
£210 million of dividends received from Royal Mail Group Limited, offset by management charges to and from Royal Mail Group Limited  
and certain transaction-related costs.

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the parent Company financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the parent Company financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.

consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the parent Company financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
 e become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

prepared is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.

 Adequate accounting  
branches not visited by us; or

Shareholder fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors 
into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless 
or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an 
upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell 
shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) about 
share fraud each year, with victims losing an average of £20,000. If you 
are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud 
reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out more 
about investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
on 0800 111 6768. If you have already paid money to share fraudsters 
you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Disclaimers
This document contains certain forward-looking statements

looking statements included in this document. Accordingly, readers are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
By their nature, forward-looking statements relate to events and 
depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and are 
inherently unpredictable. Such forward-looking statements should,

rates; the impact of competitive products and pricing; the occurrence of 
major operational problems; the loss of major customers; undertakings 
and guarantees relating to pension funds; contingent liabilities; the 
impact of legal or other proceedings against, or which otherwise affect, 
the Group; and risks associated with the Group’s overseas operations.
All written or verbal forward-looking statements, made in this 
document or made subsequently, which are attributable to the Group 
or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their 
entirety by the factors referred to above. No assurance can be given 
that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised; 
actual events or results may differ materially as a result of risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. Subject to compliance with applicable

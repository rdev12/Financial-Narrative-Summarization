 2011 2    ISG plc Report and Financial Statements 2011
This annual report outlines our performance 
over the year. Since our formation in 1989, 
we have come a long way. What started as 
a business with revenue of £21m, has 
become an international company with  
2,500 people and revenue of over £1bn. 
 
This year our report illustrates just how far we 
have come on our journey – from our roots in 
London office fit out, to the construction of 
the London 2012 Velodrome. No matter how 
much we grow and diversify, our reputation 
for delivering consistently has, and will 
continue to, underpin our future success.

Chairman’s 
statement
Office -	K&L	Gates,	London,	UK ISG	plc	Annual	r eport	and	accounts	2011				3
Pr ofits	of	£11.5m	befor e	tax	fr om	
continuing	operations	but	befor e	
exceptional	items	and	amortisation	of	
intangible	assets	–	br oadly	in	line	with	
those	of	last	year	(2010:	£12.0m)	–	 
have	been	generated	fr om	a	significant	
incr ease	in	volume	of	work	performed.	 
Adjusted	ear nings	per	shar e*	stand	 
at	27.03p	(2010:	29.91p).
These	r esults	demonstrate	the	r esilience	
of	our	business	model	and	give	the	
Boar d	the	confidence	to	incr ease	the	
final	dividend	in	line	with	our	pr ogr essive	
dividend	policy .	Accor dingly ,	the	Boar d	
is	r ecommending	a	final	dividend	of	
10.65p 	 per 	 shar e, 	 a 	 5% 	 incr ease, 	 making	
dividends	for	the	year	total	15.06p	per	
shar e	(2010:	14.34p).	I	can	also	r eport	
a	further	impr oved	net	cash	balance	of	
£36.1m	at	30	June	2011	(2010:	£31.0m).
W e	have	enjoyed	some	outstanding	
successes	during	the	year .	In	the	UK,	
a	particularly	noteworthy	achievement	
has	been	the	completion	of	the	London	
2012	V elodr ome.	It	hit	the	headlines	
as	the	first	building	completed	on	the	
Olympic	Park	–	ahead	of	time	and	to	
cost.	Since	the	year	end	we	have	been	
awar ded	the	contract	to	manage	the	
extensive	temporary	infrastructur e	
works	for	the	Olympics.	It	is	this	type	
of	consistent	delivery	that	has	helped	
us	to	continue	to	build	up	the	excellent	
r elationships	we	have	established	with	
our	commer cial	and	r etail	customers	
acr oss	the	banking,	food	and	high	str eet	
r etail	sectors.
While	the	year	saw	us	successfully	
challenge 	 the 	 Office 	of 	 Fair 	 T rading, 	 enabling	 
us	to	write	back	last	year’ s	associated	
exceptional 	 item 	 of 	 £1.7m, 	 we 	 also 	 faced	
a 	 number 	 of 	 challenges. 	 In 	 particular , 	 our	
Construction 	 business 	 covering 	 the 	 South	
W est 	 suf fer ed 	 fr om 	 the 	 marked 	 downtur n	
in	activity	in	that	r egion,	incurring	both	
trading	losses	and	the	costs	of	having	 
to	r estructur e	the	business.
Outside 	 the 	 UK, 	 we 	 saw 	 a 	 rise 	 in 	 volumes,	
boosted	by	first	time	contributions	fr om	
our 	 Middle 	 East 	 and 	 Moscow 	 businesses.	
However ,	overseas	pr ofits	ar e	lower	
due	to	pr essur e	on	mar gins	and	losses	
arising	fr om	a	particularly	complex	
pr oject	in	Geneva	for	one	of	our	major	
blue	chip	clients.
In	addition	to	or ganic	gr owth,	we	
have	continued	to	look	for	acquisition	
opportunities	to	extend	our	range	
of	activities	and	geographic	r each.	
In	December	we	established	a	new	
office	in	Scotland,	built	ar ound	the	
former	Rok	plc	construction	team.	
In	April,	we	acquir ed	85%	of	Realys	
Gr oup	Limited	(Realys).	It	specialises	
in	design-led	pr oject	management,	
servicing	multinational	companies	fr om	
a	base	in	Shanghai.	Realys	brings	with	
it	an	impr essive	and	mainly	W ester n	
Eur opean	client	list	–	many	of	whom	
ar e	new	to	us.	W e	ar e	curr ently	in	
discussion	with	a	number	of	other	
potential	acquisitions.
Ther e	ar e	two	changes	to	our	Boar d	
of	dir ectors.	At	the	end	of	May	we	
announced	the	appointment	of	Richar d	
Whittington	as	a	Non-Executive	Dir ector .	
Richar d,	a	charter ed	accountant,	has	
r ecently	r etir ed	as	a	Senior	Partner	at	
KPMG	wher e	one	of	his	r esponsibilities	
was	Global	Head	of	the	Building	and	
Construction	practice.	His	experience	
of	our	sector	and	of	business	in	general	
will	be	of	significant	value.	John	Jer emy ,	
our Senior Independent Director 
and	Chairman	of	the	Remuneration	
Committee,	has	decided	to	r etir e	fr om	
the	Boar d	at	the	conclusion	of	the	AGM	
after	16-years’	service.	He	assisted	the	
founders	at	the	time	of	the	management	
buy-out	and	became	a	Non-Executive	
Dir ector	on	flotation	in	1998.	On	behalf	
of	all	shar eholders	I	would	like	to	thank	
him	for	his	wise	stewar dship	and	
counsel	during	a	period	of	transition	
fr om	a	£100m	r evenue	company	at	
flotation	to	one	of	nearly	£1.2	billion.	
Above	all,	his	good	sense	and	practical	
appr oach	will	be	much	missed.

It	is	particularly	appr opriate	to	pay

Overview
Key	featur es	of	our	business	during	the	
year	included:
		W e	have	won	work	during	the	year	
totalling 	 £1,204m 	 (2010: 	 £892m) 	 enabling	
us	to	finish	the	year	with	our	best	ever	
total	r evenue	–	up	by	23%,	in	a	highly	
competitive 	 and 	 challenging 	 envir onment.
		As	we	anticipated,	we	have	seen	
r ecovery	in	some	of	our	private	sector	
markets.	W e	continue	to	deliver	pr ojects	
for	an	enviable	blue	chip	client	base.
		Our	UK	Fit	Out	division	gr ew	r evenues	
by	32%	to	£342m	(2010:	£260m),	and	
continues	to	win	market	shar e.
		The	London	office	fit	out	market	
impr oved,	albeit	with	fewer	lar ge-scale	
pr ojects.	W e	expect	the	tr end	for	smaller	
pr ojects	to	continue	in	the	curr ent	year	
with	the	demand	for	lar ge-scale	works	
likely	to	r etur n	in	2013.	
		Our	r etail	businesses	have	performed	
str ongly	with	r evenue	fr om	the	sector	
incr easing	to	£345m	(2010:	£258m).	
Ther e	is	incr eased	demand	fr om	our	
r etail 	 banking 	 clients 	 and 	 our 	 Food 	 Retail	
division	has	seen	its	r evenues	nearly	
double	compar ed	to	the	pr evious	year .
		Inter nationally ,	we	have	seen	volumes	
incr ease	as	inter national	customers	
r ecommence	their	capital	pr ogrammes.	
However ,	the	overseas	r esults	wer e	
impacted	by	our	Continental	Eur ope	Fit	
Out	division	which	would	have	made	
a	pr ofitable	contribution	but	for	a	lar ge	
loss	on	a	challenging	pr oject	for	a	 
key	customer .	
		In	the	Middle	East	ther e	was	a	very	
str ong	performance	with	a	good	second	
half 	 to 	 the 	 year 	 as 	 international 	 companies	
r etur ned	to	Dubai	and	Abu	Dhabi.
		In	Asia,	our	performance	fell	short	of	
the 	 prior 	 year , 	 as 	 r evenues 	 only 	 started 	 to	
impr ove	late	in	the	final	quarter .	In	April	
2011,	we	completed	the	acquisition	 
of	Realys	Gr oup	Limited	(Realys),	a	
design-led 	 pr oject 	 management 	 business	
b a s e d 	 in	Shanghai.	
		Against	the	market	tr end,	our	
Construction	division	has	had	a	str ong	
year .	It	has	continued	to	r educe	its	
exposur e	to	the	public	sector	and	its	
performance	on	high-pr ofile	pr ojects	
such	as	the	London	2012	V elodr ome	
has	str engthened	its	r eputation	for	
excellent	delivery .	The	exception	was	
our	South	W est	business	which	was	
slow	to	r espond	to	market	conditions.
		Our	commitment	as	a	company	is	to	
pr ovide	consistency	of	delivery	to	all	
our	customers	r egar dless	of	geography ,	
service 	 line 	 or 	 business 	 sector . 	 T o 	 support	
and	drive	this,	we	have	simplified	our	
brand	identity .
		As	a	people	business	we	continue	
to	focus	on	the	development	of	our	
employees.	During	the	year	we	wer e	
awar ded	“Investors	in	People”	status	
acr oss	our	UK	operations.	Our	ongoing	
strategy 	 of 	 str engthening 	 our 	 management	
inter nationally	will	continue.

La Défense is the latest in a 
number of projects I have had 
the pleasure of working on 
for Foot Locker. Working for 
an internationally recognised 
brand demands consistency 
across every project. It gives 
me great satisfaction to say 
that we have achieved this 
once again on this store.

UK Fit Out
The	r ecovery	of	the	UK	fit	out	market	
continued,	with	r evenues	up	by	32%	
to	£342m	(2010:	£260m).	This	str ong	
performance	has	led	to	an	incr ease	 
in	operating	pr ofit	of	27%	to	£8.0m	
(2010: 	 £6.3m), 	 r esulting 	 in 	 mar gins 	 slightly	
down	at	2.3%	(2010:	2.4%).
In	the	year	we	successfully	completed	
the	320,000	sq	ft	fit	out	of	Man	Gr oup’ s	
Riverside	House.	The	£38m	pr oject	was	
one	of	the	industry’ s	lar gest	London	fit	
out	commissions	in	the	period.	W e	also	
completed 	 the 	 successful 	 delivery 	 of 	 GE’ s	
70,000 	 sq 	 ft 	 UK 	 headquarters 	 – 	 the 	 fastest	
delivery	of	its	type	in	GE’ s	inter national

in	the	2011	BCO	A war ds	Best	Fit	Out	of	
W orkplace 	 – 	 London 	 & 	 South 	 East 	 Region.	
Other	significant	pr ojects	include	the	
160,000	sq	ft	r efit	of	the	London	offices	
for	one	of	the	world’ s	lar gest	investment

In	the	short-term,	the	pipeline	has	
diminished	for	major	fit	out	pr ojects	in	
the 	 corporate 	 office 	 sector 	 and 	 our 	 focus 	
continues 	 on 	 medium-sized 	 assignments.	
Ther e	is	also	an	incr eased	demand	for 
infrastructure upgrades to improve 
efficiency 	 and 	 also 	 meet 	 the 	 r equir ements 	
of	the	UK	Gover nment’ s	CRC	Ener gy	
Efficiency	Scheme.	T o	capitalise	on	our	
position	as	a	leader	in	this	niche	market,	
we	have	incr eased	our	specialised	
Engineering	service	of fering	in	the	 
period	and	we	have	alr eady	completed	 
a	substantial	mission	critical	pr oject	for	
The	Royal	Bank	of	Scotland	(RBS).	
W e	expect	major	fit	out	opportunities	in	
the	corporate	office	sector	to	incr ease	
in	the	second	half	of	2012	as	the	curr ent	
wave	of	developments	in	central	London

Our	success	in	the	market	for	the	r etail	
banking	fit	out	sector	continued	with	a	
very	str ong	performance	–	in	particular ,	
our	work	under	framework	agr eements.	
W e	ar e	on	the	frameworks	of	Bar clays

RBS 	 and 	 HSBC 	 and 	 the 	 year 	 has 	 seen 	 us

pr ojects	include	the	delivery	of	Lloyds’	
and	RBS’ s	flagship	outlets	in	London’ s	
W estfield	Stratfor d	shopping	centr e.	
On	the	high	str eet,	our	fit	out	of	the	
world’ s	lar gest	shoe	department	in	
London’ s	Selfridges	hit	the	headlines.	
The	vast	space	–	which	is	bigger	than	
T ate	Moder n’ s	T urbine	Hall	–	showcases	
over	5,000	pairs	of	shoes	fr om	120	
brands.	W e	ar e	also	delivering	our	first

the	business	has	been	awar ded	a	new	
framework	appointment	with	the	UK’ s

At 	 the 	 year 	 end 	 our 	 UK 	 Fit 	 Out 	 business	 
had 	 an 	 or der 	 book 	 of 	 £170m 	 (2010: 	 £172m),

Middle East Fit Out
After	dissolving	our	joint	ventur e	
arrangement 	 in 	 the 	 Middle 	 East 	 as 	 of 	 1 	 July	
2010	we	have	operated	a	business	that	
focuses 	 exclusively 	 on 	 fit 	 out. 	 The 	 division 	
is	now	operating	very	successfully	–	in	
line 	 with 	 the 	 r eturning 	 confidence 	 we 	 have 	
seen 	 in 	 the 	 Dubai 	 and 	 Abu 	 Dhabi 	 markets.	
In 	 the 	 period 	 it 	 generated 	 r evenue 	 of 	 £20m	
and 	 made 	 a 	 positive 	 contribution 	 of 	 £0.7m 
(2010: 	 loss 	 of 	 £0.3m). 	 Pr ojects 	 in 	 the 	 period	
included 	 work 	 for 	 Siemens, 	 Philips, 	 Pfizer 	
and	ExxonMobil,	and	most	significantly	
we	have	won	five	of	the	initial	fit	out	
pr ojects 	 in 	 Sowwah 	 Squar e, 	 wher e 	 a 	 new

Our 	 Construction 	 division 	 has 	 had 	 a 	 highly	
successful	year .	Despite	the	difficult 
economic	envir onment,	r evenues	have 
r emained 	 stable 	 at 	 £476m 	 (2010: 	 £474m).	
Operating	pr ofit	decr eased	to	£2.7m

South	W est	business	being	slow	to

As	r eported	in	last	year’ s	financial	
statements,	Pear ce	Construction	
(Midlands)	 Limited,	 a	 dormant	 subsidiary	
of	ISG	Pear ce	Limited,	was	investigated	
by	the	OFT	for	technical	br eaches	of	
competition	law	in	earlier	years	prior	to 
ISG’ s 	 ownership. 	 On 	 20 	 November 	 2009	
the	OFT	fined	Pear ce	Construction	
(Midlands) 	 Limited 	 £5.2m 	 of 	 which 	 £4.4m 
was	on	a	joint	and	several	basis	with	
the	company’ s	former	owner ,	Cr est	
Nicholson	plc.	Appeals	wer e	submitted	
to	the	Competition	Appeal	T ribunal	on	
24 	 November 	 2009 	 and 	 hear d 	 in 	 July 	 2010. 
On 	 15 	 April 	 2011, 	 the 	 tribunal 	 announced	
that	 the	 fine	 had	 been	 r educed	 to	 £950k, 
of	which	80%	would	be	settled	on	a 
joint 	 and 	 several 	 basis 	 with 	 the 	 company’ s	
former 	 owner , 	 Cr est 	 Nicholson 	 plc. 	 The 	 fine 	
has 	 been 	 settled 	 in 	 full. 	 Due 	 to 	 the 	 fact 	 that 
the 	 fine, 	 accrued 	 inter est 	 and 	 associated 	
legal	costs	ar e	below	the	£2.0m	cash	
backed	indemnity	fr om	the	vendors	of 
ISG 	 Pear ce 	 Holdings 	 Limited, 	 the 	 pr ovision	
cr eated	as	an	exceptional	item	in	the	
prior	year	has	been	r eversed	r esulting	 
in	an	exceptional	gain	of	£1.7m.
During	the	year ,	the	Gr oup	has	r ecor ded	
a	r estructuring	pr ovision	of	£2.0m	as	an	
exceptional	item.	This	principally	r elates	
to	 our	 South	 W est	 construction	 business	
which 	 has 	 been 	 slow 	 to 	 r espond 	 to 	 mor e 
difficult	market	conditions,	and	has	
r esulted 	 in 	 the 	 business 	 being 	 r e-or ganised	
and	fully	integrated	with	the	r est	of	our	
Construction	operations	in	the	UK.	
With 	 ef fect 	 fr om 	 1 	 July 	 2010, 	 the 	 Al 	 Habtoor	
ISG	Inter national	LLC	joint	ventur e	
agr eement	in	the	Middle	East	was	
terminated	with	the	Gr oup	r etaining	the	
fit	out	business.	The	Gr oup	has	incurr ed	
costs	of	£0.6m	during	the	course	of	the 
joint 	 ventur e 	 separation 	 which 	 have 	 been 
tr eated 	 as 	 a 	 loss 	 on 	 disposal 	 of 	 joint 	 ventur e.
Further	details	ar e	pr ovided	in	Note	7	 
to	the	financial	statements	on	page	77.
Profit before Tax
Adjusted 	 pr ofit 	 befor e 	 tax** 	 of 	 £11.5m 	 was 	
5% 	 behind 	 last 	 year’ s 	 £12.0m 	 and 	 is 	 stated	
befor e	non-contr olling	inter ests	of	£12k	
(2010:	£nil).	The	non-contr olling	inter est	
r elates 	 to 	 the 	 15% 	 of 	 Realys 	 (85% 	 acquir ed	
by 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 in 	 April 	 2011) 	 that 	 has 	 been	
r etained 	 by 	 the 	 vendors 	 of 	 that 	 company .	
Finance	income	incr eased	to	£0.2m	
(2010: 	 £0.1m) 	 as 	 a 	 r esult 	 of 	 higher 	 average	
cash 	 balances 	 thr oughout 	 the 	 year , 	 being	
£44.2m	(2010:	£35.4m).	Finance	costs	
decr eased	to	£0.5m	(2010:	£0.6m).
Pr ofit 	befor e 	 tax * * * 	 was 	 £9.0m 	 (2010: 	 £8.7m)	
with	no	losses	on	discontinued	activity	
(2010:	£0.8m),	an	exceptional	loss	of	
£0.8m	(2010:	£1.9m),	and	amortisation	
of	intangibles	of	£1.6m	(2010:	£1.4m).
Taxation
The	Gr oup’ s	ef fective	adjusted	tax	rate**	
was	25.3%	(2010:	22.9%).
The	rate	was	lower	than	the	weighted	
average	standar d	rate	for	the	curr ent	
year	of	27.5%	(2010:	28.0%)	due	to	the	
utilisation	of	tax	losses	br ought	forwar d	
and	the	establishment	of	deferr ed	tax	
assets	on	£2.0m	of	the	r emaining	tax	
losses,	being	those	that	ar e	expected	
to	be	utilised	in	the	next	twelve	months,	
of fset	by	expenses	disallowable	for	tax	
purposes	and	curr ent	year	overseas

Earnings per Share and Dividends
The	adjusted	basic	ear nings	per	shar e*	
shows	a	decr ease	of	10%	to	27.03p	
per	shar e	(2010:	29.91p).	The	r eduction	
is	also	impacted	by	the	incr ease	in	the	
ef fective	tax	rate	and	the	incr eased	
average	number	of	shar es	in	issue	due	
to	the	full	year	ef fect	of	the	deferr ed	
consideration	paid	in	2010	in	r espect	of	
the	acquisition	of	ISG	Pear ce	Holdings	
Limited 	 and 	 the 	 shar es 	 issued 	 in 	 April 	 2011	
in	r espect	of	the	acquisition	of	Realys.	
Basic	ear nings	per	shar e	for	the	period	
was	22.17p	(2010:	18.80p).
The	Gr oup	aims	over	time	to	
pr ogr essively 	 gr ow 	 the 	 dividend, 	 taking	
into	account	the	investment	needs	 
of	the	business.	The	final	dividend	 
is	pr oposed	at	10.65p	(2010:	10.14p)	
giving 	 a 	 total 	 dividend 	 for 	 the	 
year 	 of 	 15.06p 	 up 	 5% 	 on 	 last 	 year	 
(2010: 	 14.34p). 	 At 	 this 	 level 	 the 	 dividend	
is	cover ed	1.8	times	(2010:	2.1	times)	
based 	 upon 	 the 	 adjusted 	 basic 	 ear nings	
per	shar e*.	This	is	slightly	lower	than	 
last	year	but	the	Boar d	feels	that	this	 
is	r easonable	given	the	str ength	of	 
the	Gr oup’ s	cash	balances	and	 
futur e	pr ospects.
Shareholders’ Funds 
During	the	year ,	shar eholders’	funds

(2010:	£2.5m).	
The	for eign	curr ency	movement	for	
the	year	was	£2.2m	(2010:	£0.4m)	and	
r epr esented	the	translation	gain	on	the	
r evaluation	of	the	assets	and	liabilities	of

The 	 number 	 of 	 shar es 	 in 	 issue 	 at 	 30 	 June	
2011 	 was 	 33,405,281 	 (2010: 	 33,158,467).	
The	incr ease	of	246,814	shar es	 
(2010: 	 2,107,908) 	 is 	 lar gely 	 due 	 to 	 the	
issue 	 of 	 237,586 	 shar es 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 the

Shar eholders’	funds	ar e	stated	after	
deducting	the	Gr oup’ s	investment	in	its	
own	shar es	of	£3.7m	(2010:	£3.8m).

2011	is	31,701,680	(2010:	31,028,881).
The	company’ s	shar e	price	was	 
201.0	pence	at	the	close	of	business	 
on	30	June	2011,	an	incr ease	of	22%

set	out	in	the	Chief	Executive	Officer’ s	Statement	on	pages	8	to	28,	the	Financial	Review	on	pages	32	to	36,	the	Dir ectors’	
Report	on	pages	44	to	50	and	the	Corporate	Gover nance	r eport	on	pages	56	to	59,	and	the	key	performance	indicators	ar e	
set	out	in	our	gr oup	financial	highlights	on	page	1,	which	ar e	incorporated	by	r efer ence	to	this	r eport	and	should	be	deemed	to	
form	part	of	it.
 
The	Dir ectors’	Report	is	pr epar ed	for	the	members	of	the	Gr oup	and	should	not	be	r elied	upon	by	any	other	party	for	any	other	
purpose.	The	Dir ectors’	Report	(including	the	Chairman’ s	Statement,	Chief	Executive	Officer’ s	Statement,	the	Financial	Review	
and	the	Corporate	Gover nance	r eport)	contains	certain	forwar d-looking	information	and	statements	in	r elation	to	the	Gr oup’ s	
operations,	economic	performance	and	financial	conditions.	These	statements	ar e	made	by	the	dir ectors	in	good	faith	based	
on	the	information	available	to	them	at	the	time	of	their	appr oval	of	this	r eport	and,	although	they	believe	that	the	expectations	
r eflected	in	such	forwar d-looking	statements	ar e	r easonable,	they	should	be	tr eated	with	caution	due	to	the	inher ent	
uncertainties,	including	both	economic	and	business	risk	factors,	underlying	such	forwar d-looking	statements	or	information.
Basis for preparation of financial statements on a going concern basis
Information	on	the	business	envir onment	in	which	the	Gr oup	operates,	including	the	factors	that	ar e	likely	to	impact	the	futur e	
pr ospects	of	the	Gr oup,	ar e	included	in	the	Chief	Executive	Officer’ s	Statement	on	pages	8	to	28.	The	principal	risks	and	
uncertainties	that	the	Gr oup	faces	ar e	set	out	below	on	pages	45	to	47.	The	financial	position	of	the	Gr oup,	its	cash	flows,	
liquidity	position	and	debt	facilities	ar e	described	in	the	Financial	Review	on	pages	32	and	36.	In	addition,	Notes	3	and	26	to	
the	consolidated	financial	statements	set	out	the	Gr oup’ s	objectives,	policies	and	pr ocesses	for	managing	its	capital,	financial	
risks,	financial	instruments	and	hedging	activities,	and	its	exposur e	to	cr edit	risk	and	liquidity	risk.
 
The	dir ectors	have	pr epar ed	cash	flow	for ecasts	for	the	Gr oup	for	a	period	in	excess	of	twelve	months	fr om	the	date	of	
appr oval	of	these	consolidated	financial	statements.	These	for ecasts	ar e	based	on	the	Gr oup’ s	existing	or der	book	and	r eflect	
an	assessment	of	curr ent	and	futur e	market	conditions	and	risks	and	uncertainties	in	the	business,	their	impact	on	the	Gr oup’ s	
trading	performance	and	the	actions	taken	by	management	in	r esponse	to	curr ent	market	conditions.	The	for ecasts	completed	
on	this	basis	demonstrate	that	the	Gr oup	will	be	able	to	operate	within	the	curr ent	committed	debt	facilities	and	show	
continued	compliance	with	the	financial	covenants.	In	addition,	management	has	consider ed	various	mitigating	actions	that	
could	be	taken	in	the	event	that	futur e	market	conditions	deteriorate	beyond	their	curr ent	assessment.	Such	measur es	include	
further	impr ovements	in	working	capital	within	management’ s	contr ol,	further	r eductions	in	costs	and	capital	expenditur e	and	
use	of	the	Gr oup’ s	undrawn	cr edit	facilities.
 
On	the	basis	of	the	exer cise	described	above,	the	dir ectors	have	a	r easonable	expectation	that	the	Gr oup	and	company	have	
adequate	r esour ces	to	continue	operational	existence	for	the	for eseeable	futur e.	Accor dingly ,	they	continue	to	adopt	the	going	
concer n	basis	in	pr eparing	the	financial	statements	of	the	Gr oup	and	the	company .

Acquisition of the company’s own shares
At the Annual General Meeting held on 3 December 2010, the shareholders authorised the company to make one or more 
market purchases of ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the company during the year. The company did not exercise 
this right during the year. The Interior Services Group Employee Share Trust (the “Trust”) is a trust established to hold shares 
to satisfy entitlements of employees to receive shares in the company pursuant to the company’s share schemes. During the 
year the Trust transferred 56,812 shares of 1p each in the capital of the company to employees pursuant to the company’s 
share schemes. At the year end the Trust held a total of 1,512,317 (2010: 1,569,129) ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital 
of the company, representing 4.53% (2010: 4.73%) of the company’s called-up ordinary share capital. The Trust has, at the 
recommendation of the Board, waived its right to receive dividends.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The ability to identify and effectively manage the risks that impact the business is fundamental to the continued success of the 
Group. Accordingly, the key risks and uncertainties facing the Group are considered as part of the Group’s well established 
processes and systems for identifying, evaluating, and managing risk. The impact of significant risks and their mitigation is 
monitored at both Group and divisional Board meetings throughout the year and are subject to annual review by the Board. 
The risks considered to be the most significant by the Board are set out in the table on the next page. Directors’ report

Procurement Committee Payments to creditors
The Group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction. It is the Group’s general policy to  
pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms.  
Trade creditors include retention amounts held over defect liability periods. The creditor days for the Group at 30 June 2011 
are 52 days (2010: 48 days).
 
Donations
During the year the company made no political donations (2010: £nil). During the year the Group made charitable donations 
totalling £27,349 (2010: £23,369) including £3,900 to the Anderson Foundation, £3,280 to Variety Club Children’s Charity, 
£2,500 to the Dawlish Town AFC Registered Charity and £2,500 to the South West MS Centre.
 
Employment policies
We support the principle of equal opportunities in employment and oppose all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the 
grounds of colour, race, religion or belief, age, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status or disability. 
The Group’s policy provides equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of an individual’s suitability 
for the work. As an equal opportunities employer our benefits and training are accessible to every staff member and, as 
mentioned above, we encourage and support personal and professional development. 
 
At ISG we pride ourselves not only on the projects that we deliver but also the training opportunities we provide to our staff.  
In June 2011 the UK business, following a re-accreditation review, successfully met the Investors in People Standard.  
The assessor commented in the accompanying report that ‘seminars by subject matter experts, extensive opportunities for 
development, promotions, devolved responsibility and sharing of ideas and best practice all highlight an organisation that has 
a continuous learning culture’. In November 2010 the UK business received a 10 Year Award from Investors in People. 
 
A common Performance Development Review process is in place across the business to share best practice. The Group’s 
values and associated behaviours are a fundamental part of this process. These Performance Development Reviews ensure 
that employees continue to receive structured feedback and have the opportunity to agree personal development plans with 
their managers.
 
The Group has well-established mechanisms to communicate with employees at every level and to encourage their 
involvement regarding the Group’s performance and future activities. During the year the Group relaunched its intranet under 
the name Horizon. Horizon can be viewed by all employees worldwide and enables the Group to better communicate its 
strategy and distribute up-to-date news. During the next year a global file sharing mechanism will be added to Horizon, giving 
employees access to case studies and winning-work resources. 
All employees who have completed six months service with a Group company are invited to join the company’s Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme on an annual basis and thereby share in the success of the Group. The Group also operates  
an All-Employee Share Ownership Plan.
The Group HR Director has improved our knowledge and best practice sharing across the Group, simplifying and standardising 
processes where appropriate.
Health & safety 
The Board continues to consider health & safety a key priority and has maintained this focus throughout the year. It is essential 
that we take all reasonable measures to conduct our business to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all our employees and 
all other persons who may be affected by our activities. 
 
This includes members of the public, clients, designers and subcontractors that we work with. In the UK we support this with 
our certification to OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational Health & Safety Management System and our dedicated teams of health 
& safety professionals achieving industry leading safety performance. 
 
This is demonstrated by ISG’s Accident Incident Rate (calculated on the number of reportable accidents per 1,000 employees) 
of 2.60 (2010: 3.17) (industry average 7.33 for the period April 2010 to March 2011). These figures now also include our safety 
performance in ISG Olson and Europe. We endeavour to ensure that the same high standards of health & safety are applied by 
our overseas operations.
 
One of the best ways to raise standards is to recognise and reward those that lead the field and to encourage others to follow. 
That is why every year The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety Council (BSC), two 
of the world’s leading health & safety organisations, invite companies of all sizes from the full spectrum of work activities and 
from all over the world to enter the RoSPA and BSC safety awards. During May 2011 the Group received seven RoSPA Gold 
Directors’ report 
(continued)  ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011    49
Medals, 25 Gold Awards and two Bronze Awards (2010: nine RoSPA Gold Medals, 21 Gold Awards and two Silver Awards) and 
19 BSC International safety awards (2010: 20 BSC International safety awards).
 
We have maintained a strong commitment to health & safety training with over 63 UK directors and senior managers 
completing the IOSH (Institute of Occupational Safety and Health) Safety for senior Executives course during 2011. During the 
year over 180 UK employees and key suppliers completed our 5 day Site Managers Safety Training Scheme.
 
Sustainability
As a company working in the construction industry our impact on sustainability is far reaching. We have the ability to physically 
change landscapes using a multitude of materials, we use natural resources during the construction process, produce waste, 
work in a variety of communities and employ a large workforce. As a publicly listed company we are responsible to our 
shareholders for our financial performance. In summary our work affects people, the planet and the prosperity of many on a 
daily basis and this is what formed the basis of our sustainability policy.
We are committed to continual improvement. People, planet and prosperity continue to be the cornerstones of our policy today 
and for the future.
•	 People (social issues)
 Our main objectives are to develop the skills of our staff; to be socially responsible treating all of our stakeholders fairly 
and with respect; create a safe and healthy built environment and to manage our supply chain responsibly.
 In the last year we maintained our commitment to health and safety issues and have won further recognition including a wide 
range of RoSPA and British Safety Council awards for projects around the world demonstrating our global consistency.
 Our UK training and development received group Investors in People (IiP) certification in 2011 and as our training 
academies continue to improve the skills of our and our suppliers’ staff. Supply chain sustainability development is 
encouraged with the continuation of our annual ISG sustainability award.
•	 Planet (environmental issues)
 We aim to enhance and protect the natural environment and minimise the consumption of natural resources and reduce 
our carbon footprint. We also aim to minimise waste and maximise the opportunities for recycling.
 To demonstrate this commitment, all of our UK-based operations and our Hong Kong office have management systems 
which are certified to the requirements of ISO14001:2000 Environmental Management Systems. Sustainability Strategies 
have now been agreed with all ISG companies to ensure continual development.
 We are on target to meet our UK Halving Waste to Landfill initiative promoted by the government funded WRAP (Waste & 
Resources Action Programme). Our recycling rates continue to improve across the business with our exemplar projects 
achieving zero waste to landfill and a UK average recycling rate of 88% (2010: 85%).
•	 Prosperity (economic issues)
 Our main objective is to be a good corporate citizen and engage with the local communities in which we work. We also 
aim to improve the capability of ISG and to communicate with our shareholders.
 Lloyds Banking Group appreciated ISG’s environmental achievements and awarded us a Sustainability Partnership where 
we advise on construction best practice and future development.
 Our capability was recognised with a range of international awards from the Best Office Award in Moscow, the BSC 
International Award for Safety and short listed for the Building Magazine Major Contractor of the year award. The influence 
of the Group expands with the further acquisition in Shanghai and our Dubai office relocated to the prestigious Sama 
Tower and new offices opened in Glasgow, Cardiff, Liverpool and Newcastle in the UK. Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
(1) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and 
(2) the director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
 
Auditors

Report of the board to the 
shareholders on directors’ 
remuneration
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Accounting Regulations under Companies Act 2006,  
and has been approved by the Board and adopted for submission to the shareholders. This report is unaudited, except where 
specified. A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company to be held on  
16 November 2011.
 
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were J L Jeremy (Chairman), M J Barnes and J R Stevenson. 
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within existing terms of reference, on remuneration 
policy and determines, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors. During the 
year the Remuneration Committee sought and received advice from the remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, 
specifically in relation to the Performance Share Plan 2010 (the “Performance Share Plan”) which was approved by the 
members at the last annual general meeting. The remuneration adviser has no other connection to the company.
 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is to provide executive remuneration arrangements which are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the high calibre required, to promote the long-term success of the company and to reward the executive directors 
for enhancing value to shareholders without encouraging inappropriate risk taking. The performance measurement of the 
executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration arrangements are undertaken by the Remuneration 
Committee consisting solely of non-executive directors. In determining the annual remuneration arrangements of the executive 
directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the remuneration policies applied elsewhere in the Group.  
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the full Board.
 
In framing remuneration policy the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
 
Components of remuneration
The Remuneration Committee recognises the importance of ensuring an appropriate mix of performance related and  
non-performance related elements of remuneration and this is reflected in the remuneration arrangements established for the 
executive directors. The Remuneration Committee reviews the remuneration of the executive directors and the senior management 
to ensure a consistent approach is being applied to remuneration arrangements. The components of remuneration are:
 
a) basic salary and benefits;
b) performance related discretionary bonuses; and
c) performance related share and share option incentives.
The company operates an optional salary waiver arrangement which can result in pension contributions being made.
Basic salary
An executive director’s basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year and 
when an individual changes position or responsibility. G V Aldridge and S D Lawther did not take a salary increase during the year.
 
Bonus payments
In the year ended 30 June 2011, the directors received bonuses which reflected performance relating to the financial year 
ended 30 June 2010. 
 
For J C B Houlton and S D Lawther the performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2010 included Group profit 
based targets, completion of strategic objectives and non-financial elements covering health & safety, financial accounting 
standards, human resource management and environmental responsibility. As stated in last year’s annual report, not all of the 
targets were achieved and therefore J C B Houlton and S D Lawther did not receive the maximum bonuses of 75% of basic 
salary. However, it was the view of the Remuneration Committee that J C B Houlton and S D Lawther had performed well 
against the targets despite the difficult economic circumstances and they therefore each received a bonus equal to 60% of 
basic salary. Similar performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 30 June 2011, the maximum bonus payable being 
up to 75% of basic salary. Again, not all of the targets were achieved and therefore an accrual of 60% of basic salary has been 
included in the accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2011. 
For G V Aldridge the performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2010 included Group profit based targets 
and completion of strategic objectives. The maximum bonus payable was 50% of basic salary. As not all of the targets were 
achieved he received a bonus equal to 20% of basic salary. Similar performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 
30 June 2011, the maximum bonus payable being up to 50% of basic salary. Again, not all of the targets were achieved and 
therefore an accrual of 25% of basic salary has been included in the accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2011. Share options
The Remuneration Committee approves the grant of options to executive directors under the Group’s discretionary share 
schemes. In respect of share options, the following audited information also applies:
a) details of directors’ share options are detailed below, and 
b) all options granted to directors under the Approved Plan (since 2008) and under the Unapproved Plan are subject to 
performance criteria relating to growth in adjusted earnings per share which is calculated from the earnings attributable 
to ordinary shareholders after adjusting for amortisation of goodwill and the profit or loss on disposal of associates and 
subsidiaries. Since October 2010 the Remuneration Committee has also applied a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) element 
to the performance criteria.
The performance criteria for share options unexercised as at 30 June 2011 are as follows:
Date of grant Performance period Target
10 May 2004 1 July 2004 to  
30 June 2007
The percentage increase in adjusted EPS over the performance period 
must be greater than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum over 
the same period.
29 September 2005 1 July 2005 to  
30 June 2008
The percentage increase in adjusted EPS over the performance period 
must be greater than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum over 
the same period.
18 September 2006 1 July 2006 to  
30 June 2009
The percentage increase in adjusted EPS over the performance period 
must be greater than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum over 
the same period.
14 October 2008 1 July 2008 to  
30 June 2011
The percentage increase in adjusted EPS over the performance period 
must be greater than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum over 
the same period.
14 April 2009 1 July 2009 to  
30 June 2012
Aggregate adjusted EPS for the performance period must be in the range 
of 72p to 80p. The proportion of the option which is exercisable will 
increase from 0% to 100% on a straight line basis between these amounts.
16 October 2009 1 July 2009 to  
30 June 2012
Aggregate adjusted EPS for the performance period must be in the range 
of 72p to 80p. The proportion of the option which is exercisable will 
increase from 0% to 100% on a straight line basis between these amounts.
8 October 2010 1 July 2010 to  
30 June 2013
75% of the option is subject an EPS performance condition as follows: 
adjusted EPS growth per annum for the performance period must be 
in the range of 3% and 10%. The proportion of the option which is 
exercisable will increase from 24.75% to 75% on a straight line basis 
between these amounts.
25% of the option is subject to a TSR performance condition as follows: 
rank of the company’s TSR within a specified comparator group must 
be between median and the upper quartile. The proportion of the option 
which is exercisable will increase from 8.25% to 25% on a straight line 
basis between these amounts.
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
 
Share awards
At the last Annual General Meeting the members approved the adoption of a long-term incentive plan, the Performance Share 
Plan. Following that meeting the Remuneration Committee approved the grant of share awards to the executive directors 
under the Performance Share Plan. In respect of the share awards, the following audited information also applies:
a) details of directors’ share awards are detailed below, and 
b) all share awards made to directors under the Performance Share Plan are subject to performance criteria relating to 
growth in adjusted earnings per share which is calculated from the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders after 
adjusting for amortisation of goodwill and the profit or loss on disposal of associates and subsidiaries, and to the ranking 
of the company’s TSR within a specified comparator group.

The performance criteria for share awards not vested as at 30 June 2011 are as follows:
 
Date of award Performance period Target
10 December 2010 1 July 2010 to
30 June 2013
75% of the option is subject to an EPS performance condition as follows: adjusted 
EPS growth per annum for the performance period must be in the range of 3% 
and 10%. The proportion of the option which is exercisable will increase from 
24.75% to 75% on a straight line basis between these amounts.
25% of the option is subject to a TSR performance condition as follows: rank of 
the company’s TSR within a specified comparator group must be between median 
and the upper quartile. The proportion of the option which is exercisable will 
increase from 8.25% to 25% on a straight line basis between these amounts.
Performance criteria applied to share options and share awards
In the Remuneration Committee’s opinion any share-based incentives should be linked to the interests of the shareholders.  
The principal measure of those interests is shareholder return, to which earnings per share is the main contributor which can be 
determined by management performance. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee views a mixture of earnings per share and 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR), weighted towards the former, as the optimum balance for share option and award vesting criteria.

Performance graph 
The following graph shows the company’s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance 
of the AIM share index also measured by total shareholder return. The AIM share index has been selected for this comparison 
as the company is a constituent of that index.
  
The graph shows the theoretical 
growth in the value of an initial 
£100 hypothetical shareholding 
over the specified period, assuming 
that dividends are re-invested to 
purchase additional units of equity 
at the closing price applicable on 
the ex-dividend date. Historical 
data is based on the constituent 
companies at each given date.
Directors’ contracts
None of the service contracts of executive directors includes provision for specific payment in the event of early termination, 
nor do they provide for extended notice periods in the event of a change in control. It is not the Remuneration Committee’s 
intention to introduce such provisions. If any existing contract of employment is breached by the company in the event 
of termination, the company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and 
contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period. The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that the director fulfils 
his obligation to mitigate his losses and will also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate.

With the approval of the Remuneration Committee, executive directors are entitled, under their service agreements, to perform 
duties outside the Group and to receive fees for those duties. Other than G V Aldridge, none of the directors received fees for 
duties performed outside the Group during the year. G V Aldridge retained his total earnings of £50,000 from his roles as  
non-executive chairman of Broker Profile, an investor relations consultancy, and as non-executive chairman of Core Capital V 
VCT plc, a specialist private equity investor. 
 
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, 
and is based upon independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The remuneration  
paid to each non-executive director in the year to 30 June 2011, shown below, was subject to Board approval. Fees for the  
non-executive directors did not increase during the financial year. Non-executive directors may be paid for professional 
services provided to the Group, but cannot participate in the company’s share option schemes. Non-executive directors do not 
have service contracts and are not eligible to join in any pension scheme operated by the Group. The letters of appointment for 
J L Jeremy, M J Barnes, J R Stevenson and R G Whittington are for a one-year term and subject to prior termination on notice 
of three months either way, while the letter of appointment for R M Dantzic is for a one-year term with twelve months’ notice.

6 September 2011 Corporate  
governance
While the Group is not subject to the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (formerly known as the Combined 
Code), the directors have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures. The directors have also considered the 
guidance set out in Guidance on Audit Committees (formerly known as The Smith Guidance).
 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), as appended to the Listing Rules, sets out Principles of Good Corporate 
Governance and Code provisions which are applicable to listed companies incorporated in Great Britain.
 
A narrative statement on how the company has applied the Principles and a statement explaining the extent to which the 
provisions in the Code have been complied with appear below.
 
Narrative Statement
The Code establishes 18 Principles of Good Governance which are split into five areas which are covered below and in the Directors’ 
Report on pages 44 to 50 and in the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 51 to 55.
 
Directors
The company is controlled through the Board of directors which comprises three executive directors and five independent  
non-executive directors. There is a separation of the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Non-Executive Chairman leads the Board and ensures that the directors have sufficient relevant information to enable 
them to make informed decisions on the strategy of the business and to assess the performance of the various business units. 
The Chief Executive Officer’s responsibilities focus on running the Group’s businesses and implementing Group strategy. 
The Board has considered and confirmed the independence of its non-executive directors. All directors are able to take 
independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties if necessary. They also have access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary.
 
J L Jeremy will retire as a director of the company at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. He will be succeeded as 
the Senior Independent Director by M J Barnes and as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee by J R Stevenson.
 
During the year there were ten Board meetings, three Audit Committee meetings and six Remuneration Committee meetings. 
Attendance by the directors was as follows:

R G Whittington 2* N/A N/A
*number attended since joining the Board on 27 May 2011
 
The Chairman also regularly meets with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present to discuss the 
performance of the Group and any other matters as they arise.
 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it which includes:
 
•	 appr oval	of	annual	budgets	and	business	plans
•	 appr oval	of	contracts	exceeding	pr escribed	thr esholds
•	 acquisitions	and	disposals
•	 appr oval	of	all	capital	expenditur e	pr ojects	not	cover ed	by	budget
 
It is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects 
and consideration of significant financing matters. It monitors the exposure to key business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of individual trading subsidiaries, their codes of conduct, their annual budgets, their progress towards achievement 
of those budgets and their capital expenditure programmes. The Board also considers environmental and employee issues 
and key appointments. It ensures that all directors receive appropriate training on appointment and then subsequently as 
appropriate. All directors submit themselves for re-election at least once every three years.  ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011    57
The Board has two committees, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Details of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found in the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 51 to 55. The members 
of the Audit Committee are R G Whittington (Chairman), R M Dantzic, J L Jeremy and J R Stevenson. R G Whittington is a 
qualified accountant. He recently retired as a senior partner from KPMG and he is considered to be the non-executive member 
of the Board with the most recent experience necessary for the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
 
During the year, the Audit Committee of the Board:
 
a) meets regularly with the external auditors and executive directors attending by invitation to review the financial statements, 
the suitability of the accounting policies and financial reporting of the company, its internal management and financial 
controls and matters arising from the external auditors’ work;
b) approves the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors; and
c) makes recommendations to the Board on these matters and in relation to the re-appointment of auditors to be 
recommended to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
In forming their opinion of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into account 
the safeguards operating within the external auditors and ensures that the level of audit fee is sufficient to enable them to 
fulfil their obligations in accordance with the audit Letter of Engagement. Fees for non-audit work are reviewed by the Group 
Finance Director and then passed to the Audit Committee for approval.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee makes a report to the Board following each Committee meeting and the Board receives 
the minutes of all Audit Committee meetings.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
An evaluation of the Board, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the individual directors was conducted 
during the year by the Chairman and the Secretary (and by the Senior Independent Director and the Secretary in the case 
of the Chairman’s evaluation) by means of questionnaires followed by meetings on a one to one basis to review the results. 
The results of the evaluation were considered satisfactory and provided evidence of a healthy culture that encourages candid 
discussion and rigorous decision-making.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee measures the performance of the executive directors and key members of senior management as a 
prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to the Board for final determination. 
The Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration is set out on pages 51 to 53. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
 
Relations with shareholders
The Board encourages two way communication with both its institutional and private investors and responds quickly to all 
queries received. The executive directors have met with analysts and institutional shareholders on a regular basis in the year 
ended 30 June 2011. Non-executive directors are fully briefed by the executive directors on the views of major shareholders 
about the company and are available for meetings with major shareholders. All shareholders have at least twenty working days’ 
notice of the Annual General Meeting at which all directors and Committee chairs are introduced and available for questions.
 
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
A review of the performance and financial position of the Group is included in the Financial Review. The Board uses this, 
together with the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement and the Directors’ Report on pages 8 to 50, 
to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s position and prospects. The statement of directors’ 
responsibilities for the financial statements is described on page 60.
Internal control
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has been established and that 
process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the revised version of Internal Control Guidance for Directors on the 
UK Corporate Governance Code produced by the Turnbull working party. Following the latest review, the significant risks faced by 
the Group now total 31, of which six are considered principal risks as described on pages 45 and 47. Steps continue to be taken to 
embed internal control and risk management further into the operations of the business and deal with areas of improvement coming 
to management and Board attention. As part of this process, a Corporate Governance Manual setting out the principle business 
policies and procedures operating within the Group has been produced previously and adopted by all businesses across the Group. The reporting systems include formal consideration of all significant business risks at the monthly Board meetings and are 
still subject to continuous review by the Board throughout the year. The monthly management information includes key risk 
indicators with the emphasis on early warning systems. Risk management principles are embedded within all significant projects.
 
The directors are responsible for the system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
 
The key risk management activities are described under the following headings:
 
•	 Strategic	contr ol
 The Board reviews the Group’s strategic plans each year and monitors progress throughout the year. On a regular basis, 
the Group’s significant risks are updated and appropriate control strategies and accountabilities are agreed.
•	 Allocation	of	r esponsibilities	and	contr ol	envir onment
 The Board has set clear terms of reference for each of its committees and the Group has an organisational structure with 
clear reporting lines for financial results, risk exposure and control assessment, and defined and documented delegated 
authorities are in place.
•	 Quality	and	integrity	of	personnel
 The Group is committed to competence and integrity of management and staff at all levels, through its values statement, 
comprehensive recruitment, training and appraisal programmes.
•	 Role	of	the	executive	dir ectors
 Day-to-day management of the Group’s activities is delegated by the Board to the executive directors. They monitor 
the effectiveness of the operating units in meeting Group objectives and controlling major business risks and make 
recommendations to the Board.
•	 Risk	management	r eporting	and	Boar d	r eview
 The Board has overall responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks facing the Group.  
It regularly reviews all operating unit assessments of business risk exposure and control, including compliance 
assessments, and determines appropriate action, taking into account the recommendations of the executive directors.
 
•	 Operating	unit	contr ols
 Key controls over major business risks include reviews against performance indicators and exception reporting.  
Each operating unit’s senior management is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks. 
They make regular assessments of their exposure to major business risks and the extent to which these risks are 
controlled, which are reported to the Board on a monthly basis.
•	 Financial	contr ol
 The Group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the Board. The performance of each business 
is reviewed monthly by local and Group management. Each operating unit prepares monthly results with a comparison 
against budget or forecast. The Board reviews these for the Group as a whole and determines appropriate action.  
Certain members of the Board sit on the boards of the main operating companies.
•	 Inter nal	audit
 While there is no dedicated internal audit function, internal audit resources are provided by the central functions which 
are considered sufficient by the Group. They support the risk management activities and help to identify key risk areas 
across the Group. Any significant issues are reported to the Board via monthly reports. In particular, the Group Commercial 
Director’s role includes the implementation of, and the monitoring of adherence to, the Group’s policies on key commercial 
issues, assisting in the validation of key commercial judgements taken, and ensuring that relevant training is provided for 
all key commercial staff as appropriate. 
•	 Contr ols	over	central	functions
 A number of the Group’s key functions, including Commercial, HR, Health and Safety and Finance, are monitored and 
managed centrally. Each function is required to report to the Board on a regular basis.
•	 IT	systems
 The Group has established controls and procedures over the security of data held on computer systems and suitable 
disaster recovery arrangements are in place.
Corporate governance
(continued)  ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011    59
An ongoing review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the year ended 30 June 2011 has been maintained 
and has taken account of any material developments since the year end.
 
Compliance statement
Although not required to, the Board reports on compliance with the fifty two code provisions throughout the accounting period. 
Save for the exceptions outlined below, the company has complied throughout the accounting period ended 30 June 2011 
with the provisions set out in the Code. The exceptions to the Code were as follows:
 
B.2.1
The directors have not constituted a Nomination Committee because they consider that it is preferable for elections to the 
Board to be dealt with by the Board as a whole. As a result, B.2.2 and B.2.4 do not apply and therefore have also not been 
complied with.
B.6.2
Not applicable.
C.3.1
Until May 2011 the Chairman of the company, who is a qualified accountant, was also Chairman of the Audit Committee.  
Thereafter, R G Whittington, also a qualified accountant, became Chairman of the Audit Committee and therefore the company 
now complies with this provision. The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgments	and	accounting	estimates	that	ar e	r easonable	and	prudent;
•	 state	whether	applicable	UK	Accounting	Standar ds	have	been	followed,	subject	to	any	material	departur es	disclosed	and	
explained in the financial statements; and
•	 pr epar e	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concer n	basis	unless	it	is	inappr opriate	to	pr esume	that	the	company	will	
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 pr operly	select	and	apply	accounting	policies;
•	 pr esent	information,	including	accounting	policies,	in	a	manner	that	pr ovides	r elevant,	r eliable,	comparable	and	
understandable information; 
•	 pr ovide	additional	disclosur es	when	compliance	with	the	specific	r equir ements	in	IFRSs	ar e	insuf ficient	to	enable	users	to	
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 make	an	assessment	of	the	company’ s	ability	to	continue	as	a	going	concer n.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the	financial	statements,	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	the	r elevant	financial	r eporting	framework,	give	a	true	and	fair	
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the	management	r eport,	which	is	incorporated	into	the	dir ectors’	r eport,	includes	a	fair	r eview	of	the	development	and	
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   61
We have audited the group financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related Notes 1 to 38. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
•	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	gr oup’ s	af fairs	as	at	30	June	2011	and	of	its	pr ofit	for	the	year	then	ended;
•	 have	been	pr operly	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted	by	the	Eur opean	Union;	and
•	 have	been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	the	r equir ements	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
•	 certain	disclosur es	of	dir ectors’	r emuneration	specified	by	law	ar e	not	made;	or
•	 we	have	not	r eceived	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	r equir e	for	our	audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 
June 2011 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
Although not required to do so, the directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing the 
extent of their compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. We reviewed:
•	 the	dir ectors’	statement	in	r elation	to	going	concer n;	and
•	 the	part	of	the	Corporate	Gover nance	Statement	r elating	to	the	company’ s	compliance	with	the	nine	pr ovisions	of	the	UK	
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review;
•	 certain	elements	of	the	r eport	to	shar eholders	by	the	Boar d	on	dir ectors’	r emuneration.

•	 IFRS	2	(amendments)	‘Share-based payment’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations relevant to the Group, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective. In some cases these standards 
and guidance had not been endorsed by the European Union:
•	 IFRIC	18	‘Transfer of assets from customers’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2011 
•	 IFRIC	19	‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2011
•	 IFRS	9	‘Financial Instruments’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group.
3. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis. This is discussed in the Directors’ Report on page 44. 
The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting 
policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below. Areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed 
in Note 4.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiaries and joint 
ventures. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation (continued)
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interests of 
non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of 
the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed 
to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided to external 
customers, net of trade discounts and excluding value added tax and similar sales based taxes.
•	 Revenue	fr om	construction	contracts	includes	the	amount	initially	agr eed	in	the	contract	plus	any	variations	in	contract	
work to the extent that it is probable that the variation will result in revenue that can be reliably measured (usually when 
instructions have been received from the client). The revenue recognised reflects the value of the contract at the reporting 
date, with reference to a survey of work performed. The value of work carried out during the year includes amounts which 
have not been invoiced;
•	 Revenue	fr om	construction	r elated	service	contracts	is	r ecognised	in	the	income	statement	in	the	same	pr oportion	as	the	
stage of completion of the contract at the reporting date, the stage of completion having been assessed with reference to 
a survey of the work performed;
•	 Inter est	income	is	accrued,	by	r efer ence	to	the	principal	outstanding	and	the	ef fective	inter est	rate	applicable;
•	 Dividend	income	is	r ecognised	when	the	right	to	r eceive	payment	is	established.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. Transactions which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional 
items are material items of income or expense due to the significance of their nature or amount and include gains or losses on 
disposal of businesses and investments, costs of restructuring and reorganising existing businesses, litigation and regulatory 
settlements, and asset impairments.
Construction and service contracts
Margin on long-term contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion and the final estimated margin, provided 
that the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The stage of completion is measured with reference to the 
proportion of the value of the contract at the reporting date against the total estimated value of the contract. 
Where the outcome of the construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of 
contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period 
in which they are incurred. 
Full provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual contracts immediately, once such losses are foreseen. 
Pensions
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are invested and managed 
independently of the finances of the company. Contributions to the defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the 
income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
At 30 June 2011 (continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   69
Business combinations
Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under	IFRS	3	‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets 
(or	disposal	gr oups)	that	ar e	classified	as	held	for	r esale	in	accor dance	with	IFRS	5	‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
The cost of business combinations includes, where applicable, deferred consideration discounted at an appropriate rate of 
interest to its fair value at the effective date of combination.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit or loss and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups 
of units.
 
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated:
•	 r epr esents	the	lowest	level	within	the	Gr oup	at	which	the	goodwill	is	monitor ed	for	inter nal	management	purposes;	and
•	 is	not	lar ger	than	a	segment	based	on	the	Gr oup’ s	r eporting	format	determined	in	accor dance	with	IFRS	8	
‘Operating segments’.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of 
cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates. Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash flow analysis 
is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash-generating unit compared with the carrying value of that goodwill. 
Management estimate the discount rates as the risk effected cost of capital for the particular cash-generating units. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset 
is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and is based on its fair values as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost and amortised over the estimated useful lives on a straight line 
basis. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The categories of intangible assets (all of which were acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries) and their estimated useful lives 
are as follows: 
Customer relationships 4-10 years
Customer contracts 1-2 years
 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
loss. Cost includes expenditure associated with bringing the asset into use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of 
its assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Short-leasehold property  Life of the lease
Motor vehicles   4 years
IT and office equipment  3-5 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as 
a revaluation decrease.
Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is 
not control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is 
subject to joint control and the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint venture 
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The arrangements the Group has entered into involve the 
establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting; initially stated at 
cost and adjusted thereafter for subsequent changes in the Group’s share of net assets less any impairment in the value of 
individual investments. The Group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ post-tax results are reported in the consolidated 
income statement and the net investments disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the associate and joint venture recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The 
goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost 
of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Inventories
Inventories comprise stocks and property developments, which are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost, where appropriate, is determined using the first-in first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion. Provision is made for foreseeable losses. 
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under finance leases or hire purchase 
contracts are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. The present value of future rentals is shown as a liability. The interest element of rental 
obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease in proportion to the balance sheet repayments 
outstanding. Rentals under operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
At 30 June 2011 (continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   71
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. 
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis.
Own shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the company’s ordinary shares acquired by 
Interior Services Group Employee Trust in connection with the Group’s employee share schemes.
Share-based payments 
Charges for employee services received in exchange for share-based payments have been made for all options that were 
granted	after	7	November	2002	and	had	not	yet	vested	at	1	January	2005	in	accor dance	with	IFRS	2	‘Share-based Payments’.
Options granted under the Group’s employee share schemes are equity settled and measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value of such options has been calculated using the Black–Scholes model, based upon publicly available market data 
and based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions, and is expensed over the vesting period. Vesting conditions are service and performance conditions. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Under	IAS	12	‘Income Taxes’, deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, 
and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they 
are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 
settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the period
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items credited 
or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial 
accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in 
calculating goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost. 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
less any impairment. 
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all of the amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The carrying amount of 
the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed 
as uncollectible.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and at hand and short-term highly-liquid investments that are readily 
convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement. 
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	 significant	financial	dif ficulty	of	the	issuer	or	counterparty;	or
•	 default	or	delinquency	in	inter est	or	principal	payments;	or
•	 it	becoming	pr obable	that	the	borr ower	will	enter	bankruptcy	or	financial	r e-or ganisation.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. 
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or 
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. If the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise 
the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured at the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in 
accor dance	with	IAS	37	‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
At 30 June 2011 (continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   73
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Finance costs 
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method.
 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
Onerous property contracts
Provision for onerous lease commitments on property contracts is based on an estimate of the net unavoidable lease and other 
payments in respect of these properties. These comprise rental and other property costs payable, plus any termination costs, 
less any income expected to be derived from the properties being sublet. The provisions are discounted at an appropriate rate 
to take into account the time value of money.
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and 
financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, 
and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the Group company’s functional currency (Sterling) at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different 
from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the Group’s profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent that they 
relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item.
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated into Sterling at 
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate. The exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to the “foreign 
currency translation reserve” in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if 
applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amount of income and revenue recognised in the 
period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are discussed below. 
Revenue and profit/margin recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition and long-term contracts policies are set out in Note 3 above. These policies are central to 
the way in which the Group values the work it has carried out at each reporting date and the estimation of the percentage 
completion of the contract. These policies require forecasts to be made of the outcome of long-term construction and service 
contracts and require assessments and judgements to be made on the recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in work 
scopes, expected contract costs to complete and the progress on contract programmes. The Group has appropriate control 
procedures in place to ensure estimates are calculated on a consistent basis.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired generally requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
intangible assets or the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. Judgement is also required in determining 
the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated. The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present 
value. Note 3 above and Note 16 details the assumptions that have been applied in assessing impairment of goodwill.
Taxation
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. The Group provides for future liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions where additional tax may become 
payable in future periods, and such provisions are based upon management’s assessment of exposures. 
As set out in Note 3 above, deferred tax is accounted for on temporary differences using the liability method, with deferred 
tax liabilities generally being provided for in full and deferred tax assets being recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Note 29 details the unused 
tax losses for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised and the undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been provided, together with the judgements which the Group has made in respect of these 
matters. These judgements may change in the future and they will be reviewed at each balance sheet date.
5. Segmental information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments on both a product and geographic perspective. 
The performances of these segments are considered by the Board when making strategic decisions. These segments include 
Fit Out, Food Retail and Construction, whilst Fit Out is further segregated by geography into the UK, Continental Europe, 
Middle East and Asia. This segmentation is revised from prior years, as previously announced in the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2010. The prior period comparatives have been restated to reflect this new segmentation. Although the Continental 
Eur ope,	Middle	East	and	Asia	geographical	segments	do	not	meet	the	quantitative	thr esholds	r equir ed	by	IFRS	8	‘Operating 
Segments’, management has concluded that these segments should be reported. All are closely monitored by the Board as 
potential growth regions and are expected to materially contribute to Group revenue in the future. The principal activities of 
each of these divisions are as follows:
UK Fit Out  provision of specialist fit out services in the UK
Continental Europe Fit Out provision of fit out services in Continental Europe
Middle East Fit Out provision of fit out, refurbishment and project management services in the Middle East
Asia Fit Out provision of fit out, refurbishment, design, project management and commissioning management 
 services in Asia
Food Retail provision of fit out, new build and refurbishment services to national food retail customers in 
 the UK
Construction provision of new build, refurbishment and ancillary fit out services in the UK

As reported in last year’s financial statements, Pearce Construction (Midlands) Limited (Pearce Midlands), a dormant subsidiary 
of ISG Pearce Limited, was investigated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for technical breaches of competition law in earlier 
years prior to ISG’s ownership. Pearce Midlands was issued with a Statement of Objections which it has been defending. 
ISG has a £2.0m cash backed indemnity from the vendors of ISG Pearce Holdings Limited, being cash of £1.0m held in an 
escrow bank account and the remainder being the outstanding deferred consideration from the original acquisition of ISG 
Pearce Holdings Limited.
On 20 September 2009, the OFT published a list of fines for 103 UK construction companies, including Pearce Midlands. 
The OFT subsequently announced the findings of its investigation on 20 November 2009 and fined Pearce Midlands £5.2m of 
which £4.4m is on a joint and several basis with the company’s former owner, Crest Nicholson plc. Appeals were submitted 
by both parties to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) on 24 November 2009. On 15 April 2011, the CAT announced their 
findings in respect of the appeal and reduced the fine against Pearce Midlands to £950k. The CAT has indicated that 20% of 
this fine will be Pearce Midland’s sole responsibility and the remaining 80% will be settled on a joint and several basis with 
the company’s former owner. The fine and associated interest were paid in July 2011 and as such have been classified as 
current liabilities.

A restructuring provision of £1.7m has been accrued in respect of the South West Construction business which has been slow

rest of our Construction operations in the UK. A further £0.3m provision has been incurred in respect of further restructuring 
costs incurred in other parts of the UK business. Of the total provision of £2.0m, £0.6m has been spent as at 30 June 2011.

incurred costs during the course of the joint venture separation which have been treated as a loss on disposal of joint venture. 
Given the nature of these items, the Board has considered that they should be treated as exceptional items in accordance with

In April 2010, the Group decided to close its Japanese operation and it was classified as a discontinued operation for the year 
ended 30 June 2010.
14. Dividends
In	accor dance	with	IAS	10	‘Events after the Reporting Date’, dividends are accounted for in the period in which they are paid 
and approved by the shareholders. Accordingly the final dividend proposed in respect of the year ended 30 June 2011 has not 
been included as a liability as at 30 June 2011.
15. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to owners of the company by the weighted average 
number	of	or dinary	shar es	during	the	period,	determined	in	accor dance	with	the	pr ovisions	of	IAS	33	‘Earnings per Share’.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the 
assumption of conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary 
shares, being share options granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the company’s ordinary shares 
during the period, and conditional shares not vested where contingent consideration conditions are yet to be met.
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed from continuing operations to owners of the 
company, before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
during the period. The Group believes that this measure of earnings from continuing operations before exceptional items is 
more reflective of the ongoing trading of the Group. 
A total of 3,044,164 share options that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future were excluded from the 
calculations below because they were anti-dilutive at 30 June 2011 (2010: 3,033,458).

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to six groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) identified 
according to operating segments, being UK Fit Out, Continental Europe Fit Out, Middle East Fit Out, Asia Fit Out, 
Food Retail and Construction as disclosed in Note 5.  The CGUs are revised from prior year in line with the revised 
segmentation as described in Note 5.  The allocation of goodwill is dependent on the CGU that is expected to benefit 
from the business combination. 
 
The Group tests goodwill bi-annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired.  The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.  The key 
assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.  
The Board estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the business, giving a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% (2010: 11.1%).  The Group 
discount rate is applied to all CGUs, on a pre-tax basis.  The long-term growth rate of 2.25% is based on the 
estimated industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product.  
 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by the Board for 
the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following three years based on the estimated growth rate of 
2.25% and thereafter applied into perpetuity.  
 
At 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and 
deemed not to be impaired.  
 
The Group's impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used.  The major assumptions that 
result in significant sensitivities are the growth rate, the discount rate and the forecast year two cash flows.  A 
reasonably possible change in a single assumption will not cause impairment in any of the Group's CGUs. 
 
16. Goodwill
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to six groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) identified 
according to operating segments, being UK Fit Out, Continental Europe Fit Out, Middle East Fit Out, Asia Fit Out, Food 
Retail and Construction as disclosed in Note 5. The CGUs are revised from prior year in line with the revised segmentation 
as described in Note 5. The allocation of goodwill is dependent on the CGU that is expected to benefit from the 
business combination.
The Group tests goodwill bi-annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period. The Board estimates discount rates 
using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business, 
giving a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% (2010: 11.1%). The Group discount rate is applied to all CGUs, on a pre-tax basis. 
The long-term growth rate of 2.25% is based on the estimated industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross 
domestic product. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by the Board for the 
next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following three years based on the estimated growth rate of 2.25% and 
thereafter applied into perpetuity. 
At 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and deemed not to 
be impaired. 
The Group’s impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. The major assumptions that result in 
significant sensitivities are the growth rate, the discount rate and the forecast year two cash flows. A reasonably possible 
change in a single assumption will not cause impairment in any of the Group’s CGUs.  17. Other intangible assets

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
At 30 June 2011 (continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   91
Fair value of financial instruments
The Board considers that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest 
at rates approximate to the market. 
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, the key risks identified being:
•	 Market	risk
•	 Cr edit	risk
•	 For eign	curr ency	risk	
•	 Liquidity	risk
•	 Inter est	rate	risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and 
procedures for measuring and managing risk. Please refer also to the principal business risks in the Directors’ Report on pages 
45 to 47 and also the Corporate Governance statement on pages 56 to 59.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage 
and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. The Board reviewed and agreed the policy for managing interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and the 
potential impact of any significant economic changes are discussed at monthly Board meetings. Refer to both foreign currency 
risk and interest rate risk headings below.
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial 
loss from defaults. 
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued 
income, which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the consolidated 
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience 
and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. No credit exposure is permitted to a financial 
institution with a rating lower then A+ or equivalent. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are 
continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and the Group’s exposure 
to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on 
credit risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having 
similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other 
receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components of this allowance 
are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established 
for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is 
determined by references to past default experience and historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.  26. Financial instruments (continued)
Financial risk management (continued)
Credit risk (continued)
Trade receivables (continued)
Before accepting any new customer, the Group runs credit checks to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The 
company monitors exposure to individual clients and all customers are subject to standard terms of payment for each division. 
Ageing of trade receivables:
Trade receivables that are less than four months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired. Included in the 
Group’s trade receivables are debtors with a carrying amount of £2,230,000 (2010: £7,748,000) which are four months past 
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not made provision as there has not been a significant change in the credit 
quality and the amounts are considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. 
Movement in the provision for impairment:
Foreign currency risk
The Group has international operations and is exposed primarily to the Euro (EUR), Singapore dollar (SGD) and United Arab 
Emirates dirham (AED), hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The main risk is from net investments in foreign 
operations, recognised assets and liabilities and future trading transactions. 
The current level of foreign business is approximately 6% (2010: 8%) of the Group’s trading operating profit before Group 
activities as presented in Note 5. A 10% increase/decrease in the GBP against the EUR would have had a circa £71,000 (2010: 
£37,000) impact on trading operating profits, a 10% increase/decrease in the GBP against the SGD would have had a circa 
£93,000 (2010: £55,000) impact on trading operating profits and a 10% increase/decrease in the GBP against the AED would 
have had a circa £64,000 (2010: £25,000) impact on trading operating profits. This analysis assumes all other variables, in 
particular interest rates, remain constant. 
The Group monitors the net balance sheet exposure to foreign currency movements and would consider hedging against any 
material exposure arising. 
During the year the Group made a decision not to hedge any exposure to fluctuations in the value of the EUR, SGD and AED 
against the GBP since it believed that it would not be in the interests of the business as the cost outweighs the benefit.

Trade receivables 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of 
the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less 
of an influence on credit risk.

exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of 
the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less 
of an influence on credit risk. 
 
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties 
having similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related 
entities.   
 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
and other receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.  The main 
components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a 
collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not 
yet identified.  The collective loss allowance is determined by references to past default experience and historical data 
of payment statistics for similar financial assets.   
 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group runs credit checks to assess the potential customer’s credit quality.  
The company monitors exposure to individual clients and all customers are subject to standard terms of payment for 
each division.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
At 30 June 2011 (continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   93
Foreign exchange risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Finance Department and the Board and if considered necessary a 
strategy to minimise any potential risk will be discussed and implemented. Significant foreign exchange movements are also 
reviewed by the Board and the process of reviewing different options is undertaken on a quarterly basis. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, relating to 
operations carried out in local functional currencies, at the reporting date are as follows: 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Responsibility for 
liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring bank covenant compliance, forecast 
and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in Note 25 is a description 
of the additional undrawn facility that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk. 
Further details relevant to the Group’s liquidity position and its status as a going concern are included within the Directors’ 
Report on page 44.
The Group reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits. A daily cash flow forecast for the 
next three weeks and a weekly cash flow forecast for the following nine weeks are prepared on a weekly basis and reviewed 
at company and Group level. At each month end a twelve month cash flow is prepared by each company and submitted to 
Group. Minimum cleared cash levels have been imposed on each company and actual balances are monitored against the 
minimum levels on a daily basis. 
In addition the top and bottom ten cash contracts by company are reviewed at company and Group level on a monthly basis. 
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities. The tables below 
have been drawn up based on the earliest date on which the Group can settle the debt. The table includes both interest and 
principal cash flows.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument, will 
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The Group’s only interest-bearing asset is cash, which is invested in 
short-term deposits. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing funds at floating interest rates. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages interest rate risk 
on borrowings by ensuring access to diverse funding and through monitoring interest rate movements with weekly reports. 
Interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis and if considered necessary a strategy to minimise any potential risk through 
interest rate swaps is discussed and implemented. Currently the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and 
expense is immaterial to the Group. Risk arises on the variance between the Bank of England Base Rate and the LIBOR rate. 
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed below.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the 
year would increase or decrease by £126,000 (2010: £163,352) in respect to exposure to the Group’s borrowings. However this 
exposure is largely mitigated by cash balances held by the Group throughout the year.
27. Trade and other payables
An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in Note 25. 
The Group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction. It is the Group’s general policy 
to pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms. 
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe. 
Therefore, under the normal course of business, the Group is not charged interest on overdue payables. There are no 
suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade payables in either 2011 or 2010. Estimated contingent 
consideration of £2,080,000 is payable on the acquisition as at 30 June 2011 to be fulfilled in cash of £1,664,000 and shares 
worth £416,000. These amounts are payable in March 2012, March 2013 and March 2014.

At the balance sheet date there were unused tax losses of approximately £14.7m (2010: £14.5m) which are available for offset 
against future profits, of which a deferred tax amount has been created on £2.0m (2010: £nil) of these losses.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after 
offset) for financial reporting purposes:
The Finance Act 2010, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1 
April 2011, was substantively enacted on 21 July 2010. Subsequently, the Government has further reduced the main rate of 
corporation tax from 27% to 26% effective from 1 April 2011. This was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 under the 
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968. This subsequent rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at 
the balance sheet date.
The Government intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate of 1% each year down to 23% by 1 April 2014. We 
estimate that the future rate changes to 23% would further reduce our UK deferred tax assets recognised as at 30 June 2011 
from £1.7m to £1.5m. The actual impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £3.6m (2010: £4.5m) in respect of timing differences relating to trading losses, 
non trade loan relationship deficits, capital allowances in excess of depreciation, other short-term timing differences as the 
timing of the recoverability of this is considered uncertain. These may be carried forward indefinitely. We estimate that the 
future rate changes to 23% would further reduce our UK deferred tax assets not recognised as at 30 June 2011 from £3.6m to 
£3.2m. The actual impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time.

30. Share capital
The total authorised number of ordinary shares is 100 million shares (2010: 100 million) with a par value of 1p per share 
(2010: 1p per share). All issued shares are fully paid. The company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to 
fixed income.
As at 30 June 2011, the Interior Services Group Employee Share Trust held 1,512,317 (2010: 1,569,129) ordinary 1p shares in 
the company at a cost of £3,658,000 (2010: £3,770,000) and a market value of £3,039,757 (2010: £2,589,063). These shares 
have not yet been allocated to individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares have been waived. The Board does 
not consider the decrease in value of the shares to be a permanent diminution in value and as such they have not been 
written down.
At 30 June 2011, the Group owns 4.53% (2010: 4.73%) of its own called up share capital.

36. Acquisition of subsidiaries 
On 8 April 2011 the Group acquired 85% of the issued share capital and obtained control of Realys, a design-led project 
management specialist based in Shanghai servicing multinational companies – primarily from Western Europe. The acquisition 
is expected to widen the Group’s international client base and provide a broader service offering to the Group’s clients in China 
and Hong Kong.
The fair value of the financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value and gross contractual value of £0.2m. 
These are expected to be fully collectible. The goodwill of £2.6m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the expansion of 
the Group’s client base and geographical spread. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of the 237,586 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Realys, £0.5m, was based on the 
share price on 8 April 2011.
The non-controlling interest has been measured as the proportionate share of the fair value of identifiable net assets.
The contingent consideration arrangements require the achievement of certain profit targets. The potential undiscounted 
amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is 
between £0.5m and £3.2m. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of £2.1m was estimated by applying 
the likelihood of meeting the profit targets as assessed by current management.
The vendors and the Group have entered into a put and call option arrangement for the remaining 15% of the shares of Realys, 
with the earliest exercise date being 2015. 
Acquisition-related costs (included in administrative expenses) amount to £0.2m (Note 6).
Realys contributed £0.4m revenue and £0.1m to the Group’s profit for the period between the date of the acquisition and the 
balance sheet date. If the acquisition of Realys had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for 
the period would have been £1,198m and the Group’s profit for the period would have been £7.4m.

  We have audited the parent company financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 
which comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related Notes 39 to 47.  The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
•	 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	company’ s	af fairs	as	at	30	June	2011;
•	 have	been	pr operly	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice;	and
•	 have	been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	the	r equir ements	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
•	 adequate	accounting	r ecor ds	have	not	been	kept	by	the	par ent	company ,	or	r etur ns	adequate	for	our	audit	have	not	been	
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the	par ent	company	financial	statements	ar e	not	in	agr eement	with	the	accounting	r ecor ds	and	r etur ns;	or
•	 certain	disclosur es	of	dir ectors’	r emuneration	specified	by	law	ar e	not	made;	or
•	 we	have	not	r eceived	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	r equir e	for	our	audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2011.

39. Significant accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that 
Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Whilst the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the principal accounting policies adopted are the 
same as those set out in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements insofar as they are material to the parent company 
financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. The 
company is included within the consolidated financial statements of Interior Services Group plc, which are publicly available. 
Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of 
FRS	1	(r evised	1996)	‘Cash Flow Statements’.
40. Parent company profit and loss account
The company has taken advantage of section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own profit 
and loss account. The profit for the year included within the financial statements of the parent company is £2,627,000 
(2010: £10,395,000 loss). 
41. Tangible assets
The company does not have any of its property and equipment pledged as security over bank loans.
42. Investments
The disposal balance in the current year is the result of internal restructuring where the ownership of ISG Asia Investment (HK) 
Limited was transferred to ISG Overseas Investments Limited at carrying value. Impairment was recognised in respect of the 
company’s investment in Propencity Group Limited in the prior year.

The total authorised number of ordinary shares is 100 million shares (2010: 100 million) with a par value of 1p per share

fixed income.
47. Company reserves
As at 30 June 2011, the parent company held 513,634 (2010: 513,634) ordinary 1p shares in the company at a cost of 
£1,143,000 (2010: £1,143,000) and a market value of £1,032,404 (2010: £847,496). These shares have not been allocated to 
individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares have been waived. The company does not consider the decrease in the 
value of the shares to be a permanent diminution in value and as such they have not been written down. 
Other reserves are unrealised. Of the opening balance, £15,500,000 arose from the sale of ISG Interior Services Group UK plc 
to Interior Services Group (UK Holdings) Limited in 2008. 
All amounts within the profit and loss account are distributable reserves.

As at 30 June 2011, the parent company held 513,634 (2010: 513,634) ordinary 1p shares in the company at a cost of 
£1,143,000 (2010: £1,143,000) and a market value of £1,032,404 (2010: £847,496). These shares have not been 
allocated to individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares have been waived. The company does not 
consider the decrease in the value of the shares to be a permanent diminution in value and as such they have not 
been written down.  
 
Other reserves are unrealised. Of the opening balance, £15,500,000 arose from the sale of ISG Interior Services Group 
UK plc to Interior Services Group (UK Holdings) Limited in 2008.

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the seventeenth Annual General Meeting of Interior Services Group plc (the “Company”)

“2006 Act”) to exercise all powers of the Company to allot any shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for 
or to convert any security into shares in the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount of £222,716 comprising:
(a) an aggregate nominal amount of £111,358 (whether in connection with the same offer or issue as under (b) below or 
otherwise); and
(b) an aggregate nominal amount of £111,358 in the form of equity securities (within the meaning of section 560(1) of the 
2006 Act) in connection with an offer or issue of ordinary shares by way of rights or other pre-emptive offer or issue, 
open for acceptance for a period fixed by the directors, to holders of ordinary shares (other than the Company) on 
the register on any record date fixed by the directors in proportion (as nearly as may be) to the respective number of 
ordinary shares held or deemed to be held by them, subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors 
may deem necessary or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements, legal or practical problems arising in any 
overseas territory, the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange or any other matter whatsoever.
 
This authority shall expire (unless previously varied as to duration, revoked or renewed by the Company in general meeting) 
on the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company and 15 months after the date of the 
passing of this resolution, except that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might 
require shares to be allotted or rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares to be granted after the expiry of such 
authority and the directors may allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares in pursuance of 
such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred by this resolution had not expired.
 
The authority granted by this resolution shall replace all existing authorities to allot any shares in the Company and to grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company previously granted to the directors pursuant to 
section 551 of the 2006 Act.
11. That subject to the passing of resolution 10, the directors be empowered (i) pursuant to section 570 of the 2006 Act to

conferred on them by resolution 10 above and/or (ii) pursuant to section 573(2) of the 2006 Act to sell equity securities 
held as treasury shares for cash in accordance with section 727 of the 2006 Act, in each case as if section 561(1) of the 
2006 Act did not apply to any such allotment or sale, provided that this power shall be limited to any allotment and/or sale 
of equity securities:
(a) in connection with or pursuant to an offer or issue by way of rights or other pre-emptive offer or issue, open for 
acceptance for a period fixed by the directors, to holders of ordinary shares (other than the Company) on the register 
on any record date fixed by the directors in proportion (as nearly as may be) to the respective number of ordinary 
shares held or deemed to be held by them, subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may 
deem necessary or expedient to deal with fractional entitlements or legal or practical problems arising in any overseas 
territory, the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange or any other matter whatsoever; and (b) otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above, in the case of ordinary shares (as defined in section 560(1) of 
the 2006 Act), an aggregate nominal value or, in the case of other equity securities, giving the right to subscribe for or 
convert into ordinary shares having an aggregate nominal value, not exceeding the sum of £33,407.
 
 This authority shall expire, unless previously revoked or renewed by the Company in general meeting, at such time as the 
general authority conferred on the directors by resolution 10 above expires, except that the Company may at any time 
before such expiry make any offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted or equity 
securities held as treasury shares to be sold after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities and/or sell 
equity securities held as treasury shares in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the power conferred by this 
resolution had not expired.
12.  That the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised, to make one or more market purchases (within 
the meaning of section 693(4) of the 2006 Act) of its ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the Company 
(“ordinary shares”) provided that:
(a)  the maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares hereby authorised to be purchased is 3,340,747;
(b)  the minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid per ordinary share is not less than 1p; and
(c) the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid per ordinary share is not more than 105 per cent of 
the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the ordinary share is contracted to be 
purchased.
 This authority shall expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company and 15 
months after the date of the passing of this resolution, but the Company may, if it agrees to purchase ordinary shares 
under this authority before it expires, complete the purchase wholly or partly after this authority expires.
The directors believe that the proposed resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of shareholders as a whole 
and recommend that shareholders vote in favour of all the resolutions, as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial 
shareholdings in the Company.

Notice of annual general meeting 
(continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   113
Notes to the Notice of the Meeting:
1.  A member who is an individual is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting or to appoint one or more other 
persons as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights on his behalf. Further details of how to appoint a proxy, and the 
rights of proxies, are given in the paragraphs below. A member that is a company can appoint one or more corporate 
representatives (such as a director or employee of the company) whose attendance at the meeting is treated as if the 
company were attending in person, or it can appoint one or more persons as its proxy to exercise all or any of its rights 
on its behalf. In each case, a person attending the meeting will need to provide the Company or its registrars, Capita 
Registrars, with evidence of their identity and, if applicable, their appointment as a proxy or corporate representative with 
authority to vote on behalf of a member.
2.  A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”) is entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at the AGM on his behalf. A shareholder may appoint more than 
one proxy in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share 
or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. A proxy form which may be used 
to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice.
3.  To appoint a proxy or proxies shareholders must complete either (a) a form of proxy which they should sign and return, 
together with the power of attorney or any other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy of such 
authority, to the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4TU; or (b) a 
CREST Proxy Instruction (see Note 7 below); or (c) an online proxy appointment at http://www.capitaregistrars.com/; in 
each case so that it is received not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the AGM or any adjournment thereof. 
Appointment of a proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending and voting in person at the AGM.
4.  In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the 
joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most 
senior).
5.  Copies of all directors’ service contracts, or where any such contract is not reduced to writing, a memorandum of 
the terms thereof, are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours 
(Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excluded) and will also be available for inspection at the AGM (for 15 minutes 
prior to the meeting and during the meeting).
6.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those shareholders who are registered 
on the Company’s share register at 12 noon on 14 November 2011, being not more than 48 hours prior to the time fixed 
for the AGM or, if the AGM is adjourned, such time being not more than 48 hours prior to the time fixed for the adjourned 
AGM, shall be entitled to attend the AGM and vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to entries on the share register made after this time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend and/or vote at the AGM.
7.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for the AGM and any adjournment(s) of the meeting, by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available 
via http://www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST 
members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider 
who will be able to take appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications, 
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy 
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time for receipt 
of proxy appointments set out in Note 3 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined 
by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve 
the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s), should note that Euroclear UK & 
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and 
limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member 
concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST Personal Member or CREST sponsored member or has appointed 
any voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as is necessary 
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST 
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections 
of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Explanatory notes on the resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 10 are ordinary resolutions. These resolutions will be passed if more than 50% of the votes cast for or 
against the resolution are in favour.
Resolutions 1 and 2 – Receiving the audited accounts and associated reports
The 2006 Act requires that for each financial year, the directors present the Company’s accounts, the directors’ report and the 
auditors’ report before a general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. The directors are also seeking approval of the 
directors’ report to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration.
Resolutions 3 and 4 – Reappointment of auditors and authority to determine auditors’ remuneration 
The 2006 Act requires that the Company shall, at each general meeting at which accounts are presented, appoint an auditor or 
auditors to hold office from the conclusion of that meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts 
are presented. Accordingly, the directors propose to reappoint the Company’s auditors, Deloitte LLP , as the auditors of the 
Company and the directors are also seeking shareholder approval to determine the amount of their fees. 
Resolution 5 – Declaration of a Final Dividend
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 10.65 pence per ordinary share of 1 pence, payable on 18 November 2011 
to holders on the register as at 6.00pm on 21 October 2011. The final dividend can not be paid without shareholder approval 
and its amount may not exceed the amount recommended by the directors.
Resolutions 6, 7, 8 and 9 – Reappointment of directors
Article 95 of the Company’s articles of association requires that directors shall retire from office at the AGM unless they have 
been reappointed as a director at either of the last two annual general meetings. Accordingly, G V Aldridge, M J Barnes and R 
M Dantzic are retiring and are seeking re-election. 
Article 99 of the Company’s articles of association requires that directors appointed by the Board must seek re-election at the 
next following AGM. Accordingly, R G Whittington is retiring and is seeking re-election. 
Directors seeking re-election
G V Aldridge was appointed as an executive director of the Company in January 2008 responsible for corporate development 
in particular to help in the development of the group’s international operations. Prior to joining the Company he was a 
managing director in corporate finance at Bridgewell, the investment bank, focusing on the construction and support services 
sectors. He has been a corporate adviser to the Company since the flotation of the Company in 1998.
M J Barnes joined the Board as a non-executive director in June 2004. He has extensive experience in the leisure and 
hospitality industry and is currently a non-executive director of Sportech plc and Chairman of Novus Leisure Limited. He is a 
member of the Remuneration Committee.
R M Dantzic joined the Board as non-executive Chairman in June 2004. A chartered accountant, he has a wealth of experience 
in the property sector and is a former director of Stanhope Properties plc, British Gas Properties and Development Securities 
plc. The Board does not consider that his other commitments prevent him from being an effective Chairman of the Company.
R G Whittington joined the Board as a non-executive director in May 2011. He is a chartered accountant and recently retired as 
a Senior Partner from KPMG where he was the Partner in charge of the Infrastructure, Government and Healthcare Audit Group 
and simultaneously Global Head of Building and Construction. He now acts as a consultant/adviser to a number of businesses. 
He is Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
With the exception of R G Whittington who had not joined the Company at the time, all of the directors seeking re-election 
were subject to a formal performance evaluation during the year. The Board is of the view that all of the directors continue 
to be effective, that each makes a valuable contribution to the Board and that all demonstrate commitment to their 
respective roles.

(continued) ISG plc Annual report and accounts 2011   115
Resolution 10 - Authority to allot shares and securities
The 2006 Act provides that the directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. At the AGM, 
shareholders will be asked to renew the directors’ authority to allot new shares, to grant options to subscribe for new shares 
and to issue securities that are convertible into new shares under section 551 of the 2006 Act. This authority will be limited to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £222,716, which represents approximately two-thirds of the current issued ordinary share 
capital. As provided in paragraph (a) of the resolution, up to half of this authority (equal to one-third of the issued share capital 
of the Company) will enable directors to allot and issue new shares, to grant options to subscribe for new shares and to 
issue securities that are convertible into new shares, in whatever manner they see fit (subject to relevant pre-emption rights). 
Paragraph (b) of the resolution provides that the remainder of the authority (equal to a further one-third) may only be used in 
connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer or issue in favour of ordinary shareholders. As paragraph (a) imposes 
no restrictions on the way the authority may be exercised, it could be used in conjunction with paragraph (b) so as to enable 
the whole two-thirds authority to be used in connection with a rights issue. Where usage of the authority exceeds the one-third 
threshold in the circumstances set out in guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers the directors will stand for re-
election at the following annual general meeting, to the extent required by the ABI.
The authority will expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company and the date falling 
15 months after the passing of this resolution. 
Passing this resolution will give the directors flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when opportunities arise, 
by issuing new shares. The directors have no present intention of issuing any shares except in connection with the employee 
share schemes of the Company.
Resolutions 11 and 12 are special resolutions. These resolutions will be passed if more than 75% of the votes cast for 
or against the resolution are in favour.
Resolution 11 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
The 2006 Act requires that, if the Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them to 
existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. Shareholders will be asked to allow the directors, within limits, to 
allot equity securities and/or to sell equity securities held “in treasury” (if any) (see below for explanation of equity securities 
held “in treasury”) in the Company for cash without application of the pre-emptive rights provided by the 2006 Act up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal value of £33,407, which represents approximately 10 per cent. of the current issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company. The authority will expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares given under resolution 
10. There are no current plans to allot any shares except in connection with the employee share schemes of the Company.
Since 1 December 2003, companies have been allowed to purchase their own shares and hold them “in treasury”, rather than 
having to cancel them. Treasury shares carry no right to attend or vote at meetings, or to receive dividends. Nor will the shares 
confer any right to participate pre-emptively in new issues by the Company. It is possible to hold treasury shares for later cash 
sale or for transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employees’ share scheme, or to cancel them at any time.
The Company does not at present hold any shares in treasury. 
Resolution 12 - Authority to purchase own shares
Resolution 12 is to authorise the Company to purchase (within recommended best practice) its own shares in the market. 
The authority prescribes the maximum and minimum prices to be paid, and, if passed, would expire at the same time as the 
authority to allot shares given under resolution 10.
The authority would only be exercised if the directors were satisfied that such purchases might be expected to result in an 
increase in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and were in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Shares purchased under the authority would be treated as cancelled (and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly) 
or would be held as treasury shares, which may be re-sold, cancelled or transferred for the purposes of an employee share 
scheme.
As at the date of this Notice, the Company had 33,407,473 shares in issue. Resolution 12 seeks authority to purchase a 
maximum of 3,340,747 shares, representing approximately 10 per cent. of its current issued share capital. Notes 3    ISG plc Report and Financial Statements 2011

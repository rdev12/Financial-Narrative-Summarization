Excellence in Delivery is an ambitious and 
far reaching programme which, in a period 
of over three years, will completely 
transform Cobham by putting excellence 
at the very heart of everything we do. 
There are three components to this 
programme, which focus on a number 
of principal manufacturing locations.
STANDARD OPERATING FRAMEWORK
Establishing a Cobham way of doing 
business in the form of a standard set  
of good practice tools, processes and 
techniques that will allow us to deliver 
operational excellence consistently  
across our business.
Manufacturing Research and 
Development
CORE R&D INVESTMENT
£129m
(2010: £125m)
Cobham spent £608m in 201 1  
with suppliers on five continents. 
As part of the Excellence in 
Delivery programme, non-core 
manufacturing activities are 
being further outsourced to 
the supply chain as businesses 
are integrated into principal 
manufacturing locations. 
There is a major investment in 
training to improve supply chain 
management across the Group, 
as the performance of suppliers 
is critical to the timely delivery, 
cost and quality of the goods 
manufactured by Cobham.
Cobham funded Research and Development 
or Private Venture (PV) was £70m (2010: £69m) 
representing 5.2% (2010: 5.0%) of revenue, 
with a strategic objective of increasing 
investment to 6%.
The majority of Cobham’s customer funded 
Research and Development (R&D) and Private 
Venture (PV) is spent when the Group is down 
selected for a project or programme, so 
investment is linked to market opportunities. 
Customer funding is used to develop products, 
particularly in the USA.
Regardless of the funding source, the focus 
is on development rather than research.
Our role within the industry
Our primary focus is on Tier 3 products 
and components with selective 
operations at Tier 2.
We focus our development 
on increasing functionality 
and consider:
Power More power efficient
Commercial aircraft, fighters, satellites and unmanned vehicles are some of 
the most expensive real estate in the world, so our ability to provide greater 
functionality at a lower weight, with a smaller footprint and better power 
characteristics will remain a key discriminator. 
Increasing fuel costs mean that our customers are constantly looking 
for superior technical performance coupled with lower weight and drag.

WHAT WE DO: OUR BUSINESS MODEL Many of Cobham’s capabilities 
improve communication and 
keep people safe, which is a 
common requirement across 
the Group’s defence, security 
and commercial markets. This 
is why Cobham’s technology 
can often be adapted from 
one market to the next, 
e.g. commercial to defence/
security and from one domain 
to another, e.g. aerospace to land.
Customers
Cobham’s customers range 
from Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) and 
prime contractors, who 
incorporate the Group’s 
technology into their 
products or platforms, to 
other customers, such as 
airlines and government 
agencies who buy Cobham 
equipment directly.
NEW ERP SYSTEM
Lock down the standard operating 
framework processes with a Cobham 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, 
capture scale economies and reduce 
complexity further through 
implementation of shared services.
INTEGRATION
Integrate some smaller production 
facilities into the principal locations  
to increase the coverage of our

Business overview
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 Corporate development
We have continued to make good 
progress in our strategy of focusing on 
chosen markets where we have scale 
and differentiation, completing the 
planned divestment of the non-core 
Analytic Solutions business for 
US$350m. In addition we invested some 
US$280m in acquisitions, bringing us 
complementary and differentiated 
technologies. We are increasingly 
prioritising investments which bring 
more balance between our defence/
security and commercial markets, with 
focus on products which can be applied 
to multiple end markets, as this increases 
return on investment. 
I am pleased to say that Excellence in 
Delivery, our transformation programme, 
has produced improved operational 
performance and significant efficiency 
improvements, in part driving an 
increase in underlying EPS of 12%. 
We intend to expand the programme 
and we estimate that the run rate of 
efficiency savings at the end of 2013 
will increase from £65m to £75m. 
Underlining our ongoing commitment 
to technology investment, we invested 
£129m on Research and Development 
in our core businesses, including £70m 
of company funded investment or 
Private Venture, representing 5.2% 
of revenue.
It is our ability to generate cash which 
provides us with the funds to continue 
our significant investment in the 
business and pay a progressive dividend 
to shareholders. Our free cash flow was 
excellent, with strong operating cash 
conversion of 95%. 
Shareholder distributions
In March 201 1 we announced a 
programme to return surplus capital to 
shareholders through a share buy-back 
of up to £150m. This share buy-back 
programme was completed in 
November with a total of 76m 
shares purchased. 
Cobham has high dividend cover, 
a strong balance sheet after the share 
buy-back and a highly cash generative 
business model. As a demonstration 
of confidence in the Group’s future 
prospects, the Board has decided 
to make a one-off step change to 
the 201 1 ordinary dividend and is 
recommending a final dividend of 6.20 
pence (2010: 4.372 pence). Together 
with an interim dividend of 1.80 pence 
(2010: 1.628 pence), this will result in a 
total dividend of 8.0 pence (2010: 6.0 
pence) per share, an increase of 33% 
on the prior year.
The Board
We announced in November 201 1 that 
Andy Stevens, Cobham Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO), had decided to take 
early retirement due to the recurrence 
of a long term serious back injury. 
I have temporarily assumed the 
position of Executive Chairman, with 
Andy remaining on the Board to assist 
with the management of the Group 
until a new CEO is appointed. The 
process for finding a replacement 
is making progress.
Alison Wood joined the Board as a 
Non-executive Director in July 201 1. 
Alison brings to the Board deep insight 
of defence and security markets as well 
as related technology issues through 
her 1 7 year career at BAE Systems, 
prior to becoming Global Director 
Corporate Development & Strategy 
for National Grid plc. 
Peter Hooley retired as a Non-executive 
Director at the conclusion of Cobham’s 
Annual General Meeting in May 201 1, 
after nine years service. I would like to 
thank Peter for his wise counsel and 
assured contribution as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. Michael Wareing has 
taken over as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, drawing on his considerable 
financial experience as a former Chief 
Executive of KPMG International.
Outlook
We have made significant steps towards 
focusing the portfolio on markets where 
we have technical differentiation and 
leading positions. Excellence in Delivery 
has achieved real operational 
improvements and better-than-
expected efficiency savings and we have 
a strong balance sheet and a highly cash 
generative business model, giving us the 
flexibility to examine attractive 
acquisition opportunities and increase 
shareholder distributions. The US 
Government has confirmed defence 
and security priorities that favour 
Cobham and has made some progress 
in reconcilling these to budgetary 
imperatives. The continued delivery of 
the strategy gives the Board confidence 
that we will continue to make progress 
over the medium term.

ORDER BOOK
£2.5bn
(2010: £2.5bn)
Overview of the year
The core businesses, which excludes 
Analytic Solutions which has now been 
divested and other smaller businesses yet 
to be divested, achieved modest organic 
revenue growth of 0.3% in the year driven 
by a good performance from Mission 
Systems and the Aviation Services 
business. Revenue from both commercial 
and rest of the world defence/security 
markets, representing 56% of core 
business revenue, grew strongly. As 
anticipated, revenue growth was 
constrained by continued uncertainty 
in the US defence/security market. 
Group order intake in the year increased 
16% at constant translation exchange 
rates with the book-to-bill ratio at 1. 10 
times. At the year end, the Group order 
book was £2.5bn (2010: £2.5bn), which 
is an increase of 7% on the prior year 
on a constant translation exchange 
rate basis and excluding the impact 
of acquisitions and divestments.
The Group received some very 
important multi-year orders during 
201 1 in all of its key markets. These 
include the initial orders for engineering 
and manufacturing development on 
the US KC-46A aerial refuelling tanker 
totalling US$73m and orders for the 
Brazilian KC-390 aerial refuelling tanker 
totalling US$72m. Other significant 
orders included a US$40m order from 
Inmarsat to be the maritime terminal 
launch partner on its Global Xpress 
broadband service, a significant 
AUD$500m extension of the Australian 
QantasLink contract and a €45m 
contract to a Cobham joint venture to 
provide helicopter air reconnaissance 
capability to the Dutch Caribbean 
Coastguard. 
Further progress has been made in 2012, 
with a further significant award on 
the KC-46 tanker programme for the 
supply of body fuel tanks, with an initial 
engineering order received and other 
significant bids submitted.
Overall, US defence/security revenue in 
the core businesses was down 7%, in a 
year when US Department of Defense 
investment outlays declined 10%. 
Encouragingly, non US defence/security 
revenue increased 5% driven by air 
refuelling and electronic subsystems 
exports following significant 
investments in PV and the development 
of customer relationships. Commercial 
revenue increased 10%, benefiting from 
increased flying activity for Australian 
resource industry customers, increased 
Boeing and Airbus production and 
revenue from the sale of SATCOM 
antennas to a range of aerospace and 
marine customers.
The Group underlying trading margin 
increased by 1.4% points to 19.7% and 
underlying EPS increased by 13% at 
constant translation exchange rates, 
driven by the Excellence in Delivery 
programme and other cost savings. 
The £150m share buy-back programme, 
completed in November, increased 
EPS by 3%. 
Strategy update 
The Group’s strategy continues to 
be underpinned by three investment 
priorities. These are a continuation 
of investment in technologies in 
selected faster growing markets, 
including prioritising investment 
where this brings more balance between 
the Group’s defence/security and 
commercial markets. Secondly, achieving 
excellence in operations; and thirdly 
focusing the Group’s portfolio of 
businesses on markets where Cobham 
has scale and differentiation. 
Technology investment
Cobham has a unique set of 
differentiated technologies with 
leading positions in all its core markets. 
It has invested to maintain and build 
on these positions, with a view to 
generating revenue over a sustained 
period. Examples of this investment 
include next generation wireless video 
links which have numerous airborne 
and ground security applications, early 
threat detection on oil and gas wells 
and broadcast applications, including 
for the 2012 Olympics. In addition, 
Cobham has developed an improved 
oxygen generation system for use in 
field hospitals and next generation 
Active Electronically Scanned Array 
radar subsystems, which provide 
significantly improved performance 
and reliability.
Cobham’s PV investment is focused 
on specific areas of customer demand, 
and this approach generates an excellent 
return on the investment made. For 
example, the Group has over several 
years invested US$14m in PV on 
its Radio and Audio Integration 
Management System, which has already 
won sole source positions on some 
key commercial aircraft programmes. 
These positions are currently estimated 
to generate Cobham some US$250m 
of revenue over the product’s life, 
which does not include potential future 
awards on other commercial and/or 
military aircraft. 
Operational excellence 
The Group is delighted with the progress 
being made on Excellence in Delivery, 
Cobham’s transformation programme, 
ANDY STEVENS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Business overview
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW INNOVATION 
Cobham has been supplying tactical video links to US and other militaries for decades, for both aerial and ground unmanned vehicles for 
applications that include Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED). The technology is also used in applications ranging from TV broadcast 
of NFL games, to police helicopter surveillance for Super Bowl XLI held in Miami, Florida and the golf Ryder Cup held in Wales.
which was announced in August 2010 
and is planned to continue to the end 
of 2013. There are three components 
to this programme: the implementation 
of a Standard Operating Framework 
across a set of principal locations, the 
integration of smaller manufacturing 
facilities into these principal locations 
and the implementation of an ERP IT 
system. The programme is bringing 
a number of significant operational 
benefits including improved 
productivity, shortened manufacturing 
lead times, improved levels of quality 
and reduced working capital.
During 201 1, improvements to the 
production operations in 10 principal 
sites were progressively implemented 
with the remaining sites to be 
undertaken in 2012. The planned 
physical integrations are also starting 
to deliver efficiencies with nine site 
integrations completed. Work 
was started on the design of the new 
ERP system. In production operations, 
the benefits from the work done are 
being reflected in improved operational 
performance metrics such as on time 
delivery, first pass quality and 
productivity and production lead 
time improvements. 
The programme also achieved excellent 
financial results in 201 1 realising 
£25m of annualised year-on-year 
efficiency savings, ahead of the £21m 
savings planned. These savings were 
achieved at a cost in the year of £39m, 
well below the previously expected 
cost of £46m. Cumulative gross costs 
incurred on the programme to the end 
of the year were £62m.
Building on the considerable financial 
and operational success of the 
programme, the Group intends to 
expand the scope of Excellence in 
Delivery, including additional scope 
for supply chain improvements, with 
phasing such that significant additional 
benefits will be seen in 2013. As a result, 
the Group now estimates that the run 
rate of efficiency savings at the end of 
2013 will increase from £65m to £75m, 
at an unchanged total cost of £131m. 
In 2012, work will continue to 
consolidate and reinforce the 
production process improvements in 
the principal locations along with further 
work on engineering and supply chain 
processes. Design of the ERP system 
will be completed and four more site 
integrations will be undertaken to build 
further scale and deliver additional 
benefits. By the end of 2012, a further 
£8m of annualised, year-on-year 
efficiency savings are expected to be 
achieved, with the programme benefits 
and costs remaining in line with the 
original plan.
Portfolio optimisation
Cobham continues to have a robust 
balance sheet, good cash generation 
and a pipeline of attractive technology 
acquisitions, with focus maintained on 
existing markets, enabling it to build 
further scale and capabilities. 
In addition, the Excellence in Delivery 
programme gives Cobham an 
enhanced capability to more efficiently 
integrate acquisitions and generate 
cost synergies from them. Cobham 
remains determined only to undertake 
strategically attractive transactions 
where these satisfy its financial criteria 
and disciplined investment approach.
Consistent with its strategy, Cobham has 
invested up to US$280m on acquisitions 
before working capital adjustments in 
201 1, with the performance of these 
acquisitions in the year accretive to 
EPS and consistent with plan.
Cobham has continued to make 
good progress in its strategy to focus 
on markets where it has scale and 
differentiation. To this end and as 
previously announced, Cobham 
completed the planned divestment 
of the non-core Analytic Solutions 
business in November 201 1 for 
US$350m. Good progress is also 
being made on the divestment of 
the remaining non-core businesses,  
with Cobham MAL Limited having 
been divested in December 201 1.

I
Cobham operates in three key markets: 
US defence/security, accounting for 
44% of core revenue, non US defence/
security and commercial, each 
accounting for 28% of core revenue. 
In the US defence/security market 
while significant uncertainty remains, 
the US Government is making some 
progress towards developing a 
sustainable 10 year plan. At the end 
of 201 1, the President signed the 2012 
defence budget, containing flat year on 
year base budget investment accounts, 
without the prolonged delay in agreeing 
the prior year budget. The 2013 
Presidential base budget request is 
broadly consistent with 2012, although 
with investment accounts 4% lower. In 
addressing the significant budgetary 
demands, the Secretary of Defense has 
put forward plans for a modest increase 
in the base budget up to 201 7 . Strategic 
defence priorities have also been 
formally reiterated with continued focus 
on a number of key areas, including 
investment in special operations forces, 
unmanned systems and electronics. 
These priorities overlap significantly 
with Cobham’s capabilities and should 
enable the Group to outperform the 
defence market over the medium term. 
In addition to strong positions on legacy 
platforms, which also have significant 
export and upgrade potential, such as 
the F-16 and the F-18 fighter aircraft, the 
V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the Predator/
Reaper unmanned aerial system, the 
Group has successfully positioned itself 
on important future growth platforms 
including substantial content on the 
KC-46A aerial refuelling tanker aircraft 
and the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter. 
The Group also has a strong position on 
the F-35 multi-role fighter aircraft and 
while expected production increases 
have been slowed, this aircraft retains 
its significant potential for growth over 
the medium term. 
The Group’s non US defence/security 
markets have good potential due 
to Cobham’s breadth of geographic 
reach and presence on a wide range 
of platforms and programmes. This 
enables it to balance continued 
budgetary pressures, particularly in 
Europe, with a focus on exports to 
faster growing geographies such 
as India, Brazil, the Gulf Cooperation 
Council countries in the Middle East 
and parts of South East Asia, where 
sustained growth in defence/security 
budgets is expected. The Group 
has strong, established positions on 
non US platforms with good export 
potential such as the A330MRTT 
aircraft, the Eurofighter Typhoon 
fighter aircraft and the NH90 utility 
helicopter. This export driven strategy 
delivered progress in the year with 
important awards on the Brazilian 
KC-390 aerial refuelling tanker aircraft 
and on the Eurocopter EC1 75 and 
NH90 utility helicopters. 
Cobham’s commercial markets have 
good growth prospects, being driven 
by large jet, helicopter and general 
aviation production and the marine 
SATCOM market, which has exposure 
primarily to the oil and gas market and 
commercial shipping. Cobham also has 
specialist aviation markets in Australia, 
with a number of significant customers 
in the resources industry there. Rising 
passenger numbers, demand for more 
fuel efficient aircraft and for improved 
aviation and marine communication 
products is expected to drive growth in 
Cobham’s markets. Production at Airbus 
and Boeing is expected to grow strongly 
in 2012 and Cobham has good positions 
on recently launched platforms with 
increasing production rates, such as 
the Boeing 787 , for which deliveries 
are expected to increase from three 
aircraft in 201 1 to around 40 aircraft 
in 2012, and the Airbus A380 for which 
deliveries are expected to increase from 
26 aircraft to 32 aircraft. Cobham has 
also continued to achieve new awards 
in its commercial aviation markets in 
the year, including on the new French 
Skylander commuter aircraft and the 
Chinese COMAC C919 passenger aircraft. 
In the marine market, Cobham was 
chosen by Inmarsat as launch partner on 
its new Global Xpress broadband service.
BUILDING LEADING MARKET POSITIONS IN SELECTED FASTER GROWTH 
MARKETS WITH A HIGH TECHNOLOGY FOCUS

Business overview
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
OUR MARKETS TECHNOLOGY IN ACTION
Many of Cobham’s capabilities improve 
communication and keep people safe, 
which is a common requirement across 
the Group’s defence/security and 
commercial markets. This is why 
Cobham’s technology can often be 
adapted from one market to the next, 
e.g. commercial to defence/security 
and from one domain to another, 
e.g. aerospace to land. 
Commercial aircraft, fighters, satellites 
and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are 
some of the most expensive real estate 
in the world, so the ability to provide 
greater functionality with a smaller 
footprint or size, lower weight and better 
power characteristics will remain key 
discriminators. This is often referred to 
as SWaP – size, weight and power.
As energy costs increase, customers are 
constantly looking for superior technical 
performance coupled with lower weight 
and drag. They are also interested in the 
total cost of ownership, so factors such 
as the ease of installation and the 
degree of maintenance and support 
required are also major considerations, 
especially as many platforms are in 
service for decades. The following 
examples illustrate just a few of the 
innovative products that Cobham has 
developed that meet these demands.
Airborne SATCOM
Cobham’s top of the range SATCOM 
antenna provides broadband 
connectivity into aircraft via satellite. 
It enables both cabin and cockpit 
connectivity, allowing passengers to stay 
connected to the internet during flight, 
as well as providing enhanced cockpit 
communications and data services. The 
system is up to half the weight of and a 
third smaller than competitor antennas, 
which is why 40 airlines and other 
customers have already selected the 
system, which according to one aircraft 
manufacturer, will save it some 
US$24,000 per aircraft per year.
The Group’s latest generation SATCOM 
system, the SB200 shown below, 
combines two antennas into one, 
simplifying installation, weighing less 
than 1½ pounds (0.68 Kgs). It provides 
a 20 fold increase in speed over 
comparable competitive systems, 
bringing email and internet functionality 
at an affordable price to operators  
of smaller jets and turboprops.
Ceramic Oxygen Generating 
System (COGS)
Shown below is Cobham’s patented, 
unique ceramic membrane oxygen 
generating technology that produces 
high purity oxygen suitable for military, 
medical and aviation applications. It is 
unique because the oxygen generation 
process is solid state with no moving 
parts. Instead of filling and shipping 
multiple cylinders of oxygen, the 
Cobham system generates oxygen at 
the point where it is used, eliminating 
the need for delivery and storage. The 
technology has been demonstrated 
in Afghanistan, where aircrews normally 
get 100% pure liquid oxygen by air or 
road transport, which is dangerous 
and costly.

IP Mesh Radios
Radio and Audio Integration 
Management System (RAIMS)
For more than a decade, Cobham has 
been investing in the development of 
a highly integrated, space saving Radio 
and Audio Integration Management 
System (RAIMS). The system enables 
aircrew to control many of an aircraft’s 
communications, navigation and 
data-link systems through a single 
integrated interface, lowering pilot 
workload and saving weight and space 
in the cockpit. As the image opposite 
illustrates, the size, weight and power 
of the system have been considerably 
reduced as well as the cabling 
and installation costs associated 
with the number of boxes or units 
in each system.
IP Mesh Radios
Since their launch in 2009, Internet 
Protocol (IP) Mesh radios or nodes 
have been widely used in both law 
enforcement and commercial 
applications including large sporting 
events, where the flexibility of a fluid 
self-healing mesh communications 
network, combined with non-line of 
sight characteristics, have made them 
market leaders.
The latest generation of wireless 
video links, incorporates dual channel 
technology and high definition pictures, 
enabling video, audio and Global 
Positioning System (GPS) information  
to be transmitted over a much greater 
range – which can be in excess of 
30kms. This technology will be used by 
a number of TV broadcast channels and 
other customers at the 2012 Olympics.
The image opposite shows that in the 
space of three years the weight of each 
unit has been reduced by 85%, power 
usage by 50% and the physical space 
each unit takes up is down by 90%. This 
product family has potential airborne, 
fixed and ground mobile security 
applications, as well as commercial 
marine applications for early threat 
detection on gas and oil wells.

The Board closely monitors progress made against 
the Group’s five strategic objectives with the aid of 
a scorecard of financial and non-financial metrics, 
and this scorecard is regularly updated and 
reviewed. Cobham considers the most important 
of these scorecard metrics to be its Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). 
The Group’s KPIs have been set out on page 1 3 and 
each one has been cross-referenced to the relevant 
strategic objectives on pages 12 and 1 3 and to a 
further specified page where performance in the 
year is described in more detail. 
The Remuneration Committee has also linked total 
compensation with the achievement of specific 
and measurable progress against Key Performance 
Indicators, both as individually specified financial 
targets and within personal objectives. This 
ensures that employee performance is aligned 
with the achievement of the Group’s strategic 
objectives and with shareholder expectations. 
The Directors’ remuneration report on pages 44 
to 53 sets out Cobham’s remuneration policy 
and its application in more detail.

OUR STRATEGY
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS This is what Excellence in Delivery, combined with 
our talent development programmes are all about. 
It’s about enabling all our employees to do what 
they do best, delighting customers by improving 
quality and on time delivery and shortening 
product lead times. 
Deliver operational 
excellence
Cobham wants to develop and hold a top 
three market position by building and maintaining 
scale to support future investment in people 
and technology. Cobham needs to have enough 
scale in its markets to have the financial muscle 
or credibility that customers look for in what 
is a very long term industry.
Build sustainable 
scale positions
The strategy is to acquire businesses that deliver 
technologies or capabilities that will help the 
Group build scale in its chosen markets, accelerate 
growth and increase shareholder value. Cobham 
has successfully acquired some 50 companies in 
the past decade investing around £1.5 billion, so 
this is very much part of the strategy. The Group 
has also sold businesses to keep focused on 
markets where we have scale and differentiation.

organic decline of 3%. 
Many of the Division’s 
commercial businesses 
continued to improve 
but this was offset by 
some defence/security 
businesses, where there 
was lower land based 
vehicle intercoms revenue 
and reduced shipments 
of surveillance equipment,

from this complex task. 
It could pave the way

GROUP ORDER INTAKE 
£2,046m
(2010: £1,799m)
Technology investment 
Cobham has a unique set of 
differentiated technologies with 
leading positions in all its core markets. 
Maintaining the Group’s technical 
differentiation is central to Cobham’s 
strategy and total R&D investment in 
the core businesses was £128.9m 
(2010: £124.8m). It has invested £69.8m 
(2010: £68.8m) in PV, representing 5.2% 
(2010: 5.0%) of revenue.
Cobham’s intention, as investment 
opportunities present themselves, is to 
increase PV over time which will drive 
future revenue and profitability as new 
or improved products and services are 
brought to market.
Trading profit
Group trading profit increased to 
£364.9m (2010: £348.4m), with trading 
profit in the core businesses increasing 
to £340.4m (2010: £312. 1m). Trading 
profit in the non-core businesses 
declined to £24.5m (2010: £36.3m). 
The Group’s underlying trading 
margin increased to 19.7% (2010: 
18.3%). The margin in the core businesses 
increased to 20.8% (2010: 19. 1%), driven 
by Excellence in Delivery and other 
cost savings. 
Underlying net finance expense
The underlying net finance expense 
was £37 .0m (2010: £42.3m). The net 
interest expense on cash and debt 
holdings, held primarily in US dollars, 
reduced to £38.2m (2010: £40.6m). 
As anticipated, there was a non-cash, 
net finance income of £1.2m 
(2010: £1.7m expense) from pension 
schemes. This item is expected to 
be an expense of £2.0m in 2012.
Underlying profit before tax
The Group’s underlying profit before 
tax increased by 7% to £327.9m 
(2010: £306.1m).
Refer to page 24 for a reconciliation 
of operating profit, profit before 
taxation and profit after taxation

Results 
Orders
Group order intake in the year increased 
to £2,045.7m (2010: £1,798.9m), 
representing 16% growth at constant 
translation exchange rates. Group 
book-to-bill in the year was 1. 10 times. 
Excluding Aviation Services, where 
order intake can be uneven due to its 
significant, long-term programmes, and 
the non-core businesses, book-to-bill 
was 1.05 times. 
At the year end, the Group order book 
was £2.5bn (2010: £2.5bn), including 
£1. 1bn (2010: £1. 1bn) for the Aviation 
Services business. At constant translation 
exchange rates and excluding the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals, the order 
book increased 7% on the prior year.
Revenue
Group revenue of £1,854.4m (2010: 
£1,902.6m) was adversely impacted 
by US dollar exchange rates and a 
net reduction from the impact of 
acquisitions and disposals. Organic 
growth, as anticipated, was marginally 
negative at -0.6%, due to the performance 
of the non-core businesses, principally 
Analytic Solutions which has now been 
divested. However, in the core businesses 
organic revenue increased 0.3%. 
US defence/security revenue in the core 
businesses was down 7%, in a year when 
US Department of Defense investment 
outlays declined 10%. Non US defence/
security revenue increased 5% driven 
by aerial refuelling and electronic 
subsystems exports. Commercial revenue 
increased 10%, benefiting from increased 
flying activity for Australian resource 
industry customers, increased Boeing and 
Airbus production and revenue from the 
sale of SA TCOM antennas to a range of 
aerospace and marine customers.

Economic profit
Economic profit is considered to be 
an important measure for the Group as 
a whole and for each of its Divisions, as 
it demonstrates that returns exceed the 
full cost of investing in assets. Cobham 
achieved economic profit of £198.4m 
in the year (2010: £185. 1m).
Economic profit is defined as trading 
profit less an asset charge which reflects 
the Group’s pre-tax weighted average 
cost of capital and which is applied to 
the capital invested in the business. 
This investment includes acquired 
goodwill, other tangible and intangible 
fixed assets and working capital.
Taxation
On an underlying basis, the Group’s 
effective tax rate decreased to 25.5% 
(2010: 26.5%), in part due to the lower 
UK tax rate. The effective tax rate is 
calculated by dividing the Group’s 
underlying tax charge of £81.2m (£79.5m) 
by its underlying profit before tax of 
£318.5m (2010: £300. 1m), which is stated 
after excluding the £9.4m (2010: £6.0m) 
share of post-tax results of joint ventures.
It is anticipated that in 201 2 the effective 
underlying tax rate will decrease by at 
least a further 1% point, in part due to 
a decrease in the UK tax rate.
Earnings per share (EPS) 
Underlying EPS increased 1 2.0% to 22.05 
pence (2010: 19.68 pence), driven by the 
improvement in the trading margin. 
The £150m share buy-back programme, 
completed in November, increased EPS 
by 3%. At constant translation exchange 
rates underlying EPS increased 12.6%.
In addition to the above, basic EPS was 
higher than the comparable period at 
16.8 pence (2010: 1 3.3 pence), in part 
due to £23.8m (2010: £1.0m) of post-tax 
business divestments and similar income 
and £3.9m of post-tax insurance income 
(2010: £18.7m expense) from a prior 
year settlement of a commercial 
dispute. Reducing basic EPS were post-tax 
business restructuring charges (primarily 
Excellence in Delivery) of £22.0m (2010: 
£9.4m), which are stated net of the profit 
on sale of a site in California, USA, 
post-tax debt and interest rate swap 
cancellation costs relating to original 
financing of a divested business of £1 1.3m 
(2010: £nil) and some smaller items.
Dividends 
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 6.20 pence (2010: 4.372 
pence). Together with an interim 
dividend of 1.80 pence (2010: 1.628 
pence), which was paid on 1 1 November 
201 1, this will result in a total dividend of 
8.0 pence (2010: 6.0 pence) per share, an 
increase of 33% on the prior year. The 
full year dividend is 2.8 times covered by 
underlying EPS, with dividend payments 
in the year covered 4. 1 times by free 
cash flow generated. The 2012 interim 
dividend will be rebalanced to reflect the 
normal split between interim and full 
year dividend. 
The shares will be traded ex-dividend 
on 2 May 2012. The dividend is payable 
on 1 June 2012 to all shareholders on 
the register at 4 May 2012, subject to 
shareholder approval.
The fixed cumulative preferential 
dividend payment on the 6 per cent, 
second cumulative preference shares 
of £1 each has been approved by the 
Board at the rate of 6.0 pence per 
share (2010: 6.0 pence). The dividend in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 
201 1 will be paid on 1 June 2012 to 
all shareholders on the register at 
4 May 2012.
Share buy-back
The Group completed its share buy-back 
programme of up to £1 50m in November. 
A total of 76m shares, representing 6.6% 
of the issued ordinary share capital have 
been purchased for £150m, excluding 
transaction costs, and held in treasury.

At the close of business on 31 December 
201 1, there were 1,079m (31 December 
2010: 1, 155m) ordinary shares in issue, 
excluding the shares held in treasury. 
The weighted average number of shares 
in the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders was 1, 1 18m (31 December 
2010: 1, 151m) or 1, 121m (31 December 
2010: 1, 157m) on a diluted basis.
Acquisitions and divestments
Cobham divested the non-core Analytic 
Solutions business for US$350m in 
November 201 1 and the Engineering 
Consultancy business in February 201 1 
for £13.5m. In addition, Cobham MAL 
Limited, part of the remaining non-core 
businesses, was divested for a nominal 
sum in December 201 1.
The Group acquired Telerob GmbH 
(Telerob) for €78m in January 201 1, and 
Corp Ten International Inc. in February 
201 1 for up to US$24m. These businesses 
complement existing capabilities in 
Cobham’s homeland security markets. 
In October 201 1, Trivec-Avant 
Corporation was purchased for up 
to US$144m, bringing with it industry 
leading SATCOM capabilities that 
align with Cobham’s Antenna 
Systems business.
Cash flow
Operating cash flow, which is stated after 
capital expenditure but before interest 
and tax payments, was £337 . 1m (2010: 
£271.4m). Cash flow benefited from a 
decrease in working capital and lower 
net capital expenditure of £49.8m (2010: 
£57 . 1m). Operating cash conversion was 
strong at 94.8% (2010: 79.3%) of trading 
profit, before the Group’s share of 
post-tax results of joint ventures. 
After net interest and tax payments 
and the receipt of dividends from joint 
ventures, the Group generated excellent 
free cash flow of £287 .9m (2010: 
£218.6m), from which it paid dividends 
of £69.4m (2010: £64.6m) and £159.5m 
(2010: £7 . 1m inflow) on share purchases, 
of which £150m (2010: nil) related to 
the share buy-back programme.
In addition, the Group made £37 .0m 
(2010: £13.4m) of payments relating 
to Excellence in Delivery and received 
net proceeds of £77 . 1m (2010: £34.7m 
outflow) relating to acquisitions and 
divestments and other items.
Treasury
The Group’s treasury activities are 
managed centrally by the Group 
Treasury function, which reports 
to the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Treasury function operates within 
written policies and delegation levels 
that have been approved by the Board. 
It is the Group’s policy that trading 
in financial instruments is used only 
for risk management purposes.
Net debt and financing
At the year end, the balance of free 
cash flow was used to reduce net debt, 
comprising short term cash balances 
and fixed term borrowings, after funding 
and exchange movements, to £232.5m 
(2010: £326. 1m). The net cash inflow in 
the year was partly offset by movements 
in exchange rates included above of 
£5.5m, as it is the Group’s policy to hold 
a significant proportion of its borrowings 
in foreign currency, principally US dollars, 
as a natural hedge against assets and 
earnings denominated in those currencies.
The Group’s year end gearing position 
had fallen to approximately 0.5 times 
net debt/EBITDA with robust net interest 
cover at 10 times (2010: nine times).
Included within net debt are sterling 
cash deposits, as well as US dollar 
denominated borrowings, which 
are held for the reasons described in 
the section on foreign exchange that 
follows. At 31 December 201 1 the Group 
held total cash and short term bank 
deposits, all with an original maturity 
of three months or less of £345.6m 
(31 December 2010: £473.0m).
The Group’s principal borrowings include:
• A £300m multi-currency credit 
agreement that expires in July 2012. 
Interest is payable at the applicable 
LIBOR rate of the drawn currencies 
plus margin, of which £100.4m 
(2010: £275.4m) had been drawn down 
under this agreement at the year end
• US$1 70m of senior notes maturing 
in October 2012 with a 5.58% coupon
• US$315m of senior notes maturing in 
tranches in 2014, 2016 and 2019 with 
an average coupon of 6.67%
• US$105m of senior notes maturing 
in 2018, with an interest rate at the 
applicable LIBOR rate plus margin

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED A new forward starting US$360m 
multi-currency revolving credit 
agreement was signed in October 201 1 
to replace the existing £300m facility. 
The new facility is available from April 
2012 and matures in October 2016, 
with a lender’s option to extend for 
up to two years. Interest is payable 
at LIBOR plus margin. 
Further details on the Group’s 
borrowings are given in note 19 
to the Group financial statements.
Foreign exchange
The Group has identified volatility in 
foreign exchange rates as one of its 
principal risks (see contract risk and 
execution – page 29) with the Group’s 
aim being to reduce, or eliminate 
whenever practical, transaction foreign 
exchange risk, of which the pound 
sterling/US dollar exchange rate is the 
most important. Primarily this is because 
many global aerospace and defence 
contracts are denominated in US dollars. 
Additionally, translation exposure arises 
on the earnings of operating companies 
largely based in the USA, partly offset by 
dollar denominated interest costs.
The average and closing US$/£ exchange 
rates in the year are as follows:
US$/£ 2011 2010
Average rate 1.60 1.55
Year end rate 1.55 1.57
All foreign exchange hedging 
transactions are approved under 
delegated authority from the Board. 
A number of financial instruments are 
used to manage transactional foreign 
exchange exposure, such as forward 
rate contracts. The Group has a policy 
of hedging at least 80% of estimated 
transactional exposure for the next 
12 months, a proportion of exposures 
between 12 and 36 months and firm 
exposures on long term contracts. 
Details of the most significant of these 
instruments are described in notes 
23 and 25 of the Notes to the Group 
financial statements. Some 93% of the 
Group’s anticipated exposure to the 
US dollar in the Group’s UK subsidiaries 
is hedged for 2012 at an average rate 
of US$1.59.
With respect to translation exposure, 
the Group generally funds the acquisition 
of overseas companies using borrowings 
denominated in the same currency. 
This serves to hedge acquired assets 
with liabilities in the same currency 
and provides partial hedging 
of currency denominated profits 
through the interest line. 
Interest rates
The Group has various long and short 
term borrowings at both fixed and 
floating rates of interest. The Group 
continually monitors its exposure to 
movements in interest rates to bring 
greater stability and certainty to 
borrowing costs, with the policy being 
to assess the proportion of borrowings 
that are fixed and floating in the 
context of prevailing market conditions. 
Throughout 2011, the Group’s exposure 
to floating rates of interest on its 
borrowings was predominantly 
converted to fixed rate exposure 
through the use of interest rate swaps. 
Note 25 of the Group financial 
statements on page 95 gives more 
details on the financial risks facing  
the Group.
Retirement obligations
The Group operates a number of 
defined benefit schemes, the most 
significant being the Cobham Pension 
Plan. At 31 December 201 1, the 
estimated shortfall for accounting 
purposes between the value of the 
defined benefit schemes’ assets and 
the present value of the future liabilities 
had reduced since the previous year end 
to £71.2m before deferred tax (2010: 
£82.0m, H1 201 1: £68.3m). The biggest 
elements of this decrease were: 
• An actuarial loss of £40.6m, which 
related almost entirely to a fall in the 
value of scheme assets in the year;
• Employer contributions made in 
excess of the service cost (net 
employer funding) of £48.8m. In part, 
these contributions relate to the 
purchase of insurance contracts 
which effectively de-risk liabilities 
in two of the Group’s schemes.
A table setting out the principal 
movements in the deficit during 
the year is as follows:
£m
Pension deficit at  
1 January 201 1 (82.0)
Interest income 1.2
Actuarial loss (40.6)
Net employer funding 48.8
Gain on business divestment 1.4
Pension deficit at  
31 December 201 1 (71.2)
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes have been closed to new 
entrants since 2003, with alternative 
defined contribution schemes offered 
in all cases. Cobham remains committed 
to the support of the pension schemes 
within the Group and continues to work 
with the trustees of those schemes 
to ensure that net deficit issues are 
managed appropriately.
Further details on the Group’s retirement 
benefit schemes, the amounts recognised 
in operating profit and the changes in 
value of defined benefit schemes during 
the year is given in note 24 to the Group 
financial statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance 
and position are set out in the business 
overview on pages 14 to 21 and the 
principal risks on page 28. In addition, 
notes 23 and 25 of the Notes to the 
Group financial statements include 
the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, 
financial risk management, details 
of financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposure to credit, 
liquidity and other risks.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources together with long term 
contracts with a number of customers 
across different geographic areas. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully, despite the 
current economic outlook.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, 
the Directors have formed a judgement 
at the time of approving the financial 
statements that it is their expectation 
that the Company and the Group as 
a whole have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Group and parent 
company financial statements.

details are set out on page 42.
Cobham’s Risk Committee, which is 
an executive committee, is responsible 
for overseeing execution of the risk 
management framework throughout 
the Group. The process for monitoring 
and controlling risk, illustrated below, 
emphasises continuous evaluation and 
monitoring by Divisional Presidents, 
together with their respective 
management teams, including business 
unit management. The risk framework 
is structured to ensure that risks are

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
PRINCIPAL RISKS Principal risks
Risk Description/Context Impact/Sensitivity Mitigation/Comment
Inability 
to attract 
and retain 
staff with 
appropriate 
levels of skills 
and talent
The success of the Group’s 
investment in technology and 
the ability to build and maintain 
scale positions in our chosen 
markets are dependent on our 
ability to attract and retain the 
appropriate talent and skills.
Without the appropriate 
quality and quantity of skills 
throughout the organisation 
it would be increasingly 
difficult to execute the 
strategy and grow.
In order to attract and retain the appropriate skills, the 
Group has rigorous talent management plans and an effective 
appraisal system. It provides competitive compensation 
packages that incentivise desired behaviours (see page 45).
A dedicated careers website and team are focused on 
recruiting people in the UK and USA.
The Group ensures work for employees is challenging 
and rewarding and is increasing participation in Group-wide, 
coordinated development and training programmes 
(see page 56). 
The Group is pursuing a ‘zero harm’ Safety, Health 
and Environment (S|H|E) she strategy (see page 30).
Contract risk  
and execution
The Group designs and 
assembles products and 
engages in services that are 
often custom built, utilising 
complex technologies, under 
fixed price contracts. This gives 
rise to specific risks, including 
cost overruns, foreign exchange 
and inflation risks.
A failure to anticipate and 
resolve technical problems, 
estimate and control costs 
and offset inflationary 
pressures can result in 
schedule and cost overruns. 
Also, failure to mitigate risk by 
underestimating the contract 
may mean potential exposure 
to penalties, claims 
and warranties. 
To mitigate contract risk, a thorough review of terms and 
conditions prior to signing ensures contract provisions are 
fully understood and risks fairly allocated between parties.
Execution risk is mitigated through rigorous application of the 
Group’s Life Cycle Management process to all bids, contracts 
and development projects, with independent assessment 
and meaningful metrics applied through project reviews, 
design reviews and phase reviews. 
The Group also continually reviews and manages (including 
hedging) inflation and exchange rate risks (see page 95).
Deterioration 
in the macro 
economic 
environment 
adversely 
impacting our 
core markets
The Group’s revenue is derived 
from global commercial, 
defence and security markets. 
The level and type of spending 
is dependent on a complex 
mix of macroeconomic, fiscal 
and strategic defence and 
security imperatives.
A change in global growth 
rates or changes in 
government spending 
priorities, which could lead to 
changes in market growth and 
programme terminations or 
delays, or a fundamental shift 
in how customers procure 
products or services, could 
have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s future results.
The Group mitigates this risk through targeted PV investment 
on products and services that are priorities for our customers 
(see page 7). 
Market developments, order intake trends and order book 
cover are reviewed monthly to enable action to be taken, 
including cost control measures.
The successful completion of the Excellence in Delivery 
programme, which will enable Cobham to optimise its market 
positions, will give a standardised operating framework, and 
transform operating performance. 
The Group is increasing the level of business in higher growth 
geographic markets such as India, Brazil, parts of the Middle 
East and Asia (see page 9).
The Group is looking for opportunities to grow its commercial 
business to provide an appropriate balance between the 
Group’s defence/security and commercial end markets. 
Failure 
to comply 
with laws, 
regulations and 
restrictions
The Group must comply with 
numerous domestic and 
international laws, regulations 
and restrictions. Cobham 
operates in a highly regulated 
environment and is subject 
to the laws, regulations 
and restrictions of many 
jurisdictions, including those 
of the US, the UK and other 
countries. Among other things, 
these include import and 
export controls, government 
contracting rules and anti-
bribery provisions, as well as 
applicable S|H|E legislation.
Sanctions for failure by the 
Group, or its sales agents, 
or others acting on its behalf 
to comply with these laws, 
regulations and restrictions 
could include fines, penalties, 
suspension or debarment 
of the Group from future 
government contracts for a 
period of time. Such sanctions 
could have an impact on the 
Group‘s financial position and 
future operations.
Cobham continues to enhance compliance processes across 
the Group. These include numerous policies and procedures 
which are regularly reviewed, including procedures related to 
the use of sales and marketing representatives, anti-bribery 
and corruption, gifts and hospitality, whistle blowing and 
investigation of ethics and compliance concerns.
Mandatory training is undertaken on a variety of compliance 
related subjects including US Government contracting, and 
anti-bribery and corruption. 
Cobham has reviewed and strengthened procedures in the 
light of the Bribery Act 2010 and is currently pursuing a ‘zero 
harm’ strategy for S|H|E (see page 30).

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 IDENTIFYING COBHAM’S CURRENT TALENT POOL AND 
DEVELOPING A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ITS FUTURE 
REQUIREMENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STRATEGIC 
WORKFORCE PLANNING CYCLE
HIGHLIGHTS
 Benchmarking shows 
Cobham is a competitive 
employer and connecting 
well with potential 
recruits
 Energy (electricity, natural 
gas and heating oil) and 
resource use improved
 Number and severity 
of health and safety

requirements of UK 
Bribery Act
Cobham’s corporate responsibility 
and sustainability approach adds 
shareholder value
To be successful and sustainable in its 
chosen markets Cobham must attract 
and retain the most talented people, 
improve operating efficiency, manage 
risk and protect reputation through 
striving for a strong environmental, 
social and governance culture. 
Developing good quality 
relationships with key stakeholders
Cobham’s goal is to link its key 
stakeholder issues with shareholder 
value through its strategy and 
operational performance. To develop 
this approach Cobham has joined 
Business in the Community and 
participated in the Corporate 
Responsibility Index to benchmark 
its progress. As part of this process 
Cobham is developing the management 
of its corporate responsibility and 
sustainability activities into a structured 
continuous improvement system 
that will facilitate management in the 
implementation of key programmes 
and initiatives.
The Group also intends to continue to 
participate in key investor surveys from 
EIRiS, Carbon Disclosure Project and 
Bloomberg. To supplement this, 
performance data and publicly disclosed 
policies will be made available on the 
corporate responsibility section of the 
Cobham website.
As part of an industry initiative, Cobham 
is also participating in the development 
of standardised supply chain metrics and 
will be well placed to cooperate as they 
are cascaded through the supply chain. 
A focus on learning and 
development to deliver the 
workforce of the future
Delivering Cobham’s strategy 
requires a focus on talent, an 
area in which Cobham has already 
made good progress.
Identifying Cobham’s current talent pool 
and developing a clear understanding 
of its future requirement is an essential 
part of the Strategic Workforce Planning 
cycle, with review of some functional 
areas completed. 
T o fill the gap between future 
requirement and current capability, 
Cobham is developing in-house 
talent and attracting new talent. A 
benchmarked review has shown Cobham 
is competitive and connecting well with 
potential recruits. Cobham has developed 
its ‘Innovators with Insight’ employer 
brand and over 1 1,000 applications have 
been managed via the new applicant 
tracking system and careers website. 
Cobham’s Performance and Development 
Review process develops its in-house 
talent. The momentum behind Cobham’s 
development programmes has been 
maintained, with over 70% of participants 
in the Senior Development Programme 
assuming bigger roles. In 201 1, 1 3 high 
performing graduates completed the 
Graduate Development Programme 
and moved into their first permanent 
positions. The award winning 
apprenticeship programme now covers 
all the largest UK engineering locations. 
Creating a better place to work
Developing a strong safety, health and 
environment mindset supports the goals 
of developing an ethical business culture 
and attracting and retaining talent, 
improving operating efficiency and the 
community licence to operate. Cobham 
has set itself a goal to pursue ‘zero harm’ 
– zero work-related fatalities, injuries 
and illnesses – and to minimise its 
impact on the environment wherever 
possible. This is a challenging goal but is 
achievable through embedding the right 
attitudes, behaviours and competencies. 
Cobham has implemented a 
standardised approach including a 
three-tiered management performance 
framework to drive continuous 
improvement. All business units were 
set a target to achieve the foundation

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY Above/below
Cobham Aviation Services based at Bournemouth 
International Airport in the UK, installed sunpipes into 
upgraded hangar facilities to improve the working 
environment for employees and reduce energy 
consumption. The carbon footprint reduction is estimated 
at 16 tonnes of carbon over five years for a system that 
requires no maintenance and has a guarantee of 10 years. 
level of our performance framework: 
76% achieved the first level and 14% 
achieved higher levels. Leading safety 
and environmental indicators, a 
management scorecard and a set of 
best practice technical standards were 
also rolled out to help reach the ‘zero 
harm’ goal. Cobham recorded zero 
fatalities and reduced the number 
and severity of lost time accidents. 
Consumption of electricity, natural 
gas and heating oil as well as the 
generation of waste materials were 
reduced at Cobham’s facilities. However, 
an increase in operational flying hours 
for customers combined with an increase 
in business travel (due to changes in 
customer geographies) and improved 
reporting practices contributed to higher 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Going forward, the focus will be on 
embedding the standards, performance 
management systems and processes 
to drive continuous improvement in 
the safety, health and environmental 
aspects of Cobham’s operations, 
activities, products and services. 
Particular areas of focus will include 
employee wellbeing, energy efficiency 
and resource efficiency.
Pursuing the highest 
ethical standards
Cobham’s goal is to maintain a strong 
business ethics culture that will 
minimise liability, manage risk and 
protect reputation in an increasingly 
regulated and complex global 
marketplace. 
Cobham recognises the importance 
of setting the tone from the top. 
The executive-level Business Ethics 
& Compliance Committee oversees 
the ethics and compliance 
programme. It sets out the policies 
and management standards and 
oversees ethics investigations and 
compliance concerns. The Group 
Executive discusses monthly reports, 
which include updates on ethics and 
compliance cases raised and training, 
with updates at each Board meeting.
31
Business overview
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 The ethics and compliance programme 
is based around the key principles 
of prevent, detect and respond:
Prevent – This includes a range of 
measures to help prevent ethics and 
compliance issues from occurring.
Training – Employees are provided with 
sessions on business and compliance 
issues, including ethical awareness, 
contracting with the United States 
government, international trade 
compliance and with the introduction 
of the UK Bribery Act 2010, anti-bribery 
and corruption. Business Unit Ethics 
and Compliance Officers ensure timely 
completion of employee training: 
99% of employees completed required 
Ethical Awareness training and 97% 
of employees completed anti-bribery 
and corruption training.
Company policies and procedures have 
been updated for emerging issues, such 
as the UK Bribery Act. Cobham has 
revised its Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy, including robust processes to 
manage third parties.
‘Canteen’ kids fly high
Cobham Aviation Services in 
Adelaide, Australia provided 
a BAe 146 to fly 65 youngsters, 
on 13 August 2011, to the 
heart of Australia, to Uluru 
(previously Ayers Rock), where 
they were able to get together 
with other ‘Canteen’ kids from 
Darwin and Alice Springs at 
the Uluru Voyages resort for 
the weekend.
Canteen is an organisation for 
young people living with cancer 
and the event was designed to 
allow the children to develop 
peer support networks that 
will help them through their 
cancer journey.

Detect and respond – Cobham ensures 
the early detection and response of 
ethics and compliance issues and these 
are dealt with swiftly and effectively. 
Employees are actively encouraged 
to use a free and confidential ethics 
helpline, which is available 24 hours a 
day, with a formal investigation process 
into ethical and compliance concerns. 
Data verification 
Cobham collects data annually on 
all key corporate responsibility and 
sustainability KPIs from its wholly-
owned operational subsidiaries. This 
excludes Cobham’s joint ventures 
which are not under operational control, 
sites with less than 5 people, sites leased 
to tenants, vacant properties being 
disposed of, and any business units 
that have been closed or divested 
during the course of the year for which 
there is less than six months of reported 
data. During 2011 divestments included 
Cobham Analytic Solutions in the 
US and Cobham MAL Ltd in the UK. 
However, as these business units were 
divested within Q4 they have been 
included to provide a more complete 
representation of energy use and 
greenhouse gas emissions. Data for 
Cobham Analytic Solutions was 
reported up to 1 November 2011 and 
pro-rated to the transaction completion 
date whilst data for Cobham MAL Ltd 
was based on 2010 data normalised by 
turnover and pro-rated for the duration 
of 2011 ownership.
100% of Cobham’s wholly-owned 
operations by turnover have been 
reviewed internally to identify 
omissions and significant variations 
(i.e. 5%) from the preceding year. 
Cobham has commissioned an external 
assurance provider, ERM, to provide 
limited assurance of its 2011 carbon 
data (i.e. Scope 1 and 2) as presented 
in the table opposite. The assurance 
statement will be made available on 
the corporate responsibility section 
of Cobham’s website.

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 35 This part of the Annual Report, together 
with the Directors’ remuneration report 
set out on pages 44 to 53, describes how 
the Company has applied and complied 
with the principles contained in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published 
in June 2010 (the Code). The Code is 
available at frc.org.uk/corporate/
combinedcode.cfm.
Statement of compliance with the 
provisions of the Combined Code
The Ordinary Shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. In accordance 
with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, the Company confirms 
that throughout the year ended 
31 December 201 1 and at the date 
of this Annual Report, it was compliant 
with the provisions of the Code. 
Share capital
Details of the share capital of the 
Company and the powers of the 
Directors in relation to allotment, 
issue and market purchases of 
shares are given in the Directors’ 
report on page 54. 
The Board composition
The Board comprises an Executive 
Chairman (John Devaney), a Chief 
Executive Officer (Andy Stevens), a 
Chief Financial Officer (Warren Tucker) 
and six other Non-executive Directors 
of whom Marcus Beresford is the 
Senior Independent Director. All 
Non-executive Directors are considered 
to be independent and the Chairman 
was considered to be independent 
on appointment. They all held office 
throughout the year except Alison 
Wood, who joined the Board on 
1 July 201 1. Peter Hooley retired 
from the Board and stood down as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee at 
the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) on 6 May 201 1. 
Biographies of the Directors, giving 
details of their experience and other 
significant commitments, are set out 
on pages 34 and 35. The wide ranging 
experience and backgrounds of the 
Non-executive Directors enable them 
to debate and constructively challenge 
management in relation to both 
the development of strategy and 
the performance of the Group. The 
attendance of Directors at Board 
meetings are set out on page 34 
and attendance at principal Board 
committee meetings as members of 
such committees during the year are 
set out in the reports from each 
committee on pages 40, 42, and 44. 
Non-executive Directors are appointed 
for specified terms of three years which 
can be extended by agreement provided 
that the individual’s performance 
continues to be effective. The rules for 
the appointment and replacement of 
Directors are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association (the Articles) 
copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House in the UK or by 
contacting the Company Secretary. 
Changes to the Articles must be 
approved by shareholders passing a 
special resolution. The Directors and the 
Company (in the latter case by ordinary 
resolution) may appoint a person who is 
willing to act as a Director, either to fill a 
vacancy or as an additional Director. 
All Non-executives have confirmed they 
will have sufficient time to meet what is 
expected of them and copies of their 
appointment letters are available on 
request to the Company Secretary and 
will be available for inspection at the 
AGM. Under the Articles, Directors are 
subject to re-election by shareholders 
at the first AGM after their appointment 
by the Board and are subject to 
re-appointment if they have held office 
for three years or more since their 
previous appointment by shareholders 
and, in the case of Non-executive 
Directors, if they have held office for 
nine years or more since first being 
appointed by shareholders. However, 
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which recommends 
that all directors of FTSE 350 companies 
seek re-election by shareholders on an 
annual basis, all Directors currently in 
office will retire and seek re-election at 
the AGM. In addition, Alison Wood, who 
was appointed by the Board on 1 July 
201 1, is seeking election by shareholders 
at the 2012 AGM for the first time. The 
Board has set out in the circular a 
resolution to elect Alison Wood as 
a Non-executive Director and explains 
why it believes she should be elected. 
The Chairman confirms to shareholders 
when proposing re-election or 
re-appointment that the individual’s 
performance continues to be effective 
and that the individual continues to 
demonstrate commitment to the role. 
Non-executive Directors are subject 
to Companies Act provisions relating 
to the removal of a Director.
The Chairman is, among other 
things, responsible for chairing Board 
meetings and leading the Board. The 
Chief Executive Officer’s responsibilities 
include operational performance, 
Corporate social responsibility and the 
development and implementation of 
the Group’s strategy. He focuses also 
on long-term growth and development 
of the Group, its people and customer 
relationships. The Board’s policy is that 
the roles of Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer should be performed 
by different people. The division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman’s 
role and that of the Chief Executive 
Officer is documented and clearly 
understood. Although the current 
Chief Executive Officer has resigned 
from his role, due to a recurring 
long-term serious back injury, he is 
serving his notice and will continue 
to carry out some duties until a new 
Chief Executive Officer is appointed.
The Senior Independent Director’s 
responsibilities include the provision of 
an additional channel of communication 
between the Chairman and the 
Non-executive Directors. He also 
provides another point of contact 
for shareholders if they have concerns 
which communication through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer or Chief Financial 
Officer has failed to resolve, or where 
these contacts are inappropriate.
The Board and its proceedings
Board meetings, scheduled in 
accordance with the annual timetable, 
take place five times a year on a face to 
face basis, five times a year by telephone 
and otherwise as required. There is 
contact between meetings to progress 
the Group’s business as required. 
Meetings were held at the head 
THE BOARD’S ROLE IS TO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED office in Wimborne, at the Company’s 
London office and at an international 
operational location. In addition, the 
Senior Independent Director held a 
meeting with the Non-executives in 
the absence of the Chairman to appraise 
the Chairman’s performance and his 
performance was evaluated. In addition, 
the Chairman has held meetings with 
the Non-executives in the absence 
of the Executive Directors. 
The Board’s role is to lead the Group 
with a view to the creation of strong, 
sustainable financial performance and 
long-term shareholder value. In doing 
so, it reviews and agrees Group strategy, 
ensures that the necessary resources 
are in place, monitors management 
performance, and supervises the 
conduct of the Group’s activities within 
a framework of prudent and effective 
internal controls. During the year, 
the Board and senior management 
participated in two separate meetings 
devoted to the consideration and 
development of the Group’s strategy. 
The Board has adopted a schedule 
of matters reserved for its specific 
approval. The schedule provides the 
framework for those decisions which can 
be made by the Board and those which 
can be delegated either to committees 
or otherwise. Among the key matters on 
which the Board alone may make decisions 
are the Group’s business strategy, its five 
year plan, its consolidated budget, Group 
policies, dividends, acquisitions and 
disposals, and all appointments to and 
removals from the Board. Authority is 
delegated to management on a structured 
basis in accordance with the provisions of 
the Corporate Framework ensuring that 
proper management oversight exists at 
the appropriate level. Matters delegated 
in this way include, within defined 
parameters, the approval of bids and 
contracts, capital expenditures and 
financing arrangements. 
The Board has adopted procedures 
relating to the conduct of its business, 
including the timely provision of 
information, and the Company 
Secretary is responsible for ensuring that 
these are observed and for advising the 
Board on corporate governance matters. 
The Company Secretary is appointed, 
and can only be removed, by the Board.
If a Director were to have a concern 
which cannot be resolved this would 
be recorded in the Board minutes. On 
resignation, Non-executive Directors are 
invited to provide a written statement 
to the Chairman for circulation to the 
Board if they have concerns. No such 
statements were made during 201 1.
All potential situational and transactional 
conflicts of interest are disclosed, noted 
and authorised. Procedures are in place 
and operating effectively to keep such 
disclosures up to date.
Performance evaluation
The Board conducts an evaluation of 
its activities on an annual basis. During 
201 1, the Board and its committees 
undertook an internal evaluation. 
The evaluation included the circulation 
of a questionnaire, a review of actions 
taken in response to the 2009 external 
evaluation and 2010 internal evaluation. 
The Board considered the output and 
has approved an action plan to address 
issues arising. A Board evaluation 
undertaken by external facilitators 
is planned for 2012.
A table of action instigated by 
previous performance evaluations 
is included below.

a management committee for risk. Propose formal terms 
of reference and executive membership for approval.

2009, to enable the Board and management to manage risk more effectively 
throughout the Group. The risk management process has been strengthened, 
and continues to evolve.

Board members.
The Board implemented a structured induction programme in 2010 for new 
Board members and those joining Board committees. All new Board members 
starting with Michael Wareing have been through the induction programme.
Review diversity within the Board membership and ensure that 
it is a priority going forward for the Nomination Committee.
The Nomination Committee, led by the Chairman, drafted a specification for 
a new Non-executive Director position in 2010 and the Board collectively has 
placed a greater emphasis on diversity within the members of the Board.
2010
Proactively attempt to recruit a diverse member of the Board 
during 2010.

a global recruitment consultant, to recruit Alison Wood as the Group’s 
newest Non-executive Director elected on 1 July 2011.
Increase dialogue between Executive Directors and Non-executive 
Directors to better leverage skills and experience of Non-executive 
Directors in strategic needs. 
The strategic review process was completely revised for 2011 with the 
Board committing more time and input into the Group Strategic Plan.
Review the consultant support to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee reviewed the relationship with their 
remuneration consultants, introduced new communication channels 
and strengthened the reporting process that has significantly improved 
the input of the consultants to the Committee.
2011
Devote time, as part of the Nomination Committee’s review, to discuss 
the profile of the individual required for new Board members before 
each appointment.
The appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer will be led by the 
Chairman, taking into account the profile discussed with the Nomination 
Committee and specifically ensuring the appointee is the right individual 
to take forward the Group Strategic Plan.
Establish a plan to bring in new talent for key posts, ensuring talent 
and succession planning are driven forward.
Talent and succession planning will continue to be a Board focus during 2012.
Increase the frequency of discussions at the Board on market 
positioning, on technology assets, and on implementation of 
the Group Strategic Plan. 
The Board will implement new reporting and quarterly strategic updates 
during 2012.

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 39 Comments from the Chairman
“Succession planning has been a key 
focus for the Nomination Committee 
this year as we continually seek the 
right talent to execute our articulated 
strategy. The process for selection for 
the appointment of Alison Wood was 
managed in conjunction with Korn/
Ferry Whitehead Mann, recruitment 
consultants who have signed up to 
the voluntary Code of Conduct for 
executive search firms. Korn/Ferry 
provided a short list of candidates 
whom I interviewed and confirmed 
with the Board my preferred choice. 
Alison was then interviewed by 
the Executive Directors and the 
majority of the Non-executive 
Directors before being offered 
the Non-executive Director role. 
This exhaustive process combined 
with the Committee’s continual 
review process of the Board and 
senior Group executives provides 
the Group with the necessary range 
of talent, experience and skills to 
ensure the Group is well positioned 
for the future.
The Committee is currently working 
on the appointment of a successor to 
the Chief Executive Officer, who for 
health reasons, will be leaving the 
Group later this year.”

Succession planning
Succession planning takes place at 
Board and senior management level 
on a regular basis to ensure that the 
Group is managed by executives with 
the necessary skills, experience and 
knowledge. The Board has a role to 
play in overseeing the development of 
management resources in the Group. 
Specifically, the Board wants to see 
depth and quality in management and 
robust processes are in place to help 
the Board in this task. 
Succession planning for Non-executive 
Directors is based on maintaining a 
depth of knowledge and experience on 
the Board. The Nomination Committee 
actively manages Non-executive 
Director succession having regard to 
anticipated retirement dates for existing 
Directors and initiates focused searches 
for Non-executive Directors as positions 
are required. 
The current Board composition in 
relation to the Non-executive Directors, 
as of 31 December 201 1, in terms of 
length of service and current term is

information about the operations and 
activities of the Group, the role of the 
Board and the matters reserved for its 
decision, the Group’s corporate 
governance practices and procedures

Audit Committee The Committee’s terms of reference, 
which were reviewed during the year, 
are available on the Company’s 
website or on application to the 
Company Secretary. 
The Chairman of the Committee is 
Michael Wareing. He is an independent 
Director. The Board is satisfied, since 
he was the former International 
Chief Executive of KPMG until 2009, 
has been Chairman of the Audit 
Committee of Wolseley plc for two 
years and is a chartered accountant, 
that he has ‘recent and relevant financial 
experience’ as required by the Code. 
The other members of the Committee 
are all independent Directors. Details 
of their experience are set out on 
pages 34 to 35.
Risk management 
and internal controls
The Committee believes that the current 
arrangements comprising a rotational 
programme of internal financial and 
other control reviews by the internal 
audit function, business reviews carried 
out by the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer and a process of 
self-assessment of internal financial 
controls by all business units provides 
appropriate coverage of the Group’s 
activities. Where weaknesses have been 
identified, plans for remedying them are 
developed and progress monitored. 
The Group operates under a system 
of internal controls which has been 
developed and refined over time 
to meet its needs and the risks and 
opportunities to which it is exposed. 
This includes a strategic planning 
process involving the preparation 
of a five year plan, a comprehensive 
budgeting system with an annual 
budget which is approved by the 
Board, the regular revision of financial 
forecasts for the year, the monitoring 
of financial performance and the 
appropriate delegation of authorities 
to operational management. 
Delegations and other operational 
controls are contained in the 
Corporate Framework and the 
Group Finance Manual. Specifically 
with regard to the financial reporting 
process and the preparation of the 
Group financial statements, the 
system includes an annual and 
semi-annual representation letter 
from all business units. Included in those 
letters are written acknowledgements 
that financial reporting is based upon 
reliable data and that the results are 
properly stated in accordance with 
Group policies. The review and 
monitoring of the effectiveness of 
the internal controls including, but 
not limited to, financial controls and 
the Group’s financial and operational 
risk management systems is delegated 
to the Audit Committee.
Risk management is an integral part 
of the system of internal control. 
Divisional Presidents are required to 
ensure that appropriate processes, 
including the maintenance of business 
unit and divisional risk registers, exist 
to identify and manage risks and to 
regularly carry out formal risk 
assessments. The executive Risk 
Committee undertakes a top level 
review of significant risks and the 
Chief Executive Officer reports 
regularly to the Board on 
their mitigation. 
The latest principal risks and the risk 
management process are highlighted 
on pages 28 and 29.
The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control, 
the aim of which is to manage risks 
that are significant to the fulfilment 
of the Group’s business objectives 
and to contribute to the safeguarding 
of shareholders’ investment and the 
Company’s assets. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system. However, such a system is 
designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and 
can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against 
material mis-statement or loss.
The Board confirms that there is 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group. This process, 
which has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts, is reviewed in accordance 
with the guidance for Directors on 
internal control issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. 
The Audit Committee monitors 
the adequacy of internal financial 
controls and compliance with Group 
standards through a combination of 
a self-assessment process involving all 
business units supplemented by regular 
internal audit reviews and visits. The 
Board receives reports on a regular 
basis from the Audit Committee in 
relation to the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control 
and has, accordingly, reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control in respect of 201 1. The 
review covered all material controls, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk 
management systems.
External auditors
The Committee and the external 
auditors have safeguards to avoid the 
possible compromise of the auditors’ 
objectivity and independence. These 
include the adoption by the Committee 
of a policy regarding the supply of 
audit and non-audit services and of 
a policy on the employment of 
external audit staff. Non-audit services, 
as defined from time to time in the 
policy, can be provided subject to 
pre-approval by the Committee where 
the cost of any individual engagement 
exceeds a pre-defined limit. The 
Committee has received reports from 
the external auditors confirming their 
independence and objectivity.
The external auditors operate, in 
relation to the senior engagement 
auditor, a rotation policy after five 
years and the current audit partner 
was appointed in early 2009. The 
Committee has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the external auditors 
and has recommended that a 
resolution be proposed at the AGM 
to re-appoint the external auditors 
and to allow the Board to set their 
remuneration. The Committee is 
satisfied that the external auditors 
remain independent.
The nature of services received from 
and fees paid to the external auditors 
during the year are set out in note 2 
to the Group financial statements.

Comments from the Chairman
“The Committee feel very strongly that 
rewards should be linked to both Group 
and personal performance. The economic 
conditions in Cobham’s industry sectors 
and the Group’s performance in the 
previous year led us to award no salary 
increases in 201 1 for the Executive 
Directors and the majority of the Group 
Executive, although there were awards 
throughout the Group focused on those 
parts of the business that continued to 
perform well.
As a result of the continuing economic 
uncertainty, no changes have been made 
to the long-term incentive schemes during 
the year. In line with our normal practice, 
the targets for the 201 2 annual bonus have 
been reviewed and set against the Group 
Strategic Plan and the Board’s short-term 
performance targets.
During the year we have introduced 
a clawback provision in line with current 
external guidelines and the Group has 
rolled out an Excellence in Performance 
programme across all employees, 
including the executive team, which 
increases the emphasis on rewarding 
personal performance within the context 
of the business. Details can be found on 
page 45 of this report.
Looking forward to 201 2, base pay for the 
executive team has been increased by 3% 
in line with the awards across the Group.”

This report provides the 
information required by the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (the Regulations). 
It also describes how the Group applies 
the principles of the Code in relation to 
remuneration. The report has been 
approved by the Board and shareholder 
approval will be sought at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website or on 
application to the Company Secretary. 
The Committee received advice 
during the year from Deloitte LLP on 
remuneration strategy, incentive design 
and market data. Additional advice 
was received from the Executive Vice 
President Human Resources and the 
Company Secretary. In addition, Deloitte 
LLP provided services to the Group 
relating to the execution of the 
Excellence in Delivery programme. 
In this respect, the Committee is 
satisfied that any potential conflicts 
are appropriately managed. Deloitte LLP 
have taken a leading role in developing, 
and have signed up to, the voluntary 
Code of Conduct in relation to Executive 
Remuneration Consulting in the UK. 
They were appointed in November 
2009 and their performance is 
considered by the Committee as 
part of their performance evaluation.
Whilst proposals from the Committee 
take account of the advice received, the 
ultimate decision is made by the Board 
in the absence of any advisers.
Remuneration policy
The Board’s policy is to recruit, 
motivate and retain executives of high 
calibre by rewarding them for superior 
performance with competitive 
remuneration packages. In particular, 
the executive pay policy for the current 
and subsequent financial years is 
designed to retain those executives 
with the skills and experience necessary 
to enable the Group to achieve its 
objectives and satisfy shareholder 
expectations. 
Paying for performance is the 
guiding principle of the Excellence 
Note: No awards made to Executive Directors under 
the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) in 2011.
in Performance programme. 
Compensation decisions, including 
salary and annual incentives, are linked 
to the Group’s performance against 
the Group Strategic Plan, in particular, to 
cash conversion and EPS growth, 
and separately to the performance 
of the individual employee.
The philosophy is to deliver total 
competitive compensation comparable 
to that of aerospace and defence peers 
if sustained competitive performance is 
achieved. For solid performance, actual 
total compensation delivered is 
targeted in line with the market. 
The primary elements of the 2011 
remuneration package focus on 
supporting different objectives, 
as illustrated in the table on the 
following page, which also shows 
the opportunity for 2011 and 
2012 executive remuneration 
performance measures. 
In defining the Group’s remuneration 
policy, the Committee takes into 
account best practice guidelines set by 
institutional investor bodies such as the 
Association of British Insurers. The 
Chairman of the Company also ensures 
the Company, through the Committee 
and its Chairman, maintains contact 
with principal shareholders about 
remuneration matters.
The Company’s short-term incentives 
are paid, and long-term incentives vest, 
only if stretching performance targets 
are achieved and the Committee is 
satisfied that executive management 
has acted in a responsible and diligent 
manner. The Remuneration Committee 
considers corporate performance on 
governance issues when setting the 
remuneration targets of Executive 
Directors and the Group Executive. 
The Remuneration Committee has 
considered whether the incentive 
structures may raise risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour and is of the view that this 
is not the case.
The Remuneration Committee 
introduced clawback provisions to 
the incentive programmes applicable 
to the 2011 annual incentive and 
long-term incentive awards, giving 
them discretion to reduce awards or 
require repayment of cash paid to a 
participant in relation to annual and 
long-term incentives within the 
preceding 12 months for material 
mis-statement of financial results, 
reputational damage to the Group or 
gross misconduct of the individual.
Around half of each Executive 
Director’s total target remuneration 
is variable and is linked to corporate 
performance. The chart below 
illustrates the proportions of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages comprising fixed (i.e. salary 
and pension) and variable elements 
of pay, assuming target annual bonus 
and expected values of long-term 
incentives are achieved.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Dilution
The Company’s share schemes are 
funded through shares purchased in 
the market. Until November 2010, 
share schemes were funded by new 
issue shares.
Funding of awards through new issue 
shares is subject to an overall dilution 
limit of 10% of issued share capital in 
any ten year period. Of this, 5% may be 
used in connection with the Company’s 
discretionary share schemes. As of 
31 December 2011, 23.4m (2.17%) and 
13.4m (1.24%) shares have been issued 
pursuant to awards made in the 
previous ten years in connection with 
all share schemes and discretionary 
schemes respectively. Awards that are 
made, but then lapse or are forfeited, 
are excluded from the calculations.
Base salary
Andy Stevens was appointed to the 
position of Chief Executive Officer on 
1 January 2010 on an annual salary of 
£600,000. His salary was positioned 
below the market median with the 
intention to increase towards the 
median subject to performance over 
time. Warren Tucker, the Chief Financial 
Officer, received a salary of £428,400 in 
2011. From 2011 the annual review date 
for Executive Directors’ salaries was 
moved to 1 March in order to enable all 
aspects of compensation to be planned 
for at the same time. However, given 
the wider economic environment, no 
salary increases were awarded for the 
Executive Directors, the majority of 
the Group Executive and certain of 
their direct reports for 2011. For 2012, 
Andy Stevens’ salary will remain 
unchanged and Warren Tucker’s has 
been increased to £443,400 to reflect 
Company performance and his 
personal contribution.
To ensure that salary and employment 
benefits across the Group are taken 
into consideration when decisions 
regarding Executive Directors’ 
remuneration are made, the 
Committee is briefed on key 
changes impacting employees. 
Annual incentive
The Company operates an annual 
cash incentive scheme for its Executive 
Directors. Annual incentives were 
awarded by the Committee in respect 
of 2011 having regard to the 
performance of the Group and personal 
performance objectives for the year. 
Details on the annual cash incentive 
scheme and the amount achieved 
against targets for 2011 can be 
found in the table on page 46.
Long-term incentives
Executive Directors, senior executives 
and certain other staff are eligible to 
participate in the following incentive 
schemes:
• The Cobham Bonus 
Co-investment Plan (BCP) 
• The Cobham Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) 
• The Cobham Executive Share 
Option Scheme (ESOS)
The performance measures against 
which BCP , PSP and ESOS awards vest 
include relative TSR, real underlying EPS 
growth and real EP growth. Together 
these performance measures help 
ensure the interests of executives are 
aligned with those of shareholders 
(through TSR) whilst also reinforcing 
capital efficiency (through EP) and 
bottom-line growth for shareholders 
(through underlying EPS). There has 
been no change to performance 
measures for the 2012 awards.
Bonus Co-investment Plan
The Executive Directors and other 
members of the Group Executive were 
invited by the Committee to defer up to 
50% of their net earned annual bonus in 
2010 (paid in Spring 201 1) into Ordinary 
Shares in return for an opportunity to 
earn a matching award of shares against 
the gross bonus invested. Threshold 
performance results in invested shares 
being matched pro rata to target 
achievement and the 2:1 match is 
awarded for maximum levels of 
performance. Matching awards vest 
after three years subject to stretching 
three year EP growth targets. EP targets 
are considered to be commercially 
sensitive and therefore are not disclosed 
at the start of the cycle. In the event of 
a change of control, vesting of BCP 
matching awards is not automatic and 
would depend on the extent to which 
the performance conditions had been 
met at the time and the period elapsed 
since the date of grant.
Performance Share Plan
Under the PSP , approved by shareholders 
in 2007 , conditional share awards or 
nil-cost options of up to 150% of base 
salary may be granted annually to 
eligible executives. The individual limit 
of 150% of salary can be exceeded in 
exceptional circumstances involving the 
recruitment or retention of a senior 
employee by approval of the 
Committee. During 201 1, awards were 
made to employees in the UK, including 
the Executive Directors and certain 
employees outside the UK. The awards, 
equal to 143% of the salary, made to the 
Executive Directors are disclosed on 
page 52.
Vesting of PSP awards is based 50% on 
the Company’s three year TSR relative to 
a comparator group of aerospace and 
defence sector peers and 50% on the 
Company’s three year real underlying 
EPS growth. Companies in the TSR 
comparator group for awards granted 
in 201 1, and to be made in 2012:
BAE Systems Lockheed Martin
Boeing Meggitt
EADS Northrop Grumman
Flir Systems QinetiQ
Goodrich Raytheon
IMI Rockwell Collins
ITT Industries Rolls-Royce
L-3 Communications Smiths Group
To the extent that the performance 
targets are not met over the three year 
performance period, awards will lapse, 
i.e. there is no re-testing of the 
performance conditions. In the event 
of a change of control, vesting of PSP 
awards is not automatic and would 
depend on the extent to which the 
performance conditions had been 
met at the time and the period 
elapsed since the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The ESOS was approved by shareholders 
at the 2004 AGM and amended at the 
2007 AGM. It includes an ‘Approved’ 
plan, which has been approved by HM 
Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and an 
‘Unapproved’ plan which is not designed 
for HMRC approval. Options to acquire 
Ordinary Shares may be awarded to 
participants up to a maximum annual 
value of 200% of base salary (300% for 
overseas-based participants). 
No grants under the ESOS were made 
to the Executive Directors or UK 
employees during 201 1. ESOS ‘time only’ 
and performance awards continue to 
be made to overseas participants. The 
vesting of options granted to overseas-
based participants (other than senior 
executives whose awards were subject 
to performance conditions which 
are described in the following table) 
is conditional only on continued 
employment and they vest in 25% 
increments on each anniversary of grant 
over four years. Such phased vesting is 
in line with common US practice.

The graph below illustrates the 
TSR performance (share price growth 
plus dividends) of the Company against 
the FTSE350 Index over the past five 
years. The FTSE350 Index was chosen  
as it is a recognised broad equity market 
index of which the Company was a 
member during 201 1 and is currently,  
as at 6 March 2012, ranked at 1 14th.
In the event of a change of control, 
vesting of ESOS awards is not automatic 
and would depend on the extent to 
which the Committee determines the 
performance conditions had been met 
at the time. Any vested awards not 
exercised within one month of the 
change of control would lapse.
Other share schemes 
The Cobham Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme (Sharesave) is an 
HMRC approved scheme open to all UK 
employees. The maximum that can be 
saved each month is £250 and savings 
plus interest may be used to acquire 
shares by exercising the related option. 
Options have been granted at a 20% 
discount to market value. The Executive 
Directors are permitted to participate 
in the scheme and details of their 
participation are included in Table 5 
on page 52.
The Company also operates another 
HMRC approved all-employee share 
scheme, the Cobham Share Incentive 
Plan. This scheme operates within 
specific tax legislation and enables 
participants to buy Ordinary Shares

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Directors’ pensions 
Executive Directors participate in the 
Cobham Executives Pension Plan (the 
Pension Plan). The Pension Plan provides 
benefits on final pay principles against 
a normal scheme pension age of 60 
subject to actuarial reduction for earlier 
retirement. Pension accrues at 1/30th of 
pensionable earnings, i.e. base salary 
(capped as appropriate), for each year of 
service and participants contribute at a 
rate of 7%- 1 5% of pensionable earnings. 
Contributions to the Pension Plan are paid 
through a salary sacrifice arrangement.
All pensions in payment relating to 
post-April 1997 rights are increased in line 
with the retail prices index (RPI), subject 
to a minimum of 3% per annum and a 
maximum of 5% per annum, with the 
balance of pension being increased at 
3% per annum. On death in service, a 
lump sum of four times pensionable 
earnings is payable together with a 
spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the 
member’s prospective pension. On 
death after retirement, a spouse’s pension 
is paid at the rate of two-thirds of the 
member’s pre-commutation pension. 
Similar spouses’ pensions are payable on 
the death of a deferred pensioner prior 
to retirement.
The pension benefits of Directors who 
are members of the Pension Plan were 
restricted by the HMRC earnings cap until 
5 April 2006 and thereafter by a scheme 
specific salary cap. Contributions in 
respect of such members were paid into 
funded unapproved retirement benefit 
schemes (FURBS) until 5 April 2006. No 
further contributions have been or will be 
made to FURBS after 6 April 2006. Cash 
payments in lieu of contributions to 
FURBS made to Directors are set out 
in notes to T able 2 on page 50.
The policy in respect of newly 
appointed Directors is that payments 
by the Company to a defined 
contribution top-up arrangement 
or in the form of non-pensionable 
cash allowances should normally be 
2% of annual basic salary per month.
Details of Directors’ pension benefits 
as required by the Regulations are set 
out in T able 3 on page 51.
Service contracts
The Board’s policy on notice periods 
for new Executive Directors is that these 
should not normally exceed one year. 
It recognises, however, that it may be 
necessary in the case of new executive 
appointments to offer a longer initial 
notice period which would subsequently 
reduce to one year. Andy Stevens’ 
service contract, which was revised on 
6 August 2009 effective from 1 January 
2010, is terminable on one year’s notice 
by either party. Andy Stevens served 
notice on the Company under his 
contract on 1 7 November 201 1. 
Warren Tucker’s service contract dated 
1 January 2004 is terminable on one 
year’s notice by, and six months’ notice 
to, the Company. 
The Company may elect to terminate 
Directors’ service contracts by making 
payments in lieu of notice. Such 
payments are calculated by reference to 
the base salary otherwise payable during 
the notice period. Payments in respect 
of annual bonus for the relevant periods 
may also be payable. In the case of 
Warren Tucker, any payment in lieu 
of notice shall include a sum equal 
to the value of his annual benefits. 
The Company recognises and endorses 
the obligation of departing Directors 
to mitigate their own losses. 
Personal shareholding
Non-executive Directors are required to 
acquire, within six months of election to 
the Board, and hold a shareholding of 
5,000 Ordinary Shares.
Ownership guidelines require the 
Executive Directors to maintain Ordinary 
Shares to the value of at least one year’s 
salary and to retain a minimum of 50% 
of net vested PSP and BCP matching 
shares, and shares equal to 50% of the 
net gains resulting from the exercise 
of ESOS options until the relevant 
shareholding level is met. 
The personal shareholding guidelines for 
the Non-executive Directors have been 
achieved. In relation to the Executive 
Directors, achievement of percentage 
shareholding as required by the 
guidelines as at the year end was: Andy 
Stevens 121% and Warren Tucker 80%. 
Warren Tucker sold shares in 201 1. His 
residual shareholding was above 100%, 
but the share price has fallen during the 
year, so the value of his holdings in 
percentage terms has been reduced. 
Warren Tucker has increased his 
shareholding since the year end and the 
percentage shareholding as at 6 March 
2012, were: Andy Stevens 123% and 
Warren Tucker 88%.
Non-executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit Non-executive 
Directors of a high calibre with broad 
commercial, international or other 
relevant experience. The Non-executive 
Directors do not have service contracts. 
No compensation is payable in the event 
of an appointment being 
terminated early.
Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Company’s 
share schemes, pension schemes or 
bonus arrangements.
Mark Ronald and Mike Hagee receive 
an allowance of £5,000 per annum in 
respect of the additional travelling time 
required to ensure their attendance at 
Board meetings.
The Company reimburses reasonable 
travel and incidental expenditure 
incurred by Directors in attending 
meetings of the Board.
No additional fees are payable to the 
Chairman in respect of his membership 
of any of the committees or his 
chairmanship of the Nomination 
Committee.

The auditable part of this Directors’ 
remuneration report is set out on pages

Member contributions are paid through salary sacrifice, from March 2010 and February 2010 for Andy Stevens and Warren Tucker respectively. 
Employer contributions for the year relating to the above Executive Directors were £188, 190 (2010: £162,752).
The inflation figure used for 201 1 is 3. 1%, being the statutory revaluation rate for deferred pensioners for 2010–1 1 for a member not retiring in 201 1 after 
one year’s service.
The ‘Additional transfer value accrued in excess of member’s contributions during 201 1’ is significantly greater than the corresponding value for 2010. This is 
predominantly due to a reduction in gilt yields over the year, leading to a reduction in the yields used for the calculation of the transfer values. The transfer 
value basis at 31 December 201 1 was therefore significantly stronger than the corresponding basis at 31 December 2010.

• The Company has entered into a 
number of credit agreements with 
banks, and has issued senior notes 
under private placements. The total 
amount owing under such agreements 
at the year-end date is shown in note 
19 to the Group financial statements. 
All agreements contain clauses such 
that, in the event of a change of 
control, the Company can offer to or 
must repay all such borrowings 
together with accrued interest, fees 
and other sums owing as required by 
the individual agreements.
• Under the FB Heliservices (FBH) 
shareholders agreement entered into in 
November 2004, change of control of 
either the Company or its subsidiary 
holding shares in FBH, without the prior 
written consent of that other FBH 
shareholder, entitles the other FBH 
shareholder to purchase all of the 
Cobham Group’s shareholding in FBH.
• Under the Sentinel contract, entered into 
in March 2006, the Company must seek 
approval for any material change in the 
shareholding of the Company. There is 
an ancillary Lease Agreement under 
which a change of control may result in 
the termination of the lease if such event 
is likely to have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s ability to perform its 
obligations under the lease.
• Under the FSTA shareholders 
agreement entered into in June 2008, 
a change of control of the Company 
may result in a required sale of the 
Company’s shares in FSTA to the 
other shareholders.
Further information relating to change 
of control appears in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 47  
and 48 under the headings Bonus 
Co-investment Plan, Performance 
Share Plan and Executive Share 
Option Scheme.
Employee share schemes – 
rights of control
If required to do so by the Company, 
the trustee of the Cobham Share 
Incentive Plan (the Plan) will, on receipt 
of notice from the Company of any 
offer, compromise, arrangement or 
scheme which affects shares held in the 
Plan, invite participants to direct the 
trustee on the exercise of any voting 
rights attaching to the shares held by 
the trustee on their behalf and/or direct 
how the trustee shall act in relation to 
those shares. 
The trustee will not vote in respect of 
any shares held in the Plan in respect 
of which it has received no directions 
nor will the trustee vote in respect of 
any shares which are unallocated under 
the Plan. 
The trustees of the Employee Benefit 
Trust waive all rights to vote in respect 
of any shares they hold within the Trust.
Research and development
The Group continues to invest in the 
important area of research and 
development. During the year the 
Group expended £75.3m (2010: £73.8m) 
on non-customer funded research 
and development. The management 
of each Group business is responsible 
for identifying and carrying out suitable 
research and development programmes 
having regard to particular market and 
product needs.

Creditors payment policy
It is the policy of the Company that 
all invoices are paid within 30 days 
following the end of the month in 
which the invoices are approved. The 
total amount of the Company’s trade 
creditors falling due within one year at 
31 December 201 1 represents 16 days’ 
(2010: 45 days’) worth as a proportion 
of the total amount invoiced by 
suppliers during the year ended on that 
date. The creditor days have reduced 
significantly during the year due to a 
reduced purchase ledger balance at 
year end compared to 2010.

The Group encourages employee 
participation and consultation at all 
levels and shares relevant business 
information. This approach facilitates 
the evolution of new ideas and practices 
that add value to the business, promotes 
team member commitment and helps 
focus Company and employee 
expectations. The tools used include 
in-house newsletters, intranet, extranet 
and regular employee opinion surveys. 
Company announcements, team 
meetings and suggestion schemes all 
play a part in this process. UK employees 
are given the opportunity to become 
shareholders in the Company through 
the Cobham Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme and the Cobham Share 
Incentive Plan. Under the former, 
employees can acquire shares through 
the exercise of options granted at a 20% 
discount to market value with savings 
made over three, five or seven years. 
Under the latter, shares may be 
purchased out of pre-tax income.
The Group sets high standards 
of performance for employees, 
and in return, employees expect to be 
appropriately recognised and rewarded 
for their contribution. This mutual gain 
makes the Excellence in Performance 
programme a process that is 
fundamental to our continued growth 
and success. A major component of this 
system is the ePDR, described above. 
An outcome of this integrated process 
is to create an atmosphere where 
employees understand that there 
is a direct link between performance 
and compensation.

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 57 Directors’ declaration in relation 
to relevant audit information
In the case of each Director in office 
at the date the Directors’ report is 
approved, that:
(a) So far as the Director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of 
which the Group’s auditors were 
unaware; and
(b) He/she has taken all the steps that he/
she ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditors are aware of that 
information.
The responsibility statement was 
approved by the Board of Directors 
on 6 March 2012 and signed on its 
behalf by:
J Devaney
Executive Chairman
W Tucker
Chief Financial Officer
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and 
the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the parent 
company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards) 
and applicable law. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group and the Company for 
that period.
In preparing those financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• State whether IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union (EU), and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and Company financial 
statements respectively; and
• Prepare the Group and parent company 
financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and to enable them 
to ensure that the Group financial 
statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s website (www.cobham.com). 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the Directors, whose names 
and functions are listed on pages 34 
to 35 confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• The Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
the IFRS as adopted by the EU, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; and
• The Business overview includes a 
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 58
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES We have audited the Group financial 
statements of Cobham plc for the year 
ended 31 December 201 1 which 
comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated statement of changes 
in equity, the consolidated cash flow 
statement, the accounting policies and 
the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of 
Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement 
of Directors’ responsibilities set out on 
page 58, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, 
has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial 
statements: 
• Give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s affairs as at 31 
December 201 1 and of its profit and 
cash flows for the year then ended;
• Have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union; and
• Have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• The information given in the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which 
the Group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 
we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
• We have not received all the 
information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• A corporate governance statement 
has not been prepared by the 
parent company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review: 
• The Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, set out on page 58, 
in relation to going concern; 
• The part of the Corporate governance 
section relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review; and
• Certain elements of the report to 
shareholders by the Board on Directors’ 
remuneration.
Other matter 
We have reported separately 
on the parent company financial 
statements of Cobham plc for the 
year ended 31 December 201 1 and 
on the information in the Directors’ 
remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF COBHAM PLC circumstances of the entity acquired. This includes trading data, such as the 
value and duration of contracts acquired, the strength, duration and degree 
of exclusivity of relationships with customers, as well as valuation estimates, 
such as the estimation of likely external royalty rates that could be associated 
with technology and branding assets and attributable future cash flows. 
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least once a year. This 
requires estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units (CGUs) to 
which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group 
to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGUs and 
also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value 
of those cash flows. Further details are given in note 10.
Taxation
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement 
is required in determining the worldwide provision for tax. There are many 
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises 
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters 
is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences 
will impact the current tax provision, deferred tax provisions and income 
statement in the period in which such determination is made.
Retirement benefits
The Group financial statements include costs and liabilities in relation to 
retirement benefit obligations. A number of assumptions are made in 
assessing the costs and present value of the pension assets and liabilities 
which include the long-term rate of increase of salary costs, discount rate, 
inflation, the expected return on plan assets and mortality rates. The Group 
uses published indices and independent actuarial advice to select the values 
of critical assumptions, which are disclosed in note 24. 
Provisions 
The consolidated financial statements include appropriate provisions for the 
estimated outcome of commercial disputes. No such provision is included for 
contingent liabilities. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the 
future level of such claims and contingencies and of the costs arising out of 
any related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to 
estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs 
that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to revisions 
from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future 
events. The Directors take account of the advice of experts in quantifying the 
expected costs of future adverse judgements.
Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, 
are as set out below. 
Underlying measures
In addition to the information required by IFRS and to assist with the 
understanding of earnings trends, the Group has included within its 
published financial statements non-GAAP measures including trading 
profit and underlying earnings results.
T rading profit has been defined as operating profit from continuing operations 
excluding the impacts of certain M&A related costs and business restructuring 
costs as detailed below. Also excluded are the marking to market of non-hedge 
accounted derivative financial instruments not realised in the period, 
General information
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of 
Cobham plc (the Company), a public company limited by shares, registered and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries (the Group). The address 
of the registered office is Brook Road, Wimborne, Dorset, England BH21 2BJ.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the EU, International Financial Reporting Interpretation Council (IFRIC) 
interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of 
derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value.
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations 
have been adopted with effect from 1 January 201 1. No changes to 
previously published accounting policies or other adjustments were 
required on their adoption.
• Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures. 
• Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement.
• IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments.
• Amendment to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 
Disclosure for First-time Adopters.
• Annual Improvements 2010.
• Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues.
Management judgement and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the 
use of estimates and judgements that affect the application of accounting 
policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
These estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The current economic 
conditions have been considered when evaluating accounting estimates and 
judgements, including the application of the going concern basis of preparation. 
Although estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, 
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the next financial year, are as follows:
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
On completion of a business combination, the cost is allocated by recognising 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at fair value. 
Intangible assets are recognised where they are separable or arise from 
contractual or legal rights, and have a fair value that can be measured 
reliably. For the Group these intangible assets usually comprise contractual 
arrangements, customer relationships and technology based assets, 
but can also include acquired patents, software rights and licences and 
development costs.
In establishing the fair value for intangible assets recognised on acquisition 
and their estimated useful lives, the Group takes account of the individual 
60
Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
ACCOUNTING POLICIES on these translations are accounted for in other comprehensive income (OCI) 
and the translation reserve.
Business combinations
Businesses acquired are accounted for using the acquisition method of 
accounting with effect from the date control passes. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred. This is the fair 
values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Contingent consideration (not in the form of equity instruments) is 
accounted for as a financial liability and adjustments to contingent 
consideration are accounted for as gains or losses recognised through 
profit or loss and excluded from trading profit and underlying earnings.
Operating segments
The chief operating decision making body for the Group has been identified 
as the Board. It reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess 
performance and allocate resources. The internal reporting structure has 
been updated for the revised Group structure applicable from January 201 1 
and forms the basis of the Group’s segmental reporting. Comparatives have 
been restated to reflect the revised segmental structure and the segments 
are described further in note 1. All operating segments meet the definition  
of reportable segments. Details of the composition and purpose of the Board 
can be found on pages 34 to 37 .
The Board assesses the performance of operating segments based on 
revenue, trading profit as defined above and operating cash generation. 
Interest income and expenditure, and taxation, are not segmented and 
are reviewed by the Board on a Group basis. 
The Board does not review any information on segment assets and liabilities. 
Segment assets as disclosed in note 1 have been defined to include intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, inventory and 
trade and other receivables. They do not include tax receivables, cash and 
bank balances and derivative financial assets. 
The Group accounting policies are applied consistently across all segments 
and activities. Trading between segments is contracted and priced at arm’s 
length commercial terms.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration, 
net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods not under a long term contract is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership and effective control of 
the goods have been passed to the customer, recovery of the consideration  
is probable, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably.  
In the case of contracts with a long duration, including contracts with a 
funded development phase, revenue is recognised based upon the fair value 
of work performed to date assessed with reference to completed contract 
milestones which have been accepted by the customer. 
Long term contract accounting as described in IAS 1 1 Construction Contracts 
is not generally applicable to the longer term contracts for sales of goods 
impairments of intangible assets and items deemed by the Directors to be of  
an exceptional nature such as the settlement of a long-standing commercial 
dispute. Underlying earnings are defined as trading profit less net underlying 
finance expense, which excludes the unwinding of acquisition related 
discounting, and after deducting taxation and non-controlling interests.
M&A related costs excluded from trading profit and underlying earnings include 
the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, the writing off 
of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written up on acquisition and 
costs charged post acquisition related to acquired share options. M&A related 
costs also include other direct costs associated with business combinations and 
direct costs arising from any terminated acquisitions or divestments.
Business restructuring costs comprise exceptional profits or losses associated 
with the restructuring of the Group’s business and site integrations including 
costs associated with the Excellence in Delivery programme.
All underlying measures include the revenue and operational results of both 
continuing and those operations being sold until the point of sale. 
Net debt is defined as the net of cash and cash equivalents less borrowings 
at the balance sheet date.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the financial statements of the parent 
company, Cobham plc, and of all its subsidiaries made up to the end of the 
financial period. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control, which is 
defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company 
until the date that control ceases. On derecognition, any amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are 
accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets 
or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
Joint ventures are entities where control is shared with one or more third 
parties. They are not consolidated but are accounted for using the equity 
method. The Group financial statements include the Group’s share of the post 
acquisition change in net assets and the profit or loss of the jointly controlled 
entity from the date that joint control commences until the date this ceases. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling. Most Group companies, 
including the parent company, use their local currency as their functional 
currency. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency 
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies 
are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and 
any exchange differences arising are taken to the income statement. 
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of foreign operations 
are translated at the closing exchange rates. Income statements of such 
undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange as an 
approximation for actual rates during the year. Exchange differences arising

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 entered into by Group companies. Where long term contract accounting 
is applicable, revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis 
whereby a portion of the contract revenue is recognised based on contract 
costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion. 
 
Revenue for services is recognised as the services are rendered with reference 
to the proportion of the service delivered to date. For ‘cost-plus’ contracts 
(typically with government departments and agencies), revenue is recognised 
to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred, plus a proportionate amount 
of the estimated fee earned. For contracts where revenue is determined on 
a unit activity basis, revenue is recognised on the basis of activity undertaken 
in the period.
Revenue excludes inter-company sales, value added tax and other sales taxes.
Taxation including deferred taxation
The tax expense relates to the sum of current tax and deferred tax. 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs from profit 
before taxation as reported in the income statement. Taxable profit excludes 
items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in 
respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Tax is 
charged or credited to the income statement except when it relates to items 
recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in OCI or in equity respectively. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred 
taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are 
fully authorised.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a business 
at the date of acquisition. Goodwill acquired is allocated at acquisition to 
the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.  
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill  
is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is capitalised and reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
On divestment of a business the attributable amount of goodwill is included 
in the determination of the profit or loss on divestment. This includes any 
exchange differences reclassified to the income statement from the 
translation reserve.
Research and development
Research expenditure not chargeable to customers is written off as incurred. 
Development costs not chargeable to customers are written off as incurred 
until it can be demonstrated that the conditions for capitalisation as 
described in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met. At that point further costs are 
capitalised as an intangible asset until the intangible asset is readily available 
for use and it is then amortised on a straight-line basis over the asset’s 
estimated useful life.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill which are acquired by the Group are 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
These include customer relationships, technology and software, trademarks, 
licences and patents. The only internally generated intangible assets are 
development costs which are capitalised as described above and internally 
developed software where asset recognition criteria are met. 
All other intangible assets are amortised over the asset’s estimated useful life 
on a straight-line basis as follows:
Customer relationships 2 to 15 years 
Technology and software 2 to 10 years
Development costs 2 to 10 years
Other intangible assets 6 months to 10 years
Useful lives are assessed for each asset on an individual basis taking into 
account the specific characteristics of the asset.
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is not depreciated, but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. 
Freehold and leasehold buildings, plant and equipment are held at historic 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to 
the asset.
All property, plant and equipment other than land is depreciated on a 
straight-line basis to the estimated residual values over the estimated useful 
lives. These lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold properties The period of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 to 15 years

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the 
income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating 
lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the first-in, first-out 
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution. Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving 
and defective items.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are stated at 
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation 
is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale 
is highly probable and expected to be completed within a year of the balance 
sheet date. The asset or disposal group is also available for immediate sale in 
its present condition and is being actively marketed at a price that is 
reasonable in relation to its current fair value. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial assets are recognised at trade date. When initially 
recognised, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value.
Financial assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of an asset 
at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation at each reporting date.
Financial assets are categorised and subsequently valued as follows: 
• Assets held at fair value through profit or loss are those categorised as held 
for trading under IAS 39 and are classified as current assets or non-current 
assets dependent upon maturity. Such financial assets are subsequently 
carried at fair value.
• Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments which are not quoted in an active market, including 
cash and cash equivalents. These are classified as current or non-current 
assets dependent upon maturity and included within trade and other 
receivables. The fair value of these financial assets is adjusted for transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the asset. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Estimated residual values and the estimated useful lives are reviewed annually 
and adjusted where necessary. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the 
relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Aircraft overhaul expenditure
Major overhaul expenditure on owned aircraft is capitalised when incurred 
and the resultant property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful 
economic life. Major overhaul costs that are contractually required on aircraft 
held under operating leases are provided for over the period between the 
scheduled maintenance events.
Investment properties
Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rentals or for capital 
appreciation, are stated at cost in the balance sheet. They are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis to their estimated residual value over their estimated 
useful lives of up to 50 years. 
Rental income is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis.
Impairment losses
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at 
least annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
In addition, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, 
are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.
Where there is an indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount of an asset 
is lower than its carrying amount. All impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement. 
An impairment loss (other than arising on goodwill) is reversed only after a 
change in the estimates used to assess recoverable amount and only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if 
no impairment loss had been recognised. Any reversal is recognised in the 
income statement.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their 
fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
As explained in note 25, the Group’s activities expose it primarily to the 
financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group uses foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap 
contracts to reduce these exposures and does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. Other derivative financial instruments 
may be used from time to time to hedge other exposures such as 
inflation risks. 
The Group has documented its risk management objectives and strategy 
for undertaking various hedge transactions, and utilises hedge accounting 
principles in relation to interest rate swaps. These are designated as cash 
flow hedges which mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in interest 
rates arising on floating rate debt. From time to time, the Group may also 
use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value 
of fixed rate borrowings, however there are no such contracts outstanding 
at the present time. Foreign exchange contracts entered into to mitigate 
foreign exchange impacts of trading in non-functional currencies, and 
inflation swaps entered into to mitigate inflation risks, are not accounted  
for using hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the 
date the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their 
fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged.
Where hedge accounting is applied, the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items is documented at the inception of the 
transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash 
flows (or fair values if appropriate) of hedged items.
Where interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, 
the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in OCI through 
the hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated 
in equity are reclassified to finance income and expense in the income 
statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a cash flow hedging derivative expires or is sold, or when a hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in the hedging reserve in equity at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a hedged transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in the 
hedging reserve in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement 
in that period.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or 
liability except when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more 
than 12 months. 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, the movements in fair value 
of the derivative instruments are included in the income statement as part 
of operating profit. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as a current 
or non-current asset or liability dependent upon the expected realisation 
of the assets or settlement of the liabilities.
None of the Group’s material financial assets fall into the held to maturity 
or available for sale categories which are defined as follows: 
• Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
maturity dates which the Group intends to hold to maturity.
• Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets 
either designated by management as available for sale or not falling into 
any of the above categories. 
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are categorised on initial recognition as liabilities held at fair 
value through profit or loss, or other liabilities held at cost. Liabilities held at 
fair value through profit or loss are those categorised as held for trading under 
IAS 39 and are classified as current or non-current liabilities dependent upon 
the maturity date of the instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments are categorised as held for trading unless they 
are designated as hedges. 
The fair value of financial liabilities held at cost (not at fair value through profit 
or loss) is adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of the liability. Financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value; financial liabilities not 
at fair value through profit or loss are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost, reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Allowances for 
irrecoverable amounts are made when there is evidence that the Group may 
not be able to collect the amount due. All trade receivables which are more 
than six months overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable 
amounts determined by reference to past default experience. Amounts 
which are less than six months overdue are provided where recovery of the 
balance due is considered to be doubtful. The impairment recorded is the 
difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the present 
value of the estimated future cash flows. Any impairment required is recorded 
in the income statement in administrative expenses. The balance may be 
written off in full generally where receivables are in excess of 12 months old. 
At that time any amounts previously provided for impairment are released. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that 
are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement. 
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the amount of 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Borrowing costs, net of amounts 
capitalised, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are charged to the income statement and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in 
the period in which they arise. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable 
to relevant property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost 
of that asset.
Trade payables
Trade payables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value.

CONTINUED Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting 
all of its liabilities. 
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a 
specific date or at the option of the preference shareholders or if dividend 
payments are not discretionary. Dividends on preference share capital 
classified as liabilities are recognised in the income statement as 
finance expense.
Treasury shares
When ordinary share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the Company, 
the shares are held as treasury shares. The consideration paid, including 
commissions and taxes, is deducted from retained earnings and total 
shareholders’ equity. The proceeds of any treasury shares subsequently sold 
or re-issued, net of commission and taxes, are recognised as an increase in 
retained earnings and total shareholders’ equity.
Share-based payments
For grants made under the Group’s equity settled share-based payment 
schemes, amounts which reflect the fair value of options awarded as at 
the time of grant are charged to the income statement over the relevant 
vesting periods.
The valuation methodology for all schemes is based on the Black-Scholes 
model, modified where required to allow for the impact of market related 
performance criteria and taking into account all non-vesting conditions.
 
Accounting standards not yet effective
A number of amendments to existing standards have been published that 
are mandatory for future accounting periods, subject to EU endorsement. 
Those which are applicable from 1 January 2012 are as follows:
• Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
• Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets. 
• Amendments to IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS: Severe Hyperinflation 
and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-Time Adopters.
None of these have been adopted early by the Group or are expected  
to have an impact on the Group’s financial reporting.
There are also a number of new standards and amendments to existing 
standards which, once endorsed by the EU, will be effective from 1 January 
2013 and 2015. These include IFRS 9, 10, 1 1, 12 and 13. Management are 
currently assessing the impact of these changes on the future reporting 
of the Group’s operations. 
Provisions
A provision is required when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that settlement will 
be required at an amount that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant 
products, at management’s best estimates of the expenditure required to 
settle the Group’s liabilities. 
Contract loss provisions are recognised for onerous contracts when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant 
periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased 
operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months. Costs are 
charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft. 
Maintenance carried out on a cycle of 12 months or less is charged to the 
income statement as incurred.
When aircraft are leased, it is customary for the contract to contain specific 
conditions regarding the configuration of the aircraft on its return to the 
lessor at the end of the lease. The estimated cost associated with fulfilling 
these requirements is charged to the income statement on an aircraft 
utilisation basis. 
Provisions for claims made against the Group and commitments made under 
performance guarantees are recognised at management’s best estimates of 
the expenditure required to settle the Group’s liabilities. 
Provisions are discounted at an appropriate risk-free rate when the 
impact is material.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined 
contribution schemes. 
For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating profit are 
the current service costs. Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments 
arising on a business divestment are included in profit on divestment. Past 
service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement if the 
benefits have vested. If the benefits have not vested, the costs are recognised 
over the period until vesting occurs. The expected return on assets and 
interest cost are shown within finance income and expense. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised immediately in OCI.
Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held 
separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee administered funds. 
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured 
on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate 
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond 
of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities. The actuarial 
valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance 
sheet date. The resulting net defined benefit asset or liability is presented 
separately on the face of the balance sheet.
For defined contribution schemes the amounts charged to the income 
statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits 
are the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions 
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are recorded as either 
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT 
For the year ended 31 December 201 1 1. Segmental information
Operating segments
The Group reports four segments whose revenue and results are reported to the Board. The principal activities of these segments are as follows:
Cobham Aerospace and Security Providing end-to-end avionics and communication equipment, law 
enforcement and national security solutions, and satellite communication 
equipment for land, sea and air applications.
Cobham Defence Systems Critical technology for network centric and intelligence operations, moving 
information around the digital battlefield with customised and off-the-shelf 
solutions for people and systems to communicate on land, sea and air.
Cobham Mission Systems Providing safety and survival systems for extreme environments, nose-to-tail 
refuelling systems and wing-tip to wing-tip weapons carriage and release 
equipment for fast jets, transport aircraft and rotor craft, and remote 
controlled robots and fully-equipped bomb disposal vehicles for homeland 
security and military applications.
Cobham Aviation Services Delivering outsourced aviation services for military and civil customers 
worldwide through military training, special mission flight operations, 
outsourced commercial aviation and aircraft engineering.
Changes to the Group’s segmental reporting structure were announced in February 201 1, to bring together businesses with similar markets or technology 
consistent with the Group’s strategic objective of creating scale in each of its markets. 
To reflect these changes, Avionics and Surveillance has been renamed Aerospace and Security to better reflect the operations of this division. A number of 
businesses were moved from Defence Systems to Aerospace and Security including Defence Communications, Antenna Systems, Passive Microwave Products 
and US Composites.
Further changes to the segmental reporting structure followed the announcement in the interim management statement released on 6 May 201 1 that the 
Group was planning to divest two non-core businesses, Analytic Solutions and Commercial Systems. The segmental results shown below reflect the current 
structure of the results as reported to the Board, with non-core businesses reported as a separate segment. 
The comparative information shown below has been restated to reflect these changes.

will absorb an estimated £66.8m of shareholders’ funds. This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been 
included as a liability in these financial statements. If authorised, it will be paid on 1 June 2012 to shareholders who are on the register of members as at 4 May 
2012. The total dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 201 1 will therefore be 8.0 pence per share (2010: 6.0 pence). The total amount 
payable in respect of 201 1 will be £86.4m.

Business restructuring costs of £38.5m (2010: £23.4m) were incurred as part of the Group’s Excellence in Delivery programme. All costs were incremental to 
normal operations and exclusively relate to the design and implementation of Standard Operating Frameworks within the sites identified as principal locations, 
site consolidation, asset write downs and workforce reduction costs. Business restructuring in 201 1 also includes a gain of £6.6m on the disposal of property 
held for sale at 31 December 2010 following a site integration. In 2010 other business restructuring primarily related to profits from the sale of part of a site 
due to the relocation of a business to a site with a smaller footprint.     
Underlying profit excludes the profit on business divestments and similar income (see note 30).
Underlying administrative expenses, which exclude unrealised movements in non-hedge accounted derivative financial instruments, business restructuring, 
amortisation of intangible assets recognised on business combinations, the settlement of a commercial dispute and other M&A related adjustments,

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill. Goodwill is allocated to the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes. The Group tests goodwill impairment for each cash generating unit (CGU) annually or more frequently if there 
are indications that goodwill might be impaired. As a result of the site integration and other Excellence in Delivery activity CGUs are now typically considered 
to be Strategic Business Units (SBUs) while in 2010 CGUs were typically Business Units. In this year of transition a review has been performed to ensure that this 
change has not prevented any impairments from being recognised had the testing been performed at Business Unit level, with no issues identified. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise. The only specific 
condition in 201 1 related to a business held for sale as at 31 December 201 1 and £7 .0m of goodwill has been written down to align the net assets of the business 
with the likely proceeds of divestment. If this business was not held for sale then no adjustment would have been required on a value in use valuation basis. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for 
which management have detailed plans. Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s time 
value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The Group annually prepares cash flow forecasts for the following five years at SBU level and this is approved by management. The growth rate assumed after 
this five year period is based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU. The long-term projections used are in the range 2.5% to 3.0%. 
The growth rates assume that demand for the Group’s products in the USA and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment 
in the long-term future. Taking into account the expectation of future market conditions management believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct 
costs will reflect past practices. Where five year forecasts are not available for a CGU the long-term growth projections are applied to the following year’s cash 
flow forecast.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows are within the range 9.0% to 10.8% (2010: 10. 1%), having considered the country and currency risks 
in the principal territories in which the Group operates.
The goodwill allocated to four CGUs are considered to be individually significant as they represent more than 10% of the Group’s total goodwill carrying value. 
Key assumptions and sensitivities of these CGUs are as follows:
Goodwill  
carrying value
(£m)
Headroom
£m)
Pre-tax  
discount rate
Sensor Systems 229 246 9.7%
Antenna Systems 142 1, 152 9.5%
Tactical Communications and Surveillance 109 383 9.4%
Life Support 86 586 9.7%
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and no impairment losses would arise if the discount rate increased by 20%, if the growth rate was zero or if cash flows 
reduced by 20%.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to 
exceed its recoverable amount.

All of the Group’s investment properties are held under freehold interests and are valued under the cost model.
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to £1.7m (2010: £1.7m), which is net of all direct costs associated with 
the leasing of the property except depreciation. The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 5 and 25 years, 
commencing between 1998 and 2010.
The fair value of the Group’s UK investment properties has been assessed to be £1 1.8m (2010: £10.8m). These values are based on Directors’ estimates using 
current market data. The fair value of the Group’s investment property in the USA is assessed to be US$10.5m (2010: US$10.0m) based on market data.
13. Investments in joint ventures
The Group has the following interests in joint ventures within the Aviation Services segment:
• 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Défense Service SA, a company incorporated in France.
• 50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England.
• 50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England.
• 50% of the voting share capital in FB Leasing Limited, a company incorporated in England.
Notwithstanding the fact that the holding is 45%, the governance structure for Aviation Défense Service SA is such that the Group has joint control with 
its partner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.
Within the Cobham Aerospace and Security segment the Group has a 50% interest in Northrop Grumman Cobham Intercoms LLC, a company incorporated 
in the USA.

This allowance is reviewed by management on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary. The amounts are 
generally determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand. Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, 
consequently, to reversal of amounts previously provided. No inventory was written off directly to the income statement (2010: £nil).
Inventory will be realised within the normal operating cycle of the businesses and the amount expected to be realised after more than 12 months is not

IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the 
measurements. All financial instruments measured at fair value in the table above are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have 
been determined using significant inputs which are based on observable market data.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by the use of valuation techniques, primarily 
discounted cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates, whilst the fair value of bank overdrafts and floating 
rate loans are based on market values. The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities are assumed to approximate 
to their fair values due to their short-term nature.
As at 31 December 201 1, the fair value of the fixed rate senior notes is £370.4m (2010: £394.7m). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of all other financial assets and liabilities recorded in these financial statements is equal to, or approximates 
to, their fair value.
The Group’s investment in the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft companies as described in note 16d is classified as available for sale. The Group does not hold 
any financial assets which would be classified as held to maturity.
The total interest income and expense for financial assets and liabilities not held at fair value through profit or loss is as shown in note 4.

requirement to provide security over the residual value of leased assets under an agreement which expires in 2020 but can be realised within three months 
under the terms of the agreements. Also, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, a small number of accounts have been established,

Total borrowings 578.1 799.1
US$350.0m of borrowings were repaid following the divestment of the Analytic Solutions business in October 201 1, including floating rate revolving credit 
facilities and fixed rate loan notes.
Bank loans and overdrafts include a total of £100.4m (2010: £275.4m) drawn under a revolving multi-currency credit agreement of £300.0m which expires in 
July 2012. Refinancing has been agreed in the form of a forward starting US$360.0m multi-currency revolving credit agreement which was signed in October 
201 1. This facility is available from April 2012 and matures in October 2016, with a lender’s option to extend for up to two years. Interest is payable at LIBOR 
plus margin.
The drawdowns under the revolving multi-currency credit agreement are for periods not exceeding three months and hence the balance is reported within 
current borrowings. All bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Other principal borrowing facilities include a US$75.0m (£48.3m) fully drawn credit agreement which expires in December 2031 although the lender has 
a series of put options exercisable every three years from December 2013. In addition, senior notes are outstanding as set out below:

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 Warranty claims
The warranty provision represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s liability under warranties granted on products sold, based on past experience 
and industry averages for defective products. It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year.
Contract loss provisions
Contract loss provisions represent management’s best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under those contracts. The timeframe within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, 
but is generally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions
Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased 
operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months, and where specific conditions exist regarding the state of a leased aircraft on its return to 
the lessor at the end of the lease. Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision. The 
provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity or on incurring the expenditure required to return 
the aircraft to the state of maintenance required before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Provisions related to businesses divested
These provisions relate to businesses divested in prior years and include amounts provided in respect of the divestment of MTS in 2009 and warranties given 
on the divestments of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group in 2005. All amounts have been determined based on management’s 
current estimates of likely outcomes. Due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of settlement of these items, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
Other provisions
Other provisions include amounts provided in respect of announced business restructuring and legal claims. All amounts have been determined based on 
management’s current estimates of likely outcomes and most are expected to be settled within one year.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of £64.9m (2010: £65.6m) potentially available for offset against future capital profits in certain 
circumstances. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams. These 
losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £51 1.2m (2010: £403.9m).
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012, with further reductions proposed to reduce the rate to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The Group’s share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures (included within the Group’s share of assets and 
liabilities as shown in note 13) was £3.9m (2010: £3.7m).

Interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedging instruments and hedge accounting is applied. There is no material ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges 
to be reported through the income statement.
Foreign exchange and inflation derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are recorded in the income statement 
as part of operating profit. The movement in the fair value of currency swaps which offset movements in currency balances are offset against exchange 
movements in those balances in the income statement.
Full details of the Group’s financial instrument accounting policies and risk management strategies, objectives and policies are set out in the statement 
of accounting policies and in note 25.
Following the divestment of the Analytic Solutions business and repayment of a portion of floating rate debt during the year as described in note 19, a number 
of interest rate swaps were cancelled. These interest rate swaps had previously been designated as cash flow hedges and the related hedge reserve has been 
reclassified to the income statement.
Interest rate swaps which had previously been designated as cash flow hedges were also cancelled in 2009, and the related hedge reserve is being amortised 
over the life of the original forecast issuance (the hedge item). In 201 1, £3.6m (2010: £3. 1m) was reclassified from the hedge reserve to the income statement 
and reflected in finance expense.
24. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of £24.0m (2010: £30.8m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the schemes.
£0.8m (2010: £3.7m) was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 201 1.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan (CPP).  The assets of all of these 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members 
since 2003.
Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries, 
the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2009. Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable 
country regulations. The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 201 1.
91
Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 As part of the Group’s risk management strategy for defined benefit obligations, certain liabilities relating to past service of pensioner and deferred members of 
defined benefit schemes were subject to a buy-in arrangement on 14 December 201 1. Under the terms of this arrangement, the schemes impacted transferred 
assets to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides annuity payments equal to the liabilities covered by the arrangement 
as they fall due. This eliminates the Group’s exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these liabilities and is a meaningful, but not yet 
significant, first step of a project to review the Group’s exposure to risks associated with pension obligations.
The buy-in did not impact on the reported profits of the Group for the year or on the defined benefit obligations calculated under IAS 19. The insurance 
contract asset is measured at a value equal to the related liabilities. Contributions of £19.6m were payable into the schemes representing the difference 
between the cost of this asset and the net obligations transferred.
Additional contributions of £7 .9m were paid in 2010 to the CPP in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which completed in 2005. 
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 201 1 or 2010 for the defined benefit schemes.
Following the disposal of the Engineering Consultancy Group business, curtailment gains of £1.4m have been recognised in the income statement.
The amount recognised in the income statement also includes £12.5m relating to past service following changes to the rate of certain UK pension increases.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
2011 2010
UK Schemes USA Scheme UK Schemes USA Scheme
Rate of increase in salary costs 3.62% 3.62% 4.09% 4.09%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.12% 3.12% 3.59% 3.59%
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.12% 3.12% 2.89% 3.59%
Discount rate 4.85% 4.85% 5.42% 5.54%
Inflation assumption 3.12% 3.12% 3.59% 3.59%
Expected return on scheme assets 5.12% 5.46% 6.25% 6.80%
The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experience of members within the scheme and also allow for future 
mortality improvements. The mortality assumption used in 2010 was denoted by actuaries as ‘PA92 year of birth long cohort’. The more recent tables known 
as ‘SAPS CMI 09’ have been used for 201 1. In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below:
Year of birth Year age 65
Further life 
expectancy
Male 1946 2011 22.5 years
Female 1946 2011 24.6 years
Male 1980 2045 25.8 years
Female 1980 2045 27.9 years
At 31 December 201 1 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% (2010: 20%) of their pension for cash at retirement. This implies a full 
take-up of the permitted 25% (2010: 25%) commutation by approximately 80% (2010: 80%) of eligible members on retirement.

business divestment).
The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$30. 1m (2010: US$26.0m) and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme 
is US$18.4m (2010: US$1 7 .5m).
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions is provided below:
• Increasing the discount rate by 0. 1% would decrease scheme liabilities by £10.2m.
• Increasing the inflation rate by 0. 1% would increase scheme liabilities by £6.9m. 
• If each scheme member was expected to live for an additional year then scheme liabilities would increase by £1 1.8m.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since transition to IFRS is £166.8m 
loss (2010: £126.2m loss). Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year for changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities, approximately 
£60m relating to the decrease in the discount rate mitigated by approximately £40m increase relating to the inflation assumption and £19m relating to changes 
in the mortality assumption.
The actual return on scheme assets was £7 .6m loss (2010: gain £54.0m). The Group expects to contribute £19.4m to its defined benefit pension schemes 
in 2012.

A number of the Group’s subsidiaries based in France contribute to a retirement indemnity scheme. The liabilities of the scheme were valued by an 
independent actuary as at 31 December 2010 at €3.8m and are recorded in these financial statements at £3.2m (2010: £3.3m). These liabilities are included 
in other liabilities in note 20. A German subsidiary acquired during the year has some retirement obligations that are covered by an insurance policy. The gross 
value of these obligations are €2.2m.

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED 25. Financial risk management
The Group’s multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rates. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the 
financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rate swaps. Other derivative 
financial instruments may be used from time to time to hedge other exposures such as inflation risks. The financial risk management policies agreed by the 
Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below. The Group does not trade in financial instruments or use complex derivative 
financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk
The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments including 
those in Australia and other European countries. As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ exchange rates. The 
Group’s policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk. All currency exposures are reviewed regularly 
and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s total foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, translated at the relevant year-end 
exchange rates, are as follows:
2011 2010
£m US$ € AUS$ US$ € AUS$
Monetary assets 235.5 100.9 107.8 268.8 86.7 85.3
Monetary liabilities (647.3) (49.4) (98.8) (882.9) (37.8) (109.5)
Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Group’s overseas net assets. The Group typically 
borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the USA and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge. The following borrowings (included  
in monetary liabilities in the table above) and foreign exchange contracts match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets:
£m 2011 2010
US dollar borrowings 460.1 526.9
US dollar foreign exchange contracts 193.0 161.0
On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries (which include monetary assets and liabilities shown in the tables above) are translated at closing 
exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in other comprehensive income and the translation reserve (note 27). 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and 
liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency. The Group undertakes a formal process 
to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional 
currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts. 
The sterling/US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which non-US based 
subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities, and the proportion of the Group based in the USA. In addition to the longer term borrowing 
structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts. It is the Group’s current belief that 
the net dollar receipts by its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for net sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December:
US$m amount Average US$: £ exchange rate
2011 2010 2011 2010
Expiring within one year 138.5 182.7 1.59 1.56
Expiring within one to two years 63.8 52.4 1.59 1.60
Expiring after two years 46.2 83.1 1.61 1.61
248.5 318.2 1.59 1.58
The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is December 2014.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies. The sensitivities below represent 
management’s assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on experience over the previous five years. The sensitivity analysis of the 
Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the 
financial year. The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and includes the effect of derivative financial instruments. 
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity.

The exposure to movements in exchange rates arises due to outstanding non-functional currency financial instruments, receivables and payables at the year 
end, including borrowings.
In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency,

Australian dollars 10% (0.1) (0.1) 10% (0.1) (0.1)
Interest rate risk
The Group has various long and short-term borrowings, principally in US dollars and Australian dollars at both fixed and floating rates of interest. The Group 
continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs. Group policy 
is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to use interest rate swaps to manage 
the interest rate risk. 
Borrowings are held under both fixed and floating rates as follows:
£m 2011 2010
Fixed rates 
Senior notes 313.0 334.2
Floating rates 
Bank loans and overdrafts 162.4 361.2

Loan notes 1.5 3.7
Other borrowings and finance leases 1.4 1.0
265.1 464.9
578.1 799.1
All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates. Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are as follows, all are 
designated as cash flow hedges: 
Period of swap contract 2011 2010
Hedged item Fixed rate from to Currency value £m Currency value £m
US dollar loans 3.22% June 2010 June 2013 US$65.0m 41.8 US$260.0m 166.1

6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$14.3m 9.4 AUS$16.1m 10.5
248.3 454.3
The Group does not currently hold any interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments.
Surplus funds are placed on short term fixed rate deposit and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure.

Liquidity risk
The Group has a positive cash flow from operating activities and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional 
basis. For short-term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement. In the US a 
central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security 
and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders. 
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft and revolving credit facilities. The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Group’s 
financial liabilities. The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.

In addition, and to provide flexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity, it is the Group’s policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
in various currencies. At 31 December 201 1, £202. 1m (2010: £46.6m) was available to the Group under existing facilities, including the £300.0m multi-currency 
facility which expires in July 2012. As shown in note 19, a new facility for US$360.0m has been agreed to replace this facility.
Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a range 
of reputable financial institutions, such counterparties are banks with satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The levels of 
credit risk are monitored through the Group’s ongoing risk management processes, which includes a regular review of the banks’ credit ratings. Risk in this area 
is limited further by setting a maximum level for deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. Customers are typically 
large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships. The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit 
checks on potential customers before sales are made. Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where 
necessary to minimise any credit risk. The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for 
impaired receivables. 
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis. At 31 December 201 1, 
6.5% (2010: 6. 1%) of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 201 1 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 16. Letters of credit are the only 
collateral held as security against trade receivables. These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure 
less than £1.0m of receivables.

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 The Group has pledged assets only in respect of bank accounts as disclosed in note 1 7 and a small amount of finance leases. No assets have been pledged 
in respect of any of the Group’s primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities. 
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances. In the normal course of business these bank accounts are 
settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the financial statements. In the event of an automatic enforcement event the 
bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Inflation risk
The Group’s exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity. During 201 1, a specific 
operational contract was agreed for which it was deemed appropriate to enter into a swap to manage the inherent inflation risk in the contract. 
Capital risk management
Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders’ equity, excluding non-controlling interests, totalling £1,018.6m at 31 December 
201 1 (2010: £1,075.8m), so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Within this overall 
policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings. Funding needs are reviewed periodically and 
also each time a significant acquisition or business divestment is made. A number of factors are considered which include the net debt/EBITDA ratio, future 
funding needs (usually potential acquisitions) and proposed dividend levels. Group banking arrangements are also considered, these include financial covenants 
which are based on adjusted IFRS results. This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic 
climate, continues to be considered appropriate. There have been no breaches of the terms of the Group banking arrangements or defaults during the 
current or prior year.
During the year the Board considered that the proceeds from exiting sub-scale and other non-strategic businesses were estimated to be broadly surplus to 
funding requirements and consequently £150.0m of capital was returned to shareholders through a share buy-back programme; further details are shown 
in note 26.

every member holding Ordinary Shares who is present in person or by a duly authorised representative has one vote and on a poll every member who is 
present in person or by proxy has one vote for every £1 in nominal value of the shares of which the member is the holder.
75,951,724 shares were acquired by the Company in the year to 31 December 201 1 under the share buy-back plan announced on 3 March 201 1 and these are 
held as treasury shares. The total cost of these shares is £150.0m (plus £1.0m of commissions and taxes) which has been deducted from retained earnings and 
total shareholders’ equity. 
Additional treasury shares have also been purchased by the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust in connection with a number of the Group’s share incentive 
schemes, and shares have been transferred from the trust to employees upon vesting of share schemes during the period. No new shares have been issued 
during 201 1 in connection with the exercise of share options. 
In addition to the Ordinary Shares described above, 19,700 6% second cumulative Preference Shares have been issued which represent 0. 1% of total issued 
share capital. These are non-redeemable and are classified as borrowings with a value of £19,700.

The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising on the results and financial position of subsidiaries whose functional currencies differ 
from the Group’s reporting currency. Foreign exchange movements arising on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are also included here and 
following the settlement of the financial instrument, any balances remaining are transferred to retained earnings.
The hedging reserve reflects movements in fair values on cash flow hedging derivatives as detailed in notes 23 and 25.
The share options reserve includes the cost of share options as assessed under IFRS 2 together with deferred tax provided under IAS 12 relating to share-based 
payments, where the calculated future tax benefit is in excess of the amount charged to date under IFRS 2. Where share options which gave rise to charges 
under IFRS 2 have been exercised, the appropriate proportion of the share options reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
Retained earnings includes the purchase of Cobham plc ordinary shares by the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust in connection with the Cobham Bonus 
Co-investment Plan, the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme and the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme, and the allocation of the shares 
upon the exercise of options. Unallocated shares are held as treasury shares. At 31 December 201 1, the trust held 2,828,612 (2010: 1,959,353) ordinary shares 
with a market value of £5.2m (2010: £4.0m).

Group financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 Details of the schemes which give rise to these charges are as follows:
Equity settled share-based payment schemes
The Group operates a number of incentive schemes for certain senior executives as follows:
• The Cobham Performance Share Plan (PSP).
• The Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan (BCP).
• The Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS).
The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares which mainly vest 50% based on the Group’s three year Total Shareholder Return relative to that 
of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Group’s underlying EPS over the same period.
The BCP scheme allows participants to defer up to 50% of their net earned annual performance bonus into Cobham shares in return for an opportunity to earn 
up to a 2:1 matching award of shares against the gross bonus invested, based on three-year Economic Profit growth targets.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Group’s Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are 
granted. Exercise is conditional upon the Group’s underlying EPS growth over a three year period. The scheme also includes a ‘time-only’ section which is 
offered to participants based in the USA. This allows for options to be granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued 
employment within the Group.
Further details of the above schemes can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 47 and 48. 
Entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme (ShareSave) is available to all employees of participating UK subsidiaries. Employees may purchase 
the Group’s shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a two-week period each year, up to an HMRC imposed maximum contribution 
value of £3,000 in any one year. The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employee’s share savings plan and will only be released to employees who 
remain in the Group’s employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.

The number of BCP awards shown in the table above reflects matching shares granted against the net bonus invested and will be grossed up for tax at the time 
of vesting. The rules of the BCP scheme allow for a matched award based on the gross amount of the bonus, dependent upon satisfaction of the performance 
conditions. The exact amount of the entitlement will be ascertained upon vesting of the awards. For the award vesting in 201 1, the operation of the gross up 
mechanism resulted in an additional 348,267 matching shares being awarded to the holders of the 541,452 matched shares exercised in year.
Under the ESOS and ShareSave schemes, exercises were made at various times throughout the year. The average share price in that period was £2.024 
(2010: £2.330).

Expected volatility was determined through the assessment of the historical volatility over a period consistent with the expected life of the award. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. The expected employee cancellation rate is based on an assessment of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of 
contracts by employees.
Most participants of the PSP scheme receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the 
valuation model.
Cash settled share-based payment schemes
Share appreciation rights (SARs) were issued in 2006 and 2007 to a number of senior executives which required the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the 
award to the employee at the date of exercise. These awards vested in 2009 and the majority expired in November 201 1. The expense for the year for these 
awards was £0.2m credit (2010: £0.2m credit), arising from changes in the fair value of the outstanding awards at the balance sheet date together with 
additional amounts arising at the date of exercise. The fair value of the SARs outstanding at 31 December 201 1 was £0. 133 (2010: £0.204).

On 19 October 201 1 the divestment of the Group’s Analytic Solutions business was announced, for consideration of $351. 1m on a debt-free, cash-free basis. 
The divestment was completed on 16 November 201 1. The results of Analytic Solutions have been reported within continuing operations as the business 
sold does not form a separate line of business for the Group and does not qualify for disclosure as a discontinued operation. 
The divestment of the Engineering Consultancy Group (ECG), part of Cobham Technical Services (within Aerospace and Security) was completed on 
1 7 February 201 1. Consideration comprised £13.5m on a debt-free cash-free basis, realising a net profit on divestment of £4.9m.
In addition, the sale of Cobham MAL Limited (MAL) was completed on 19 December 201 1, realising a loss on divestment before tax of £6.4m. MAL formed 
part of the non-core Commercial Systems business.
The profit on divestments, which has been excluded from trading profit, can be analysed as follows:

205.9 261.0
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office and operational properties, and operational aircraft used in its 
service businesses.
32. Contingent liabilities and commitments
At 31 December 201 1, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters 
arising in the ordinary course of business. Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within 
the Group consolidated financial statements.
As the conditions of these guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no provision has been made at the year end.
The Company has also committed, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, to invest £6.0m in the equity share capital of three 
companies and to provide additional funding of £18. 1m in the form of redeemable loan notes by March 2013 at the latest. In addition, a number of 
performance guarantees and letters of credit have been provided to secure the funding of this project. No provision was made at 31 December 201 1  
or 2010 in connection with these guarantees.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management do not anticipate that 
the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations 
that arise in the ordinary course of business. In 2010, the Group identified one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years. The contract was 
in respect of goods provided into a geographic market which represents only a small amount of revenue for the Group. The circumstances surrounding this 
remain under review and the outcome still cannot be estimated. Resolution may take some time. No further information is disclosed as it could be prejudicial. 
At 31 December 201 1, the Group had commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of £3.9m (2010: £5.4m).

• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
• The parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Cobham plc for the year ended 31 December 201 1.
Stuart Watson 
Senior Statutory Auditor
for and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors
London
6 March 2012
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Cobham plc 
for the year ended 31 December 201 1 which comprise the parent company 
balance sheet, the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds, the 
accounting policies and the related notes. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out 
on page 58, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• Give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 201 1;
• Have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
• The part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• The information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which 
the parent company financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements.

Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF COBHAM PLC Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative contracts which are 
held at fair value, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable 
accounting standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). 
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, 
are as set out below.
Dividends 
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are 
fully authorised. Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right 
to receive payment has been established.
Pensions
The Company operates and contributes to a multi-employer defined benefit 
pension scheme. Contributions and pension costs are apportioned across 
the scheme as a whole and assessed in accordance with the advice of 
qualified actuaries. The scheme is closed to new members and has a high 
proportion of deferred and pensioner members from businesses that no 
longer participate in the scheme. The Company is therefore not able to 
identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a 
reasonable and consistent basis and in accordance with the multi-employer 
exemption contained in FRS 1 7 Retirement Benefits, the scheme has been 
accounted for as if it was a defined contribution scheme. The charge to the 
profit and loss account therefore reflects payments for the year. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit 
and loss account in the period the contributions are payable. 
The Company also makes contributions for certain employees to individual 
personal pension and stakeholder schemes. Contributions are charged to the 
profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right 
to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable when, on the basis of 
all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on 
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax has not been discounted.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, comprising software, are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. They are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives which range from three to five years.
Tangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are initially recognised at cost and depreciated on a straight-line 
basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives which 
range from three to six years. 
Investments in Group and other undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment in value and include the fair value at the date of grant of share 
options awarded to employees of subsidiary undertakings, net of amounts 
recovered as management charges.
Other investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment 
in value.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
settlement will be required of an amount that can be reliably estimated.
Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
agreements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting 
all of its liabilities.
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a 
specific date or at the option of the preference shareholders or if dividend 
payments are not discretionary. Dividends on preference share capital 
classified as liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account as 
interest expense. 
Treasury shares
When ordinary share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the Company, 
the shares are held as treasury shares. The consideration paid, including 
commissions and taxes, is deducted from retained earnings and total 
shareholders’ equity.
 
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is sterling. Transactions in currencies 
other than the local currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at 
the balance sheet date. 
All exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account. 
In order to manage the Group’s exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, 
the Company enters into forward contracts and options which are accounted 
for as derivative financial instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses 
foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to reduce these 
exposures and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to 
time to hedge other exposures such as inflation risks. 
110
Parent company financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Group has documented its risk management objectives and strategy 
for undertaking various hedge transactions and utilises hedge accounting 
principles in relation to interest rate swaps. These are designated as cash 
flow hedges which mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in interest 
rates arising on floating rate debt. Foreign exchange contracts entered into 
to mitigate foreign exchange impacts of trading in non-functional currencies 
and inflation swaps entered into to mitigate inflation risks are not accounted 
for using hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the 
date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss 
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument 
and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
Where hedge accounting is applied, the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items is documented at the inception of the 
transaction. The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash 
flows (or fair values if appropriate) of hedged items.
Where interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, 
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in reserves. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the profit and loss account. Amounts accumulated in reserves are recycled 
to the profit and loss account in the periods when the hedged item affects 
profit or loss.
When a cash flow hedging derivative expires or is sold, or when a hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in reserves at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative 
gain or loss recognised in reserves is immediately transferred to the profit 
and loss account in that period.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or 
liability except when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more 
than 12 months. 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, the movements in fair value of 
the derivative instruments are included in the profit and loss account. 
The fair value of such derivatives is classified as a current or non-current 
asset or liability dependent upon the maturity of the contracts. 
Other financial instruments 
Amounts receivable from and owed to subsidiaries are recognised at their 
nominal value. Receivables are reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
For grants made to employees of Cobham plc under the Group’s share-based 
payment schemes, amounts which reflect the fair value of options awarded 
as at the time of grant are charged to the profit and loss account over the 
vesting period. The fair value of options awarded to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings, net of amounts recovered as management charges, is 
recognised as a capital contribution and recorded in investments.
The valuation of the options utilises a methodology based on the 
Black-Scholes model, modified where required to allow for the impact 
of market related performance criteria and taking into account all 
non-vesting conditions.

Parent company financial statements
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENTS IN SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
For the year ended 31 December 201 1 1. Dividends 
The following dividends on Ordinary Shares were authorised and paid during the year: 
£m 2011 2010
Final dividend of 4.372 pence per share for 2010 (2009: 3.971 pence)  49.8  45.8 
Interim dividend of 1.800 pence per share for 201 1 (2010: 1.628 pence)  19.6 18.8
69.4 64.6
In addition to the above, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 201 1 of 6.2 pence per share which will 
absorb an estimated £66.8m of shareholders’ funds. This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been 
included as a liability in these financial statements. If authorised, it will be paid on 1 June 2012 to shareholders who are on the register of members as at 4 May 
2012. The total dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 201 1 will therefore be 8.0 pence per share (2010: 6.0 pence). The total amount 
payable in respect of 201 1 will be £86.4m.
2. Directors’ emoluments and pension costs
Disclosures in respect of Directors’ emoluments can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 44 to 53 of the Group financial statements.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Company operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan (CPP) and the Cobham Executive Pension Plan (CEPP). The pension schemes are of 
the defined benefit type and assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The funds are valued every three years by a professionally qualified 
independent actuary and the rates of contribution payable are determined by the actuary. The latest effective dates of the actuarial assessment of the 
CPP and CEPP were 1 April 2009 and 1 April 2010 respectively. The assessments were updated to 31 December 201 1 at which date the total net liabilities of 
the schemes were assessed to be £29.0m. The Directors of the companies involved in the Group schemes will continue to monitor the pension deficits and 
take advice from independent actuaries as appropriate. 
As part of the Group’s risk management strategy for defined benefit obligations, certain liabilities relating to past service of pensioner and deferred members of 
the CEPP were subject to a buy-in arrangement on 14 December 201 1. Under the terms of this arrangement, assets were transferred to an insurance company 
in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides annuity payments equal to the liabilities covered by the arrangement as they fall due. This eliminates 
exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these liabilities and is a meaningful, but not yet significant, first step of a project to review 
the exposure to risks associated with pension obligations. 
The schemes have been accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account therefore reflects payments 
for the year.
Contributions to the Group schemes for 201 1 amounted to £0.3m (2010: £0.3m) of normal funding and an additional contribution of £1 7 .5m related to the 
buy-in arrangement (2010: £7 .9m connected to a prior year business divestment). No contributions were outstanding at the end of 201 1 or 2010.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The Company also operates and participates in the Cobham plc money purchase pension arrangements. The assets of the schemes are held separately from 
those of the Company in independently administered funds. The pension costs charged represents contributions payable by the Company to the funds and 
amounted to £0.6m (2010: £0.6m). No contributions were outstanding at the end of 201 1 or 2010.
3. Share-based payments
Employees of Cobham plc participate in the following equity settled share-based payment schemes which are operated by the Group for certain 
senior executives:
• The Cobham Performance Share Plan (PSP).

of vesting. The rules of the BCP scheme allow for a matched award based on the gross amount of the bonus, dependent upon satisfaction of the performance 
conditions. The exact amount of the entitlement will be ascertained upon vesting of the awards. For the award vesting in 201 1, the operation of the gross up 
mechanism resulted in an additional 277 , 1 72 shares being awarded to the holders of the 415,764 matched awards exercised in the year.
Under the ESOS and ShareSave schemes, exercises were made at various times throughout the year. The average share price in that period was

The impact of foreign exchange movement to the profit for the financial year is a £0.4m loss (2010: £0.4m loss).
Reserves are wholly attributable to equity interests.
224,670 (2010: 1 72,978) Ordinary Shares were purchased during the year in connection with the Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan and are held in treasury. 
Distributable reserves have been reduced by £0.4m (2010: £0.6m), being the consideration paid for these shares.
The profit and loss account also includes the purchase of Ordinary Shares by the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust in connection with the Cobham Bonus 
Co-investment Plan, the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme and the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme, and the allocation of the shares 
upon the exercise of options. Unallocated shares are held as treasury shares. The consideration paid for shares during the year was £14.3m (2010: £4. 1m) and 
£6.2m (2010: £0. 1m) was received as a result of the allocation of these shares to employees upon the exercise of options. At 31 December 201 1, the trust held 
2,828,612 (2010: 1,959,353) Ordinary Shares with a market value of £5.2m (2010: £4.0m).
The special reserve was created in 1996, with the sanction of the High Court, against which goodwill arising on subsequent acquisitions may be charged.
The share options reserve relates to provisions made in accordance with FRS 20 for shares allocated to the Company’s employees under the Group’s share 
option schemes. Where share options which gave rise to charges under FRS 20 have been exercised, the appropriate proportion of the share options reserve 
is transferred to the profit and loss account in equity. 
14. Contingent liabilities and commitments
The Company has contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
entered into, for, or on behalf of, certain Group undertakings. 
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability provision has been 
made at the year end.
The Company has committed, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, to invest £6.0m in the equity share capital of three companies 
and to provide additional funding of £18. 1m in the form of redeemable loan notes by March 2013 at the latest. In addition, a number of performance 
guarantees and letters of credit have been provided to secure the funding of this project. No provision was made at 31 December 201 1 or 2010 in connection 
with these guarantees.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION We have responded rapidly to 
meet the challenges presented 
by the current oil price 
environment. Longer term, 
our quality asset base stands 
us in good stead
Mike Welton 
Chairman
The industry context
2015 was another challenging year  
for the upstream oil and gas sector.  
The oil price, having started the year 
around US$55/bbl, fell to a low of 
US$36/bbl in December. Post the 
year-end, the price continued to fall, 
reaching a low of US$27/bbl in January. 
This has been driven by a number  
of factors, including the effects of 
significant investment in unconventional 
resources in the USA, OPEC’s strategy 
of pursuing market share over price, the 
anticipated return of Iran to the global 
oil market and concerns around Chinese 
economic growth. While it is generally 
agreed that the oil price will recover 
from current levels, as supply will be 
impacted by the significant reduction  
in capital investment across the sector, 
the timing and full extent of any  
such recovery is difficult to forecast. 
Consequently, 2015 saw the industry 
focus on re-setting its cost base and 
adjusting its expenditure plans in order 
to withstand such an environment. 
Premier’s reaction to the low  
oil price environment
Premier’s focus is to invest in high 
quality production and development 
opportunities, to maintain exposure  
to upside value through selective 
exploration, and to build on our core 
positions through acquisitions when the 
market conditions allow. In the current 
oil price environment, the Board’s 
priority has been to take measured 
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
08 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT actions to reset business plans to meet 
near-term priorities. Cost and capital 
discipline remain key to ensuring we  
are well placed to deliver maximum value  
from our existing production and current 
sanctioned developments, Solan and 
Catcher, as well as preserving the option 
for long-term growth through our Sea 
Lion project. Exploration activities in 
2016 will be reduced, whilst retaining  
in Brazil, Mexico and the Falklands the 
potential for material value creation in 
future years.
In this environment, Premier has been 
able to capture sustainable savings in 
operating costs, defer discretionary 
capital expenditure and actively manage 
the portfolio. At the same time, Premier 
delivered a good operational performance 
during 2015, with strong production 
across the portfolio, high levels of 
operating efficiency and declining 
operating costs. The Solan development 
project, which has been a challenging 
project since sanction, will achieve first 
oil shortly and the Catcher development 
project is under budget and on schedule 
for first oil in 2017 . 
We have continued to execute our 
strategy of actively managing our asset 
portfolio to ensure our capital and people 
are focused on high returning assets, and 
that our financial position is appropriate. 
The proposed acquisition of E.ON’s UK 
North Sea assets, announced since the 
year-end, is in line with this strategy  
and continues Premier’s track record  
of being able to add long-term value 
through acquisitions in low oil price 
environments. We also disposed of our 
Norwegian business in 2015, realising 
immediate value for the Company from 
long-term asset plays which required 
near-term investment.
We remain focused on managing  
our financial position and achieving  
the highest level of operational and 
safety performance, whilst maintaining 
optionality in the portfolio for future 
growth. During the year, we successfully 
renegotiated our financial covenants 
with our banks and bondholders. Our 
long-term, unsecured debt structure 
and supportive banking relationships 
provide considerable balance sheet 
flexibility. However, if current low oil 
prices persist, then a further relaxation 
of our main financial covenants may  
be required, which we are taking 
pre-emptive action to address.  
The proposed acquisition of E.ON’s  
UK North Sea assets provides a 
significant contribution to current  
cash flow and is materially covenant 
accretive. We retain strong relationships 
with our lending group, and we will 
continue to work closely with them  
as we have done throughout 2015. 
Health, safety and the environment
Health, safety and environmental 
matters continue to be of paramount 
importance to us. We will not compromise 
on the integrity and safety of our 
operations, ring-fencing associated 
expenditure with these areas. We are 
very pleased to be able to report that our 
trend of improved safety performance 
continued in 2015. Our Total Recordable 
Injury Rate stood at 1.27 per million  
man hours, significantly better than our 
target for the year. We are particularly 
proud of our track record on our 
operations in Vietnam and Indonesia 
which, at year-end 2015, had reached 
two and four million man hours 
respectively without a lost work day 
case. Our production operations 
management systems at Balmoral in  
the UK, and at Anoa and Gajah Baru  
in Indonesia, retained their OHSAS  
18001 and ISO 14001 certifications for 
Environmental/Occupational Safety  
and Health Management, as did our 
worldwide Drilling Management 
Systems. In addition, in December,  
our Chim Sáo facility in Vietnam was 
awarded the same accreditation which 
means that all our production and drilling 
operations are now accredited to these 
internationally recognised standards. 
People and governance
The composition of the Board remained 
constant throughout the year with the 
exception of the retirement of Andrew 
Lodge, Exploration Director, in June. 
Premier continues to comply in full  
with all aspects of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and attaches the 
highest importance to corporate 
governance matters. During the year 
we strengthened a number of areas  
of corporate governance including  
the Board’s succession planning and 
evaluation of the appropriate skills, 
knowledge and experience required 
for future Board appointments. Further 
details of the Board’s activities this year 
can be found in the Corporate Governance 
section of this Annual Report.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
once again to express my appreciation 
for the hard work and effort put into 
the business by Premier’s staff. Their 
continued dedication and enthusiasm 
in what are trying times for the industry 
should see us well placed amongst our 
peers to prosper in the future.
Shareholder returns 
Our goal remains to deliver long-term 
capital growth to our shareholders.  
Over the course of 2015, our share  
price fell by 70 per cent, as the whole  
of the sector suffered from the fall in 
commodity prices. As we enter 2016 
with the potential for a prolonged 
period of lower oil prices, our focus  
is on maintaining access to liquidity, 
lowering our cost base and taking action 
to allow us to reduce balance sheet  
debt once we have completed our 
sanctioned development projects. 
Well positioned for future growth
The oil industry is cyclical and few  
believe that the oil price will not recover 
from the current low levels as it has 
done in the past. Significant levels of 
capital investment across the industry 
have been deferred or cut back, which 
will impact future production and 
ultimately lead to a revival in the oil 
price. Our portfolio of 758 mmboe  
of reserves and resources remains a 
valuable asset and a basis for future 
growth. In the meantime, we are 
managing our business to withstand  
lower oil prices and I am confident  
that we will emerge from the current 
down cycle a leaner, more efficient 
organisation, in better shape to deliver 
future shareholder value.

A proven 
track record 
of full-cycle 
delivery
Premier aims to increase net asset value by 
investing in and executing the development 
of high quality oil and gas projects. 
Premier accesses the oil and gas reserves and resources to do this 
through successful exploration and by selectively acquiring assets. 
Premier also actively manages its portfolio through disposals and  
plans its business on a conservative basis. The cash flow generated  
from these activities continues to support investment in high quality 
projects and, subject to the oil price, a high impact but capital 
disciplined exploration programme, the repayment of debt and,  
where appropriate, cash returns to shareholders.
Premier seeks to replenish 
its reserve and resource base 
through successful exploration 
within a strict capital 
disciplined framework.
Future exploration and  
appraisal in the Falkland Islands 
along with new areas in Brazil 
and Mexico provide Premier 
with growth opportunities  
in the longer term.
While Premier is a full-cycle 
exploration and production 
company, we have an 
established and successful 
history of asset development. 
Solan and Catcher in the UK 
and the first phase of the Sea 
Lion project in the Falkland 
Islands will underpin future 
production growth.
Premier actively manages its portfolio to ensure the Group’s capital 
and people are focused on its highest return assets and where the 
Company is best placed to add value.
Premier seeks to maximise 
value from its low cost, stable 
production base to generate 
long-term cash flows. 
Stable production from 
assets in Indonesia, Vietnam, 
UK and Pakistan provides 
the cash generation to fund 
current and future projects.
Our 2015 key  
community

In 2015, Premier undertook  
a range of community investment 
projects, both new and ongoing.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Maximising  
cash flow from 
our low cost 
production
Premier seeks to maximise 
value from its low cost,  
stable production base  
to generate long-term  
cash flows.
Premier’s production base  
is focused around operated 
floating production systems, 
such as the Chim Sáo field  
in Vietnam, and the Group’s 
dominant position in the 
South East Asia gas market. 
Premier’s portfolio mix is 
changing as the weighting  
of our production assets 
shifts from taxed gas 
production in Pakistan to 
untaxed UK oil production. 
As a result, at flat oil prices, 
Premier’s production base 
becomes increasingly cash 
flow generative.

North Falklands Basin
The North Falklands Basin exploration campaign 
aimed to demonstrate the exploitation potential 
of the licence adjacent to the Sea Lion discovery,  
and to explore the upside potential of the 
southern licence in the basin.

Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements Re-focusing 
our portfolio
Premier actively manages its 
portfolio across the cycle to 
ensure the Group’s capital 
and people are focused  
on its highest return assets  
and where the Company is 
best placed to add value. 
Premier looks to add  
high quality assets to its 
portfolio through selective 
acquisitions where its 
position is commercially 
advantaged. This includes 
increasing its equity in assets 
in which Premier already has 
an interest and acquiring key 
assets which fit within 
Premier’s core areas of 
expertise. Premier also  
seeks to take advantage  
of opportunities arising  
as a result of oil price or 
capital market weakness. 
On disposals, Premier seeks  
to dispose of non-core assets 
which do not meet our internal 
hurdle rates, fit our financial 
profile or sit within our core 
area of expertise. These 
include mature producing 
assets with rising costs and 
pre-development projects.
Acquisition  
of assets
Premier has a track 
record of being able  
to add long-term  
value through 
acquisitions in low oil 
price environments.
Proposed acquisition  
of E.ON’s UK assets
Post the year end, Premier 
agreed to purchase E.ON’s 
UK North Sea assets for a  
net consideration of US$120 
million. The proposed 
acquisition significantly 
enhances the core UK 
business at a compelling 
valuation and adds stable 
UK gas revenues to the 
portfolio. It also offers  
the potential to generate 
significant operating and 
cost synergies across  
the combined UK North 
Sea business and allows 
Premier to accelerate the 
realisation of its significant 
tax assets in the UK. 
 
The acquisition is subject  
to the approval of 
shareholders, US Private 
Placement holders and the 
banks and this approval 
process is ongoing.

A challenging oil 
an d gas industry 
drives Premier’ s 
strategy
As a full-cycle exploration and 
production company, Premier is 
impacted by the volatility in the  
oil price. Premier looks to manage  
this through an active hedging 
programme and by planning its 
business on a conservative basis. 
Equity markets
Equity markets remained volatile in 
2015, affected by many of the themes 
driving the market in the preceding 
year. The performance of UK and 
European equities was particularly 
strong in the first quarter following a 
decision by the Governing Council of 
the ECB to expand its asset purchase 
programme and include government 
bonds and agencies and European 
institution debt. This strength continued 
into the second quarter despite concerns 
over the Greek sovereign debt crisis.  
A period of relative stability ended 
mid-August when Chinese growth 
concerns led to a significant sell-off in 
equity markets. A key theme throughout 
the year was the potential for a US 
interest rate rise, a hike becoming 
ever-more likely in the face of consistently 
strong US macroeconomic data, helping 
equity markets to rally into the end of 
the year, with the FTSE 250 ending the 
year 8 per cent higher. 
Over the course of the year Brent crude 
fell by 34 per cent and consequently the 
FTSE Oil & Gas sector underperformed 
the wider market, closing the year down 
21 per cent. Premier shares, which tend 
to be strongly correlated with the oil 
price, fell 70 per cent over the course  
of 2015, closing the year at 48 pence. 
Commodity prices
Crude oil benchmarks Brent and West 
Texas Intermediate (‘WTI’) continued the 
downward trend from the second half  
of 2014, falling below US$50/bbl early  
in the first quarter. Whilst there was a 
modest recovery in the second quarter 
with Brent trading in the US$60–70/bbl 
range, this was reversed in the third 
quarter and the benchmark price ended

Highlights
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
20 MARKET OVERVIEW the year at US$37.3/bbl, down 34 per 
cent from the beginning of the year. 
The weakness in oil prices compared  
to recent years was driven by the 
continued effects of an over supplied 
market, driven primarily by the growth  
in unconventional output in North America 
and OPEC’s, particularly Saudi Arabia’s, 
decision not to cut production to try to 
stabilise markets. In addition, the second 
half of the year saw concerns over the 
effect on global supply from the expected 
easing of Iranian sanctions and the 
impact of slowing growth in China.
Consensus around the outlook for the 
oil price remains relatively bearish in the 
short term, although the medium to 
long-term view is more positive as the 
fall in oil prices is expected to curtail 
the growth in US oil shale production 
combined with the effects of a slowdown 
in E&P investment more broadly from 
NOCs, the Majors and Independent 
producers as new developments are 
deferred. The correlation between the 
price of Brent and the high sulphur  
fuel oil (‘HSFO’) benchmark Sing180 
(which drives our Singapore gas pricing) 
remained strong in 2015, with Sing180 
also falling by 49 per cent through the 
year to finish at US$178/MT.
With a significant amount of the Group’s 
production either directly or indirectly 
linked to Brent, a fall in the commodity 
price affects Premier’s revenues, cash 
flows and the value of its underlying 
assets. To manage this and to protect 
our capital investment programme, 
Premier looks to sell forward up to  
50 per cent of its entitlement production, 
on a rolling forward 12–18 months time 
frame. In 2015, Premier hedged 55 per 
cent of its entitlement oil production  
at an average price of US$97 per barrel, 
and for 2016 has approximately 30 per 
cent hedged at US$68 per barrel 
(excluding the E.ON portfolio).
Investment and costs
Whilst global upstream capital investment 
in 2014 was broadly flat year-on-year, 
2015 saw a significant decline in capital 
expenditure as the effect of lower oil 
prices impacted operating cash flow  
and the industry’s appetite to invest in 
new developments with uncertainty over 
the duration of the current downturn in 
commodity prices.
The scope of cost reduction programmes 
initiated in the second half of 2014 was 
broadened during 2015 with all aspects 
of the cost base, both internal and 
external, targeted by upstream companies.
Reduced activity and a greater focus on 
costs inevitably impacts the oil service 
sector and whilst the response to a 
weakening market has varied across  
the supply chain, the trend has been 
firmly downwards. Rig rates had already 
fallen before the oil price collapse as 
the supply of new units coming into the 
market exceeded demand, and rates 
continued to be weak in 2015. Logistics 
and well service costs have also fallen, 
in some areas significantly.
Premier has delivered savings of 25 per 
cent in operating costs in 2015 including 
the sale of the high cost Scott area, and 
further like-for-like savings are planned 
in 2016. This has been achieved primarily 
by renegotiating rates with existing 
service providers, including in-house 
contractors, G&A reductions, lower 
insurance rates and savings on fuel 
costs as a result of the fall in oil prices.
On our yet unsanctioned projects,  
the market weakness has provided an 
opportunity to review cost estimates and 
to engage contractors in a favourable 
market. The Sea Lion project in particular 
has seen savings as studies have passed 
though the pre-FEED stage and should 
benefit from the reduced backlog in 
global offshore activity forecast in 
future years. 
Exploration 
2015 was another poor year for 
exploration for the industry with few 
notable discoveries. Discretionary 
capital expenditure is often the first 
item to be sacrificed in a falling oil  
price environment and this inevitably 
led to lower exploration activity,  
a trend that is expected to continue  
in 2016. Despite this, Premier enjoyed 
two further discoveries in the North 
Falklands Basin, Zebedee and Isobel 
Deep, confirming the emergence  
of a significant new hydrocarbon 
province that was established with  
the Sea Lion discovery. 
The continued focus on capital 
preservation as a result of the recent 
sharp fall in the oil price has caused 
exploration budgets to be tightened 
further. Rig rates remain at cyclical lows 
and we have taken advantage of the 
current market conditions to drill two 
commitment wells in the UK North Sea  
in 2016.
The current environment has also 
created opportunities to acquire new 
licences with reduced commitments 
and low entry costs. In Mexico, Premier 
teamed up with Talos Energy and 
Sierra Oil & Gas to acquire a 10 per 
cent interest in offshore Blocks 2 and 7 
in the country’s first licensing round. 
The interest is carried through to the 
first drilling decision where Premier 
has options to exit or increase its stake 
in this highly prospective acreage.
Acquisitions and disposal activity
The volatility in oil prices created 
significant uncertainty in M&A  
markets which resulted in a significant 
drop in deal completions in 2015. 
However, some major transactions 
were announced, most notably Shell’s 
acquisition of BG Group, which was 
completed in the first quarter of 2016.
In the North Sea, utility companies 
which had previously been highly 
acquisitive in acquiring upstream 
assets reversed that strategy. Both 
RWE and E.ON announced disposals  
of their Norwegian and UK E&P assets 
after making strategic decisions to  
exit the sector.
Premier took advantage of its position 
in the UK North Sea to announce the 
acquisition of E.ON’s UK E&P assets 
which is ongoing and subject to 
shareholder approval. The deal will 
add c15 kboepd to Premier’s portfolio 
and create significant value by utilising 
a portion of the Company’s sizeable 
UK tax loss position.
In Norway, the disposal of Premier’s 
business in November 2015 for  
US$120 million continued the 
Company’s active management  
of its portfolio, realising value from 
non-core assets despite tough  
market conditions.

Indonesia
Vietnam

Pakistan & Mauritania
Given the macroeconomic backdrop,  
it was important that in 2015, Premier 
remained focused on operational 
delivery and achieving the near-term 
priorities that we set ourselves.
As we move into 2016 there remains 
considerable uncertainty over the 
direction of oil prices. Premier was 
quick to react to the fall in the oil 
price, rationalising our business while 
retaining our core skills and never 
compromising the safety or performance 
of our operations. A low operating 
cost base ensures that we can operate 
effectively through a period of low oil 
prices and positions us well to take 
advantage of any future recovery.
Generating cash flow from our low 
cost, efficient production
Premier delivered a robust production 
performance in 2015, averaging 57.6 
kboepd (2014: 63.6 kboepd), in line with 
expectations and above our market 
guidance of 55 kboepd. This was driven 
by high operating efficiency of 90 per cent 
(2014: 84 per cent) across the Group’s 
assets. The reduction year-on-year 
largely reflects the sale of the Scott  
area production, which contributed  
3.8 kboepd in 2014.
In Asia, our operated Chim Sáo field  
in Vietnam continued to outperform, 
with high levels of operating efficiency, 
good reservoir performance and strong 
control of costs. Singapore’s demand 
for our Indonesian gas remained strong 
and our operated Natuna Sea Block A 
fields captured a market share well in 
excess of contractual allocation. Our 
gas contracts into Singapore generate 
long-term, stable cash flows for the Group, 
and we retain additional productive 
capacity as well as future development 
opportunities to back fill that deliverability, 
which will enable us to benefit from any 
contractual supply shortfall from other 
suppliers or strengthening of Singapore 
demand for our gas. In the UK, all fields 
produced in line with expectations, with 
good production efficiency across the 
portfolio, including Huntington which 
benefitted from an improved CATS 
export availability from April onwards. 
The UK business unit’s performance  
was also aided by the first full year of 
production from the Kyle redevelopment. 
In 2016, we expect Group production  
to be around 65–70 kboepd, reflecting 
some natural decline in our existing 
portfolio, offset by new production 
from the Solan field and a contribution 
from the E.ON UK assets on completion.
At the start of the year Premier set  
itself the goal of materially reducing 
operating expenses across the Group. 
As a result of significant cost saving 
initiatives and the sale of the high  
cost Scott area in the UK, underlying 
operating costs were US$16/boe (2014: 
US$18.5/boe), a reduction year-on-year 
of over US$100 million in absolute terms. 
Cost reduction initiatives have included 
optimising work programmes, reducing 
discretionary spend, sharing services 
with other operators and re-negotiating 
contracts with existing suppliers. These 
initiatives continue and it is anticipated 
that further savings in underlying

Once fully on-stream, both the Solan 
and Catcher projects will contribute 
materially to our cash flows, given our 
tax advantaged position in the UK.
Progressing future development 
projects, retaining future optionality 
and growth opportunities 
We have continued to mature the 
development plan for the first phase of  
the Sea Lion project in the Falkland Islands 
and the pre-FEED work is now complete. 
The project scope has been modified  
with a lower break even oil price and 
significantly enhanced economics. We 
have begun the FEED exercise alongside 
the set of world class contractors that we 
have selected, and we anticipate this will 
last approximately 18 months. A draft Field 
Development Plan has been completed 
and submitted to the Falkland Islands 
Government, and we have entered into 
new contractual arrangements with our 
Sea Lion partner. The timing of the final 
investment decision remains dependent 
on achieving our target rate of return, the 
oil price outlook at the time, the level of 
cost reductions secured and our ability  
to fund the project without putting our 
balance sheet at risk. It remains our 
intention to seek an additional partner 
ahead of final investment decision. 
In Norway, on the Premier-operated 
Vette project, extensive project re-work 
and market engagement was carried out 
during the course of 2015, generating 
very competitive offers of commercial 
terms from the supply chain. T wo alternative 
development concepts were validated 
but rather than continue to prepare the 
project for a sanction decision, we agreed 
to sell the whole of our Norwegian 
business to Det norske oljeselskap ASA 
in November for US$120 million, realising 
immediate value from the project.
Executing our key sanctioned 
development projects 
In May 2015 we acquired Chrysaor’s  
40 per cent interest in the Solan field  
for no upfront cash consideration, 
removing partner funding concerns and,  
as a result, Premier holds a 100 per cent 
equity interest. First oil on the Solan 
project is expected shortly. This has 
been a challenging project for Premier 
with the commissioning of the platform 
taking longer than planned largely due 
to significantly worse than anticipated 
weather conditions West of Shetlands. 
As a result, costs have been higher and 
first oil is later than originally planned. 
Looking to the future, lessons have 
been learnt and will be applied to future 
projects. Following first oil from Solan, 
our efforts will turn to delivering the 
second pair of wells later in the first half 
of 2016, in order to ramp up production 
at Solan to target plateau production 
of 20–25 kboepd.
Key milestones have been achieved on 
our operated Catcher project during the 
year, and the project is under budget 
and scheduled to deliver first oil in 2017 . 
The subsea installation work planned  
for 2015 was successfully completed  
and fabrication of the critical subsea 
equipment, due to be installed in  
the summer of 2016, is on schedule. 
Initial development drilling has been 
encouraging with good reservoir results, 
and construction of the topside modules 
is progressing well. Construction of  
the FPSO hull was initially slower than 
planned but following actions taken  
by the FPSO contractor to address 
scheduling issues, the sail-away date 
from Singapore for a 2017 field start  
up remains on schedule.

Refocusing the exploration portfolio 
and success with the drill bit
In 2015, Premier delivered notable 
exploration successes, with important 
discoveries at Zebedee and Isobel Deep 
in the Falkland Islands and additional 
resource potential confirmed at Anoa 
Deep, Indonesia. Post year-end, the 
re-drill of the Isobel/Elaine complex 
confirmed the results of the original 
Isobel Deep exploration well and 
discovered hydrocarbons in additional 
reservoir horizons. The successes in the 
Falklands add significant additional 
resources to the North Falkland Basin, 
providing further potential for future 
phases of development and increasing 
the attractiveness of the Basin to 
Premier and to potential future partners. 
During the year, unsuccessful wells were 
drilled on our acreage onshore Kenya 
and offshore Norway. 
Our Exploration New Ventures team  
has taken advantage of the reduced 
competition for high quality exploration 
acreage in the current environment,  
to replenish our portfolio at low cost  
with minimal near-term commitments, 
focusing on under-explored but proven 
hydrocarbon basins. We were pleased  
to have been awarded two blocks in the 
proven Sureste basin in Mexico’s Round 
1, with our interests carried through the 
initial phase of exploration. At the same 
time, we have continued to divest and 
relinquish non-core exploration acreage. 
Actively managing our asset portfolio
Post the year-end, Premier agreed to 
purchase E.ON’s UK North Sea assets  
for a net consideration of US$120 million 
plus a completion adjustment of US$15 
million, resulting in an aggregate cash 
payment of US$135 million. The proposed 
acquisition significantly enhances our  
core UK business by adding both cash 
generative production and reserves  
and resources at a compelling valuation. 
It adds stable UK gas revenues to the 
portfolio and increases Premier’s presence 
in the Central North Sea, including a stake 
in the producing world class Elgin-Franklin 
asset and related fields. The acquisition 
offers the potential to generate significant 
operating and cost synergies across the 
combined UK North Sea business and 
allows Premier to accelerate the realisation 
of our significant tax assets in the UK.  
The acquisition is a Class 1 transaction, 
requiring approval from Premier’s 
shareholders, banks and US Private 
Placement holders. A circular is expected 
to be issued to shareholders shortly.
During 2015, we completed the sale  
of our interest in Block A Aceh onshore 
Indonesia for US$40 million and our 
Norwegian business for US$120 million. 
These disposals form part of our strategy 
to actively manage our portfolio, disposing 
of non-core assets where we can realise 
appropriate value. In addition, the formal 
sales process for the Pakistan business, 
which was initiated after an unsolicited 
approach, is ongoing. A number of bids 
have been achieved which we continue 
to evaluate.
Financial discipline and balance  
sheet focus
Our strong production performance  
in 2015, together with the benefit of  
our hedging programme and extensive 
cost savings, has enabled the Group to 
deliver strong cash flows from operations 
of US$809.5 million (2014: US$924.3 
million), despite the low oil price during 
the year. The Group is reporting a loss 
after tax of US$1,103.8 million in 2015 
(2014: US$210.3 million loss after tax) 
largely as a result of impairment charges 
of US$558.7 million (post-tax) principally 
on the carrying value of Solan. These 
were due to the impact of the lower 
near-term oil price assumptions used  
in balance sheet tests at the year-end. 
Capital expenditure in 2015 was 
US$1,070.1 million (2014: US$1,195.5 
million). In 2016 we expect this to  
reduce significantly to approximately 
US$700 million, reflecting the reduction 
in committed expenditure now that the 
Solan project is nearing completion.  
In 2017 , committed capital expenditure  
is expected to fall further to approximately 
US$300 million, reflecting primarily 
remaining development expenditure  
on the Catcher project.
The continuing low oil price environment 
has served to highlight the importance 
of maintaining a strong funding position 
and a conservative approach to financing. 
In order to plan and protect our future 
cash flows, we have continued with our 
oil price hedging programme and at the 
year-end we have approximately 30 per 
cent of 2016 production hedged at 
US$68/barrel. The proposed acquisition 
of the E.ON UK assets adds a significant 
hedging position to our portfolio which, 
post completion, means that we maintain 
approximately 30 per cent of the enlarged 
2016 oil entitlement production hedged 
but at US$73/barrel. Approximately  
30 per cent of E.ON’s UK gas production 
is sold forward at an average of 63 pence  
per therm.
We retain significant funding facilities 
with cash and undrawn facilities of 
US$1.2 billion at year-end. During the year 
we renegotiated our principal financial 
covenants with banks and bondholders. 
Ongoing continued compliance with our 
covenants will remain a key priority for 
Premier in 2016 and beyond, with covenant 
headroom in excess of US$900 million at 
year-end. We continue to benefit from 
the flexibility of our funding arrangements 
which are structured on a corporate 
unsecured basis and are not subject to 
any redeterminations. However, if current 
oil prices persist, then a further short-term 
relaxation of our main financial covenants 
may be required. We are actively working 
on a number of mitigating initiatives 
including the proposed acquisition of E. ON’ s 
UK North Sea assets which is materially 
accretive to our lending covenants,  
and we retain strong relationships with 
our lending group, with whom we will 
continue to work closely, as we have 
done throughout 2015.
Looking forward, 2016 will see 
significantly lower capital expenditure as 
the Solan project is completed, while at 
the same time delivering production 
growth. Our aim is to manage the 
business such that we are able to 
maintain the integrity of our production 
assets, continue to execute our Catcher 
development within budget and on 
schedule, protect the optionality  
for future growth in projects such as  
Sea Lion even in the current oil price 
environment and start to deleverage the 
balance sheet as future cash flows allow. 
The acquisition of the E.ON assets in the 
North Sea alongside the rationalisation 
of our portfolio through the sale of our 
Norway position and the proposed sale 
of our Pakistan business will allow us  
to focus on and grow our UK and South 
East Asian asset bases where we have 
competitively advantaged businesses.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Delivering 
value across  
the oil life cycle
Our vision is to be a world-class  
upstream independent. As a full-cycle 
exploration and production company,  
our strategy is to grow shareholder value 
by investing in high quality production 
and development opportunities while 
maintaining exposure to upside value 
from successful exploration. 
Description
Premier seeks to find, develop and operate high quality assets  
in parts of the world where we have a strategic or operational 
advantage, creating commercially advantaged businesses. In Asia, 
we are a key player in the Singapore gas market, with contracts 
underpinning long-term cash flows, and our Chim Sáo field in 
Vietnam provides strong cash flows for the Group. We are a tax 
advantaged production and development operator in the North  
Sea, and we are the dominant player in the North Falklands Basin 
with access to a potentially world-class resource base. 
Progress in 2015 
Stable production from our operated Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia 
delivered gas to Singapore, capturing a market share well in excess  
of its contractual share, with increased deliverability provided by  
the Pelikan field brought on-stream in March. Our Chim Sáo field 
Description
Premier has a proven track record of operating across the  
cycle from exploration through development to production  
with particular focus on offshore projects. Premier aims to  
leverage its operating capabilities to build a dominant position  
and to position itself to take advantage of future opportunities. 
Our aim is to deliver operational excellence in all activities in a  
safe and responsible manner. 
Progress in 2015 
Premier has operated assets in Indonesia, Vietnam and the  
UK throughout the year with improved operating efficiencies 
demonstrated on almost all the fields. This has driven stable 
production as this improved operating efficiency has partially  
offset the anticipated natural decline in the fields.

projects were progressed, with first oil from Solan expected shortly 
and the Catcher project under budget and scheduled for first oil in 
2017 . Pre-FEED work on the first phase of the Sea Lion development 
project in the Falklands has been completed.
Priorities in 2016
Continue to deliver gas to Singapore, using our deliverability to fill  
any shortfall from other suppliers within the existing contracts and 
progress the next generation of developments. Maintain high operating 
efficiency at Chim Sáo in Vietnam. Complete and tie-in the second 
producer well at Solan, allowing the field to ramp up to plateau 
production of 20–25 kpoed. Continue to progress the Catcher  
project to achieve first oil in 2017 . Take advantage of high quality 
acquisition opportunities in the low point of the oil price cycle to  
create long-term value.
We have also operated a number of drilling campaigns including 
offshore the Falkland Islands and in the North Sea. Our focus on  
safe and reliable operations saw a continued improvement in 2015, 
with our Total Recordable Injury Rate at 1.27 per million man hours 
and our Loss of Primary Containment from our operated assets, 
both below our target for the year. 
Priorities in 2016
Continue to operate all the assets across our portfolio in a safe  
and reliable manner ensuring both the safety of our workforce 
remains paramount and that any potential risk to the environment  
is minimised. Maintain the high levels of operating efficiency across 
our producing assets in order to sustain production levels over the 
medium term.

26 OUR STRATEGY  Read more about  
our KPIs on page 28
Description
Premier employs strong in-house operating teams at an asset and 
country level supported by functional experts with a significant track 
record of project delivery. Our aim is to ensure that the organisation 
is appropriately sized with the right calibre of people to achieve the 
Company’s strategic initiatives. 
Progress in 2015 
A process of rationalising the business and streamlining operations, 
which began at the end of 2014, continued throughout the year. 
Although this process necessitated a reduction in headcount at both 
employee and contractor level, it was achieved while retaining our 
core skills and without compromising the safety or performance of 
our operations.
Description
Premier’s favourable, low cost debt structure with significant liquidity 
underpins our capital investment programme and our ability to access 
new opportunities for future growth. We seek to operate within the 
balance sheet debt capacity and to maintain a conservative financial 
profile especially in periods of prolonged commodity price volatility.
Progress in 2015
During the year we renegotiated our banking covenants with  
banks and bondholders and these have been relaxed until 
mid-2017. Covenant headroom at the year-end was in excess  
of US$900 million. The Company had net debt of US$2.2 billion  
at year-end, with cash and undrawn facilities of US$1.2 billion 
providing significant liquidity. We have also continued with our

hedging programme to mitigate risk against the lower oil price and 
protect debt capacity and have successfully hedged approximately 
30 per cent of 2016 production at US$68/barrel.
Priorities in 2016
Ongoing continued compliance with our debt covenants will remain  
a priority for Premier in 2016 and beyond, although the Company 
may have to seek a relaxation of our covenants during the year if  
low oil prices persist. We will continue to operate within balance sheet 
debt capacity and to carry out our hedging programme to plan  
and protect future cash flows and implement further cost reduction 
initiatives. Further initiatives to preserve covenant headroom, including 
the proposed acquisition of E.ON’s UK North Sea assets, will continue 
to be pursued.

Measuring our 
performance
The Board monitors the Group’s 
progress against its Key Performance 
Indicators to assess performance  
and delivery of its strategy.
Premier measures a range of operational, financial and 
non-financial metrics to help it manage its long-term 
performance and achieve the Company’s business plans. 
Despite the challenging conditions faced by the sector  
in 2015, Premier continued to deliver on a number of its  
key metrics.
Objective
Premier aims to maximise 
production from its existing 
asset base and, over time,  
to deliver production growth.  
By delivering on our production 
targets it provides a source of 
funding in the form of significant 
high-margin annual cash flow. 
Production growth is measured 
using average daily production 
and the number of development 
projects being brought through 
to sanction. The ability to 
commercialise and bring these 
projects on-stream is key to  
the Company’s success. 
Objective
Premier aims to maximise  
cash flow from operations  
in order to maintain financial 
strength, ensuring it can invest  
in the future of the business  
and deliver long-term returns  
to shareholders. Premier’s  
cash flows are protected by  
a rolling forward hedging 
programme and this metric  
is closely monitored.
Objective
Premier aims to minimise  
costs from operations without 
compromising on health and 
safety or asset integrity. 
Operating costs per barrel  
of oil equivalent is a function  
of industry costs, inflation, 
Premier’s fixed cost base and 
production output. Operating 
costs are monitored closely to 
ensure that they are maintained 
within pre-set annual targets.
2015 Progress 
Average daily production in  
2015 was 57.6 koepd, in line 
with expectations and ahead of 
the 55 koepd market guidance.  
The reduction from the previous 
year principally reflects the 
disposal at the end of 2014 of 
the Scott area in the UK which 
contributed 3.8 kboepd in 2014. 
Progress was made on the next 
generation of development 
projects in the UK which will 
underpin the Company’s future 
production growth.
2015 Progress 
Despite the difficult macro 
environment and a low oil price 
throughout the year, Premier has 
registered a strong operating cash 
flow in 2015 of US$809.5 million 
(2014: US$924.3 million). This was 
achieved by strong production 
performance, extensive cost savings 
and the benefit of the hedging 
programme. Premier’s portfolio of 
crudes was sold at an average of 
US$52.6/bbl (2014: US$98.2/bbl) 
(pre-hedge) and US$70.0/bbl 
(2014: US$101.0/bbl) (post hedge) 
compared with an average Brent 
crude price of US$52.4/bbl.
2015 Progress 
Proven and probable (2P)  
reserves at the end of 2015 were 
332 mmboe (2014: 243 mmboe).  
The increase reflects the booking 
of 136 mmboe in respect of the 
first phase of the Sea Lion field  
in the Falkland Islands following 
the completion of a draft field 
development plan, which more 
than offsets the impact of 2015 
production and disposals from our 
reserve base. Disposals comprised 
the Black A Aceh disposal at the 
start of the year and the Vette 
field, sold as part of our Norwegian 
business in December.
Objective
Premier aims to provide a basis 
for future growth by growing  
the reserves and resources  
base through a combination  
of successful exploration and 
selective acquisitions. This 
ambition is measured by 
reserves replacement, risked 
prospective resources added  
and finding costs.
2015 Progress 
Operating costs reduced to  
US$16.0/boe in 2015 (2014:  
US$18.8/boe), a reduction 
year-on-year of over US$100 
million. This was the result of 
significant cost saving initiatives 
carried out across the Group, 
the sale of the high cost Scott 
area in the UK at the end of 
2014 and high operating 
efficiencies delivered in 2015.

Objective
Premier is committed to 
managing its operations in  
a safe and reliable manner  
in order to prevent major 
accidents and to provide  
a high level of protection to  
its employees, contractors and 
the environment. Health and 
safety performance is measured 
using a number of metrics 
including total recordable injury 
rate (‘TRIR’) per million man 
hours. Safety performance  
data includes both Premier 
employees and contractors.
Objective
Premier aims to retain balance 
sheet strength by maintaining 
liquid reserves, including 
undrawn committed banking 
facilities, to meet planned 
funding commitments. The 
long-term, unsecured nature  
of our debt means that ongoing 
compliance with our covenants  
is the key metric to ensure the 
ongoing availability of our 
funding arrangements.
2015 Progress 
In 2015, Premier completed the 
roll-out of a centralised, online 
Occupational Health and Safety 
incident reporting tool – Synergi 
Life – across the Company. This 
has centralised HSES incident 
reporting and action tracking into 
a single Company-wide platform, 
thereby improving the analysis of 
performance. Premier achieved  
a TRIR performance of 1.27 per 
million man hours (2014: 1.5),  
a 14 per cent decrease on 2014, 
continuing the improving trend 
from 2014 and ahead of our 
target for the year.
2015 Progress 
At the end of 2015, Premier retains 
significant funding facilities with cash 
and undrawn facilities of US$ 1 .2 billion. 
During the year, covenants were 
renegotiated with our banks and 
bondholders and these have been 
relaxed until mid-2017 . Ongoing 
continued compliance with covenants 
is a priority for Premier, with covenant 
headroom in excess of US$900 million 
at year-end. However, if current  
low oil prices persist, then a further 
relaxation of our main financial 
covenants may be required, which 
we are taking pre-emptive action  
to address.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Managing our 
principal risks
Premier’s business may be impacted  
by various adverse events or circumstances 
leading to failure to achieve strategic targets 
for growth, loss of financial standing, cash 
flow and earnings, and reputation. Certain 
external developments such as the global 
price of oil are outside the Company’s control 
which can have serious consequences for 
the Company with limited opportunity to 
mitigate. The Company may also be exposed 
to risks which are not yet manifested or 
reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is central  
to achieving our strategic objectives 
and protecting our personnel, assets, 
the communities where we operate 
and with whom we interact, and our 
reputation. Premier therefore has  
a comprehensive approach to risk 
management, as set out below.
The Directors have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. A description of those 
risks, together with details of how  
such risks are managed and mitigated,  
is set out on pages 32 to 35.
David Lindsell
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee
A critical part of the risk management 
process is to assess the impact and 
likelihood of risks occurring so that 
appropriate control and mitigation 
plans can be developed and 
implemented. However, there are 
certain risks to which Premier is  
exposed over which it has very limited 
power to control or mitigate, such  
as oil price and extended adverse 
weather conditions in the North Sea. 
Risk level matrices are developed across 
Premier’s business to facilitate assessment 
of risk. The specific risks identified by 
project and asset teams, business units 
and corporate functions are consolidated 
and amalgamated to provide an oversight 
of key risk factors at each level from 
operations through business unit 
management to Executive Committee 
and Board level.
For all the known risks facing the 
business, Premier attempts to minimise 
their likelihood and mitigate the impact. 
According to the nature of the risk, 
Premier may elect to accept or tolerate 
risk, treat risk with controls and mitigating 
actions, transfer risk to third parties  
or terminate risk by ceasing particular 
activities or operations. Premier has  
a zero tolerance to financial fraud or 
ethics non-compliance, and ensures 
that health, safety, environment and 
security (‘HSES’) risks are managed  
to levels that are as low as reasonably 
practicable, whilst managing exploration 
and development risks on a portfolio basis.
Significant risk factors during 2015
• Continued oil price weakness  
(weak share price and North Sea 
impairments).
• Project delivery challenges  
(schedule and cost). 
• ‘Alignment’ with JV partners  
(in particular their ability to  
fulfil commitments). 
• Negative market sentiment.
Significant risk factors for 2016
• Breach of banking covenants and  
longer-term viability.
• Continued oil price weakness.
• Cash flow and ability to fund existing 
and planned projects, thereby deliver 
business strategy.
• Political and security instability  
in countries of current and  
planned activity.
• Negative market sentiment.
• Potential costs arising from 
decommissioning liabilities.
• Reputational impact if we defer projects.
• Ability to maintain core competencies.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Principal risk factor Risk detail How is it managed? Key steps to mitigate in 2015/16 
Commodity price  
volatility
(Of particular  
significance during  
2015 and into 2016)
•  Oil and gas prices are affected by global supply and demand and price can be  
subject to significant fluctuations.
•  Factors that influence these include operational issues, natural disasters,  
weather, political instability, or conflicts and economic conditions or actions  
by major oil-exporting countries. 
•  Price fluctuations can affect our business assumptions and can affect investment 
decisions and financial capability.
•  Specific risks for 2016: inability to deliver satisfactory hedging programme due  
to low forward oil prices.
•  Oil and gas price hedging programmes to underpin our financial 
strength and protect our capacity to fund our future developments 
and operations.
•  Premier investment guidelines ensure that our development 
programmes are robust to downside sensitivity price scenarios.
•  Seek acquisition opportunities which will improve 
the Company’s hedging position.
•  Hedging programme (continued into 2016) taking 
advantage of the limited protection from such 
activity during an extended period of low oil prices. 
•  Economics of development programmes re-worked 
to reflect low oil price environment. 
•  Discretionary spend curtailed. 
•  Contingency planning or accelerated 
decommissioning of identified production assets. 
Production and  
development  
delivery 
 
(Of particular  
significance during  
2015 – Solan –  
and into 2016)
•  Uncertain geology and reservoir performance leading to lower production and 
reserves recovery.
•  Availability of services including FPSOs and rigs, availability of technology and 
engineering capacity, availability of skilled resources, maintaining project schedules 
and costs as well as fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions leading to 
operational problems and production loss or development delay.
•  Consequences may include lower production, lower recovery of reserves,  
production delays, cost overruns and/or failure to fulfil contractual commitments.
•  Specific risks in 2016: delayed second producer well on Solan; Solan ramp-up to 
plateau production is delayed or budget exceeded; decline in Indonesian and 
Vietnamese production through operational issues.
•  Geoscience and reservoir engineering management systems, 
including rigorous production forecasting and independent 
reserves auditing processes.
•  Effective contracting strategy, operations, development and  
project execution management systems and cost controls  
together with capable project teams.
•  Long-term development planning to ensure timely access to  
FPSOs, rigs and other essential services.
•  Improved production forecasting, enhanced 
reporting and monitoring through further 
refinement of near-real-time production  
analytics platform.
•  Improved project planning and delivery through 
better co-ordination and execution of cross-
functional review prior to decision gates.
•  Independent ‘lessons learned’ review of Solan 
project communicated to Group corporate and 
business unit teams.
•  Continued ExCo, business unit and project 
engagement on contractor selection/management.
Financial discipline  
and governance
(Of particular  
significance during  
2015 and through 2016)
•  Risk of covenant breach and that sufficient funds are not available to finance  
the business. 
•  Risk of financial fraud.
•  Breach of delegated authority.
•  Specific risks in 2016: need to relax financial covenants; failure to deliver cost 
efficiencies; and reduced capex plans.
•  Strong financial discipline. Premier has an established financial 
management system to ensure that it is able to maintain an 
appropriate level of liquidity and financial capacity and to manage 
the level of assessed risk associated with the financial instruments. 
Premier maintains access to capital markets through the cycle.  
The management system includes policies and a delegation of 
authority manual to reasonably protect against risk of financial  
fraud in the Group.
•  An insurance programme is put in place to reduce the potential 
impact of the physical risks associated with exploration and 
production activities. In addition, business interruption cover is 
purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields. 
Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with minimum  
A credit rating banks, AAA managed liquidity funds and A1/P1 
commercial paper, subject to Board approved limits.
•  Careful management of covenant headroom  
on the Group’s debt facilities and ongoing  
dialogue with lenders regarding the likely need  
to re-negotiate covenants. 
•  Economics of investment decisions and 
development projects re-worked to reflect low  
oil price environment.
•  Deferred discretionary exploration spend.
•  Unsanctioned development projects deferred  
and re-shaped.
•  Ongoing reduction of contractor spend.
•  Contingency planning for right-sizing and  
re-structuring of Group to deliver business goals.
•  Enhancement of Business Control Review process.
Health, safety,  
environment  
and security  
(‘HSES’)
•  Major process safety incident or operational accident, natural disasters, pandemics, 
social unrest, civil war.
•  Consequences may include accidents resulting in loss of life, injury and/or  
significant pollution of the local environment, destruction of facilities and disruption  
to business activities.
•  Comprehensive HSES and operations management systems 
including emergency and oil spill response capability and  
asset integrity.
•  Active security monitoring and management and regular testing  
of business continuity plans.
•  Learning from Company and third party incidents.
•  Further embedded electronic incident-recording 
and action-tracking system, implemented HSEMS 
self-audit system.
•  Further embedded implementation of asset 
integrity scorecard methodology (covering people, 
plant and process lead indicators) at all operated 
production assets.
Joint venture partner 
alignment and supply  
chain delivery
(Of particular significance 
during an extended period of 
oil price weakness/volatility) 
•  Global operations in the oil and gas industry are conducted in a joint venture 
environment. There is a risk that joint venture partners are not aligned in their 
objectives and drivers and this may lead to inefficiencies and/or delays. Several of our 
major projects are operated by our joint venture partners and our ability to influence 
our partners is sometimes limited due to our small interest in such ventures.
•  We are heavily dependent on supply chain providers to deliver services and products 
to time, cost and quality criteria. Heightened risk during period of downturn in the 
upstream services sector.
•  Specific risks in 2016: failure of supply chain providers to deliver, causing delays/cost

Commodity price  
volatility
(Of particular  
significance during  
2015 and into 2016)
•  Oil and gas prices are affected by global supply and demand and price can be  
subject to significant fluctuations.
•  Factors that influence these include operational issues, natural disasters,  
weather, political instability, or conflicts and economic conditions or actions  
by major oil-exporting countries. 
•  Price fluctuations can affect our business assumptions and can affect investment 
decisions and financial capability.
•  Specific risks for 2016: inability to deliver satisfactory hedging programme due  
to low forward oil prices.
•  Oil and gas price hedging programmes to underpin our financial 
strength and protect our capacity to fund our future developments 
and operations.
•  Premier investment guidelines ensure that our development 
programmes are robust to downside sensitivity price scenarios.
•  Seek acquisition opportunities which will improve 
the Company’s hedging position.
•  Hedging programme (continued into 2016) taking 
advantage of the limited protection from such 
activity during an extended period of low oil prices. 
•  Economics of development programmes re-worked 
to reflect low oil price environment. 
•  Discretionary spend curtailed. 
•  Contingency planning or accelerated 
decommissioning of identified production assets. 
Production and  
development  
delivery 
 
(Of particular  
significance during  
2015 – Solan –  
and into 2016)
•  Uncertain geology and reservoir performance leading to lower production and 
reserves recovery.
•  Availability of services including FPSOs and rigs, availability of technology and 
engineering capacity, availability of skilled resources, maintaining project schedules 
and costs as well as fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions leading to 
operational problems and production loss or development delay.
•  Consequences may include lower production, lower recovery of reserves,  
production delays, cost overruns and/or failure to fulfil contractual commitments.
•  Specific risks in 2016: delayed second producer well on Solan; Solan ramp-up to 
plateau production is delayed or budget exceeded; decline in Indonesian and 
Vietnamese production through operational issues.
•  Geoscience and reservoir engineering management systems, 
including rigorous production forecasting and independent 
reserves auditing processes.
•  Effective contracting strategy, operations, development and  
project execution management systems and cost controls  
together with capable project teams.
•  Long-term development planning to ensure timely access to  
FPSOs, rigs and other essential services.
•  Improved production forecasting, enhanced 
reporting and monitoring through further 
refinement of near-real-time production  
analytics platform.
•  Improved project planning and delivery through 
better co-ordination and execution of cross-
functional review prior to decision gates.
•  Independent ‘lessons learned’ review of Solan 
project communicated to Group corporate and 
business unit teams.
•  Continued ExCo, business unit and project 
engagement on contractor selection/management.
Financial discipline  
and governance
(Of particular  
significance during  
2015 and through 2016)
•  Risk of covenant breach and that sufficient funds are not available to finance  
the business. 
•  Risk of financial fraud.
•  Breach of delegated authority.
•  Specific risks in 2016: need to relax financial covenants; failure to deliver cost 
efficiencies; and reduced capex plans.
•  Strong financial discipline. Premier has an established financial 
management system to ensure that it is able to maintain an 
appropriate level of liquidity and financial capacity and to manage 
the level of assessed risk associated with the financial instruments. 
Premier maintains access to capital markets through the cycle.  
The management system includes policies and a delegation of 
authority manual to reasonably protect against risk of financial  
fraud in the Group.
•  An insurance programme is put in place to reduce the potential 
impact of the physical risks associated with exploration and 
production activities. In addition, business interruption cover is 
purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields. 
Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with minimum  
A credit rating banks, AAA managed liquidity funds and A1/P1 
commercial paper, subject to Board approved limits.
•  Careful management of covenant headroom  
on the Group’s debt facilities and ongoing  
dialogue with lenders regarding the likely need  
to re-negotiate covenants. 
•  Economics of investment decisions and 
development projects re-worked to reflect low  
oil price environment.
•  Deferred discretionary exploration spend.
•  Unsanctioned development projects deferred  
and re-shaped.
•  Ongoing reduction of contractor spend.
•  Contingency planning for right-sizing and  
re-structuring of Group to deliver business goals.
•  Enhancement of Business Control Review process.
Health, safety,  
environment  
and security  
(‘HSES’)
•  Major process safety incident or operational accident, natural disasters, pandemics, 
social unrest, civil war.
•  Consequences may include accidents resulting in loss of life, injury and/or  
significant pollution of the local environment, destruction of facilities and disruption  
to business activities.
•  Comprehensive HSES and operations management systems 
including emergency and oil spill response capability and  
asset integrity.
•  Active security monitoring and management and regular testing  
of business continuity plans.
•  Learning from Company and third party incidents.
•  Further embedded electronic incident-recording 
and action-tracking system, implemented HSEMS 
self-audit system.
•  Further embedded implementation of asset 
integrity scorecard methodology (covering people, 
plant and process lead indicators) at all operated 
production assets.
Joint venture partner 
alignment and supply  
chain delivery
(Of particular significance 
during an extended period of 
oil price weakness/volatility) 
•  Global operations in the oil and gas industry are conducted in a joint venture 
environment. There is a risk that joint venture partners are not aligned in their 
objectives and drivers and this may lead to inefficiencies and/or delays. Several of our 
major projects are operated by our joint venture partners and our ability to influence 
our partners is sometimes limited due to our small interest in such ventures.
•  We are heavily dependent on supply chain providers to deliver services and products 
to time, cost and quality criteria. Heightened risk during period of downturn in the 
upstream services sector.
•  Specific risks in 2016: failure of supply chain providers to deliver, causing delays/cost 
over-runs on Catcher project.
•  Due diligence and continuous and regular engagement with 
partners in joint ventures in both operated and non-operated 
projects. Premier takes strategic acquisition opportunities where 
appropriate to gain a greater degree of influence and control.
•  Non-operated ventures management system.
•  Active engagement with supply chain providers.  
Monitor performance and delivery.
•  Heightened engagement with joint venture  
partners and supply chain counterparties with 
regard to their ability to fulfil commitments.
•  Solan JV partner bought out.
•  Various portfolio management options under

Host government:
political and fiscal risks
•  Premier operates in some countries where political, economic and social transition  
is taking place or there are current sovereignty disputes. Developments in politics,  
laws and regulations can affect our operations and earnings.
•  Consequences may include forced divestment of assets; limits on production  
or cost recovery; import and export restrictions; international conflicts, including  
war, civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of 
Company facilities; price controls, tax increases and other retroactive tax claims; 
expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights; and increase in regulatory 
burden. It is difficult to predict the timing or severity of these occurrences or their 
potential impact.
•  Premier’s portfolio includes operations in both low and higher risk 
environments. Premier actively monitors the local situation and has 
business continuity plans in each area which can be activated 
depending on pre-defined levels of alert.
•  Premier strives to be a good corporate citizen globally, and fosters 
reputation by strong and positive relationships with government 
and communities where we do business. Premier engages in 
respectful industry-wide lobbying and sustainable corporate 
responsibility and community investment programmes. Rigorous 
adherence to Premier’s business ethics policy and code of conduct.
•  Continuous monitoring of the external environment for emerging 
risks to the business. 
•  Improved provision of politico-economic/ 
security/societal risk assessment informing 
investment decisions.
•  Strengthened Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) 
management system and ongoing improvements 
to CR reporting.
•  Ongoing cost/benefit assessment of political  
risk insurance on case-by-case basis.
Organisational  
capability
•  Risk that the capability of the organisation is not adequate to deliver plans for  
strategic growth. The capability of the organisation is a function of both the strength 
of its human resources and its business management systems. Inadequate systems  
or lack of compliance may lead to loss of value and failure to achieve growth targets. 
Loss of personnel to competitors, inability to attract and retain quality human 
resources and competency gaps could affect our operational performance and 
delivery of growth strategy.
•  Premier has created a competitive remuneration and retention 
package including bonus and long-term incentive plans to 
incentivise loyalty and good performance from the existing,  
highly skilled workforce.
•  Premier continues to strengthen its organisational capability to 
achieve strategic objectives. This includes resource planning, 
competency development, training and development programmes, 
succession planning including leadership development.
•  Continuous strengthening of business management systems  
and controls as appropriate to the size and market position  
of the Company.
•  Continuous improvement of human resources 
management systems and controls.
•  New reward programme rolled out in the  
fourth quarter of 2015.
•  Phased function roll-out of competency 
management system continued.
•  Succession planning reviewed.
Exploration success  
and reserves addition
•  Failure to identify and capture acreage and resource opportunities to provide a 
portfolio of drillable exploration prospects and sufficient development projects  
to achieve reserves addition targets.
•  Specific exploration programmes may fail to add reserves and hence value. 
•  Failure to negotiate access rights or close transactions could slow growth  
of reserves and production and lead to loss of competitive advantage.
•  Strong portfolio management and alignment with strategic  
growth targets. Appropriate balance between growth by 
exploration and acquisition.
•  Exploration management systems including comprehensive  
peer review with focus on geologies in core areas we know  
well and in which we can build a competitive advantage.
•  M&A effort focusing on geographical and technical areas  
aligned with our strategy. Diligence in acquisition process  
and post-acquisition integration to ensure targeted returns.
•  Review and downsize exploration portfolio  
to high-grade prospectivity (in response to  
low oil price).
•  Re-shape exploration team with revision  
of ExCo responsibility.
•  Acquired Mexican offshore licence interests.
•  Ongoing M&A options in progress into 2016.
Risk management and internal 
controls in Premier
The corporate governance process  
in Premier is designed to determine  
the nature and level of risk that the 
Company is willing to take in pursuit  
of its strategy and to provide an 
appropriate level of assurance that any 
risks taken are appropriately managed 
and that the system of internal controls  
is effective. 
Risk management processes and  
systems of internal control are designed 
to manage and communicate rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance that material 
financial irregularities and control 
weaknesses will be detected.
Business Management System
Internal controls within Premier are 
governed by the Business Management 
System (‘BMS’). This system is composed 
of the policies, standards, procedures, 
processes and guidelines for every 
function involved in carrying out Premier’s 
business including Development and 
Operations, Exploration, Business 
Development, Finance, Health, Safety, 
Environment and Security (‘HSES’), 
Corporate Responsibility, Risk and other 
business support services. Group 
corporate function management systems 
are complemented by local management 
systems within the business units which 
contain additional content specifically 
required in order to operate and 
manage the business under local 
conditions and in compliance with  
local laws and regulations. 
During 2015 a significant upgrade to the 
BMS platform was initiated for delivery  
in 2016. Premier also commissioned an 
external, independent peer review of its 
management and governance systems 
in comparison with a number of 
anonymised independent upstream  
oil & gas companies. The review 
identified no significant shortcomings 
compared to peer companies. The 
recommendations from the review will 
be followed up and include improving 
the overall coherence of the risk-based 
reviews of management systems in the 
Group’s functions by putting in place  
a Group-wide standard prescribing the 
review procedure and required outputs 
in order to improve ownership and 
accountability for required actions.

The recommendations also included

Risk management
Premier believes that risk management 
is just part of good management which 
leads to quality decision making and 
achievement of targets for growth of 
the business. 
The process for risk management is 
central to Premier’s Business Management 
System and the Group’s management 
system has been developed in accordance 
with the risk management principles and 
guidelines of ISO 31000 (Risk Management 
– Principles and Guidelines).  
The processes developed by the 
Company cover all key elements of  
ISO 31000.
The core process for risk management 
is contextualised by the Company’s 
business strategy and comprises the 
risk architecture defining accountability 
and responsibility, the risk protocols 
(policy, standard, procedures) and a 
continuous improvement cycle for these 
systems. This process is described in 
more detail on page 31.
Risk identification
A new risk workbench (‘ARROW’) based 
on ISO 31000 guidelines was further 
developed in-house during 2015 and 
has been implemented across the  
Group. ARROW facilitates the 
registration, communication and 
assessment of corporate, functional, 
business unit and asset/project risks 
and the definition of the plans for 
control and mitigation, and assignment 
of responsibility. ARROW allows risks 
that have a significant potential impact 
and a higher likelihood of occurrence to 
be flagged and referred automatically 
up to the next level(s) of management, 
enabling more effective top-down 
monitoring of risk. ARROW’s integration 
with Premier’s BMS enables risks and  
the related controls and mitigating 
processes to be described, managed 
and communicated in a more complete 
and consistent manner and also enables 
the programme of financial and operational 
control reviews to be prioritised further 
against the principal Group business 
risks as ranked in ARROW.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Risk assessment
A standard matrix of impact versus 
likelihood is used to assess risks at all 
levels in the organisation. Appropriate 
consideration is giv en to risk inter -dependency 
and amalgamation of similar specific  
risks across the organisation. Risks are 
categorised according to a scale  
of Major, Medium and Minor and 
escalated to the appropriate level.
Risk treatment includes risk acceptance 
or tolerance and active risk reduction 
measures based on a Board approved 
risk appetite. Particular attention is 
given to occupational health, safety  
and environmental factors to ensure 
that residual risks are at a level that  
is as low as reasonably practicable.
Risk monitoring and review
The status of risks and progress with 
risk treatment plans are monitored 
continuously and reviewed periodically 
via performance reviews, workshops, 
audits and risk assessments.
The architecture of the organisation 
provides the framework for defining  
the accountability and responsibility  
for risk identification and management. 
It links the Board and Audit and Risk 
Committee to the Executive Committee 
and functional and business unit 
management structure, and enables 
risks to be escalated and managed at 
the appropriate level. The Group Head 
of Corporate Services is responsible for 
the risk management system and the 
overall running of the process.
The risk protocols are the policy, 
procedures and processes documented 
as part of the risk management system 
and key tools used in the process.  
A cycle of continuous improvement to 
the risk management system within the 
organisation is applied and regularly 
reviewed with both the Executive 
Committee (via regional and functional 
performance reviews) and the Audit  
and Risk Committee. 
The Business Management System,  
risk management processes and 
programme of reviews form the ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal business risks 
faced by the Company. This process has 
been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
It is regularly reviewed by the Audit and 
Risk Committee and provides the Board 
with reasonable assurance that appropriate 
controls are in place to provide effective 
management of business risks and to 
safeguard the Group’s assets against 
inappropriate use or loss and fraud.
Regular review
The effectiveness of the Business 
Management System is a function  
of both the adequacy of the system  
and compliance with the system. The 
operation of internal control procedures 
is monitored by planned management 
system and business control reviews.  
An annual programme of review is 
agreed between functional and 
business unit management and 
approved by the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The programme adopts  
a risk-based focus and includes a  
review of management system efficacy 
and control as well as targeting key 
operational, financial and organisational 
delivery milestones. This process is 
designed, inter alia, to provide assurance 
to the Board that Premier is embedding 
effective risk management into its 
operations. Significant findings from 
these reviews are presented to the Audit 
and Risk Committee which monitors the 
implementation of recommendations 
for control improvements. A rolling 
three-year plan to cover all operations  
is in place.
In addition, where we are the operator, 
audits of joint venture operations are 
carried out by our joint venture 
partners. Where one of our partners is 
the operator, we seek visibility of the 
most significant risks identified and 
managed by the joint venture partners.
The annual cycle of monitoring in 
Premier culminates in the completion of 
the Corporate Governance Return which 
contains declarations by business unit 
and functional management confirming 
compliance with the Group’s BMS as 
well as identifying enhancements as part 
of a continuous process for improving the 
effectiveness of management systems.
Board responsibility
Overall responsibility for the system of 
internal control and risk management 
and reviewing the effectiveness of  
such systems rests with the Board.  
This involves ensuring that there is  
a process to identify, evaluate and 
manage any significant risks that may 
affect the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
The Directors carry out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company, including those that 
would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. These risks are regularly 
reviewed and monitored by the Board.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
36 PRINCIPAL RISKS continued Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2  
of the 2014 revision of the Combined 
Code, the Directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Company over  
a longer period than the 12 months 
required for the ‘Going Concern’ 
statement. In preparing this 
assessment of viability the Board has 
considered the principal risks faced 
by the Group, relevant financial 
forecasts and sensitivities and the 
availability of adequate funding. 
Assessment period
The Board conducted this review for 
a period of three years to 30 June 2019 
(the ‘Forecast Period’), which was 
selected for the following reasons:
• At least annually, the Board 
considers the Group’s long-term 
forecast (the ‘Forecast’) over a 
three-year period.
• Within the three-year period, liquid 
commodity price curves are able 
to be used in the Forecast. Given 
the lack of forward liquidity in oil 
and gas markets after this initial 
three-year period, we are reliant  
on our own internal estimates  
of oil and gas prices without 
reference to liquid forward curves.
• Over the next three years the 
Group’s current major development 
projects (being Catcher and Solan) 
are expected to have come 
on-stream and the Group is not 
currently committed to any major 
developments beyond that date.
• The majority of the Group’s 
financing facilities are available 
during the three-year horizon. 
However, beyond this time horizon, 
the Group’s main lending facilities 
will need to be re-financed.
Review of financial forecasts
The Forecast is based on:
• the Group’s latest life of field 
production and expenditure  
forecasts on an asset by asset basis, 
together with a variety of portfolio 
management opportunities which are 
currently under active consideration;
• management’s best estimate of future 
commodity prices (based on recent 
forward curves, adjusted for the 
Group’s hedging programme); and
• the Group’s borrowing facilities, 
including the requirements of 
financial covenants included  
within these facilities. 
Sensitivities are run to reflect different 
scenarios including, but not limited  
to, changes in oil and gas production 
rates, possible reductions in commodity 
prices and delays or cost overruns on 
major development projects. 
Review of principal risks
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, set out in detail on  
pages 32 to 35, have been considered 
over the period.
The Board considers that commodity 
price volatility, and in particular a 
sustained low oil price, has the most 
impact upon the continued viability  
of the Group during the Forecast 
Period. At the current low oil price 
being observed, a breach in at least one 
of the Group’s financial covenants as 
currently set is likely to occur in respect 
of the testing period ending 30 June 
2016 unless appropriate mitigating 
actions can be taken. The risk that the 
Group will be unable to either achieve 
appropriate mitigating actions prior  
to 30 June 2016 or to secure an 
appropriate relaxation of its financial 
covenants is a material uncertainty, as 
explained in more detail in the going 
concern section of the Financial Review 
on page 54. Having assessed this risk 
and after making enquiries, the Board 
has a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will avoid a covenant breach.
Furthermore, some US$700 million  
of the Group’s financing facilities will 
mature in 2017 and 2018. The Board 
has considered the risk around the 
Group’s ability to re-finance these 
facilities as they fall due and how this 
risk can be mitigated. A key assumption 
underpinning the three-year forecast 
is that the credit markets will be 
sufficiently liquid, and prevailing oil 
prices sufficiently robust, to enable  
the Group’s financing facilities to be 
renewed at the same level. Given the 
Group’s ongoing banking relationships, 
the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that it will be possible to re-finance 
these facilities in 2017 and 2018.
The potential impact of each of the 
Group’s other principal risks on the 
viability of the Group during the 
Forecast Period, should that risk arise 
in its unmitigated form, has been 
assessed. The Board has considered 
the risk mitigation strategy as set out 
for each of those risks and believes 
that the mitigation strategies are 
sufficient to reduce the impact of  
each risk such that it would be unlikely 
to jeopardise the Group’s viability 
during the Forecast Period.
Conclusion 
The Directors’ assessment has been 
made with reference to the Group’s 
current position and prospects, the 
Group’s strategy and availability of 
funding, the Board’s risk appetite and 
the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed in the 
Strategic Report. The Directors have 
also considered the availability of 
actions within their control in the  
event of plausible negative scenarios 
occurring. On the assumption that the 
Group is able to avoid a covenant 
breach in respect of the 30 June 2016 
testing period and is able to re-finance 
the Group’s facilities towards the  
end of the period of assessment,  
the Directors confirm that they have  
a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue to operate and 
meets its liabilities, as they fall due,  
for the next three years.

Net production from Indonesia in 2015 on a working interest basis was stable  
at 13.9 kboepd (2014: 14.4 kboepd). A strong operational performance from the 
Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A was offset, in part, by lower production  
from the non-operated Kakap field. 
Premier sold an average of 223 BBtud (gross) (2014: 231 BBtud) from its operated 
Natuna Sea Block A during 2015:

Gross liquids production from the  
Anoa field averaged 1.4 kbopd (2014:  
1.6 kbopd) and gross liquids production 
from the non-operated Kakap field 
averaged 3.5 kbopd (2014: 3.9 kbopd). 
Cost reduction initiatives have been 
delivered through optimisation of work 
programmes, reduction of discretionary 
spend, efficiencies through shared 
services with other operators in the area 
and contract renegotiations with existing 
suppliers. Based on current production 
levels, Natuna A is well placed to deliver 
operating costs of US$8.0/boe into the 
medium term. 
The Pelikan field was successfully 
brought on-stream in March within 
budget, following first gas from the 
Naga field in November 2014. The 
Pelikan and Naga gas fields, which 
contain 150 bcf of reserves, will maintain 
the production profiles of GSA1 and 
GSA2 and these fields are now fully  
tied into the Gajah Baru facilities. This 
increased deliverability from Natuna Sea 
Block A also allows Premier increased 
operational flexibility, the ability to fill 
any shortfall from other suppliers within 
the existing contracts and the potential 
to respond to any future increase in 
Singapore or domestic gas demand. 
Elsewhere on Natuna Sea Block A, the next 
generation of developments to backfill our 
existing Singapore and domestic market 
contracts continue to progress. FEED has 
been completed on the Bison, Iguana and 
Gajah Puteri projects and an investment 
decision on these projects is targeted  
for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Evaluation of the potential development 
scenarios for the 2014 Kuda/Singa  
Laut discoveries on the Tuna Block 
remains ongoing. Premier is conducting a 
farm-out process with a view to reducing 
its 65 per cent equity interest in the 
block in order to manage its exposure 
going forward.
 
Exploration
The Anoa West-1 well successfully 
appraised the Anoa Deep discovery 
made in 2012, encountering the same 
gas bearing sandstones in the Lama 
formation as well as exploring deeper 
reservoir sections that were also found 
to be gas bearing. Premier continues  
to mature a number of other leads and 
prospects elsewhere in the Lama play 
to drillable status. 
Portfolio management 
In January 2015, Premier successfully 
completed the sale of its 41.67 per cent 
non-operated interest in Block A Aceh 
onshore Indonesia for an after-tax 
consideration of US$40 million. 
GSA1 deliveries from Block A were 43 
per cent (2014: 45 per cent) of all GSA1 
deliveries, above the contractual share  
of 39.9 per cent. In addition Premier 
continues to provide additional gas sales 
of up to 40 BBtud from the Gajah Baru 
field to the domestic market under a 
Domestic Swap Agreement (GSA5).  
In 2015, GSA5 sales were less than 
expected in the first half of the year  
due to competition from low price diesel 
fuel, but increased in the second half. 
End-users continued to make take or  
pay payments in full as per the terms  
of the DSA/GSA.

Production
Production from the Premier-operated 
Block 12W, which contains the Chim Sáo 
and Dua fields, exceeded expectations, 
averaging 16.9 kboepd (12.8 kbopd of oil 
and 19.8 mmscfd of gas) net to Premier. 
A programme of acidising the reservoir 
to improve its delivery capacity and 
increasing the use of gas lift in the  
wells has helped to maintain production 
levels similar to those achieved in 2014, 
assisted by continued high operating 
efficiency of 87 per cent. Contractual 
changes, which enhanced the alignment 
between Premier and our Operations 
and Maintenance subcontractor, resulted 
in further improvements in plant reliability 
and improved business efficiency. While 
plateau rates from Block 12W have been 
maintained for longer and at higher rates 
than originally envisaged at sanction, 
some natural decline from the existing 
wells is now being seen. 
In response to lower oil prices, operating 
costs have been proactively managed 
downwards. Chim Sáo operating costs  
were around US$11.7/boe, reflecting a 
20 per cent year-on-year decrease as a 
result of a rigorous approach to contract 
management. Cost savings and efficiency 
improvements have been achieved 
through a variety of measures: renegotiation 
of contracts; assumption of direct control 
of the offshore operations and maintenance 
services for the Chim Sáo FPSO; and 
operating efficiencies, such as changing 
crew shift patterns and the use of lower 
cost and more fuel efficient supply vessels.

Production
Production from Premier’s UK fields 
averaged 16.7 kboepd (2014: 15.6
1
 
kboepd). Good production efficiency 
across the portfolio and the first full year 
of Kyle production since the field was 
redeveloped, offset natural field decline 
across other assets. This production was 
delivered at reduced cost with UK unit 
operating costs of US$30/boe during 
2015 (2014: US$37 .5/boe). This reduction 
reflects the operating cost savings 
achieved across all assets as well as the 
disposal of the high-cost Scott area 
assets at the end of 2014. UK G&A costs 
have also been reduced, reflecting a 
lower headcount in the business unit.
Production from the Premier-operated 
Balmoral area averaged 3.1 kboepd 
(2014: 3.2 kboepd). Improved production 
efficiency which averaged 83 per cent 
(2014: 73. 1 per cent), and the reinstatement 
of the Stirling well 20z for the majority 
of 2015 (2014: five months) were offset 
by natural field decline and the loss of 
the Balmoral B29 well in July 2015 for 
mechanical reasons. Operating costs 
were reduced to US$64.4 million (2014: 
US$88 million), representing savings 
from cost efficiencies such as the 
sharing of logistics with other operators 
plus reduced G&A allocations. These 
initiatives are all anticipated to deliver

further full-year benefits during 2016.  
In addition, the third party Beauly well 
was successfully reinstated during 
October 2015.
The non-operated Huntington f 
ield averaged 6.2 kboepd in 2015  
(2014: 5.7 kboepd). Production was 
constrained in the first quarter due to 
restrictions on exporting gas through 
the CATS pipeline system following 
failure of a topside valve on the CATS 
riser platform during December 2014. 
On completion of repair work and 
subsequent agreement being reached 
for higher gas export volumes through 
the CATS system, production rates were 
increased to higher than anticipated 
levels before reducing as a result of 
natural field decline. Production 
efficiency since April has exceeded  
90 per cent. 
Production from the non-operated 
Wytch Farm field averaged 5.2 kboepd 
(2014: 5.6 kboepd) and was stable during 
the majority of the year. ESP pump 
failures on key producer wells and 
operational issues encountered with  
the Furzey Island water injection line led 
to a marginal reduction on the previous 
year but, at the year-end, production 
had been fully restored. Significant 
operating cost savings were delivered 
by the operator resulting in a decrease 
in operating costs to US$32.4 million 
(2014: US$36.9 million) in spite of the 
need to conduct the ESP well workovers.
Production from the non-operated  
Kyle field increased to an average of  
2.0 kboepd (2014: 1 kboepd), reflecting 
the first full year of Kyle production 
since severe storm conditions in 
December 2011 resulted in damage  
to the subsea infrastructure and the 
host Banff FSPO facility. Production 
recommenced in July 2014 following  
a two and a half year reinstatement 
project. The main K14 production well has 
performed strongly in 2015, although the 
field suffered some unplanned outages 
due to gas compression  
issues on the host Banff field FPSO.
Development 
Solan
On the Premier-operated Solan project, 
the unprecedented weather conditions 
West of Shetlands have continued to 
impact the final commissioning of the 
offshore installations systems required for 
first oil. Despite this, progress continues 
to be made and first oil is expected 
shortly. The first pair of subsea producer-
injector wells required for first oil were 
successfully completed and tied back  
to the Solan platform during the year. 
During the year all other subsea work 
required for first oil was completed, 
including the tie-in of the subsea oil 
storage tank. Platform commissioning 
work delivered the minimum systems 
required to support first oil including the 
living quarters, firewater deluge system 
and other safety related systems, and all 
the utilities including power, fuel supply 
and air. Export oil tanker trials were 
completed in November and platform 
habitation was achieved in January 2016. 
The Regalia accommodation vessel 
provided accommodation facilities  
to support commissioning work and 
delivered high productivity and good  
up time from its arrival on location in 
August 2015 through to the completion 
of its contract in November. The Regalia 
was replaced by the Flotel Superior 
during November 2015, a vessel better 
suited to operations West of Shetland 
during winter conditions. Premier has 
options over the use of the Flotel 
Superior which potentially extends its 
hire to the end of May 2016 if required.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION In parallel, drilling of the second  
pair of producer-injector wells has 
progressed. Drilling of the second 
producer well (P2) commenced in  
July completing over 1,000 feet of the 
reservoir section. However, mechanical 
problems were encountered which 
resulted in the well being suspended 
during September. The Ocean Valiant 
rig is currently completing the second 
injector well (W2) after intersecting 
some 700ft of high quality reservoir 
sand, before returning to side-track the 
second producing well in the second 
quarter of 2016. 
The field is expected to achieve initial 
production rates of 10–12 kboepd 
following ramp up from the first producer 
well, with plateau production rates of 
20–25 kpoed when the second producer 
well is completed and tied-in around 
mid-year. Cash spend to 31 December on 
the Solan project stood at US$1.88 billion. 
An onshore control room to support 
Solan operations has been established 
within Premier’s Aberdeen office.  
This will facilitate a future move to  
a not permanently manned state  
with resulting lower operating costs, 
and is currently anticipated to occur 
approximately one year after first oil.
Catcher
The Premier-operated Catcher project  
is progressing under budget and is 
scheduled to deliver first oil in the second 
half of 2017 . Key milestones have been 
achieved during the year including the 
subsea installation work planned for 2015, 
which was completed with the successful 
installation of the pipeline end manifold and 
tow templates at Catcher and Burgman.  
In addition, the 60 kilometre gas export 
pipeline was successfully laid and tied  
in during July with minimal weather 
downtime. Fabrication of the subsea 
equipment including flowline bundles 
and associate towheads, the buoy and 
the mid water arches (riser buoyancy 
aids), which are all due to be installed in 
the summer of 2016, is on schedule. 
Drilling activities which started in July 
using the Ensco 100 rig progressed well, 
with excellent operational performance. 
The three Catcher wells, two injectors 
(CTI1 and CCI2) and one producer 
(CCP3), all met or exceeded pre-drill 
expectations in terms of reservoir 
quality and flow rates. In addition,  
the injection well tests successfully 
demonstrated that water can be 
injected into the field. 
Fabrication of the FPSO hull and topsides 
is ongoing in Asia and the sail-away 
date of the FPSO from Singapore for a 
2017 field start up remains on schedule 
following mitigating actions put in place 
by the FPSO provider BW Offshore to 
address scheduling issues. The first 
major FPSO hull section was successfully 
delivered in December to the yard  
in Japan from South Korea. Topsides 
module and turret construction continues 
to progress well in Batam and Singapore. 
The FPSO contractor currently plans the 
commencement of hull and integration 
work in Singapore from summer 2016.
 
Exploration
No exploration wells were drilled in 
2015, however preparations are underway 
to drill two wells in the UK North Sea  
in 2016. Drilling of the Bagpuss/Blofeld 
heavy oil exploration prospect in the 
Moray Firth and the near-field Catcher 
Field prospect at Laverda-Slough  
are planned for the first half of 2016. 
Premier is committed to drilling the 
Bagpuss/Blofeld appraisal well as part 
of a prior commercial arrangement to 
farm into the licence, and the Laverda-
Slough well is a licence commitment. 
The Laverda-Slough well will be drilled 
using the Ensco-100 rig currently 
working on the Catcher project, whilst 
negotiations for the Bagpuss rig 
commitment are currently in progress. 
During 2015, Premier continued to high 
grade and rationalise its UK North Sea 
exploration portfolio with several licences 
relinquished or sold.
Portfolio management
In May 2015, Premier successfully 
acquired Chrysaor’s 40 per cent  
interest in the Solan field for no upfront 
cash consideration and entered into an 
agreement with FlowStream Commodities 
whereby a US$100 million payment was 
received in return for the proceeds from 
15 per cent of production from the field 
for a period of time. These transactions 
removed partner funding concerns and 
reduced the Group’s balance sheet 
exposure to the Solan project.

Premier’s Pakistan business continued to generate positive and stable  
net cash flows for the Group. During 2015, the average realised gas price  
was above US$4/mmscf while operating costs remained low at around  
US$3.7/boe (US$0.58/mscf). 
The fall in production reflects natural 
decline in the Bhit, Qadirpur, Kadanwari 
and Zamzama gas fields only partially 
offset by higher production from the 
Badhra field.
Higher production was achieved  
from the Badhra area with three new 
wells being brought on-stream which 
performed better than expected, 
offsetting natural decline from existing 
wells. The compressor reconfiguration 
project at Bhit, designed to improve the 
ultimate recovery by around 54 billion 
cubic feet (gross), was successfully 
completed and the results are in line 
with expectations. 
Production from the Qadirpur, 
Kadanwari and Zamzama fields fell  
over the year, reflecting natural decline 
in the fields, below expectation 
performance of the new infill wells  
at the Kadanwari field, and deferment 
of a development well in Zamzama.
All costs pertaining to Premier’s 3.75 per 
cent working interest in the Zarghun South 
gas field are carried by the operator. 
Exploration 
Premier drilled one exploration well 
– Bhit South-1 – in Pakistan during the

encountered, the sands were of poor 
reservoir quality, and the well was 
subsequently plugged and abandoned. 
Mauritania
Production and development
Production from the Chinguetti field 
averaged 414 bopd (2014: 447 bopd)

of the low oil price and resulting 
negative cash flows, the joint venture 
partners have decided to cease 
production from the field by the  
end of 2016 and proceed to field 
abandonment during 2017 and 2018. 
Field decommissioning plans are

Development
During the course of 201 5, Premier continued 
to mature the development plan for the Sea 
Lion Phase 1 development and the pre-FEED 
work, which is now complete, has further 
optimised the project. As a result, this initial 
phase will target 220 mmbbls of reserves  
in the north-east and north-west of PL032. 
During the pre-FEED work, the designs  
of both the FPSO and the subsea systems 
evolved and it is now planned that a leased 
FPSO with 18 subsea wells (drilled with a 
conventionally moored mobile offshore 
drilling unit) from a single drill centre, will 
recover 220 mmbbls of oil over 20 years  
(a 37 per cent increase on the 160 mmbbls 
previously announced). Despite the increase 
in scope, the estimate of pre-first oil capex 
requirement remains at US$1.8 billion, 
reflecting significant cost reductions in  
the current market, and total expected 
development capex per barrel has reduced 
from US$14 to US$11/bbl. The technical 
and cost improvements and efficiencies 
identified during pre-FEED work have 
resulted in a lower break-even oil price  
for the project and have significantly 
improved the overall project economics.
As part of the pre-FEED activities, 
tendering exercises were completed and 
a set of world class preferred contractors 
selected for the provision of the FPSO and 
subsea facilities. Premier has entered into 
contracts with SBM Offshore covering the 
FEED for the FPSO, and the subsequent 
provision of the FPSO on a lease and operate 
basis (contingent on project sanction being 
achieved). Contracts have also been 
awarded to Subsea 7 for SURF Transport 
and Installation, and to National Oilwell 
Varco for Flexibles. It is expected that the 
SPS FEED contract will be awarded during 
the first quarter of 2016.
It is planned that the FEED programme  
will last approximately 18 months and 
during this period Premier will work with 
these contractors to further optimise the 
design and fabrication plans for the facilities, 
and will also select the drilling and well 
service contractors. The construction of 
the FPSO will be financed by the FPSO 
provider and Premier is exploring the 
use of a similar leasing scheme for the 
subsea system. The timing of the final 
investment decision remains dependent 
on the economics of the project and  
in particular the oil price outlook.
A draft Field Development Plan has  
been submitted to the Falkland Islands 
Government (‘FIG’) for comment. An 
application has also been made to FIG  
to extend the licence for the Sea Lion 
discovery area in PL032.
Premier and Rockhopper executed  
an amendment to the 2012 Sale and 
Purchase Agreement (‘SPA’) which 
supersedes the Heads of Agreement 
announced in November 2014. The terms 
of this agreement allow Rockhopper to 
utilise the full exploration carry under the 
current exploration campaign whereas  
the development carry of US$674 million 
will be split equally between phase 1  
and the next development phase. 
Rockhopper will pay a Guarantee Fee  
to Premier of US$15.9 million per quarter 
for five years from first oil. Either party 
may renegotiate this amount at the time 
of project sanction if they believe it results  
in an apportionment of value that is 
significantly different from 50/50. Instead 
of the financing arrangements in the 
original SPA, Premier will provide 
Rockhopper with a Standby Loan Facility 
of up to US$750 million (at a 15 per cent 
interest rate), although it is anticipated 
that Rockhopper will continue to review 
alternative financing sources. Premier  
will also continue to progress the 
development financing arrangements 
during FEED, and this work will include  
a farm down process to bring in an 
additional upstream partner. 
An overall development strategy for  
the entire basin has been matured. A 
subsequent phase 2 will develop the  
300 mmbbls remaining reserves in PL032 
and the satellite accumulations in the 
north of PL004. Phase 3 will entail the 
development of the Isobel/Elaine fan 
complex in the south of PL004.
 
Exploration
Premier’s four-well North Falklands 
Basin campaign, targeting multiple 
stacked fans in PL004 and PL032, 
commenced in March using the Eirik 
Raude rig. The Zebedee well in PL004 
was declared a discovery having 
penetrated multiple targets in the 
Cretaceous F2 and F3 formations with  
a total hydrocarbon net pay of 136 feet, 
adding around 60 mmbbls of resource 
to a potential Phase 2 development. 
The Isobel Deep well, which was the 
first test of the Isobel/Elaine fan 
complex, encountered oil-bearing 
sandstone at the prognosed depth and 
opened up a new play in the previously 
unexplored southern part of PL004. 
Following operational difficulties the 
Isobel Deep well was suspended and  
the Eirik Raude rig transferred to another 
operator in the South Falklands Basin. 
The rig returned to the North Falklands 
Basin late in the fourth quarter to 
complete the final two wells of our 
programme. Agreement was reached 
between the joint venture partners and 
the Falkland Islands Government to 
replace drilling the Jayne East prospect 
in PL004 with a re-drill of the Isobel 
prospect. The well, 14/20-2, confirmed 
the results of the original Isobel Deep 
exploration well and in addition 
discovered hydrocarbons in shallower 
sandstone units. 
As a result of material operational issues 
experienced with the Eirik Raude rig during 
its contract, Premier and Noble Energy 
terminated the contract with Ocean Rig 
in February 2016. The last well of the 
four -well campaign, the Chatham exploration 
well, will no longer be drilled in the 
current campaign although it is planned 
that this prospect will be drilled at the 
same time as the Sea Lion development.

Mexico
In July 2015, Premier successfully 
entered Mexico with the award of a 
non-operated 10 per cent interest in 
Blocks 2 and 7 at no upfront cost, in 
partnership with Talos Energy (45 per 
cent operator) and Sierra Oil and Gas 
(45 per cent). The blocks are located in 
the shallow water Sureste Basin in the 
Gulf of Mexico, one of the world’s most 
prolific hydrocarbon provinces and  
the most important in Mexico’s history, 
having produced nearly 50 billion 
barrels of oil equivalent to date. Large 
parts of the basin remain under-explored, 
particularly in comparison to the US 
Gulf of Mexico. One such area is 
the Salinas sub-basin where Blocks 2 
and 7 are located and where light  
oil will be targeted in Tertiary clastic 
reservoirs. The existing 3D seismic data 
will be reprocessed in 2016, with new 
data acquired if necessary in 2017, 
ahead of exploratory drilling in 2017/18. 
Premier is carried on each of the blocks 
up to the point of the first well when it 
has the option to increase its interest  
to 25 per cent prior to drilling. 
The award of Blocks 2 and 7 represents 
the first time in 75 years that Mexico’s 
upstream sector has been open to 
private investment. Further opportunities 
are expected to follow in 2016 and 
beyond, and therefore Premier will be 
well placed, should it wish to invest and 
grow further in Mexico in the longer term.
Brazil
In April, Premier increased its footprint 
in the Ceará Basin, our focus basin in 
Brazil, by farming into CE-M-661 for  
a non-operated 30 per cent equity 
interest at no upfront cost. With its 50 
per cent operated interest in CE-M-717 
and CE-M-665, Premier is now the 
largest net-acreage holder in the  
basin and is well placed to target the 
emerging Cretaceous play fairway. 
Multi-client 3D seismic acquisition 
across all of Premier’s blocks was 
carried out during 2015. Interpretation 
of these 3D seismic surveys will take 
place in 2016, in order to identify 
drilling targets for the end 2017/18 
drilling campaign. 
Portfolio management
Premier has continued to divest  
or relinquish non-core exploration 
acreage in the UK and internationally. 
On 14 December 2015, Premier  
signed an agreement with Bashneft 
International B.V. whereby Premier will 
assign its participating interest share  
in Iraq, Block 12 back to Bashneft,  
the current operator. Completion of  
the assignment remains subject to 
receiving government consents. 
In the Foz do Amazonas Basin  
where Premier holds a 35 per cent 
non-operated interest in block FZA-M-90, 
interpretation of new 3D seismic data 
continues. Drilling targets will be 
matured in 2016. 
In May 2015, Premier withdrew from 
Block 2B onshore Kenya following the 
drilling of the unsuccessful Badada-1 
well and consequently no longer has  
an acreage position in Kenya.

50 FINANCIAL REVIEW Overview
After the sharp fall in crude oil prices  
in the second half of 2014, oil and gas 
prices remained low throughout 2015. 
Brent opened the year at US$55.0/bbl 
and despite increasing to US$65.7/bbl 
in May 2015, the average for 2015 was 
US$52.4/bbl against US$98.9/bbl for  
the prior year, with a closing price of 
US$35.7/bbl at the end of the year. The 
early part of 2016 has seen oil prices fall 
to further lows not seen for many years.
Against this economic backdrop our 
production averaged 57.6 kboepd, 
ahead of our full-year guidance of 55 
kboepd per day (2014: 63.6 kboepd), 
resulting in revenue of US$1,067.2 
million compared with US$1,629.4 
million in 2014. Revenue for the year 
includes US$278.9 million (2014: 
US$46.0 million) for forward sales  
which have settled in the year.
The deterioration in the oil price 
environment has led to downward 
pressure on operating and development 
costs. Combined with the significant 
cost saving initiatives launched by 
Premier, operating costs have reduced 
by over US$100 million year-on-year  
to US$323.6 million (2014: US$436.1 
million). Gross G&A costs for 2015  
were approximately US$230 million,  
a reduction from almost US$300 million 
in 2014, resulting in net G&A costs  
to Premier of US$14.4 million (2014: 
US$25.4 million).

Operating loss (707.8) (248.1)

EBITDAX 750.4 1,073.8
1 As previously reported.
EBITDAX for the year was US$750.4 million 
for 2015 compared to US$1,073.8 million 
for 2014 (as previously reported). The 
lower EBITDAX is mainly due to lower 
oil prices realised and a reduction in 
volumes lifted due to the disposal of 
the Scott area assets in the UK.
Operating cash flows remain strong at 
US$809.5 million (2014: US$924.3 million). 
Included within this balance is US$100 
million received by Premier from 
FlowStream Commodities, accounted 
for as deferred revenue in return  
for granting FlowStream 15 per cent  
of production from the Solan field  
until sufficient barrels have been 
delivered to achieve the rate of return 
within the agreement. 
Net debt at 31 December 2015 amounted 
to US$2,242.2 million (2014: US$2,122.2 
million), with cash resources of S$401.3 
million (2014: US$291.8 million). 
In August 2015, Premier reached 
agreement with its lending group to 
modify its financial covenants until 
mid-2017. Under this agreement our 
financial covenants have been modified 
as follows:
• Net Debt/EBITDAX cover ratio 
increases to 4.75 times until the 
period ending 31 December 2016 
and to 4.5 times for the period ending 
30 June 2017, before returning to its 
pre-modified level of 3.0 times for the 
period ending 31 December 2017.
• Interest cover ratio reduced to  
3.0 times until the period ending  
30 June 2017, before returning to its 
pre-modified level of 4.0 times for  
the period ending 31 December 2017. 
These covenants are tested at  
30 June and 31 December each year, 
based on EBITDAX for the previous  
12 month period.
Premier does not have any significant 
debt maturities until late 2017 and all 
debt is unsecured. 
Income statement
Production and revenue
Group production on a working 
interest basis averaged 57.6 kboepd 
compared to 63.6 kboepd in 2014. 
Lower production year-on-year is  
a result of the Scott area disposal  
and natural decline in the portfolio, 
partially offset by increased 
production from the Chim Sáo field  
in Vietnam. This was driven by high 
operating efficiency and better than 
predicted reservoir performance. 
Entitlement production for the period 
was 53.4 kboepd (2014: 57.8 kboepd).
Premier realised an average price  
for the year of US$52.6/bbl (2014: 
US$98.2/bbl) after taking into account 
timings of actual liftings and export 
duties paid in Vietnam. Post hedging, 
realised prices increased to US$79.0/
bbl (2014: US$101.0/bbl).
Average gas prices for the Group were 
US$5.9 per thousand standard cubic 
feet (mscf) (2014: US$8.4/mscf). Gas 
prices in Singapore, linked to high 
sulphur fuel oil (‘HSFO’) pricing and  
in turn, therefore, linked to crude oil 
pricing, averaged US$9.4/mscf (2014: 
US$16.8/mscf). The average price for 
Pakistan gas (where only a portion  
of the contract formulae is linked to 
energy prices) was US$3.9/mscf (2014: 
US$4.6/mscf).
Total sales revenue from all  
operations fell to US$1,067.2 million 
(2014: US$1,629.4 million), due to the 
fall in average realised prices and the 
lower year-on-year production.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Operating costs
Cost of sales comprise cost of operations, 
change in lifting position, inventory 
movement, royalties and amortisation 
and depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment (‘PP&E’). Cost of sales for the 
Group was US$661.0 million for 2015, 
compared to US$986.2 million for 2014.
Operating costs 2015 2014
Cost of operations 
(US$ million) 323.6 436.1
Unit costs  
of operations  
(US$ per boe) 15.5 18.5
Amortisation of oil 
and gas properties 
(US$ million) 315.9 446.1
Unit amortisation 
rate (US$ per boe)
 
14.8 19.9
The reduction in unit operating costs 
year-on-year was due to improved 
operating efficiency across several  
of the Company’s assets, active cost 
management with our suppliers and 
disposal of the high cost Scott area of 
assets. Underlying unit amortisation fell 
to US$14.8/boe (2014: US$19.9/boe). 
Impairment of oil and gas properties
The sustained low in spot and forward 
oil prices has inevitably had an impact 
on our reported financial results in 
respect of the carrying value of certain 
of our oil and gas assets. An impairment 
charge has been booked in the income 
statement relating to several of our 
fields in the UK North Sea, Indonesia 
and Pakistan. The total amount for  
the impairment (pre-tax) is US$1,023.7 
million (US$583.5 million post-tax) 
(2014: US$784.4 million (pre-tax), 
US$327.8 million (post-tax)). 
Impairment charges for the year, relating 
to UK fields, amounted to US$998.4 
million (pre-tax) (2014: US$732.3 million), 
and were recognised principally for the 
Solan field in addition to a number  
of other producing assets in the UK, 
while the remaining impairment charge 
of US$25.3 million was recognised in 
respect of the Kakap field in Indonesia 
and the Kadanwari field in Pakistan. 
After the recognition of the impairment 
charges there is US$2,611.7 million 
capitalised in relation to PP&E assets 
and US$240.8 million for goodwill.
The principal cause of the impairment 
charge is a further reduction in the 
short to medium-term oil price 
assumption used in estimating the 
future discounted cash flows for each 
field and an increase earlier in the  
year in the expected cost to complete 
and future decommissioning costs 
attributable to the Solan development. 
Exploration expenditure and  
pre-licence costs
Exploration expense and pre-licence 
expenditure costs amounted to 
US$109.0 million (2014: US$71.5 million, 
restated). This includes the write-offs 
relating to the unsuccessful Badada-1 
well drilling costs in Kenya (US$30.9 
million), the Bonneville uncommercial 
discovery in the UK (US$21.0 million) 
and licence costs held for Iraq (US$20.8 
million). After recognition of these 
expenditures, the exploration and 
evaluation asset remaining on the 
balance sheet at 31 December 2015  
is US$749.7 million.
General and administrative expenses
The Group general and administrative 
(‘G&A’) costs on a gross basis were 
significantly reduced year-on-year  
at US$231.7 million (2014: US$298.5 
million), resulting in net G&A costs  
to the Group of US$14.4 million  
(2014: US$25.4 million).
Finance gains and charges
Interest revenue and finance gains reduced 
to US$40.7 million from US$57.1 million 
(restated) in 2014. The principal reason 
for this reduction is the fall in accrued 
interest receivable from the JV partner 
for the Solan development, which ceased 
to be accrued by us on completion of 
the asset acquisition of Chrysaor’s 40  
per cent interest in Solan in May 2015. 
Gross finance costs, before interest 
capitalisation, which included unwinding 
of the discount on decommissioning, 
were reduced to US$219.4 million from 
US$238.0 million (restated). Interest costs 
capitalised increased by US$16.6 million 
to US$58.8 million reflecting increased 
development expenditure on the Solan 
and Catcher assets. 
Taxation
The Group’s total tax charge for 2015  
is US$241.1 million (2014: US$173.7 
million credit as previously reported, 
US$136.5 million restated) which 
comprises a current tax charge for  
the period of US$98.6 million and  
a non-cash deferred tax charge for  
the period of US$142.5 million. 
The total tax charge for the period 
includes a number of material tax  
items arising in the UK. These include 
the effects of the UK Supplementary 
Charge to Tax rate reduction from 32 
per cent to 20 per cent on the opening 
deferred tax asset balance (US$167.2 
million charge) and the net impact of 
ring fence expenditure supplement 
claims in the UK during the period 
offset by the non-recognition of UK  
tax losses and allowances due to the 
prevailing low oil price environment.  
In addition an element of the Group’s 
UK impairment charge for the period  
is treated as a permanent difference 
which results in a reduction in the 
impairment deferred tax credit. The 
Group has a net deferred tax asset of 
US$678.3 million at 31 December 2015 
(2014: US$717.5 million).
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
52 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Discontinued operations
Premier agreed to sell its 100 per cent 
stake in Premier Oil Norge AS (‘PONAS’) 
which comprises all its Norwegian assets, 
to Det norske oljeselskap ASA for a cash 
consideration of US$120 million, which 
was received in December 2015 on 
completion of the transaction. 
As Norway was a separate operating 
segment, the results for this business 
unit have been presented as a 
discontinued operation for the year  
and prior year comparatives are 
restated on the same basis. The loss 
after tax for the year, including a loss on 
disposal recognised of US$29.2 million, 
was US$33.1 million. 
Loss after tax
Loss after tax is US$1,103.8 million 
(2014: US$210.3 million) resulting in  
a basic loss per share of 216.1 cents 
from continuing and discontinuing 
operations (2014: 40.3 cents).
Acquisitions and disposals 
In May 2015, Premier acquired Chrysaor’s 
40 per cent interest in the Solan field for 
nil upfront cash consideration. In return, 
Chrysaor can potentially receive a 
number of contingent payments from a 
notional 40 per cent interest in the field’s 
net operating cash flow. As a result of 
this transaction, Premier recognises 
100 per cent of the Solan field’s 
production, revenues and capex in its 
financial results. The consideration for 
the transaction, recognised as part of 
our total development cost for the Solan 
field (pre-impairment), was US$614.8 
million, which included consideration  
of US$549.0 million for waiving of the 
outstanding loan balance due from 
Chrysaor and US$56.0 million for the  
fair value of the contingent consideration 
using Premier’s long-term oil price 
planning assumptions. 
Under the terms of the transaction, 
Premier agreed to make three types  
of contingent consideration (royalty) 
payments to Chrysaor which depend  
on the future profits generated from  
a notional 40 per cent interest in the 
Solan field. The terms of each royalty 
differ and in certain cases include a 
fixed monetary cap and in other cases 
allow for deductions designed to allow 
Premier to recover the loan previously 
advanced to Chrysaor and/or a 40  
per cent share of the total project 
capital expenditure.
At year end, using the Group’s updated 
long-term planning assumptions, the fair 
value of the contingent consideration 
payable to Chrysaor reduced to US$24.1 
million. The change in fair value of 
US$31.9 million has been recognised  
as other operating income.
Separately, combined cash of  
US$219.6 million was received from  
the completion of the disposals of  
Block A Aceh onshore Indonesia and 
the Scott area assets in the UK (both  
of which completed in January 2015) 
and the sale of the Norway business 
unit (completed in December 2015).
Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities  
was US$809.5 million (2014: US$924.3 
million) after accounting for tax 
payments of US$94.0 million (2014: 
US$208.5 million).
Capital expenditure in 2015 totalled 
US$1,070.1 million, including US$77.9 
million advanced to Chrysaor prior to 
the acquisition of their 40 per cent share 
in Solan (2014: US$1,513.9 million).

of the issue costs of US$0.3 million (2014: US$0.4 
million) and debt arrangement fees of US$28.1 
million (2014: US$27.4 million) respectively.
Long-term borrowings consist of 
convertible bonds, UK retail bonds, 
senior loan notes and bank debt. 
During the period, Premier bought 
back US$148 million and €40 million  
of its US private placement notes at a 
discount to par, repaid a US$300 million 
term loan maturing in the second 
quarter of 2015 and repaid €20 million 
of the Schuldshein notes. Premier 
retains significant cash and undrawn 
facilities which, at 31 December 2015, 
were US$401.3 million and c.US$850  
million respectively. 
Deferred income
Deferred income of US$108.5 million 
has been recognised on the balance 
sheet representing the initial US$100.0 
million of cash proceeds received from 
FlowStream and a finance expense of 
US$8.5 million reflecting the period  
of time from the completion of the 
deal until the year end. This deferred 
income will be released to the income 
statement as barrels are delivered to 
FlowStream post first oil from Solan.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Provisions
The Group’s decommissioning provision 
increased to US$1,062.6 million at  
31 December 2015, up from US$871.3 
million at the end of 2014, principally 
due to an increase in the expected  
cost of decommissioning the Solan and 
Chinguetti assets and the recognition  
of a decommissioning provision on 
Catcher as the development project  
has progressed. 
In addition, contingent consideration 
payable to Chrysaor following the asset 
acquisition of the 40 per cent interest  
in Solan has been recognised.  
The fair value of this future payment  
at 31 December 2015 was US$24.1 
million, with the movement since the 
acquisition date of US$31.9 million 
being recognised as other operating 
income in the year.
Financial risk management
Commodity prices
At year-end, 3.7 mmbbls of Dated Brent 
oil were hedged through forward sales 
for 2016 at an average price of US$68.3/
bbl. This volume represents approximately 
27 per cent of the Group’s expected 
liquids entitlement production in 2016. 
72,000 metric tonnes of HSFO, which 
drives our gas contract pricing in 
Singapore, has been sold forward for 
2016 at an average price of US$400.0/
mt. These hedges cover approximately 
10 per cent of our expected Indonesian 
gas entitlement production for 2016. 
The year-end fair value on the 
commodity swaps was an asset of 
US$114.2 million (2014: US$273.4 
million), which is expected to be 
released to the income statement 
during 2016 as the related barrels  
are lifted.
During 2015, forward oil sales of 
5.6 mmbbls, and forward fuel oil  
sales of 120,000 mt expired resulting  
in a net credit of US$278.9 million 
(2014: US$46.0 million) which has  
been included within sales revenue  
for the year. 
Foreign exchange
Premier’s functional and reporting 
currency is US dollars. Exchange rate 
exposures relate only to local currency 
receipts, and expenditures within 
individual business units. Local currency 
needs are acquired on a short-term 
basis. At the year-end, the Group 
recorded a mark-to-market loss of 
US$19.1 million on its outstanding 
foreign exchange contracts. The Group 
currently has £150.0 million retail bonds, 
€60.0 million long-term senior loan 
notes and £100.0 million term loan in 
issuance which have been hedged 
under cross currency swaps in US 
dollars at average fixed rates of 
US$1.64:£1 and US$1.37:€1. 
Interest rates
The Group has various financing 
instruments including senior loan  
notes, convertible bonds, UK retail 
bonds, term loans and revolving credit 
facilities. As at year-end, 61 per cent  
of total borrowings is fixed or has  
been fixed using the interest rate swap 
markets. On average, the cost of drawn 
funds for the year was c.3.5 per cent. 
Mark-to-market credits on interest rate 
swaps amounted to US$7.7 million 
(2014: credit of US$6.8 million), which 
are recorded as movements in other 
comprehensive income.
Insurance
The Group undertakes a significant 
insurance programme to reduce the 
potential impact of physical risks 
associated with its exploration, 
development and production activities. 
Business interruption cover is purchased 
for a proportion of the cash flow from 
producing fields for a maximum period 
of 18 months. During 2015, claims 
amounting to US$10.2 million were 
agreed in relation to umbilical damage 
on Dua (Chim Sáo) and re-drill costs on 
Rochelle, which occurred in 2013. 
Going concern
The Group monitors its funding  
position and its liquidity risk throughout 
the year to ensure it has access to 
sufficient funds to meet forecast cash 
requirements. Cash forecasts are 
regularly produced based on, inter  
alia, the Group’s latest life of field 
production and expenditure forecasts, 
management’s best estimate of future 
commodity prices (based on recent 
forward curves, adjusted for the Group’s 
hedging programme) and the Group’s 
borrowing facilities. Sensitivities are run 
to reflect different scenarios including, 
but not limited to, changes in oil  
and gas production rates, possible 
reductions in commodity prices and 
delays or cost overruns on major 
development projects. This is done to 
identify risks to liquidity and covenant 
compliance and enable management  
to formulate appropriate and timely 
mitigation strategies. 
At year-end, the Group had significant 
headroom on its borrowing facilities and 
related covenants. However, although 
the Group expects to have sufficient 
availability of liquidity under these 
existing facilities during the next 12 
months, the Group’s projections currently 
indicate, unless mitigating actions can 
be taken, that a breach of one of the 
financial covenants within the Group’s 
borrowing facilities is likely to arise in 
respect of the testing period ending  
30 June 2016. If an agreement cannot 
be reached with the Group’s principal 
lenders in relation to the amendment  
or relaxation of such covenants and  
a covenant breach therefore occurs  
then, under the terms of the Group’s 
borrowing facilities, the Group’s debt 
holders on all of the Group’s facilities 
will have the right to request re-payment 
of the outstanding debt from October 
2016 onwards and to cancel the

54 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued The Group continues to work towards 
the completion of the acquisition of the 
E.ON E&P UK assets. If this transaction 
completes, it is expected to have a 
significant positive effect on the Group’s 
near-term financial covenant calculations. 
However, at current oil prices, in the 
absence of other mitigating actions,  
this is unlikely to fully mitigate any 
potential covenant shortfall in respect 
of the testing period ending 30 June 
2016. Therefore, the Group will seek  
to modify or temporarily waive the 
existing covenants ahead of the end  
of the testing period. 
The risk that the Group will be unable to 
achieve appropriate mitigating actions 
prior to 30 June 2016 or secure an 
appropriate relaxation or amendment  
of its financial covenants in order  
to avoid a breach of covenant is  
a material uncertainty which the 
Financial Reporting Council Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting requires us to report may 
cast significant doubt upon the 
Company’s ability to continue to apply 
the going concern basis of accounting.
Nevertheless, after making enquiries 
and considering the uncertainties 
described above, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will avoid a covenant breach. 
Therefore, the Group and Company are 
expected to have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, being at least 
the next 12 months from the date of 
approval of the 2015 Annual Report and 
Accounts. Accordingly, the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements.
Business risks 
Premier’s business may be impacted  
by various risks leading to failure to 
achieve strategic targets for growth, 
loss of financial standing, cash flow  
and earnings, and reputation. Not all  
of these risks are wholly within the 
Company’s control and the Company 
may be affected by risks which are not 
yet manifest or reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is critical to 
achieving our strategic objectives and 
protecting our personnel, assets, the 
communities where we operate and 
with whom we interact and our reputation. 
Premier therefore has a comprehensive 
approach to risk management.
A critical part of the risk management 
process is to assess the impact and 
likelihood of risks occurring so that 
appropriate mitigation plans can be 
developed and implemented. Risk 
severity matrices are developed  
across Premier’s business to facilitate 
assessment of risk. The specific risks 
identified by project and asset teams, 
business units and corporate functions 
are consolidated and amalgamated to 
provide an oversight of key risk factors 
at each level, from operations through 
business unit management to the 
Executive Committee and the Board. 
For all the known risks facing the 
business, Premier attempts to minimise 
the likelihood and mitigate the impact. 
According to the nature of the risk, 
Premier may elect to take or tolerate 
risk, treat risk with controls and 
mitigating actions, transfer risk to third 
parties, or terminate risk by ceasing 
particular activities or operations. 
Premier has a zero tolerance to financial 
fraud or ethics non-compliance, and 
ensures that HSES risks are managed  
to levels that are as low as reasonably 
practicable, whilst managing 
exploration and development risks  
on a portfolio basis.
The Group has identified its principal 
risks for the next 12 months as being:
• Commodity price volatility;
• Production and development 
delivery;
• Financial discipline and governance;
• Health, safety, environment and 
security (‘HSES’);
• Joint venture partner alignment;
• Host government – political and 
fiscal risks;
• Organisational capability; and
• Exploration success and  
reserves addition.
Further information detailing the way 
in which these risks are mitigated is 
provided on the Company website:

B. Materiality Materiality assessment process
In line with the Global Reporting 
Initiative G4 Guidelines, our annual 
corporate responsibility reporting 
focuses on our most material issues. 
Materiality has been assessed (in 
conjunction with third party experts)  
on the basis of:
• The potential/actual impact  
of Premier on stakeholders  
and their interests
• The potential/actual impact  
of stakeholders on Premier  
and the achievement of its  
business objectives
Material issues
The corporate responsibility materiality 
matrix sets out the results of the 
assessment process, with arrows 
indicating the most significant  
changes compared with 2014. 
Presentation of an issue as  
‘non-material’ on this matrix does  
not mean it is irrelevant or that it  
is not being managed by Premier.
Key changes in Premier’s Material Issues 
between 2014 and 2015 are indicated  
in the matrix and include: 
• The new status of ‘Responsible  
supply chain management’ as a 
Material Issue – reflecting growing 
stakeholder expectations and a 
regulatory trend towards increased 
transparency and disclosure
• Increased prioritisation of ‘Economic 
contributions’ for both Premier and  
its stakeholders – reflecting: (1)  
the challenges posed by the  
current market environment;  
and (2) growing international focus  
on tax transparency
• Increased prioritisation of ‘Employee 
engagement’ for stakeholders – 
reflecting the actual and potential 
impacts of the low price environment 
on Premier’s workforce
• Increased prioritisation of ‘Climate 
change and GHGs’ for both Premier 
and its stakeholders – reflecting 
growing international consensus  
on the need for stronger action to 
address man-made climate change. 
This has been reflected in the 
outcomes of the COP21
1
 meeting  
in Paris in December 2015 as well  
as public support by a number of  
oil and gas majors for fair and 
coherent carbon pricing

Context
Newborns Vietnam is a UK-registered 
charity that operates in Vietnam.  
The charity, which is highly dependent 
on support from volunteers, works to 
improve the health of newborn infants 
and their mothers. 
It does so by delivering neonatal 
nursing and medical education 
programmes designed to produce 
skilled and capable professionals. 
These professionals can play an active 
role in reducing both neonatal mortality 
as well as long-term disability that can 
result from poor care. The charity works 
with higher education institutions and 
teaching hospitals in the UK to deliver 
these programmes.
Premier has supported Newborns since 
2013, when it became the first sponsor 
of the charity’s initial challenge bicycle 
ride, an event designed to raise funds for 
neonatal nurse training. Following the 
success of this ride, the charity has held 
regular fundraising cycling events across 
Vietnam, which Premier has continued 
to support and participate in. 
Supporting neonatal nurse education  
through Newborns Vietnam, Vietnam
Actions in 2015
Premier paid US$10,000 to sponsor 
Newborns’ ‘Cycle a Difference Vietnam 
Challenge Ride’, a two-week-long 
fundraising bicycle ride through 
northern Vietnam that took place in 
November 2015. The purpose of the 
ride (attended by cyclists from a range 
of countries) was to help finance the 
provision of specialist training by 
UK-based professionals for neonatal 
nurses and doctors in Vietnam. It also 
helped provide relevant equipment.
In addition to the sum donated by the 
Company, staff at Premier’s Vietnam 
business unit have engaged in a variety 
of small-scale fundraising activities 
throughout the year (including bake 
sales and sponsored events), which 
have raised approximately US$5,000  
in funding for Newborns. 
Impacts
The money provided by Premier  
and its staff is of great importance  
to Newborns and the programmes  
and initiatives that it currently operates.  
The initial funding that Premier 
provided in 2013 not only enabled  
the first challenge ride to take place, 
but also acted as a catalyst for other 
businesses to support these events, 
which have so far raised US$600,000 
in revenue for the charity. As a result 
of this revenue, the charity has been 
able to significantly improve neonatal 
healthcare at the Da Nang Women 
and Children’s Hospital, located in 
central Vietnam. Specialist training 
provided by Newborns has helped to 
reduce its neonatal mortality rate by 
50 per cent between 2012 and 2014. 
It is hoped that this positive impact 
can be extended to other hospitals. 
The most able nurses trained under 
this programme will become Nurse 
Practice Educators, who will teach  
the skills they have learned in district 
hospitals throughout Vietnam’s central 
region in 2016. Over time, it is hoped 
that this sustainable training model  
will result in thousands of newborns 
across the central region benefiting 
from high-quality nursing care.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Governance and business ethics
Premier’s Business Ethics Policy supports 
its overall Corporate Responsibility Policy, 
and our activities in this respect are 
governed by our Global Code of 
Conduct (the ‘Code’). Implementation  
of the Code is supported by a Company-
wide leadership group, made up of 
business ethics champions from each 
business unit. The group meets twice  
a year and addresses any opportunities 
for improving performance.
The Code is compliant with the UK 
Bribery Act and covers:
• Legal compliance
• Anti-bribery
• Facilitation payments
• Gifts and hospitality
• The appointment of intermediaries
• Charitable and political donations
• Whistleblowing
• The proper recording of transactions 
and the application of relevant 
accounting and reporting standards
All employees and those associated 
with Premier, such as consultants, are 
required to adhere to the Code. We 
require our business partners, including 
joint venture partners, contractors, 
customers and suppliers, to apply the 
principles of the Code or equivalent 
The following section provides an overview of our material 
corporate responsibility issues and explains why they are  
material to us, how we manage them and some of the key 
performance indicators we use to measure our performance. 
Why this issue is material
Good governance underpins the entire 
scope of our business and our ability  
to act in a way that is not only legally 
compliant but which is also responsible. 
Doing business in this manner allows us 
to build and maintain the trust of our 
key stakeholders, including actual and 
potential investors, host governments 
and societies, business partners 
(including suppliers) and customers, 
whilst also ensuring our compliance  
with applicable laws and regulations. 
Furthermore, it is our responsibility to 
enhance rather than undermine our 
business environments, both for our own 
benefit and that of our stakeholders.
How we manage this issue
Our Corporate Responsibility Policy  
is owned and promulgated by our 
Board, whilst its supporting policies  
are owned and implemented by our 
Executive Committee. Premier’s 
corporate responsibility activities are 
managed on a day-to-day basis by:
• The Group Development and 
Operations Manager, who oversees 
the management of HSES issues
• The Group Head of Corporate 
Services, who oversees human  
rights, government relations and  
risk management 
• The Group Human Resources Director, 
who oversees human resources
• The Group General Counsel,  
who overseas legal and regulatory

standards. The main means by which  
we do so is the integration of business 
ethics provisions (such as anti-corruption 
requirements) into our contracts.
Any breach of the Code by our 
employees will result in disciplinary 
action, and, in extreme cases, in instant 
dismissal and referral to the relevant  
law enforcement authorities. 
Whistleblowing hotline
Premier encourages employees, 
contractors and agency workers to 
voice their concerns to line managers  
if they think the Company or anyone 
working on behalf of the Company has 
not acted in accordance with the Global 
Code of Conduct. Premier provides  
a confidential and well publicised 
independent third party reporting 
hotline for employees who feel unable 
to raise concerns via other procedures. 
This hotline is available 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. No material incidents 
of corruption or non-compliance with the 
Code were identified in 2015.

System (‘BMS’). These include our 
Golden Rules, which are designed to 
help address the most common causes 
of serious incidents at oil and gas facilities. 
The HSES Management System 
prescribes how HSES issues should be 
managed throughout the hydrocarbon 
lifecycle (exploration, development, 
production and decommissioning). It 
applies to all our operated assets and 
activities. Certain elements also apply 
to our assets that are operated by  
third parties and to activities that we 
contract out. The management system 
is externally certified to the OHSAS 
18001 health and safety management 
system standard for our production 
facilities and drilling operations.
We aim to provide our employees, 
contractors, visitors, neighbours and the 
environment with a high level of protection 
and believe that all major accidents are 
preventable. Because of this, we carry  
out regular reviews of our operations to 
assess the risk of major accidents and to 
implement relevant measures to prevent 
their occurrence. HSES performance is 
monitored, measured and reported on an 
ongoing basis to the Executive Committee 
and to the Board.
Why this issue is material
Given the potential risks associated  
with offshore oil and gas operations, 
health and safety is paramount in 
everything we do. This is not only  
due to the potential impacts of health, 
safety and security incidents on our 
employees and contractors, but also  
the need to maintain our:
• Operational continuity
• Environmental performance 
• Regulatory compliance
• Corporate reputation amongst  
our employees, business partners, 
government partners and investors
Key issues in this regard include: 
• Process safety and asset integrity
• Emergency preparedness
• Occupational health and safety
• Employee and asset protection
How we manage this issue 
Premier’s Health, Safety, Environment 
and Security Policy (‘HSES Policy’)

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Why this issue is material
Premier currently conducts all of its 
operated activities offshore, where we 
drill for and extract oil and gas from 
sub-surface reservoirs. By their very 
nature, offshore oil and gas operations 
can have a range of potential impacts 
on water quality, air quality and local 
ecosystems. Furthermore, any failure  
to responsibly avoid and/or mitigate 
negative environmental impacts poses 
a material risk to Premier’s reputation, 
as well as our ability to comply with  
our legal and regulatory obligations. 
Our most significant environmental 
issues relate to:
• Greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with energy consumption and flaring 
at our facilities
• Effluents and waste, including  
the prevention of spills and the 
responsible management of 
hazardous materials
How we manage this issue
We manage our environmental 
performance across the lifecycles of  
our operations and projects through 
our HSES Management System. All of 
our operated production and drilling 
activities are certified to the ISO 14001 
environmental management standard. 
Our HSES Management System, as well 
as our external ISO 14001 audits, help 
ensure our compliance with relevant 
environmental legislation and regulations.
Under our HSES Management System, 
we conduct baseline surveys and 
prepare environmental and social 
impact assessments (‘ESIAs’) for  
each operated activity. 
The assessments include:
• Physical impacts
• Ecosystem impacts
• Socio-economic impacts
As part of this process, we gauge the 
significance of each impact and assess 
how we can reduce it to a level that is 
‘as low as reasonably practicable’ 
(‘ALARP’). In this context, we decide on 
the implementation of potential impact 
controls on the basis of:
• Efficacy
• Practicality
• Cost
We gather environmental metrics from 
each business unit on a monthly basis. 
These are analysed and relevant 
performance indicators are reported  
to the Board each month. In addition, 
we distribute an HSES scorecard to all 
personnel to keep them informed of 
Company HSES performance.

5  Calculations of Scope 1 emissions (i.e. direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) are based on equations and emission factors provided in the 2009 API GHG 
Compendium. Global warming potential rates are taken from the IPCC (2013) Assessment Report as well as IOGP guidance.

Climate Change, the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (‘DEFRA’) and International Energy Agency guidance. A different factor is used for each 
country, and is applied to the total energy consumption in our onshore facilities (offices and warehouses). Emission factors are used to give an estimate of CO

 equivalent. 
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
62 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW continued Why this issue is material
Like any company, the ongoing success of 
our business is underpinned by our ability 
to recruit, retain and motivate high-quality, 
skilled employees and contractors. This 
still remains the case despite the fact 
that current market conditions have 
made competition for relevant technical 
and management skills less acute than 
in recent years. In this context, Premier 
seeks to treat its people fairly, offer 
meaningful professional development 
and deliver rewards commensurate with 
employee performance.
Key issues in this regard include:
• Workforce profile 
• Learning and development
• Employee engagement (and rewards)
How we manage this issue
Human resource matters are addressed 
in a number of cross-cutting Premier 
policies. These include our overarching 
Corporate Responsibility Policy, our 
Human Rights Policy and our Global 
Code of Conduct. Our online human 
resources information system (the 
People Portal) and BMS host a range  
of processes and guidance that underpin 
our HR Management System. 
This includes processes and guidance 
relating to:
• Performance
• Resourcing
• Reward
• Succession
• Competency management
The BMS helps us achieve the correct 
balance between consistent corporate 
policy requirements and flexible, local-level 
requirements across the Group. 
When recruiting, developing and dealing 
with employees and service providers, we 
treat people fairly, equally and without 
prejudice, irrespective of gender, race, 
age, disability, sexual orientation or any 
other similar discriminatory attributes. 
This approach is embedded in our 
employment policies, which apply to all 
permanent, contractual and temporary 
staff, and to all job applicants. 
We encourage staff to develop their 
professional skills to the advantage of 
both the individual and the Company, 
and provide experiential learning 
opportunities, coaching and training  
to support this objective. Although we 
do not currently employ any disabled 
people, this of course extends to those 
disabled employees that we might 
employ in the future. We will also strive 
to provide continued employment for 
members of our workforce who become 
disabled whilst employed by us.
Premier encourages open 
communication between employees 
and managers on an ongoing basis.  
We use a number of one- and two-way 
communication mechanisms to keep 
employees informed about wider 
Company issues and performance. 
These include: 
• Regular team meetings
• A regularly updated Company intranet
• Video messages from our Chief 
Executive Officer and other members 
of the Executive Committee
• Ongoing email communications  
on Company matters
• Town Hall staff meetings at each 
business unit, attended by visiting 
members of the Executive Committee 
and senior management
We carry out regular structured employee 
surveys on a local basis. These help us 
gain insight into employee attitudes 
towards commitment, rewards, retention, 
working conditions and related issues.
Premier will typically provide its employees 
and their elected representatives (where 
relevant) with at least one month’s 
notice of any significant operational 
changes that might affect them.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Why this issue is material
The offshore nature of our operations 
means that community relations are not 
as critical for Premier as for companies 
with onshore operations. Nonetheless, 
they remain important due to:
• The impact of our activities (and those 
of our exploration partners) on local 
fishing communities, as well as our 
reliance on certain onshore communities 
as transit and logistics points for  
our offshore operations
• The important role that our 
community investment activities play, 
in terms of our reputation and wider 
social licence to operate
• The impact of our non-operated 
onshore exploration and production 
activities (in Pakistan and at Wytch 
Farm in the United Kingdom, for 
example), and the potential for new 
onshore operations in the future
A key issue in this regard is:
• Our generation of value for  
local communities
In addition, we are careful to minimise 
our negative impacts on local 
communities, if they do occur.
How we manage this issue
Our approach to community relations  
is governed by Premier’s Community 
Investment Policy. The Policy includes 
several commitments, ranging from  
the maintenance of transparent and 
constructive engagement with 
stakeholders, to working to achieve  
a net positive socio-economic impact 
on local communities. It is applied 
through our Community Investment 
Management System, which is aligned 
with IPIECA standards. Under the 
management system, we systematically 
identify, manage, evaluate and budget 
our disbursements and engagements  
in host countries. It focuses on the 
following key aspects:
• Policy governance
• Risk evaluation management
• Planning
• Implementation and monitoring
• Audit and review
All of our operations have community 
investment and engagement 
programmes in place.

Development

in Piabung  
Village, Indonesia
Context
In 2015, Premier began a new community 
investment project in Piabung Village, 
which is located on Matak Island in the 
same region as Natuna Sea Block A. The 
village, which is home to approximately 
900 inhabitants, is situated in a remote 
area and is currently served by relatively 
poor quality roads. Like many of 
Indonesia’s more remote island 
communities, it has restricted access  
to high-quality public services. 
In addition, the region in which the village 
is located (the Anambas Regency) is 
facing heightened levels of inward 
migration from other parts of Indonesia. 
Concerns have been raised by some 
community leaders that this could 
potentially threaten efforts to conserve 
traditional Malay cultural heritage.
Actions in 2015
In recognition of the challenges faced 
by the community, Premier contributed 
more than US$40,000 to help develop  
a Community Learning Centre in the 
village. The Centre, which received  
the full support of the village head  
and local leaders, has been equipped 
with a variety of facilities, including: 
• A public library containing 
approximately 1,000 books and a 
computer terminal through which 
users can access the internet.
• A community radio system that  
can broadcast to the inhabitants  
of Piabung Village as well as eight 
surrounding villages

64 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW continued Why this issue is material
Premier’s activities and relationships 
have the potential to directly and 
indirectly impact a range of stakeholders. 
Conversely, these stakeholders also 
have the potential to affect Premier’s 
business at both a local and national 
level. In this context, it is important  
for Premier to respect the rights of  
local people, work transparently and 
constructively with government and 
other stakeholders, and demonstrate  
its economic value to broader society.
Key issues in this regard are:
• Human rights
• Public policy and government 
relations
• Economic contributions
How we manage this issue
Our interactions with society are 
managed through a number of  
policies, including our overarching 
Corporate Responsibility Policy, Code 
of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and  
Risk Management Policy, and through 
our associated management systems. 
Where relevant, we are also guided by 
the United Nations Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights.
The Strategic Report, which has  
been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006, has been approved and 
signed on behalf of the Board.

Impacts
Premier handed the new Centre over  
to the community on its completion in 
October 2015. It was warmly received  
and is quickly beginning to support local 
learning in Piabung, as well as broadcasting 
to the 2,000 people within range of  
the radio transmitter. Furthermore,  
the library is acting as a repository of 
information about local culture and 
traditions, helping preserve valuable 
cultural capital for future generations.

community investment activity can

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Our approach  
to governance
Compliance statement 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’) was updated by the FRC in September 
2014 and takes effect for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 October 2014. 
This report, together with the Nomination 
Committee Report, the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
sections of the Strategic Report incorporated  
by reference, describes the manner in which  
the Company has applied the main principles  
of governance set out in the Code and complied 
with the individual Code provisions. 
It is the Board’s view that the Company has fully 
complied with the Code throughout 2015.
Dear shareholder,
2015 has again been a challenging year 
for Premier Oil as we continue to adjust 
to the low oil price environment. We 
have sought to meet the challenges this 
presents from a governance perspective 
by ensuring that Board agendas are 
managed to allow more time for major 
project sanction and other strategic 
decisions, including, where necessary, 
additional ‘deep dive’ sessions to gain an 
in-depth understanding of both current 
and pre-sanctioned projects, review 
management of engineering progress, 
and quality and budgetary control. 
By ensuring that our Directors receive 
accurate, timely, comprehensive and 
clear information, your Board aims to 
ensure that it is effective in making the 
right decisions to secure the long-term 
success of the business for the benefit  
of its stakeholders whilst, at the same 
time, continuing to focus on minimising 
the Company’s cost base to address  
the low oil price environment. 
We have ensured that sound systems  
of risk management and internal control 
remain in place and are not adversely 
impacted by the cost reduction exercise. 
Our governance
Your Board is committed to the 
highest standards of stewardship  
and governance and aims to maintain  
a culture which demands the same 
commitment and performance in all 
the Company’s business activities. 
Good governance provides a framework 
that allows the right decisions to be taken 
by the right people at the right time. 
The information provided in this report, 
and in conjunction with the reports from 
each of the Board Committees and 
related sections of the Strategic Report, 
will help you to understand how the 
Company has been run, how risks are 
being managed and controls monitored, 
and how key decisions have been taken 
over the past year. This report also 
includes information regarding the Board 
and Committee effectiveness review 
undertaken during the year, the outcome 
of which is presented on page 75.
Board changes and succession planning
On 30 June 2015, Andrew Lodge stood 
down from the Board and from his 
position as Exploration Director. Having 
given due and careful consideration to  
the skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board and the needs of the business 
in terms of its corporate planning and 
decision making, it was agreed that 
Andrew’s successor would be recruited 
from our internal pool of talent and would 
become a member of our Executive 
Committee rather than the position being 
at Board level. This decision supports our 
succession planning strategy which has 
been a strong focus for the Nomination 
Committee and the Board during the 
course of 2015. 
A considerable amount of work has  
been undertaken to assess the skills and 
knowledge on the Board and its Committees 
to ensure that we have a robust plan for the 
succession needs of the business. Further 
details are contained in the Nomination 
Committee Report on page 84.
On 29 May 2015, our Company Secretary, 
Stephen Huddle, retired and we appointed 
Rachel Rickard as Company Secretary. 
Rachel has over 13 years’ experience as 
a chartered secretary and we are confident 
that she will play a key role in ensuring 
that the Board maintains the highest 
standards of corporate governance.
Our shareholders
Engagement with our shareholders is  
a priority for the Board. By maintaining 
good dialogue with our shareholders,  
we ensure that our objectives are 
understood and that we receive regular 
feedback on our strategy, performance 
and governance. This enables us to build 
confidence amongst our shareholders  
in the Board’s ability to oversee the 
implementation of the Company’s 
strategy and address the immediate 
challenges faced by the business. 
Through ongoing dialogue, we can 
ensure that we continue to take account 
of shareholders’ views as we address 
these challenges and we would like  
to take this opportunity to thank our 
shareholders and our debt providers  
for their support. 
Further details of our shareholder 
engagement activities are provided  
on page 77.
Board focus 2016
The Board’s priorities in 2016, from a 
governance perspective, will include: 
strategic decision making, particularly on 
investment and divestment opportunities; 
succession planning activities to ensure 
that we have the right skills and knowledge 
on our Board to address the future  
needs of our business; the continuous 
improvement of our risk management 
and internal control framework to ensure 
that the identification and mitigation of 
risks remains at the heart of how we govern 
our business; the further development  
of the skills and knowledge of our existing 
Board members to support the effectiveness 
of our Board; and the continued review  
of executive remuneration to ensure that 
it reflects both our short and long-term 
business objectives and continues to align 
the interests of our Executive Directors 
with those of our shareholders. Further 
details of our remuneration policy are 
contained in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 86 to 114.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Our governance goes beyond 
regulatory compliance and puts the 
interests of our shareholders at the 
heart of the Board’s decision-making. 
Risk management and internal control 
The Board sets the Company’s strategic 
objectives and ensures that they are 
properly pursued within a sound framework 
of internal controls and risk management. 
As part of this process, the Board determines 
the nature and extent of the principal 
risks it is willing to take in achieving  
the Company’s strategic objectives  
and ensures that major risks are actively 
monitored, with health, safety , environment 
and security (‘HSES’) borne in mind at  
all times.
The Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible 
for the governance of the Company on 
behalf of Premier’s shareholders and is 
accountable to Premier’s shareholders 
for the long-term success of the Group. 
The Board governs the Group  
in accordance with authority set  
out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association and in compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’). A copy of the Articles  
of Association is available on Premier’s 
website www.premier-oil.com. A copy 
of the Code can be accessed via the 
web at www.fca.org.uk.
Position Role and responsibilities
Chairman  
of the Board
•  The Chairman’s role is part-time and he is a Non-Executive Director. His key responsibility is the leadership  
of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role including maintaining effective communication 
with Premier’s shareholders. Between Board meetings the Chairman is responsible for ensuring the integrity 
and effectiveness of the Board/Executive relationship. This is effected through meetings, as well as contact  
with other Board members, shareholders, joint venture partners and host governments.
•  There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  
which has been agreed by the Board and is set out in writing.
Chief Executive 
Officer
•  The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Group’s operations, for applying 
Group policies including HSES and for implementing the strategy agreed by the Board. He plays a pivotal role 
in developing and reviewing the strategy in consultation with the Board and in executing it with the support  
of the Executive Committee.
Senior  
Independent 
Director
•  The Company’s Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to shareholders who have concerns 
that cannot be resolved through discussion with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other Executive 
Directors. The Senior Independent Director is responsible for leading the annual appraisal of the Chairman’s 
performance, which is discussed further on page 74.
Non-Executive 
Directors 
•  The Non-Executive Directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy and resource, 
including key appointments and standards of conduct. The Non-Executive Directors have a particular 
responsibility to challenge independently and constructively the performance of executive management  
and to monitor the performance of the management team in the delivery of the agreed objectives and targets. 
In meeting this responsibility, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet periodically without the 
Executive Directors present, and the Non-Executive Directors meet once a year without the Chairman present. 
The Non-Executive Directors must also be satisfied with the integrity of the Group’s financial information  
and with the robustness of internal control and risk management systems. The Non-Executive Directors are 
responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors and have a key  
role in succession planning and the appointment of and, where necessary, removal of Directors.
•  Non-Executive Directors are required to be free from any relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect 
their judgement. The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the independence of Non-Executive Directors.
•  Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a specified term of three years subject to annual re-election  
and to Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of a director. The terms and conditions of their 
appointment are made available for inspection. Letters of appointment set out an expected time commitment, 
and all Non-Executive Directors undertake that they will have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively and any significant other business commitments are disclosed to the Board prior to appointment. 
Changes to such commitments are disclosed to the Board on an ongoing basis. Where necessary to discharge 
their responsibilities as directors, the Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense.
Company  
Secretary
•  The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. 
The Company Secretary, under the direction of the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring good information 
flows between the Board and its Committees and between senior management and the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Company Secretary also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the induction of new directors and 
assisting with the ongoing training and development needs of Board members as required. All Directors  
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are complied with. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved 
for the Board as a whole.
The Board is responsible for maintaining 
sound risk management and internal 
control systems. In meeting this 
responsibility, the Board monitors  
the Company’s risk management  
and internal control systems throughout 
the year and, on an annual basis, carries 
out a review of their effectiveness. 
Further details about the systems  
used for ongoing monitoring and 
annual review of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control 
environment are set out in the Principal 
Risks section of the Strategic Report  
on pages 30 to 36 and on page 80 of 
the Audit and Risk Committee Report.

Board are set out in the diagram below.
The Board has the opportunity to  
meet with management and discuss key 
projects through Board presentations 
and more detailed ‘deep dive’ sessions.
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit and 
Risk, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. Each Committee has 
formal terms of reference approved by 
the Board which can also be found on 
the Company’s website. The Company 
Secretary provides advice and support 
to the Board and all Board Committees. 
Board Committees are authorised to 
engage the services of external advisers 
as they deem necessary. 
Further details on the work of our 
Committees, the number of Committee 
meetings held and individual attendance 
by Directors, are shown in the Committee 
sections of this report.
How the Board operates
The Board has a structured agenda  
for the year ensuring all relevant  
matters are considered with sufficient 
time for discussion. The programme is 
structured to include: strategic issues, 
including setting the strategy and 
assessing performance in executing  
the strategy; the annual business  
plan and budget; HSES and risk; 
corporate responsibility; investor 
relations; corporate reporting; Board 
Committee related activity, including 
matters requiring Board sanction;  
and corporate governance matters.
The Board meets at least six times  
each year and, in addition, an update 
conference call takes place in the 
months when no formal meeting is 
scheduled. The agenda for each Board 
meeting is set by the Chairman in 
consultation with the Chief Executive

Quarterly Performance Review meetings 
are also held between ExCo members 
and the senior management team from 
within each of the business units and 
include risk management and HSES 
reviews as part of the overall review  
of each quarter.
Delegation of authority
Responsibility levels are communicated 
throughout the Group as part of the 
Business Management System and 
through an authorisation manual which 
sets out delegated authority levels, 
segregation of duties and other control 
procedures. The manual was updated  
in 2015 to reflect changes to the 
organisational structure. Further details 
of the Business Management System 
are provided on page 34 of the 
Strategic Report.
Board activity
In accordance with the normal Board 
procedure outlined on page 71, the 
Board held six full meetings during  
the year and, in addition, an update 
conference call took place in the months 
when no formal Board meeting was  
held. In addition, the Board held further 
ad-hoc meetings to consider and approve 
key projects and business developments 
such as new country entry and asset sales.
Details of the number of Board meetings 
held and individual attendance by 
Directors are shown in the table below. 
The Board also attended ‘deep dive’ 
sessions during the year, allowing extra 
time to explore key aspects of the 
business outside of a formal meeting 
setting and with access to members of 
senior management. Subject areas are 
included in the table opposite and are 
detailed on page 76. Case studies on 
the Sea Lion deep dive and the HSES 
and Asset Integrity deep dive are set 
out on pages 75 and 76 respectively.
Executive Committee and 
management structure
The Board delegates the day-to-day 
running of the Group to the Chief 
Executive Officer who is assisted by the 
Executive Committee. The Executive 
Committee (‘ExCo’) meets formally once 
a month and its membership comprises: 
each of the Executive Directors; Nic Braley, 
the Group Commercial and Strategy 
Manager; Mike Fleming, the Group  
HR Director; Andy Gibb, the Group 
General Counsel; Dean Griffin, the 
Head of Exploration; and Paul Williams, 
the Group Development and Operations 
Manager. In addition to formal monthly 
ExCo meetings, the ExCo holds fortnightly 
meetings with the Country Managers 
and, in the alternate weeks, there is a 
fortnightly meeting with functional 
heads which includes, in addition to 
ExCo members, the Head of Business 
Development and additional members 
of the exploration team.

process went
Board performance evaluation
The Board last undertook an externally 
facilitated performance evaluation 
exercise in 2013 and will be doing so 
again in 2016.
In 2015, an internal Board evaluation 
exercise was carried out mirroring the 
process carried out in 2014. Detailed 
surveys were compiled with input  
from all relevant internal stakeholders. 
Topics included: 
• Board size and composition
• Board process
• Board support
• Board dynamics
• Strategy
• Shareholder engagement
• The Board’s interface with  
middle management
• The balance between strategic  
and operational matters  
considered by the Board
• Risk identification
• HR and succession planning issues
• The Board’s oversight of the 
development, management and 
control of projects and priorities  
for change 
The evaluation included individual 
Director performance reviews, a review 
of the work of the Board’s Committees and 
a review of the Chairman’s performance. 
One-to-one interviews were held by  
the Chairman with each Director and,  
in the case of reviewing the Chairman’s 
performance, by the Senior Independent 
Director with each Director. 
Although there was no explicit corporate 
responsibility component to the 2015 
evaluation process, there were opportunities 
for Directors to raise any concerns in this 
regard through the survey or interview 
process as well as directly with senior 
management at a Board ‘deep dive’ 
session held on corporate responsibility 
during the year.
The results of the evaluation were 
condensed into a report by the Chairman 
and discussed by the Board as a whole.
Re-election of Directors
Following satisfactory performance 
effectiveness reviews, it was agreed that 
each of the Directors be put forward  
for re-election at the 2016 AGM. For any 
Directors serving beyond six years, the 
performance review was particularly 
rigorous. It was agreed that Joe Darby, 
David Lindsell and Michel Romieu, each 
having served over six years, continue to 
provide sound, independent judgement 
and make a significant contribution to 
the Board and its Committees. 
Details of the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts and the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment are 
laid out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 96 and 98 respectively. 
The main responsibilities of each Board 
role are set out on page 70 of this report.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
74 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued Board appointments and development
Premier is an international business  
and has to manage a variety of  
political, technical and commercial  
risks. It is therefore important that  
the Board has the appropriate mix of 
skills and experience to meet these 
challenges. To this end, the Nomination 
Committee reviews the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and 
makes recommendations to the Board 
with regard to any adjustments that are 
deemed necessary with due regard  
for the benefits of diversity on the 
Board, including gender. In selecting 
new Directors, the Committee prepares a 
description of the role and capabilities 
required for a particular appointment  
in the context of the existing skills  
and capabilities of other Board 
members. Full details regarding the 
Board appointment process are 
contained within the Nomination 
Committee Report and the Directors’ 
Report. No Board appointments were 
made during 2015.
Key outcomes and actions from the 2014 and 2015 evaluations are set out below:
Outcome 2014 Action 2015 Outcome 2015 Action 2016
Board members agreed that  
it would be beneficial to have 
further opportunities to meet,  
and have informal presentations  
on specific subjects from,  
middle management.
The Board and Committee  
calendars for 2015 and 2016  
were revised to make additional 
space for a rolling programme  
of presentations by middle 
management alongside additional 
Board dinners, one of which was  
held with only Non-Executive 
Directors present.
Management presentations 
were held on a variety of topics 
throughout the year providing 
Non-Executive Directors with 
an opportunity to meet middle 
management and gain a greater 
understanding of several key 
business areas. Regular dinners 
were also held allowing more 
time for informal discussion. 
Overall the Board was satisfied 
with progress made in this area. 
It was agreed that the schedule  
of management presentations  
and Board dinners should continue.  
A programme for 2016 has been 
prepared to facilitate this and  
provide Non-Executive Directors  
with greater insight into more  
key areas of the business. 
Succession planning should  
be a matter of increased focus 
during 2015.
A review of the status of succession 
planning and talent management 
was undertaken by the Nomination 
Committee in November 2014  
with actions agreed for 2015. 
Further detail was provided in  
the Nomination Committee Report 
in the 2014 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. Internally, 
work continued on a review of  
short and longer-term succession 
arrangements for each senior  
role in the Company, alongside a 
review of development needs for 
potential successors.
The Nomination Committee 
and Board agreed that the level 
of increased focus on 
succession planning and talent 
management represented a 
significant improvement. 
It was agreed that a Board skills 
matrix should be maintained  
and actively used in future Board 
recruitment processes. It was further 
agreed that ongoing succession 
planning should continue to look  
at senior management levels below 
the Executive Committee and that 
training and development should 
remain a focus of the Nomination 
Committee to support the ongoing 
development of potential successors. 
Board members agreed that  
the balance between strategic  
and operational issues at Board 
meetings should be reviewed.
The balance of agenda items was 
kept under review throughout the 
year and Non-Executive Directors 
were requested to provide ongoing 
feedback on this.
The Board agreed that progress 
had been made on this objective, 
with increased time allocated to 
the discussion of strategic issues.
It was agreed that the balance of 
strategic and operational agenda items 
should remain under review, particularly 
in the context of a “lower-for-longer” 
oil price environment. 
Board members requested  
more detailed updates on 
shareholder meetings.
Additional reporting on shareholder 
meetings was added to the monthly 
Board reports and additional briefings 
were provided by the CEO and Finance 
Director at each Board meeting.
The Board confirmed its 
approval of the increased 
reporting in this area. 
It was agreed that the increased level 
of reporting should be maintained.
Conflicts of interest
A Director has a duty to avoid a 
situation in which he or she has, or may 
have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with 
the interests of the Company. Formal 
procedures are in place to ensure that 
the Board’s powers of authorisation of 
conflicts or potential conflicts of interest 
of Directors are operated effectively. 
The Board is satisfied that during 2015 
these procedures were enforced and 
adhered to appropriately.
Powers of Directors and process  
for amending Articles of Association 
Details regarding the Company’s Articles 
of Association and any amendment 
thereto, including powers of Directors 
under the Articles, are included within 
the Directors’ Report on page 115.

Induction, information and support
New Directors receive a full, formal  
and tailored induction to the Company. 
The induction programme consists of:  
a comprehensive briefing pack including  
our corporate governance manual 
which details the structure of the Group, 
decision making processes and bodies, 
and policies and procedures; an introduction 
to our resource centre for Directors 
(including external communications 
such as investor presentations, reports 
and corporate responsibility reports); 
and one-to-one meetings with each of 
the Executive Directors, members of 
senior management and external advisers. 
Specific questions on ongoing Board 
training and quality of information were 
included in the 2015 Board effectiveness 
evaluation survey and positive feedback 
was received.
All Non-Executive Directors have access 
to the Company’s senior management 
between Board meetings and the Board 
aims to hold at least one meeting each 
year in one of the business units to allow 
Non-Executive Directors to meet and 
engage with local staff. In addition,  
the continuing development of Board 
members is supported through ‘deep 
dives’ into specific business areas as 
well as presentations by management 
and regular updates on changes to  
the legal and regulatory landscape. 
During 2015, a full day deep dive 
session on the Sea Lion development 
project was held and was attended  
by all Directors. Pre-Board meeting 
presentations were also held on the 
subjects of Asset Integrity, HSES, 
Premier’s Brazil strategy, the Catcher 
Project, the Solan Project and 
Corporate Responsibility. 
Directors are regularly updated on 
relevant external training courses 
available to further complement their 
skills and knowledge. Formal procedures 
are in place to enable individual Board 
members to take independent advice at 
the Company’s expense where appropriate. 
Shareholders are given the opportunity 
to meet with new Directors upon 
request or at the next Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment.

Shareholder engagement 
There is regular dialogue with institutional 
investors through meetings, presentations 
and conferences. Presentations are given 
to analysts and investors following the 
Full-Year and Half-Year results (which  
are broadcast live via the Company’s 
website) and at other ad-hoc investor 
events. A total of 246 meetings were 
held with investors and prospective 
investors during 2015. The Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer and Finance 
Director are the Directors primarily 
responsible for engaging with shareholders. 
They ensure that other members of  
the Board receive full reports of these 
discussions. The Board also receives 
copies of analyst and broker briefings 
and shareholder sentiment reports 
prepared by the Investor Relations team. 
The Senior Independent Director is 
available to shareholders in the event that 
they have concerns which contact with 
the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer  
or Finance Director has failed to  
resolve, or where such contact would be 
inappropriate. Non-Executive Directors 
are expected to attend meetings,  
if requested, with major shareholders. 
Extensive information about the Group’s 
activities is provided in the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements,  
the Half-Year results and other trading 
statements and press releases, all of 
which are available to shareholders. 
The Company’s website also provides 
detailed information on the Group’s 
activities. Information regarding the 
Company’s share capital, including details 
of significant shareholders, is included in 
the Directors’ Report on page 115.
Shareholder communications
The primary method of ongoing 
communication with shareholders is  
the investor section of the Company’s 
website. This contains key information 
such as reports and financial results, 
investor presentations, share price 
information, regulatory news 
announcements and information  
on Premier’s AGM.
In accordance with current regulations, 
the Company uses its website as its 
default method of publication for 
statutory documents to reduce printing 
costs and help reduce our impact  
on the environment. All shareholders  
are offered the choice of receiving 
shareholder documentation, including 
the Annual Report, electronically or in 
paper format, as well as the choice  
of submitting proxy votes either 
electronically or by post.
Premier promotes the use of online 
shareholder services via the Company’s 
online share portal www.premier-oil-
shares.com. Using this service, 
shareholders are able to access their 
shareholding, update their address or 
submit queries on their account directly 
to the Company’s Registrar. Shareholders 
also have the ability to vote online prior 
to general meetings. The share portal 
also encourages shareholders to register 
to receive communications by email, 
rather than by post, thus further reducing 
the number of documents printed and 
distributed. Shareholders who have actively 
registered, receive an email notifying 
them when the Company has added a 
statutory document to its website. For 
each new registration processed, the 
Company will donate £1 to Pure Leapfrog’s 
carbon offsetting programme which 
supports carbon reduction projects  
in Africa, India and other developing 
countries (further information can be 
found at www.pureleapfrog.org).
The Company has posted guidelines  
on its website, advising shareholders  
of how to recognise and deal with 
potential share scams. Shareholders  
are advised to be extremely wary of  
any unsolicited advice or offers and only 
to deal with financial services firms that 
are authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority. More information can be 
found in the Shareholder Information 
section of the Investors area of the 
Company’s website.
Enquiries from individuals on matters 
relating to their shareholding and the 
business of the Group are welcomed 
and shareholders are encouraged  
to attend the AGM to discuss the 
progress of the Group.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Dear shareholder,
As Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee it is my 
responsibility to ensure that the Committee is rigorous  
and effective in carrying out its role as summarised in  
the adjacent column.
The terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed 
annually by the Committee and then by the Board, and are 
available on the Company’s website at www.premier-oil.com.
The members of the Committee are myself, Anne Marie 
Cannon, Joe Darby and Michel Romieu, all of whom are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. All have been 
members throughout 2015. The Board is satisfied that the 
membership of the Committee meets the requirement  
for recent and relevant financial experience.
The meetings of the Committee are normally attended  
by the Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller,  
the Group Head of Corporate Services, the Group Audit  
and Risk Manager and representatives of the auditors.  
Other Executive Directors or senior managers are required  
to attend when significant risk management or control issues 
relating to their area of responsibility are considered by the 
Committee. During the year, the Committee meets privately 
with the Group Head of Corporate Services and the Audit  
and Risk Manager, and with the Company’s auditors. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, 
identifying any matters on which it considers that action or 
improvement is needed, and to make recommendations on 
the steps to be taken.
Meetings
The Committee is required to meet at least three times per 
year and has an agenda linked to events in the Company’s 
financial calendar.
Activities during the year
The Committee met four times in 2015 and has met twice in 
2016 to date.
In February 2015, the Committee reviewed the 2014 Full-Year 
results and the Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
discussed with the auditors their audit findings, and completed 
its annual review of the effectiveness of internal controls so as 
to be able to approve the statements on internal control and 
the management of risk in the Corporate Governance Report. 
As part of this review, the Committee reviewed with management 
the hydrocarbon reserves reporting process. In completing 
its review of the effectiveness of risk management and

internal controls the Committee discussed the specific 
operational issues that had arisen in 2014 and significant  
risks foreseen for 2015. The Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the audit process and the independence  
of the auditors as a basis for considering their reappointment, 
and reviewed its own effectiveness. The Committee took 
note of enhanced Corporate Responsibility reporting for 
2015, following application of new Global Reporting Initiative 
(‘GRI’) reporting guidelines.
At its June meeting, the Committee reviewed issues that 
were expected to affect the Half-Year results, including  
the future oil price assumption and consequent asset 
impairments including the resulting reduction in the deferred 
tax asset, the accounting for the acquisition of Chrysaor’s 
interest in the Solan field and the advance payment from 
Flowstream. The Committee reviewed the potential impact 
on Group risk management of a reorganisation of the 
Corporate Services function and discussed the implications 
of changes in the Group’s risk profile since the previous 
meeting (relating in particular to the oil price), the status of  
risk management and business control reviews, and a status 
report on the new risk management system ARROW. The 
Committee also reviewed the Company’s preparations for 
complying with the Reports on Payments to Government 
Regulations (2014) and the new requirement under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code to include a ‘viability statement‘ 
in the Annual Report.
The Financial Review Council’s Audit Quality Review Team 
selected the audit of our financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 for review as part of their 2015 
annual inspection of audit firms. The focus of the review is on 
identifying areas where improvements are required rather than 
highlighting areas performed to or above the expected level. 
In August, the Committee received a copy of the findings of 
the Audit Quality Review Team and has discussed these with 
Deloitte. The Committee confirms that no significant areas for 
improvement were identified in the report. The Committee is 
also satisfied that there is nothing in the report which might 
have a bearing on the audit appointment. 
During the August meeting the Committee also reviewed  
the Half-Year results and discussed the auditors’ report  
on their review of the Half-Year results. The Committee 
received updates on major business risks, risk management 
and business controls reviews, ARROW (including a live 
demonstration of the system) and the Business Management 
System. The Committee confirmed that proposed revisions  
to its terms of reference were in line with the latest UK 
Corporate Governance Code and supporting guidance,  
and approved them for onward recommendation to  
the Board. 
In December the Committee reviewed the status of the 2015 
risk management and internal control reviews, focusing on 
the significant findings during 2015 and actions arising, and 
reviewed and approved the scope of the outline 2016 plan for 
such reviews (steered by the principal business risks faced by 
the Group). The Committee considered expected accounting 
and reporting issues relating to the Full-Year results and the 
auditors’ work plan (which built on the discussions held at the 
time of the Half-Year results), and reviewed and approved the 
proposed audit fee. The Committee reviewed the Company’s 
risk management policy and the status of a review of the 
Company’s Business Management System. In addition, the 
Committee reviewed the arrangements in place to address 
cyber security. 
The Committee held two meetings in February 2016 at  
which it reviewed the 2015 Full-Year results and the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements, discussed with the auditors 
their audit findings, and completed its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems so as to be able to approve the statements 
on risk management and internal control in the ‘Principal 
Risks’ section of the Strategic Report on pages 30 to 36 and to 
report to the Board that, in the Committee’s view, the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee’s 
review included the going concern statement and viability 
statement included within the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements and the forecasts prepared by management on 
which the statements are based. 
In completing its annual review of the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems, the Committee 
reviewed the close-out of the 2015 risk management and 
internal control reviews and was briefed on the corporate 
governance returns for 2015.
As discussed in more detail overleaf, the Committee also 
reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process and the 
independence of the auditors as a basis for considering  
their reappointment.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Risk management and internal control
The Committee continues to be responsible for reviewing the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
process designed to identify and mitigate the principal risks 
facing the Group. There is an ongoing process of refinement 
and embedding of risk management best practice through 
the Group in accordance with the principles and guidelines 
set out in ISO 31000. Risk management and internal control  
in the Group is discussed more fully in the ’Principal Risks’ 
section of the Strategic Report on pages 30 to 36. 
In addition to Group-wide governance, internal controls  
and risk management processes, the Group also has specific 
internal controls and risk management systems to govern  
the financial reporting process and preparation of the  
annual financial statements.
These systems include clear policies and procedures for 
ensuring that the Group’s financial reporting processes and 
the preparation of its consolidated accounts comply with all 
relevant regulatory reporting requirements. These policies 
are applied consistently by the finance reporting teams at 
head office and each business unit in the preparation of the 
financial results.
Management representations covering compliance with relevant 
policies and the accuracy of financial information are collated 
on a biannual basis. Detailed management accounts for each 
reporting business unit are prepared monthly, comprising an 
income statement and a cash flow statement in a manner very 
similar to the year-end and half-yearly reporting processes. 
These are subject to management review and analysis in the 
monthly consolidated management accounts.
Group Audit and Risk
An annual risk-based programme of reviews is proposed to 
the Committee following discussion by Group Audit and Risk 
with functional and business unit management. There are 
three levels of review as follows:
Level 1
Local internal management team review e.g. business unit 
manager site safety review.
Level 2
Group function review of business unit or asset/project  
e.g. drilling preparedness review, project safety review.
Level 3
External third party certification e.g. oil and gas reserves 
certification, ISO/OHSAS certification.
The Committee considers and approves the programme,  
and monitors and reviews the scope and results of the 
reviews carried out at each meeting, receiving reports 
covering progress against plan, significant findings and  
the action plans in place to address them.
In reviewing the findings from these reviews, the Committee 
noted that the work carried out had been directed towards 
the Group’s principal risks, thereby providing assurance to  
the Committee on key issues and challenges facing the Group. 
Recommendations to improve internal controls and/or to 
mitigate risks were agreed with the relevant business unit  
or corporate function after each review and progress in 
implementing the recommendations was monitored by 
Group Audit and Risk.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed the 2015 Half-Year and Full-Year 
financial results announcements and 2015 Annual Report  
and Financial Statements with the Finance Director and 
Group Financial Controller and considered the findings  
from the auditors’ review of the Half-Year results and their 
audit of the 2015 financial statements. The areas of focus  
for the Committee included consistency of application of 
accounting practices and policies; compliance with financial 
reporting standards and stock exchange and legal requirements;  
the appropriateness of assumptions and judgements in  
items subject to estimation; the going concern assumption; 
the clarity and completeness of disclosures in the financial 
statements; and, in relation to the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position  
and performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee considered in particular the following major 
items that required significant judgement and estimation in 
preparing the 2015 financial statements:
Going concern
In view of the current weakness in oil and gas prices,  
the Committee reviewed in detail management’s projections  
of the Group’s liquidity position and compliance with its 
financial covenants within its borrowing facilities for the next 
12 months. Key assumptions in the projections include those 
related to oil and gas prices during the period, cost saving 
initiatives and portfolio management options available during 
the forecast period. The key assumptions were assessed and 
challenged by the Committee. 
At 31 December 2015 the Group had significant headroom 
on all its financial covenants and availability of financing. 
However, the Group’s projections indicate that at current oil 
prices it is likely that a breach of one or more of the Group’s 
financial covenants will occur in respect of the testing period 
ending 30 June 2016 unless either appropriate mitigating actions 
can be taken or an appropriate relaxation or amendment of its 
financial covenant ratios can be achieved. 
The Committee was satisfied that an appropriate degree  
of caution had been applied in exercising the judgements 
needed in making the assumptions and estimates, and 
concluded that the statement on going concern in the 
Financial Review on page 54 is fair and balanced.
The Committee has advised the Board that it is reasonable 
for the Directors to expect that the Group will be able to avoid 
a covenant breach in respect of the 30 June 2016 testing 
period, thereby resolving this material uncertainty, that the 
Group will therefore have adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, 
accordingly, that the going concern basis is the appropriate 
basis of preparation for the 2015 financial statements.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
80 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT continued In view of the current weakness in oil and gas prices, 
management prepared a detailed impairment report for  
the Committee setting out the key assumptions for each  
of the oil and gas properties. The Committee challenged 
these assumptions and judgements to ensure that:
•  they were consistent with those that were used by 
management for budgeting and capital investment 
appraisal purposes;
•  production volumes were derived from the oil and gas 
reserves estimates discussed above, applying the same 
assumptions regarding future costs; and
•  they were reasonable within the context of the observed 
field performance and the wider economic environment 
currently being observed.
The Committee noted in particular that, consistent with  
the long-term planning assumptions used by the Company, 
assumed future oil and gas prices were based on forward 
price curves for two years, US$65/bbl in 2018 followed by an 
oil price of US$80/  bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter (as explained  
in more detail in note 10 to the financial statements on  
page 144). The Committee also noted that forecast field 
development costs and decommissioning costs were based 
on detailed and carefully reviewed current estimates.
The Committee discussed with management the review  
that was carried out of the longer-term plans for the life of 
those fields against which an impairment charge has been 
recognised and the factors giving rise to the impairment 
losses and was satisfied that the impairment charge 
recognised in the year was appropriate.
The Committee was satisfied that the rates used to  
discount future cash flows appropriately reflect current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the  
risks associated with the specific assets concerned.
The Committee was satisfied that the most significant 
assumptions on which the amount of the impairment charge 
is based are future oil and gas prices and the discount rate 
applied to the forecast future cash flows and, accordingly, 
that the disclosure of sensitivity of the impairment charge to 
changes in these factors in note 10 to the financial statements 
on page 144, is appropriate.
Provisions for decommissioning costs
Estimates of the cost of future decommissioning and 
restoration of hydrocarbon facilities are based on current 
legal and constructive requirements, technology and price 
levels, while estimates of when decommissioning will occur 
depend on assumptions made regarding the economic life  
of fields which in turn depend on such factors as oil prices 
and operating costs. The Committee therefore discussed with 
management the estimation process and the basis for the 
principal assumptions underlying the cost estimates, noting 
in particular the reasons for any major changes in estimates  
as compared with the previous year. The Committee was 
satisfied that the approach applied was fair and reasonable. 
The Committee was also satisfied that the discount rate  
used to calculate the provision was appropriate. Further 
information on decommissioning provisions is provided in 
note 17 on page 148.
Recoverability of intangible exploration and evaluation 
(‘E&E’) assets
The Committee satisfied itself by reference to the Group’s 
business plan and discussion with management that,  
in respect of all exploration and evaluation assets, either 
commercially viable resources have been discovered  
or substantive expenditure on further exploration and 
evaluation activities in the specific area is budgeted or 
planned. Details of the Group’s E&E assets are provided  
in note 9 to the financial statements on page 143.
Oil and gas reserves
Unit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
charges are principally measured based on management’s 
estimates of proved and probable oil and gas reserves. 
Estimates of proved and probable reserves are also used  
in the determination of impairment charges. Proved and 
probable reserves estimates are based on a number of 
underlying assumptions including future oil and gas prices, 
future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, 
all of which are inherently uncertain.
The Committee considered reports from management  
on the process applied to calculate the reserves estimates, 
addressing in particular the extent to which the methodology 
and techniques applied by the Company were generally 
accepted industry practice, whether the methodology and 
techniques applied were consistent with those applied in 
prior years, and the experience and expertise of the managers 
who prepared and reviewed the estimates. The Committee 
noted that estimates of the Group’s oil and gas proven and 
probable reserves prepared by independent reservoir engineers 
for producing and development fields were marginally higher 
than management’s estimates. The Committee discussed 
with management the main reasons for the difference between 
the two estimates and was satisfied that it was appropriate to 
apply management’s estimates for the purpose of preparing 
the financial statements.
Impairment of oil and gas properties
As explained in note 10 to the financial statements on page 
144, an impairment charge of US$1,023.7 million has been 
made largely in respect of the Solan development project as 
well as several producing fields in the UK North Sea, Indonesia 
and Pakistan. In order to determine whether an asset is 
impaired, management assess whether any indicators for 
impairment exist for the Group’s producing and development 
oil and gas properties. Where such an indicator exists, the 
future discounted net cash flows the Company expects to 
derive from the asset must be estimated. Such estimates are 
based on a number of assumptions including future oil and 
gas prices, the latest estimates of costs to be incurred in 
bringing fields under development into production, oil and 
gas reserves estimates, production rates and the associated 
cost profiles, decommissioning costs and discount rates that 
reflect risks specific to individual assets.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Taxation
The Group currently produces oil and/or gas in five countries 
and is subject to complex hydrocarbon and corporate tax 
regimes in each of them. Judgements must be applied in 
order to make provision for the amounts of tax that are expected 
to be settled. Also, in order to continue to recognise the 
substantial deferred tax asset relating to tax losses in the  
UK, it must be probable that sufficient taxable profits will  
be available against which the tax losses can be utilised.  
This in turn requires assumptions about future profitability.
The Committee also discussed with management their 
projections of probable UK taxable profits and noted that 
these projections, which were based on the same assumptions 
as those used in the asset impairment review, support  
the recognition of a deferred tax asset of US$871.6 million. 
Further details of the deferred tax asset and the assumptions 
used to estimate the amount of tax recoverable in respect of 
tax losses and allowances are provided in notes 6 and 19 to 
the financial statements on pages 141 and 155 respectively.
External audit
Audit effectiveness
The Committee reviewed the auditors’ work plan at the  
start of the audit cycle, considering in particular the auditors’ 
assessment of the significant areas of risk in the Group’s 
financial statements, which for 2015 corresponded with  
the major areas of judgement identified by the Committee 
discussed above, and the scope of their work. At the 
conclusion of the audit, the Committee discussed with the 
auditors the findings of the audit, including key accounting 
and audit judgements, the level of errors identified during  
the audit, the recommendations made to management by  
the auditors and management’s response. The Committee 
met privately with the auditors twice in 2015 and in February 
2016 at the conclusion of the 2015 audit.
The Committee also assessed the effectiveness of the audit 
process, based on its own experience and on feedback from 
the corporate and business unit finance teams, and 
considered in particular:
• the experience and expertise of the audit team;
• the auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any 
variations from the plan;
• the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their 
handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
• the quality of the auditors’ recommendations for financial 
reporting process and control improvements.
Auditor independence and objectivity
The Committee regularly reviews the independence  
and objectivity of the auditors. This review considers the 
overall relationship between the auditors and the Company, 
based on feedback from the Company’s finance team and 
from the auditors, and the nature and extent of non-audit 
services provided by the auditors, and takes account of  
the safeguards established by the auditors against loss  
of audit independence, including rotation of the audit 
engagement partner.
The Committee believes that certain non-audit work may  
be carried out by the auditors without compromising their 
independence and objectivity. The allocation of non-audit 
work is considered by reference to the Company’s policy on 
the provision of non-audit services by the auditors, which can 
be found on the Company’s website. The use of the auditors 
for services relating to accounting systems or the preparation 
of financial statements is not permitted, and neither are various 
other services, such as valuation work, which could give  
rise to conflicts of interest or other threats to the auditors’ 
objectivity that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level  
by applying safeguards. The Committee believes that  
certain non-audit assurance and advisory services may be 
best performed by the auditors as a result of their unique 
knowledge of the Company. Any material non-audit work  
of this nature requires approval by the Committee.
The Committee approves the fees for the audit and half-yearly 
review after reviewing the scope of work to be performed, 
and reviews the scope and fees for non-audit assignments 
awarded to the auditors to satisfy itself that the assignments 
concerned do not give rise to threats to the auditors’ 
independence and objectivity. Details of audit and non-audit 
fees in the current year are provided in note 3 to the financial 
statements on page 139.
Deloitte are required to confirm to the Committee that they 
have both the appropriate independence and objectivity to 
allow them to continue to serve the members of the Company. 
The Committee also requires the auditors to confirm that  
in providing non-audit services, they comply with the Ethical 
Standards for Auditors issued by the UK Auditing Practices 
Board. This confirmation was received for 2015.
In accordance with the Ethical Standards for Auditors,  
the audit engagement partner rotates at least every five 
years. The current audit engagement partner has been in  
the role for four years.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
82 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT continued Audit appointment
The Committee considers the reappointment of the auditors 
each year. Based on its review of the effectiveness of the 2015 
audit and of the independence and objectivity of the auditors, 
the Committee concluded that the auditors’ effectiveness 
and independence has not been impaired in any way.  
The Committee has reported accordingly to the Board and 
recommended that the reappointment of Deloitte LLP be 
proposed to shareholders for the year ending 31 December 2016.
Deloitte were initially appointed auditors of the Company in 
2004 and the audit has not been put out to tender since that 
date. The UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 introduced  
a provision requiring FTSE 350 companies to put the external 
audit contract out to tender at least every 10 years, or to explain 
why they have not done so, although with transitional provisions 
that allow the Company to defer a tender for a number of years. 
The Competition and Markets Authority has subsequently 
made it mandatory from 2016 onwards to put the external 
audit contract out to tender at least every 10 years and  
the associated transitional provisions require us to conduct  
an audit tender process no later than for the year ending  
31 December 2017 . The Audit and Risk Committee is currently 
planning to conduct an audit tender process later in 2016 
with a view to making a recommendation to shareholders at 
the 2017 AGM that the firm selected as a result of the tender 
be appointed to audit the 2017 financial statements.
Committee evaluation
The performance and effectiveness of the Committee was 
reviewed as part of the Board performance evaluation 
process and the Committee also carried out a detailed 
self-assessment. The Committee was considered to be 
operating effectively and in accordance with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit Committees.

Non-Executive Director succession
Executive Director succession and development
Dear shareholder,
It has been a busy year for the Committee, with much of  
the Committee’s time focused on succession planning and 
development, both at Board and senior management levels. 
Executive succession planning and leadership development
As I reported last year, following the appointment of Tony 
Durrant as Chief Executive Officer during 2014, a proposal 
was agreed to refresh all succession planning exercises to 
ensure stability and continuity of experience, capability and 
performance within management. This initiative has been 
ongoing throughout the year, with the Committee reviewing 
succession plans and targeted learning and development 
initiatives – whether internal or external – for all Executive 
Committee members as well as business unit and country 
managers. The initial phase of this exercise is now complete 
and is being extended further throughout the next cadre  
of senior management with refreshed development plans 
being drawn up for all of those identified as potential 
successors. The Committee has been briefed in detail 
throughout the process by the Group HR Director, with 
sessions held to provide the Committee with insight into  
the learning and development programmes being used  
to support the development of succession candidates and 
how those programmes are being integrated with our 
performance management system on an ongoing basis.
Non-Executive Director succession planning
At the Board level, all Directors have provided input into a skills 
and diversity matrix, to assist in mapping the range and strength 
of skills and experience of current members as well as the 
Board’s diversity in terms of age, ethnicity, nationality and 
gender. The output of this exercise was then mapped against 
the desired balance in view of the strategic objectives of the 
Company and anticipated skills required. We expect to use 
the output of this exercise in drawing up any role specification 
for Non-Executive Director recruitment, alongside other 
governance requirements to be considered for any particular role.

Role of the Committee
• To plan Board member succession and oversee  
plans for senior management succession, taking into 
account skills, knowledge, diversity and experience  
in so doing
• To regularly review the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and Committees
• To identify and recommend for Board approval 
suitable candidates to be appointed to the Board 
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
84 NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT Board and Committee composition
The Committee reviewed the composition of the Board  
and its Committees during the year, taking into account  
the need for continuity of membership to maintain the 
knowledge and insight of Committees while at the same time 
refreshing their membership. This will be kept under review 
as work commences on Non-Executive Director succession  
to ensure that Committee composition, as well as that of the 
Board, is carefully considered and membership refreshed. 
Executive Director succession
Andrew Lodge, Exploration Director, stood down from  
the Board with effect from 30 June 2015. Prior to his leaving 
date the Board agreed, on the recommendation of the  
Chief Executive Officer, that Andrew’s successor would be  
a member of the Executive Committee but not a Board 
Director in view of the strategic outlook of the Company  
and emerging practice in terms of Board size and balance. 
The recruitment process was led by our HR team which 
resulted in the appointment of an internal candidate as  
our new Head of Exploration, Dean Griffin, who had been 
identified in earlier succession planning reviews. 
Diversity
The Board fully embraces a culture based upon equal 
opportunities in the workplace. Further information regarding 
our commitment to fair and competitive terms of employment 
and safe working conditions is included in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review on page 56.
At the Board level, we are committed to ensuring that  
the process for all Board appointments is conducted, and 
appointments made, on merit, against objective criteria  
and with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board, 
including gender. 
When preparing for a new Board appointment, an external 
search company is selected and requested to prepare a  
short list which takes into account the capabilities, skills and 
experience required for the role, as well as diversity of the 
Board in its widest sense, including gender diversity. The 
Board considers the proportion of women on the Board  
as part of its assessment when selecting a candidate for a 
Board position. We currently have two female Non-Executive 
Directors, Jane Hinkley and Anne Marie Cannon, on a Board 
of 11 which equates to 18 per cent. The Committee reviewed 
its approach to gender diversity on the Board during the year 
and chose to maintain its practice of embracing diversity in all 
its forms without setting any measurable objectives relating 
to gender diversity.
Committee terms of reference review
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference in 2015  
and amendments were proposed to the Board for adoption.  
The terms of reference for the Nomination Committee are 
available at www.premier-oil.com.
Outlook for 2016
As we look forward to the year ahead, the Committee will 
continue to focus its efforts on succession planning and  
the active engagement and development of our employees, 
making sure that our workforce is best positioned to take  
the Company forward and deliver the Company’s strategic 
objectives. We will also continue our work on Non-Executive 
Director succession planning as outlined above.

Setting Executive remuneration 
Reward policy for Executive Directors 
Incentive arrangements for all employees
Corporate governance matters
Other
Dear fellow shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report (the ‘DRR’) for 2015.
Our Remuneration Policy, as approved at the 2014 AGM,  
is geared towards performance-related pay to support direct 
alignment with shareholders. The Policy remains unchanged 
for 2016 and therefore will not be put to a vote at the 2016 AGM. 
It is, however, included in this year’s DRR in full for ease of 
reference and to provide context to the work of the Committee 
during the year. The Annual Report on Remuneration, which is 
subject to an advisory vote at our 2016 AGM, details how this 
Policy was applied in 2015 and how it will be applied in 2016.
There has been no respite in the macroeconomic challenges 
facing the Company in 2015, with the oil price continuing to fall. 
However, in the face of these strong headwinds, the Company 
delivered strong operational performance with healthy 
production levels, high levels of operating efficiency, good 
HSES performance and reduced costs. Steps have also been 
taken in light of the low oil price environment to reposition 
the Company for the future.
Against this background, the Committee reviewed executive 
remuneration arrangements as well as remuneration 
arrangements for the broader employee population.  
In particular, as indicated last year, the Committee spent  
a considerable amount of time reviewing the structure  
of our current Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). 
All aspects have come under close scrutiny, not least  
being performance conditions, period and quantum with  
a view to ensuring that our reward structure better aligns  
with our organisational profile and delivery of our objectives.  
The outcome of this review has been to move away from  
our current ‘one size fits all’ reward philosophy and agree a 
new and much simpler long-term incentive plan (the ‘PVSP’) 
for our employees below Executive Director and senior 
management levels. 
The Committee concluded that the falling oil and gas price 
environment and divergent opinion on oil price projection 
made the case for changing executive remuneration less 
compelling. The Committee is also conscious that management’s 
focus must be on realigning the Company’s business to cope 
with the prevailing low oil price environment, and considered 
that introducing a new remuneration structure for senior 
management might cause distraction from this priority.  
We are, therefore, not proposing to make any changes now

Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
86 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT to our remuneration packages for Executive Directors and 
senior management and as a result our LTIP will continue to 
operate for our Executive Directors and senior management 
and we will not be proposing changes to our Remuneration 
Policy at the Company’s 2016 AGM. 
We will consult with shareholders on proposals for our 
Executive Directors and senior management with a view to 
submitting any new long-term incentive scheme for approval 
at the 2017 AGM. This also aligns with the timing for the 
renewal of shareholder approval of our Remuneration Policy, 
which will be submitted to shareholders for a binding vote 
at the 2017 AGM.
Our current LTIP is based on absolute and relative total 
shareholder return (‘TSR’) over a period of up to six years, 
with any vesting subject to the Committee’s assessment of 
various financial and non-financial underpins. For the LTIP 
awards granted in 2013, the initial three-year performance 
period ended in December 2015; with the fall in our share 
price and the Company’s performance relative to our peer 
group, none of the 2013 awards vested, demonstrating  
the link between Directors’ remuneration and share  
price performance.
The performance targets for the 2015 bonus and achievement 
against these targets are set out on page 102. These reflect 
good operational performance, with on target production  
and outperformance of Group HSES statistics particularly  
of note, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to the 
safety and integrity of our operations irrespective of the 
prevailing challenges and cost constraints. In aggregate,  
the target performance achievement reflects the strong 
underlying operations and delivery of results, with the 
formulaic total bonus outcome for Directors ranging from  
55.8 per cent to 58.1 per cent. However, in view of the harsh 
economic environment prevailing in the upstream oil sector 
following the collapse in oil prices and the consequent fall in 
our share price, the Committee decided to award a bonus of 
10 per cent of salary to the Executive Directors. The Committee 
feels that this decision recognises the strong operational 
performance, and, in particular, the drive for efficiency and 
cost constraint by the executive leadership team, whilst 
acknowledging the impact of low oil prices on shareholders. 
The bonus award for all staff was also set at 10 per cent of 
salary for those who ‘met expectations’ and above in their 
annual performance review. The Executive Directors had a 
proportionately higher reduction to their award than other 
staff, given their higher level of bonus quantum opportunity. 
The Committee considers that the incentive outcomes for 
2015 outlined above are fair given the performance delivered 
by the executive leadership team.
The Committee continues to consider updates to corporate 
governance guidelines in its decision-making and will continue 
to monitor best practice guidelines and take account of these 
and the views of its shareholders in the decision-making process. 
In particular, the Committee will consider any proposed 
revisions from the Investment Association’s Executive 
Remuneration Working Group, anticipated in Spring 2016.
During the course of 2015 the Committee considered 
remuneration arrangements, in line with the Remuneration 
Policy, for Andrew Lodge who stepped down as Exploration 
Director on 30 June 2015. The Committee determined that 
Andrew Lodge’s 2015 annual bonus opportunity and 
outstanding LTIP awards would remain, subject to satisfaction  
of performance conditions, and be pro-rated to reflect the 
period worked. Further details are contained on page 101. 
In consideration of the challenges posed by the changed 
market conditions, the Committee determined that there 
would again be no salary increases for the Executive Directors 
for 2016. In addition, the Committee has agreed that the 
awards that would usually be made under the LTIP (and PVSP 
for the wider employee base) following the announcement  
of the 2015 Full-Year results will be postponed. This position 
will be kept under review and revisited later in the year; the 
Committee will determine whether to make these awards 
following the Half-Year results in August 2016 in view of 
prevailing market conditions. The Committee will adopt  
the same approach as for FY2015 with respect to bonuses  
for FY2016. A full bonus scorecard has been set, but the 
Committee will continue to consider carefully the oil market 
outlook, the Company’s position and the outcome for 2016 in 
deciding whether and at what level to award bonuses for 2016. 
The 2016 performance targets are set out in general terms  
on page 107. For reasons of commercial sensitivity detailed 
figures are not given. Our intention is to publish these, 
together with the bonus outcome, in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration for 2016. As referred to above, we have 
disclosed the performance targets and achievement against 
these targets for the 2015 annual bonus on page 102.
The biennial review of the Chairman’s and Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees has been postponed for a further year;  
hence there are also no increases in fees for the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee encourages dialogue with its major 
shareholders and remains keen to hear shareholders’  
views on remuneration matters.
On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank shareholders 
for their continuing support.

Compliance statement 
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the  
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Companies Act 2006 requires the 
auditor to report to the shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and to state whether, in the auditor’s opinion,  
those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance  
with the above regulations. The Chairman’s Annual Statement and the 
Policy Report are not subject to audit. The sections of the Annual Report 
on Remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated accordingly.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This section of the Remuneration Report  
sets out the Remuneration Policy which  
was approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 14 May 2014 and  
has been effective since that date. 
Policy report
Specifically, remuneration packages are designed with the 
following objectives in mind:
• to gear remuneration significantly towards performance-
related pay to support direct alignment with shareholders 
and a highly performance-oriented culture;
• to provide annual incentives that reward achievement  
of short-term objectives key to delivering the long-term 
strategy, encompassing financial, operational and  
strategic measures;
• to ensure a particular emphasis on long-term performance, 
to encourage direct alignment with shareholders, retention 
and long-term motivation;
• to incorporate significant deferral requirements to support 
staff retention and lengthen the incentive time horizon; and
• to ensure incentive payments are commensurate with the 
Company’s underlying performance.
The Policy remains unchanged and will therefore not be put 
to a shareholder vote at the 2016 Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’). Shareholder approval will next be sought no later 
than at the AGM to be held in 2017. The Remuneration  
Policy has been included in this Annual Report in full (using 
updated data in the scenario charts) to provide the context 
within which the Committee has conducted its work during 
the year and has been updated for:
• consideration of shareholder views; this section has  
been updated to reflect activity since the last report  
to shareholders;
• Non-Executive Director remuneration; this section has 
been updated to reflect the date of Mike Welton’s current 
appointment letter which was renewed during the year;
• the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan for the 
wider employee population (excluding Executive Directors 
and senior management).
The Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 99 to 114 sets 
out how the Policy has been applied during 2015 and how  
it will be applied throughout the remainder of 2016 and will 
be put to an advisory vote at the 2016 AGM.
The Committee regularly reviews the Policy to ensure it 
supports shareholder interests and closely reflects business 
strategy. Remuneration packages are intended to be 
sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
individuals of the quality required to achieve the Group’s 
objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value. The 
Committee aims to ensure that pay rewards all employees 
fairly and responsibly for their contributions. In addition,  
the Committee aims to ensure that the Policy does not raise 
environmental, operational, social or governance risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviours.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
88 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Executive Director Policy
A summary of the Policy for Executive Directors is set out below:
Salary
Purpose and  
link to strategy
•  To provide an appropriate level of salary to support recruitment and retention, and with due regard to the role 
and the individual’s responsibilities and experience
Operation •  Typically reviewed annually with reference to Company and individual performance, each executive’s 
responsibilities and experience, the external market for talent, and salary increases across the Group
•  Salaries are benchmarked against three relevant comparator groups, comprising: 
(i) international oil & gas sector companies, (ii) the constituents of the LTIP TSR comparator group, and  
(iii) UK-listed companies of a similar market capitalisation and revenue to Premier
• Adjustments are normally effective 1 January
• Salaries are paid monthly in arrears
Opportunity •  Salary increases are awarded taking into account the outcome of the review and also broader circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, a material increase in job complexity and inflation)
•  Salary increases will normally be in line with increases awarded to other employees. However, the Committee 
may make additional adjustments in certain circumstances to reflect, for example, an increase in scope  
or responsibility, to address a gap in market positioning and/or to reward performance of an individual
•  The Executive Director salaries for the financial year under review are disclosed in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration
Performance metrics • Not applicable
Pension
Purpose and  
link to strategy
• To help provide a competitive pension provision
Operation •  Executive Directors who join Premier on or after 20 August 2013 are eligible to participate in the Company’s 
defined contribution personal pension plan and/or receive an equivalent cash supplement
•  For Executive Directors who joined prior to 20 August 2013, the Company provides a pension substantially as if 
they are contributing members of the Company’s final salary Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (the ‘Scheme’), 
which was closed to new members in 1997
•  The only pensionable element of pay is salary
Opportunity •  Executive Directors who join Premier on or after 20 August 2013 receive pension contributions  
and/or an equivalent cash supplement equal to 20 per cent of salary
•  For Executive Directors who joined prior to 20 August 2013 the Scheme provides a payment on broadly a  
fiftieths accrual basis up to two-thirds of salary at age 60, with benefits actuarially reduced on early retirement  
and pensions in payment increased in line with the lower of inflation, or five per cent per annum. The Scheme is 
subject to an internal earnings cap which is reviewed annually but for Executive Directors, the Company provides 
for pension benefits above the earnings cap through a ‘pension promise’, based on the cash equivalent transfer 
value of benefits accrued within the defined benefit scheme for earnings above the earnings cap. The way that 
this promise is currently administered is as follows:
1.  Executive Directors are given a pension allowance equal to 20 per cent of uncapped salary.  
This may either be paid into a pension scheme and/or as a salary supplement
2.  Executive Directors accrue notional defined benefits entitlement within the defined benefits scheme
3.  To the extent that payments made under ‘1.’ above are not paid into the Scheme, they are deemed to have 
been invested into a life fund
4.  At the point that a Director departs or retires, a comparison is undertaken between the value of the notional 
defined contribution pot outlined in ‘3.’ above and the cash equivalent transfer value of the notional defined 
benefits. Subject to appropriate deductions, the differential is available either as a contribution into their 
pension plan or a cash payment
5.  Regular reviews are carried out to assess the extent to which the payments already made to each Director  
are projected to be sufficient to provide the accrued component of their target pension; where such reviews 
indicate a shortfall, the Company may provide an additional payment

Benefits
Purpose and  
link to strategy
• To provide a benefits package competitive in the market for talent
Operation •  Executive Directors receive a competitive benefits package, which may include medical and dental insurance,  
car allowance, life assurance and critical illness cover, expatriate benefits, relocation allowance, health checks  
and a subsidised gym membership
•  Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the benefits package is appropriately competitive 
and reflects the circumstances of the individual Director
Opportunity • Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate for the role and individual circumstances
•  The benefits payable to the Executive Directors during the financial year under review are disclosed in the  
Annual Report on Remuneration
Performance metrics • Not applicable
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
Purpose and  
link to strategy
• To encourage share ownership in Premier
Operation •  An HMRC approved scheme under which employees (including Executive Directors) are invited to make 
contributions to buy partnership shares using gross pay. If an employee agrees to buy partnership shares  
the Company currently matches the number of partnership shares with ‘matching shares’ which are subject  
to continued employment for a minimum of three years
•  Dividends accrue on both partnership shares and matching shares, and any historical free shares (no longer 
awarded), and are automatically reinvested
Opportunity •  Employees may spend up to the HMRC permitted allowance to buy partnership shares
•  Matching shares are granted based on investment in partnership shares and up to the HMRC  
permitted match
Performance metrics • Not applicable
Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’)
Purpose and  
link to strategy
• To encourage share ownership in Premier
Operation •  An HMRC approved scheme under which employees (including Executive Directors) are invited to make  
regular monthly contributions over three or five years to purchase shares through options which are granted  
at a 20 per cent discount to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the date of grant
Opportunity •  Employees may save up to the HMRC permitted allowance
Performance metrics • Not applicable
Policy report continued
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
90 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Annual bonus
Purpose and  
link to strategy
•  To reinforce the delivery of key short-term financial and operational objectives and, through the deferred share 
element, help ensure alignment with shareholders and support retention
Operation •  Performance is measured on an annual basis for each financial year measured against stretching but achievable 
financial and non-financial targets, comprising Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’), other corporate objectives  
and personal performance
•  Performance measures, weightings and targets are set at the beginning of the year and weighted to reflect 
business priorities
•  Each performance measure has Threshold and Stretch targets. The final bonus outcome is determined by the 
Committee, having assessed achievement against corporate as well as personal targets, taking into account the 
Committee’s broader assessment of overall Company performance
•  Annual bonus awards up to 50 per cent of salary are paid in cash. Any annual bonus earned above 50 per cent  
of salary is deferred in shares for three years
•  Dividend equivalents accrue on deferred share awards and are paid on vesting, in accordance with the rules  
of the bonus plan
•  Annual bonus payouts and deferred shares are also subject to malus and clawback in the event of material 
misstatement of the Company’s financial results, gross misconduct, or material error in the calculation of 
performance conditions
•  The Committee may exercise malus and clawback until the later of: (i) one year from the payment of the bonus  
or the vesting of the shares, or (ii) the completion of the next audit after payment/vesting
Opportunity •  The annual bonus provides for awards of between 0 per cent and 100 per cent of salary for Executive Directors
Performance metrics •  Performance is assessed against a scorecard encompassing several performance categories, which may include 
some or all of: production; exploration; Health, Safety, Environment and Security; finance; business development; 
and personal and strategic objectives
•  Normally, the Committee would not expect the weighting for any performance category to be higher than  
50 per cent. However, it retains discretion to adjust weightings to align with the business plan for each year
•  The Committee uses its judgement to determine the overall scorecard outcome based on the achievement  
of the targets and the Committee’s broad assessment of Company performance
•  Further details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable for the financial year under review are provided 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 102

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Executive Director Policy continued
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Purpose and  
link to strategy
•  To support alignment with shareholders by reinforcing the delivery of absolute and relative returns to 
shareholders, through the delivery of strong share price growth and relative stock market out-performance over 
the long term, and with due regard for the underlying financial and operational performance of the Company
Operation •  The LTIP comprises three elements: Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards
•  Equity Pool Awards are based on an allocation of units in the Equity Pool. The Equity Pool is funded by a 
percentage share of the growth in the Company’s equity value per share over a performance period, if growth 
above the threshold level has been achieved. At the end of a performance period, Equity Pool Awards are 
awarded as shares calculated on the mid-market closing share price on the day prior to the date of award
•  Performance Share Awards are conditional share awards granted annually, with the grant value defined  
as a percentage of salary at the date of grant
•  Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards are measured over three years. 50 per cent of the shares 
vesting from the Equity Pool and Performance Shares are subject to compulsory deferral for a further three years 
and are eligible for a discretionary Matching Share Award, which is granted as shares and is subject to a further 
three-year performance period
•  For Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards, dividend equivalents may accrue and be paid  
on vesting in proportion to performance achieved, in accordance with the rules of the Plan
•  Award levels are reviewed before each award cycle to ensure they remain appropriate
•  All LTIP awards are subject to malus and clawback in the event of a material misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results, gross misconduct, or material error in the calculation of performance conditions
•  The Committee may exercise malus and clawback until the later of: (i) one year from vesting, or (ii) the completion 
of the next audit after vesting
Opportunity •  Executive Directors may be awarded a share of the Equity Pool. The Committee intends to continue with the 
existing approach of awarding not more than 6 per cent of the Equity Pool to any one individual, though it retains 
the discretion under the Plan to award more than 6 per cent in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment but 
not in relation to the retention of an existing Executive Director. In any other exceptional circumstances where the 
Committee decides to exercise its discretion to make an Equity Pool award, it shall not exceed 10 per cent of the 
Equity Pool
•  The value of vested awards is subject to a limit of 100 per cent of salary, but which may be exceeded, at the 
discretion of the Committee, up to the full value warranted by the size of the Equity Pool provided the Committee 
is satisfied with the underlying performance of the Company. The Committee also has discretion to reduce the 
size of the Equity Pool if the formulaic outcome is not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance
•  Performance Share Awards may be granted up to 150 per cent of salary
•  Matching Share Awards may be granted up to 2.5 times the number of shares deferred
Performance metrics •  The funding of the Equity Pool is based on three-year annualised compound growth in the Company’s equity 
value per share. Threshold performance requires compound growth in the Company’s equity value per share  
of at least 10 per cent per annum at which 1 per cent of the compound growth is credited to the Equity Pool.  
A maximum of 2.5 per cent of the compound growth is credited to the Equity Pool when growth in equity value 
per share is 20 per cent per annum. The funding rate is based on straight-line interpolation between these points
•  Performance Share Awards vest on three-year TSR relative to a comparator group of international oil and gas 
sector peers. 25 per cent vests for median performance, with full vesting for upper quartile performance and 
straight-line vesting in between
•  Matching Share Awards vest on three-year TSR relative to a comparator group of international oil and gas sector 
peers. 25 per cent vests for median performance, with full vesting for upper decile performance and straight-line 
vesting in between
•  Before finalising long-term incentive payouts, the Committee assesses the underlying financial and operational 
performance of the Company, and if appropriate, may reduce the level of vesting. In assessing the underlying 
performance of the Company, the Committee may consider Net Asset Value per share, finding and development 
costs per barrel, delivery of the strategy, relative TSR, returns on invested capital, reserves replacement, operating 
cash flow, earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth, health and safety record, and other measures as the Committee 
deems appropriate
•  Ahead of each performance cycle, the Committee may review and adjust the TSR comparator group for future 
cycles to ensure relevance to Premier. The Committee may adjust the TSR comparator group of outstanding 
cycles in the event that a TSR comparator ceases to exist, de-lists or is acquired or the Committee deems it to  
be no longer a suitable comparator

Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
92 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Further details on the Policy 
Performance measure selection 
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is based on a corporate scorecard capturing financial, operational and strategic objectives that are key to 
achieving our long-term strategy. Performance measures, weightings and targets are set at the beginning of the year to reflect 
KPIs, business priorities and other corporate objectives, and encompassing both financial and non-financial criteria.
Performance targets are set at such a level as to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities 
and economic environment in a given performance period.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP ensures alignment with shareholders, being based on both absolute and relative TSR. The diagram below illustrates 
how the three elements of the LTIP operate. A single cycle of the LTIP covers a total of six years:
The Committee believes TSR appropriately rewards the delivery of the Company’s strategy and also aligns management’s 
interests with those of shareholders. Absolute TSR captures the absolute return delivered to shareholders and relative TSR 
measures performance on a relative basis, thereby helping to negate the impact of uncontrollable forces such as oil price 
movements on the reward delivered through the LTIP. The review of the Company’s underlying performance before LTIP 
payouts are finalised ensures the impact of external factors are taken into account where appropriate. The performance 
measures applied to LTIP awards are reviewed periodically to ensure they continue to support shareholders’ interests and  
are appropriately aligned to Premier’s long-term strategy.
Targets are geared to provide the opportunity to achieve above market levels of pay only through exceptional sustained 
relative TSR performance over six years.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The Company’s policy for all employees is to provide remuneration packages which reward them fairly and responsibly for 
their contributions.
All employees participate in the Company’s incentive structures and, like the remuneration package for Executive Directors, 
remuneration is structured such that a proportion of total remuneration is potentially delivered through long-term share-based 
incentives to ensure maximum alignment with shareholders. In 2015, the Committee approved the introduction of a new share 
incentive plan (the ‘Performance Value Share Plan’ or ‘PVSP’) for the broader employee population. This moves away from  
the ‘one size fits all’ reward philosophy of the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan which was broadly operated in the same way for 
executives, senior management and the wider employee population. The PVSP is a much simpler long-term incentive scheme 
which we believe better reflects the evolution of the Company and will better serve to motivate employees within the wider 
Group, and continues to incorporate performance measures based on both relative and absolute total shareholder return  
to help ensure continued alignment with our shareholders. For clarity, Executive Directors may not participate in the PVSP.
Similarly, all employees are eligible to receive an annual bonus, with measures and targets tailored to individual business units 
and responsibilities as appropriate. The specific bonus framework varies by job level and scope to ensure annual incentives 
support motivation and retention accordingly. These schemes provide a clear link between pay and performance, ensuring 
that superior remuneration is paid only if superior performance is delivered.
Share ownership requirements
The Committee aims to ensure that our Remuneration Policy serves shareholder interests and closely reflects the Group’s business 
strategy. Further, the Company recognises the importance of aligning the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders 
through the building up of a significant shareholding in the Company. Accordingly, the Company requires the Executive Directors 
to retain no less than 50 per cent of the net value of shares vesting under the Company’s long-term incentive plans until such a 
time that they have reached a holding worth 100 per cent of salary (200 per cent for the Chief Executive Officer).
Details of the current shareholdings of the Executive Directors are in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 108.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Payments from existing awards
Any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, 14 May 2014 (being the date on which the current Policy was 
approved by shareholders) will be honoured. The only outstanding commitment is as follows:
 Robin Allan was employed by the Company between September 1986 and November 1999 and is entitled to a deferred 
pension under the Scheme in respect of this period of employment. The pension he had accrued as at November 1999  
was £25,409. Further information on Robin Allan’s pension arrangements is provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on page 104.
Illustration of application of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy
Remuneration is significantly geared towards performance-orientated pay, with particular emphasis on long-term performance. 
For example, at ‘on-target’ performance, approximately 49 per cent of the CEO’s remuneration package is delivered through 
variable components, rising to approximately 85 per cent at ‘maximum’ performance. The maximum value is delivered only if 
upper quartile TSR is delivered against sector peers over six years, with a requirement for upper decile performance in the last 
three years.
The performance scenario charts opposite show the estimated remuneration that could be received by the current Executive 
Directors for 2016, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the total package under different performance scenarios. 
The assumptions underlying each performance scenario are detailed in the table below:
Remuneration receivable for different performance scenarios
Fixed pay • 2016 salary, as disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 106
• 2016 estimated taxable benefits

Illustration of application of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy continued 
The charts below illustrate the potential reward opportunities for each of the current Executive Directors for the three 
performance scenarios.
Note:
The valuation of Deferred Bonus Shares, Performance Share Awards (‘PSA’) and Matching Share Awards (‘MSA’) excludes share price appreciation. However, Equity Pool 
Awards (‘EPA’) assume equity value per share compound growth of 10 per cent per annum at on-target performance and equity value per share growth of 20 per cent  
per annum at maximum performance. It should also be noted that the LTIP is subject to a performance period of up to six years: EPA and PSA awards are assessed on  
three-year performance and MSA awards, which are based on the number of EPA and PSA shares deferred, are subject to a further three-year performance period.
1 Charts for Richard Rose do not include the Conditional Share Award made to him in 2014 to “buy-out” the share awards forfeited on resignation from his former employer.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Approach to remuneration of Executive Directors on recruitment
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of all the existing components  
of remuneration.
The salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to the experience and skills of the individual, relevant market 
data, internal relativities and their current salary. New appointees will be eligible to receive a personal pension, benefits and  
to participate in the Company’s HMRC approved all-employee share schemes, in line with the Policy. The approach to variable 
pay on recruitment is summarised in the table below:
Component Approach Maximum annual opportunity
Annual bonus The annual bonus described in the Policy Table  
will apply to new appointees with the relevant  
maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion  
of employment over the year. Targets for the individual 
element will be tailored towards the executive
100 per cent of salary
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the  
LTIP on the same terms as other Executive Directors,  
as described in the Policy Table
Equity Pool Awards: up to 6 per cent of the Equity Pool, 
which may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances  
(in which case awards shall not exceed 10 per cent of  
the Equity Pool)
Performance Share Awards: up to 150 per cent of salary
Matching Share Awards: up to 2.5 times the number  
of deferred Equity Pool Awards and deferred  
Performance Shares
When determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors (including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited) to 
ensure that the pay arrangements are in the best interests of both Premier and its shareholders. The Committee may consider 
it appropriate to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will 
use the existing Policy where possible or, in exceptional circumstances, the Committee may exercise the discretion available 
under Listing Rule 9.4.2R. The value of any such award will not be higher than the expected value of the outstanding equity 
awards and, in determining the expected value, the Committee will use a Black-Scholes, or equivalent, valuation and, where 
applicable, discount for any performance conditions attached to these awards.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Committee will apply the Policy for external 
appointees detailed above. However, the Committee will not use its discretion to award in excess of 6 per cent of the Equity 
Pool in relation to the retention of an existing Executive Director. Where an individual has contractual commitments that vary 
from our Policy for Executive Directors, but made prior to his or her promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will 
continue to honour these arrangements.
Service contracts and exit payments and change of control provisions
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee 
and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Company. The service contract 
of each Executive Director may be terminated on 12 months’ notice in writing by either party. Executive Directors’ contracts 
are available to view at the Company’s registered office.
Details of the service contracts of the current Executive Directors are as follows:
Director Contract date Unexpired term of contract
Robin Allan 09.12.03 Rolling contract
Tony Durrant 01.07.05 Rolling contract
Neil Hawkings 23.03.06 Rolling contract
Richard Rose 25.07.14 Rolling contract
The Company will consider termination payments in light of the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account  
the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate. In such an event,  
the remuneration commitments in respect of the Executive Director contracts could amount to one year’s remuneration based 
on salary and benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period, together with payment in lieu of any accrued but 
untaken holiday leave, if applicable. There are provisions for termination with less than 12 months’ notice by the Company  
in certain circumstances.
Policy report continued
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
96 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Service contracts and exit payments and change of control provisions continued
If such circumstances were to arise, the Executive Director concerned would have no claim against the Company for damages 
or any other remedy in respect of the termination. The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment 
made to a departing Executive Director and will honour previous commitments as appropriate, considering each case on an 
individual basis.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in different leaver 
scenarios and on a change of control. Whilst the Committee retains overall discretion on determining ‘good leaver’ status,  
it typically defines a ‘good leaver’ in circumstances such as retirement with agreement of the Company, ill health, disability, 
death, redundancy, or part of the business in which the individual is employed or engaged ceasing to be a member of the 
Group. Final treatment is subject to the Committee’s discretion.
Event Timing of vesting/award Calculation of vesting/payment
Annual bonus
‘Good leaver’ •  Annual bonuses are paid at the same  
time as to continuing employees
•  Unvested deferred share awards vest  
on cessation of employment
•  Annual bonus is paid only to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisfied and  
is pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year 
worked before cessation of employment
‘Bad leaver’ • Not applicable •  Individuals lose the right to their annual bonus  
and unvested deferred share awards
Change of control
1
•  Annual bonuses are paid and unvested  
deferred share awards vest on effective  
date of change of control
•  Annual bonus is paid only to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisfied and  
is pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year 
worked to the effective date of change of control
LTIP
‘Good leaver’ •  On normal vesting date 
(or earlier at the Committee’s discretion)
•  Unvested awards vest to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisfied and  
a pro-rata reduction applies to the value of the  
awards to take into account the proportion of  
vesting period not served
• Deferred shares vest in full
‘Bad leaver’ • Unvested awards lapse • Unvested awards lapse on cessation of employment
•  Outstanding deferred shares vest on cessation  
of employment
Change of control
1
• On the date of the event •  Unvested awards vest to the extent that any 
performance conditions have been satisfied and  
a pro-rata reduction applies for the proportion  
of the vesting period not served
•  Outstanding deferred shares vest in full
Note:
1  In certain circumstances, the Committee may determine that deferred share awards under the annual bonus and both unvested and deferred awards under  
the LTIP will not vest on a change of control and instead be replaced by an equivalent grant of a new award, as determined by the Committee, in the new company. 
Upon exit or change of control, SAYE and SIP awards will be treated in line with the approved plan rules.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute  
or otherwise) to additional amounts, which would need to be met. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle other 
amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in 
connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement (as provided 
for below) and, in which case, the individual is required to seek independent legal advice.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors 
including (but not limited to) settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements. These will  
be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders to do so.
External appointments
Executive Directors are entitled to accept non-executive director appointments outside the Company and retain any fees 
received providing that the Board’s prior approval is obtained. Details of external directorships held by Executive Directors 
along with fees retained are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 109.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee does not specifically consult with employees over the effectiveness and appropriateness of the Policy. 
However, the Committee does consider the pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company, including how Company-wide  
pay tracks against the market. When awarding salary increases to Executive Directors, the Committee takes account of  
salary increases across the Group, particularly for those employees based in the UK. Further, the Company seeks to promote 
and maintain good relationships with employee representative bodies – including trade unions – as part of its employee 
engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case  
by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee aims to ensure that the Policy serves shareholder interests and is aligned with the Group’s business strategy, 
market practice and evolving best practice. The Committee Chairman consults major shareholders and proxy advisers from 
time-to-time to discuss the Remuneration Policy. The Committee considers all feedback received from such consultations,  
as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally, to help to ensure the Policy is aligned with 
shareholder views. In December 2015, the Committee Chairman contacted Premier’s major shareholders offering to discuss 
remuneration matters and providing an update on the Company’s deliberations with respect to the Company’s executive 
remuneration arrangements and, in particular, its LTIP arrangements. A formal consultation process will commence in 2016 
prior to the next Policy renewal in 2017. Premier is mindful of the views it receives in its consultations. 
Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment effective for a period of three years, subject to annual re-election  
by shareholders at each Annual General Meeting in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. All letters of 
appointment have a notice period of three months and provide for no arrangements under which any Non-Executive Director 
is entitled to receive remuneration upon the early termination of his or her appointment. Non-Executive Directors’ letters  
of appointment are available to view at the Company’s registered office.

The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to Non-Executive Directors is to be determined  
by the Board within limits set by the shareholders. The Policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is as follows:
Fees
Purpose and link  
to strategy 
• To provide fees that allow Premier to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors of the highest calibre
Operation • Fees for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed at least every two years
•  Fees are set with reference to three relevant comparator groups, comprising: (i) international oil & gas sector 
companies, (ii) the constituents of the LTIP TSR comparator group, and (iii) UK-listed companies of a similar market 
cap and revenue to Premier. The fees also take into account the time commitments of the Non-Executive Directors
•  Fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the Committee, while the fees of the other Non-Executive Directors 
are determined by the Board
•  Additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Director, and as Chairman of any of the  
Board’s Committees
•  Adjustments are normally effective 1 January
•  The Non-Executive Director fees for the financial year under review are disclosed in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration
Opportunity •  Non-Executive Director fees are set at a level that is considered appropriate in the light of relevant market 
practice and the size/complexity of the role
Performance metrics • Not applicable
Approach to Non-Executive Director recruitment remuneration
In the case of hiring or appointing a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will follow the Policy as set out in the table above.

98 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration Committee membership and considerations during 2015
Jane Hinkley is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and there are three other members who are also independent 
Non-Executive Directors. David Bamford, Joe Darby and David Lindsell served as members throughout the year. Members  
of the Committee meet without any executives present for part of each meeting. The Chief Executive Officer attended 
meetings of the Committee by invitation but absented himself when the Committee discussed matters relating to the  
Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration. Mike Fleming, Group HR Director, and Nigel Wilson, Corporate Services Director, 
attended meetings as appropriate. Stephen Huddle acted as Secretary to the Committee until his resignation as Company 
Secretary on 29 May 2015. Rachel Rickard acted as Secretary to the Committee from the date of her appointment as  
Company Secretary on 29 May 2015. Members of the Board and any other employees attending Committee meetings  
leave the meeting where their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly and published on the Company’s 
website www.premier-oil.com. The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
• determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and senior management;
• determining the individual remuneration packages for each Executive Director and any changes thereto;
• considering the design of, and determining targets for, the annual bonus plan;
• determining the quantum and performance conditions for long-term incentive awards;
• reviewing pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for Executive Directors;
• approving the Directors’ Remuneration Report, ensuring compliance with related governance provisions and legislation;
• reviewing bonus outcomes; and
• considering the remuneration policies and practices across the organisation.
During 2015, the Committee met eight times (four scheduled meetings and four ad-hoc meetings). Key activities of the 
Committee during the year included:
• determining the remuneration for Executive Directors;
• reviewing pension arrangements for Executive Directors;
• determining the termination arrangements for Andrew Lodge who stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2015;
• reviewing the current Long Term Incentive Plan and discussion of alternative arrangements;
• considering remuneration policies and practices across the organisation, in particular, the design of a new long-term 
incentive plan for the broader employee population (excluding Directors and certain members of senior management);
• determining the 2014 bonus outcome and bonus targets for 2015;
• making awards under the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan, including setting performance conditions;
• monitoring performance of outstanding awards under the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan;
• reviewing the Committee’s terms of reference; and
• reviewing the Committee’s performance.
Advisers
Kepler Associates, a brand of Mercer Limited which is part of the MMC group of companies (‘Kepler’), is the independent  
adviser to the Committee. Kepler was appointed by the Committee in 2011 through a competitive tender process  
and was retained during the year. The Committee is of the view that Kepler provides independent remuneration advice  
to the Committee and does not have any connections with Premier that may impair its independence. Kepler is a  
founding member and signatory to the UK Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct which governs standards in  
the areas of transparency, integrity, objectivity, confidentiality, competence and due care, details of which can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. In 2015 Kepler provided advice on remuneration for executives and, in particular,  
on the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, reviewed the Directors’ Remuneration Report, provided advice on 
market and best practice guidance, and attended Committee meetings. Kepler reports directly to the Committee and 
provides no other services to the Company. Its total fee for the provision of remuneration services in 2015 was £109,737  
on the basis of time and materials.
During the year the Committee also took advice from PwC to provide performance updates on outstanding LTIP awards, 
including the vesting of the 2013 Equity Pool, Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards. Total fees for PwC for  
the provision of remuneration services in 2015 were £35,000 on a fixed fee basis. The Committee also sought advice from 
Berwin, Leighton & Paisner LLP in relation to service and settlement agreements as well as a review of Executive Director 
pension arrangements. Total fees for Berwin, Leighton & Paisner LLP were £85,379 on the basis of time and materials.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers annually and is satisfied that the advice it received in 2015  
was objective and independent.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Voting on remuneration matters
Section 439A of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) requires the Remuneration Policy to be submitted to shareholders for  
a binding vote every three years or where there is a change in the Remuneration Policy. The Remuneration Policy was last 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2014 AGM by way of a binding vote and the votes received are detailed in the 
table below. As there were no changes proposed to the Remuneration Policy for 2015, it was not submitted to shareholders 
for approval at the 2015 AGM. The resolution put to shareholders at the 2015 AGM relating to Directors’ remuneration was  
a resolution to approve the Directors’ Annual Report on Remuneration and, in accordance with the Act, the resolution was 
subject to an advisory vote. The votes received are also set out in the table below.

2  Taxable benefits include medical and dental insurance, car allowance, life assurance and critical illness cover, health insurance and a subsidised gym membership.  
In particular, in 2015, all Executive Directors received a car allowance of £15,000.
3  Annual bonus awarded for performance in the relevant financial year. See page 102 of the Annual Report on Remuneration for further details of the 2015 annual bonus 
awards to each Executive Director, including performance criteria, achievement and resulting awards.
4  Long-term incentives include awards granted under Premier’s 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) subject to a performance period ending in the relevant financial 
year. In 2014 and 2015 the relevant performance targets for such awards were not achieved and the awards lapsed. Further details of performance conditions for the  
LTIP are contained on page 92.
5  Richard Rose’s pension figure includes a combination of pension contributions to the defined contribution scheme and a salary supplement. For other Executive 
Directors, pension figures are accrued pension entitlements under the Company’s final salary scheme and exclude Director contributions. See page 104 of the  
Annual Report on Remuneration for further details on total pension entitlements for each Executive Director.
6  Other payments include SIP awards and SAYE options granted in line with the Policy on page 90. Each Executive Director was awarded SIP Matching Awards during  
the year as detailed on page 114; SIP awards are valued as the number of Matching Awards granted multiplied by the share price at date of award. Tony Durrant  
and Neil Hawkings were each awarded a three-year SAYE option over 14,920 shares and Robin Allan and Richard Rose were each awarded a five-year SAYE option  
over 24,867 shares on 7 May 2015. The value of SAYE options is the embedded value at grant (20 per cent discount multiplied by the number of options granted).  
Full details of Executive Director SAYE options and SIP share awards are available on page 114 of the Annual Report on Remuneration. The ‘other payments’ figure  
for Richard Rose for 2014 also includes the value of his Conditional Share Award to “buy-out” the share awards he forfeited on resignation from his former employer.
7  Tony Durrant was appointed to the position of Chief Executive Officer with effect from 25 June 2014. The figures for 2014 reflect the resulting increase in his salary  
and related bonus and pension payments for the period 25 June 2014 to 31 December 2014. The figures for 2015 reflect a full year’s salary in relation to his position  
as Chief Executive Officer with no underlying increase taking place in 2015.
8  Richard Rose joined the Company on 8 September 2014. Details shown for 2014 are for the period 8 September to 31 December 2014. 
9  Andrew Lodge left the Company on 30 June 2015. Details shown above are for the period 1 January to 30 June 2015. For further detail regarding Andrew Lodge’s 
leaving arrangements, please see page 101. For the purpose of comparability with other Directors, the 2015 pension figure for Andrew Lodge was recalculated at 
31 December 2015 using a statutory factor of 20. The amount he received as at his date of leaving was £338,200.

Notes:
1  During the year, Joe Darby acted as Senior Independent Director, David Lindsell was Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, Jane Hinkley was Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee and Mike Welton was the Company Chairman and was also Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
2 Amounts disclosed relate to travel and accommodation expenses paid to Non-Executive Directors in respect of qualifying services during the year.
3  The 2014 figures have been restated to include travel and accommodation expenses where applicable.
4  David Bamford joined the Company on 1 May 2014. His annual fee for 2014 was £53,000 per annum in line with the other Non-Executive Directors. The total figure 
shown for 2014 reflects the fee paid to him for service from 1 May to 31 December 2014.
5  Anne Marie Cannon joined the Company on 1 February 2014. Her annual fee for 2014 was £53,000 per annum in line with the other Non-Executive Directors.  
The total figure for 2014 shown reflects the fee paid to her for service from 1 February to 31 December 2014. 
No fees were paid to Non-Executive Directors for membership of a Committee or for attending Committee meetings. 
Additional fees were payable of £10,600 (2014: £10,600) for acting as Senior Independent Director, as Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee or as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The Company Chairman is also the Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee and currently waives any fee for this role. Fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
were last increased effective from 1 January 2013 following a review in 2012. Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors were originally scheduled to be reviewed in December 2014; the biennial review has been postponed for a further 
year. In view of the current market environment it was agreed that any increase in fee would be inappropriate at this point in 
time. The next review of fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is scheduled for the end of 2016 with any change 
proposed to take effect from 1 January 2017.
Executive Director changes (audited)
Andrew Lodge stepped down as an Executive Director and from his position as Exploration Director on 30 June 2015.  
The Committee determined Andrew Lodge’s exit arrangements in accordance with his service agreement and the Remuneration 
Policy. The Committee determined Andrew Lodge would receive good leaver status in relation to outstanding incentive awards. 
The following arrangements were agreed:
A payment of 12 months’ salary and benefits of £436,120 gross calculated as (a) base salary of £353,750 and (b) payment in  
lieu of benefits of £82,370 comprising car allowance, subsidised gym membership and pension. The Company will continue to 
provide life assurance cover (plus up to £3,000 for tax payable by Andrew Lodge on this cover) and private medical insurance 
for 12 months on the same basis as previously provided.
2015 Annual Bonus Payment
Under the terms of his contract, Andrew Lodge was entitled to receive his annual bonus payment for 2015 which has been 
reduced on a time worked basis to reflect his departure date of 30 June 2015. Full details are set out on pages 102 and 103.
Long Term Incentive Plan Awards
Andrew Lodge’s existing LTIP awards will vest, subject to performance, having been pro-rated on a time worked basis, at their 
normal vesting date, in accordance with the good leaver provisions in the Company’s LTIP rules.
Pension related benefits

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Annual bonus in respect of 2015 performance (audited)
In line with the Policy, during 2015 Executive Directors participated in non-pensionable annual bonus arrangements. The 2015 
annual bonus provided for awards of between 0 per cent and 100 per cent of salary for Executive Directors. Annual performance 
was assessed against a performance scorecard encompassing health, safety, environment and security (‘HSES’), production, 
development, exploration, finance, business development and organisation as well as personal performance.
In assessing the 2015 bonus payout, the Committee reviewed performance against each measure and applied judgement to 
determine the overall bonus level, taking into account other aspects of performance including overall Company performance 
and the oil sector environment.
The 2015 annual bonus scorecard was based 80 per cent on financial and operational targets and 20 per cent on personal objectives. 
The table below details the financial and operational performance categories, their relative weightings and achievement against 
specific targets. Each Executive Director’s achievement against the personal targets is also summarised below.

The formulaic total bonus outcome ranged between 55.8 per cent and 58.1 per cent. However, in view of the harsh economic 
environment prevailing in the upstream oil sector following the collapse in oil prices and the consequent fall in Premier’s share 
price, the Committee decided to award a bonus of 10 per cent of salary to the Executive Directors. The Committee feels that 
this decision recognises the strong operational performance, and, in particular, the drive for efficiency and cost constraint  
by the executive leadership team, whilst acknowledging the impact of low oil prices on shareholders. The bonus award for  
all staff was also set at 10 per cent of salary for those who ‘met expectations‘ and above in their annual performance review.  
The Executive Directors had a proportionately higher reduction to their award than other staff, given their higher level of 
bonus opportunity.

LTIP vesting outcomes in 2015 (audited)
LTIP awards were granted in 2013 as Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards (matched 
over deferred awards under the LTIP 2010 award (see page 92 for further detail on the LTIP)). The 2013 LTIP award cycles 
completed their three-year performance periods on 31 December 2015. The vesting conditions of these awards are the same  
as described in the Policy Table on page 92.
The constituents of the comparator group for the 2013 Performance Share Award and 2013 Matching Share Award cycles are 
detailed on page 113 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The outcomes of the 2013 LTIP awards are as follows:
• Equity Pool Awards: over the performance period, the threshold of 10 per cent compound annual growth was not met,  
and, as a result, awards under the 2013 Equity Pool will not vest.
• Performance Share Awards: over the performance period, the Company’s TSR was below the median of the comparator 
group. As a result, the 2013 Performance Share Awards will not vest as the threshold was not met.
• Matching Share Awards: over the performance period, the Company’s TSR was below the median of the comparator group. 
As a result, 2013 Matching Share Awards will not vest as the threshold was not met.
LTIP awards granted in 2015 (audited)
The table below summarises the LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2015 under the 2015–2017 cycle, in line with 
the Policy detailed on page 92. Performance for these awards is measured between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017, 
and is based on equity value per share and relative TSR as detailed in the Policy Table. As the 2012 LTIP awards did not vest  
in 2015, no corresponding Matching Share Awards were granted during 2015.

Notes:
1  For Equity Pool Awards, the percentage of maximum received for achieving threshold performance is 18.2 per cent. This has been calculated as the payout for achieving 
growth in equity value of 10 per cent per annum divided by the face value of the Awards.
2 For Performance Share Awards, 25 per cent of the shares awarded would be received for threshold performance, which is TSR equal to the median of the comparator group. 
3 Any dividends paid accrue on Performance Share Awards and will be paid on vesting as cash or shares, in proportion to performance achieved.
4  For Equity Pool Awards, the face value represents the full vesting value (at growth in equity value per share of 20 per cent per annum) assuming the Committee exercises 
its discretion to allow vesting at higher than 100 per cent of salary.
5  For Performance Share Awards, face value is calculated as the maximum number of shares that would vest if targets were met in full, multiplied by the closing mid-market 
price on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of award: £1.673 on 26 February 2015.
6  Andrew Lodge left the Company on 30 June 2015. His LTIP awards will be treated in accordance with the good leaver provisions in the LTIP rules such that the awards 
will be pro-rated on a time worked basis and any remaining awards will vest at their normal vesting date subject to performance. The award shown above represents  
the total amount awarded on 27.02.15 prior to any pro-rata adjustment.
The constituents of the comparator group for outstanding Performance Share Award and Matching Share Award cycles are 
detailed on page 113 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Total pension entitlements (audited)
In line with the Policy, as Directors who joined the Company prior to 20 August 2013, Robin Allan, Tony Durrant and Neil Hawkings 
receive a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Company’s final salary Retirement and Death 
Benefits Plan (the ‘Scheme’) and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as Directors, not subject  
to the Scheme’s cap on pensionable earnings (£149,400 for 2016).
As a Director who joined the Company after 20 August 2013, Richard Rose is entitled to receive a pension contribution and/or 
cash supplement equal to 20 per cent of his salary.
The accrued pension entitlements of the Directors who were members (or deemed members) of the Scheme during 2015 are as follows:

Notes:
1 The amounts of accrued pension under (a) and (c) represent the accrued pension entitlements of the Director as at the stated dates.
2  The values under (d) have been calculated by applying a capitalisation factor of 20 to the difference between amounts shown in (c) and (b) and are principally due to the 
additional pension accrued over the year.
3  The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision; in practice, the pension benefits for these Directors are principally established 
through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
4 Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions; none of the Directors have elected to do so.
5  In addition to the current provision noted above, Robin Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of service with the Company between 
September 1986 and November 1999.
6  Andrew Lodge left service on 30 June 2015; the accrued pension under (c) relates to service completed up to that date. The value of growth in accrued pension  
under (f) was calculated at 31 December 2015 using a capitalisation factor of 20.
In respect of 2015, Tony Durrant and Neil Hawkings elected to receive a salary supplement, whilst Robin Allan and Andrew Lodge 
elected to receive a combination of pension contributions and a salary supplement. During the year a review was carried out for 
the Directors who were members (or deemed members) of the Scheme to assess the extent to which the payments already made 
to each Director are projected to be sufficient to provide the accrued component of their target pension. In January 2015, the 
Committee decided not to make the target funding payments for the prior year and following the review in December 2015,  
the Committee approved target funding payments for Robin Allan, Tony Durrant and Neil Hawkings, as detailed in the table 
below, reflecting the level of increase required to meet 90 per cent of the accrued target pension values. These payments were 
approved for payment in four instalments during the course of 2016, the first of which was made in January 2016.
Richard Rose receives a combination of pension contributions (to the defined contribution scheme) and a salary supplement 
totalling 20 per cent of salary.

106 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Annual bonus
For 2016, the Executive Director annual bonus opportunity is up to 100 per cent of salary. Annual performance will be 
assessed against a performance scorecard of which 80 per cent will be based on financial and operational measures (see table 
below) and 20 per cent on personal objectives. The 2016 corporate and personal objectives, along with threshold and stretch 
target values, will be disclosed, to the extent that they are not commercially sensitive, in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. In the current climate the Committee will consider carefully the oil market outlook, the Company’s position and the 
outcome for 2016 in deciding whether and at what level to award bonuses for that year. Any bonus paid will be assessed 
against the achievement of the 2016 performance targets. The table below also summarises the criteria used to assess each 
measure and the relative weighting of each:

Long-term incentive plan
As referenced previously, the Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the LTIP both for the wider employee population 
as well as for the Executive Directors and has agreed to move to a much simpler structure for the employee population below 
the Executive Director and senior management levels. Although it was the Committee’s intent to commence early consultation 
with shareholders on the detail of its proposal in relation to Executive Directors and senior management, the Committee 
determined that the current market volatility and divergent opinion on oil price projection made the case for changing executive 
remuneration less compelling, with management’s focus being on realigning the Company’s business to cope with the prevailing 
low price environment. Should any changes be proposed which impact the LTIP structure for Executive Directors, shareholders 
will be consulted and approval sought, as appropriate. Due to the unprecedented market conditions, the Committee has 
decided to defer a decision on granting LTIP awards to Executive Directors, as well as a decision on granting awards to the 
broader employee population under the new long-term incentive plan (the ‘PVSP’), in 2016 until later in the year, after the 
Half-Year results are released. 
Implementation of Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2016

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and scheme interests (audited)
Formal shareholding guidelines exist which require the Executive Directors to retain no less than 50 per cent of the net value 
of shares vesting under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements until such time as they have achieved a holding 
worth 100 per cent of salary (200 per cent for the CEO). 
The graphs below show the number and value of Executive Directors’ shareholding and scheme interests as at 31 December 2014 
and 31 December 2015 respectively. Despite no shares being sold during the year and an increase in shares owned outright 
by Executive Directors, the value of holdings fell significantly during the year due to the fall in share price. This resulted in a 
corresponding reduction in the level of percentage shareholding against salary.

Notes:
1  Owned outright includes shares held by the Director and/or connected persons. This figure also includes shares held in the tax-advantaged Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) 
which may be subject to forfeiture on leaving the Company, dependent upon the time for which they have been held.
2   Deferred shares subject to continued employment for Richard Rose comprise his Conditional Share Award (‘CSA’) received on joining the Company to “buy-out” the 
share awards he forfeited on resignation from his former employer. The CSA reflects the expected value of his forfeited awards and consists of 26,135 shares valued using 
the mid-market closing share price on 8 September 2014 of £3.413. The CSA will vest only if Richard Rose remains employed by the Company on 31 December 2016. 
3  Deferred shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan subject to a three-year holding period but which would vest in full on cessation of employment in all circumstances 
save for summary dismissal.
4  Unvested shares subject to performance include 2013 Performance Share Awards and 2013 Matching Share Awards, for which the performance period completed  
on 31 December 2015 and no awards vested. See page 103 of the Annual Report on Remuneration for further details on performance criteria and achievement.
5  Interests reported as at 30 June 2015, the date on which Andrew Lodge’s directorship ceased. The figures exclude 101 Partnership Shares and 101 Matching Shares 
purchased on 1 July 2015 under the terms of the Share Incentive Plan with contributions taken from Mr Lodge’s June salary.

Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
108 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Sourcing of shares and dilution limits
Awards under all the Company’s share schemes may be met using a combination of market purchases, financed by the 
Company through the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust, and newly issued shares. The Company complies with the 
Investment Association’s recommended guidelines on shareholder dilution through employee share schemes: awards  
under the Group’s discretionary schemes which may be satisfied with new issue shares must not exceed 5 per cent of the 
Company’s issued share capital in any rolling 10-year period, and the total of all awards satisfied with new issue shares  
under all plans must not exceed 10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling 10-year period.
As of 31 December 2015, 1,777,454 shares were held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2014: 2,690,319) and the commitments  
to issue new shares are summarised below:

As a result of the acquisition of EnCore, the Company has a 17.71 per cent interest in Egdon Resources plc (‘Egdon’) and

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Group financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’)  
as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) Regulation and have 
also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 – ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ – 
requires that Directors: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s and Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention  
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1.  the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted  
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
2.  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of  
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
3.  the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 24 February 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, (“UK GAAP”), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and

as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income,

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable  
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (UK GAAP) including 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Emphasis of matter – Going concern
As disclosed within the basis of preparation section of the accounting policies, there is a risk of a covenant breach in respect  
of the testing period ending 30 June 2016. If a covenant breach occurs then the Group’s debt holders on all of the Group’s 
facilities will have the right to request repayment of the outstanding debt from October 2016 onwards and to cancel the 
relevant facilities.
In order to address the risk of a covenant breach, the Group will seek to modify or temporarily waive the existing covenants, 
ahead of the testing period ending 30 June 2016.
Whilst we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate, these conditions together with the other matters set out or referred to in the basis of preparation 
section of the accounting policies indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may give rise to significant doubt over 
the Company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments 
that would result if the Group or Parent Company were unable to continue as a going concern.
We describe below how the scope of our audit has responded to this risk. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis of accounting contained within the basis of preparation section of the accounting policies and the Directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report on page 37.
Aside from the matters disclosed in the emphasis of matter paragraphs above, we have nothing else material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 30 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 32 to 35 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the basis of preparation section of the accounting policies about whether they consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval  
of the financial statements; and
• the Director’s explanation on page 37 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period  
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over  
the period of their assessment.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we  
are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. 
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PREMIER OIL PLC
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Going concern
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We consider the application of the going concern basis of 
accounting and the related disclosures to be a key risk due to  
the significant and prolonged fall in oil prices and ongoing oil  
price volatility. In particular, we considered that it was likely that 
there would be a high degree of judgement as to the Group’s  
ability to comply with certain of the covenants within its loan 
agreements throughout the going concern assessment period. 
As referenced on page 124 in the financial statements, management 
has highlighted the material uncertainty regarding the Group’s  
ability to comply with certain of the covenants throughout the  
going concern assessment period.
We have highlighted the level of uncertainty identified by the 
Directors in respect of going concern in the “Emphasis of matter  
– Going concern” paragraphs on the previous page.
To assess the appropriateness of the going concern assumption we:
• obtained management’s going concern base case forecast which was 
approved by the Board, and the accompanying cash flow and financial 
covenant forecasts for the next 12 months (the going concern period);
•  compared the cash flow forecasts for 2016 with the Board approved 
budget for that period, and obtained explanations for any  
significant differences;
•  compared the cash flow forecasts used in the going concern model with 
those used in the asset value-in-use calculations for impairment purposes 
and obtained explanations for any significant differences;
•  assessed the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;
•  compared the oil price assumptions used in these forecasts to third party 
forecasts and publicly available forward curves;
•  tested the mechanical accuracy of the cash flow model and the related 
financial covenant forecasts;
• agreed the Group’s committed debt facilities, including financial covenant 
terms and the timing of early repayment in the event there is a breach,  
to supporting documentation;
•  performed stress tests for a range of reasonably possible downside 
scenarios (including oil price, production and expenditure) and 
considered their impact on both forecast covenant compliance and  
the ability of the Group to remain within the monetary caps specified  
in its debt facilities during the going concern period;
• considered the Group’s available funding and planned activities  
to address the identified forecast covenant breach, which includes 
renegotiation of the covenants in its borrowing facilities; and 
•  considered whether the disclosures in the basis of preparation section  
of the accounting policies relating to going concern are fair, balanced  
and understandable.
As a result of these procedures, we concluded that there was a material 
uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Company’s and Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Recoverability of intangible exploration and evaluation (E&E) assets
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
In accordance with the relevant accounting standards, E&E costs are 
written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the 
appraisal process is not completed. This was considered a key risk 
due to the significant judgements and estimates that are required to 
be assessed, these include but are not limited to the significant and 
prolonged fall in oil price and the judgement regarding estimated 
reserves and resources in place.
As referenced on page 131 of the financial statements the carrying 
value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets is considered 
by management as a critical accounting judgement and key source 
of estimate uncertainty.
Note 9 of the financial statements includes details of the  
Group’s E&E assets and the impairments of US$95.4 million  
(2014: US$58.5 million) which arose during the year.
We challenged the outcome of management’s review of their E&E assets  
to assess if there were any indicators of impairments for any of the Group’s 
material field interests by:
•  participating in meetings with key operational and finance staff to 
understand the current status and future intention for each asset;
•  confirming that all assets which remain capitalised are included in future 
budgets and are considered to contain potentially commercial volumes  
of hydrocarbons, notwithstanding the current low oil price environment;
•  where the E&E asset is more progressed and economic assessments  
are available, for example the Sea Lion prospect in the Falkland Islands, 
obtaining management’s economic assessment and understanding  
the basis on which the asset is considered to be potentially commercial;
•  identifying any fields where the Group’s right to explore is either at,  
or close to, expiry and assessing the appropriateness of retaining the 
associated costs as an asset; and
•  where an asset has been impaired obtaining supporting evidence  
for the events that led to the impairment.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
120 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PREMIER OIL PLC continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Capitalisation and impairment of oil and gas properties within property, plant and equipment
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
These are considered key risks due to the significant judgements  
and estimates that need to be made in assessing both whether  
costs initially qualify for capitalisation and whether any impairments 
have arisen at year-end.
Due to the high levels of volatility experienced by commodity 
markets during 2015 and the extended time periods over which  
the Group’s key producing and development assets are expected  
to operate, the risk of impairment was considered likely to be highly 
sensitive to assumptions in respect of, in particular, future oil and  
gas prices and discount rates. 
Management has performed a review of the producing and 
development asset portfolio for indicators of impairment. 
Management has undertaken a full impairment review,  
based on key assumptions which include:
• Oil and gas prices;
•  R es e r v es / p r o d u c t i o n ;
•  Dis co u n t r a t e ;
•  Operating costs; and
•  C a p i t a l c os t s.
As referenced on page 131 of the financial statements the carrying 
value of property, plant and equipment is considered by management 
as a critical accounting judgement and key source of estimate uncertainty.
During the year a total impairment charge of US$1,023.7 million  
(2014: US$784.4 million) was recorded, which primarily related to the 
Solan and Huntington fields in the UK, and the remaining carrying value  
of oil and gas properties on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 
was US$2,594.8 million (2014: US$2,407.3 million). Further details, 
including related sensitivity analysis in respect of oil and gas prices 
and discount rate, are provided in note 10 to the financial statements. 
We challenged the assumptions made by management by comparing them 
with publicly available information, third party information, our knowledge  
of the Group and industry as well as budgeted and forecast performance. 
This included:
• comparing oil and gas price assumptions with third party forecasts  
and publicly available forward curves;
• using our internal valuation specialists to perform an independent 
recalculation of the discount rate used for each significant country  
of operation; and
• completing a scenario analysis, through which we computed what  
we believed to be a reasonable range of impairment charges by cash 
generating unit and comparing management’s impairment charges 
against this range.
We have also tested capitalised expenditure during the year on a sample 
basis to assess whether the related costs qualify for capitalisation under  
the relevant accounting standards.
Decommissioning provisions
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Provisions for decommissioning are a judgemental area as they 
include assumptions around estimated decommissioning costs, 
timing of the decommissioning, inflation, discount rates and the 
economic life of a field, which in turn will depend on factors such  
as oil price and operating costs.
As referenced on page 131 of the financial statements 
decommissioning is considered by management as a critical 
accounting judgement and key source of estimate uncertainty.
The total provision at the end of 2015 was US$1,062.6 million  
(2014: US$871.3 million) and further details are provided in  
note 17 to the financial statements.
We have assessed for appropriateness the key assumptions underlying  
the decommissioning calculation through:
• agreeing gross estimates to third party support or internal  
engineer estimates;
• obtaining supporting evidence for any material revisions in cost  
estimates during the year;
• confirming the decommissioning dates are consistent with the  
Group’s latest internal economic models;
• comparing the discount rate with available market information;
• testing the mechanical accuracy of management’s decommissioning 
provision calculation; and
• understanding the levels of development and production activity  
by field and challenging management as to the completeness of  
provisions that have been recorded.
Accounting for taxation
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
This is considered a key risk due to the diverse geographical  
nature of the Group, the different tax legislation in place in the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the judgements 
applied in recognition of deferred tax assets. 
As referenced on page 131 of the financial statements tax  
and recognition of deferred tax assets is considered by  
management as a critical accounting judgement and key  
source of estimate uncertainty.
At the year end, the Group has recorded a deferred tax asset  
of US$871.6 million (2014: US$971.8 million), which primarily  
arises in the UK. The Group has not recognised a deferred tax  
asset on US$1,129 million (US$96.0 million) of the Group’s UK  
ring fence corporate tax losses based on future profitability,  
in particular because of the significant and prolonged fall in  
oil prices during the year. Further details of the Group’s deferred  
tax position are provided in note 19 to the financial statements.
We worked with tax specialists in the relevant locations to understand the 
tax legislation governing the Group’s operations in each of the jurisdictions 
in which the Group operated during the year. We obtained the Group’s 
taxation computations in respect of current and deferred tax and assessed 
the computations for compliance with local tax legislation and IAS 12 
Income Taxes. We also evaluated the position taken by management in 
respect of the recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets, considering 
whether the supporting calculations are in accordance with enacted tax 
legislation and are consistent with the models used for the Group’s IAS 36 
impairment tests.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The risks included in our audit report for 2015 are consistent with those as reported in our audit report for the year ended 
31 December 2014, with the exception that the risk on going concern is now also an emphasis of matter.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee discussed on pages 80 to 82.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$15 million (2014: US$23 million), which represents 4 per cent of the average 
normalised pre-tax profit for the last three years, and a reduction on prior year materiality of 35 per cent. In 2014, materiality 
was below 5 per cent of normalised pre-tax profit.
Pre-tax profit has been normalised using the same method as prior year, by adjusting for significant impairments which would 
significantly distort the materiality calculation year-on-year. However, given the significant volatility in oil prices in 2015 and  
the difficulty in predicting the future direction of oil prices, we do not believe that focusing solely on 2015 normalised pre-tax 
profit would represent a stable basis for materiality or be representative of the underlying scale of the Group. Accordingly,  
we have adapted our approach in determining materiality by using the average normalised pre-tax profit for the last three 
years. In addition, although not our primary metric, due to the importance to the Group of its extensive development portfolio 
not yet in production, we have also considered the Group’s net assets base, noting that US$15 million represents 2 per cent  
of this figure at 31 December 2015.
In order to ensure that we gain sufficient assurance and oversight of misstatements throughout the Group, materiality for each 
of the reporting components has been set at between US$7.5 million and US$10 million (2014: US$12 million and US$15 million), 
depending on the relative size of the component.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 
US$0.3 million (2014: US$0.5 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at six key locations: UK – London, UK – Aberdeen, Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Falkland Islands. 
These were subject to a full audit, whilst a further two locations, including Norway which was sold during the year, were subject 
to an audit of specified account balances, where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. The key locations identified above represent 
the principal business units and account for materially all of the Group’s revenue, profit before tax and net assets.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team performs the Group audit work in respect of UK – London, UK – Aberdeen and the Falklands Islands  
and continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or  
senior members of the Group audit team visit other key locations and review the work performed on significant risks by  
the component auditors. In the year, all but one of the six key locations was either directly audited or visited by either the 
Senior Statutory Auditor or a senior member of his team. For the location not visited we included the component audit team  
in our team briefings, discussed their risk assessment, participated in a number of telephone meetings with the component 
auditor and reviewed documentation of the findings from their work, including their audit clearance and supporting materials.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. 
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
122 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PREMIER OIL PLC continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in 
the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee which 
we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION General information
Premier Oil plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the 
registered office is Premier Oil plc, 4th Floor, Saltire Court, 20 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EN. The principal activities of 
the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) are oil and gas exploration and production in the Falkland Islands, Indonesia, 
Norway, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Rest of the World.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars since that is the currency in which the majority of the Group’s 
transactions are denominated.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted, none of which have  
a material impact on the Group’s annual results.
• IAS 19 (amendments) Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2010–2012 Amendments to: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 24 Related Party 
Disclosures and IAS 38 Intangible Assets
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2011–2013 Amendments to: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and IAS 40 Investment Property 
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in 
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union):
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
• IFRS 16 Leases
• IFRS 11 (amendments) Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendments) Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• IAS 16 and IAS 41 (amendments) Agriculture: Bearer Plants
• IAS 27 (amendments) Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
• IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012–2014 Cycle Amendments to: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments,  
IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures and IFRS 16 is likely to require a number of potentially 
significant changes to the treatment of our lease arrangements. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 until a detailed review has been completed.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of financial instruments and 
certain oil and gas properties at the transition date to IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the use of the going 
concern assumption, including details of a related material uncertainty due to the risk of a covenant in breach in respect of the 
testing period as at 30 June 2016, is provided in the “Going Concern” section of the Financial Review as set out on page 54.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
124 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when a company is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by other members of the Group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs  
are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the  
cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the 
fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
(2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are 
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 share-based payment; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale  
and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional 
amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect 
new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts  
of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,  
goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when  
there is an indication the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Interest in joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is one in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing  
of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent  
of the parties sharing control. 
Most of the Group’s activities are conducted through joint operations, whereby the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. The Group reports its 
interests in joint operations using proportionate consolidation – the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
of the joint operation are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
A joint venture, which normally involves the establishment of a separate legal entity, is a contractual arrangement whereby  
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have the rights to the arrangement’s net assets. The results, assets and 
liabilities of a joint venture are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
During 2015, the Group did not have any material interests in joint ventures. 
Where the Group transacts with its joint operations, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the joint operation.
Interests in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, through the power to participate in the financial  
and operating policy decisions of the investee, but which is not a subsidiary or a joint arrangement. The results, assets and 
liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered through a sales transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the 
sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management 
must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from 
the date of classification.
Sales revenue and other income
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Oil and gas assets
The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (‘E&E’) costs, having regard 
to the requirements of IFRS 6 –‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ .
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially 
capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred 
during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established 
or the determination process has not been completed.
 Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement 
as they are incurred.
 Exploration and evaluation costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, costs of technical 
services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the Group’s vehicles, drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, 
plant and equipment used by the Company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. 
However, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting 
that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable 
overhead, including the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of 
other materials consumed during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
 
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
126 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015  Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward, until the existence (or otherwise)  
of commercial reserves has been determined subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment.  
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets,  
is then reclassified as development and production assets, once a field development plan has been approved or a gas 
sales agreement has been signed. If, however, commercial reserves have not been found, the capitalised costs are charged 
to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
(b) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of 
developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures 
incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy (a) on the 
previous page.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets,  
directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration  
and decommissioning.
 Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production 
method by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial (proved and probable) reserves  
of the field, taking into account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation 
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(c) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase 
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present 
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash-generating 
unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped  
as a single cash-generating unit where the cash inflows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement. Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently 
reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation 
that would have been charged since the impairment.
(d) Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed constitute a business.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a 
business, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field 
interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, 
and the consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production 
assets disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement.
(e) Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed. The amount recognised is the 
present value of the estimated future expenditure. A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised  
as part of the cost of the related oil and gas property. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of  
the production facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with from the start of the 
financial year as an adjustment to the opening provision and the oil and gas property. The unwinding of the discount is 
included as a finance cost.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Inventories
Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Petroleum products and  
under and over lifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively.
Tax
The tax expense/credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable/recoverable and deferred tax movements during  
the year.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill/excess of fair value over cost or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of  
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. The Group 
reassesses its unrecognised deferred tax asset each year taking into account changes in oil and gas prices, the Group’s proven 
and probable reserve profile and forecast capital and operating expenditures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive 
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle  
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than  
the functional currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated  
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Any gain or  
loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain  
or loss in the income statement. Non-monetary assets held at historic cost are translated at the date of purchase and are  
not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing  
on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the  
year. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.  
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Group retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to 
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s 
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered 
fund. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried 
out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.
Royalties
Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised  
as income.
Leasing
Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the 
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the year in which they arise.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are 
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use, i.e. when they are capable of commercial production. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of 
general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general 
borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period  
in which they are incurred.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates, interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently 
carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair 
value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types: fair value hedges are hedges of particular 
risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may 
change the amount or timing of future cash flows; and hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular 
risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity. Currently the Group only has cash flow hedge 
relationships.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability  
of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does 
not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if 
there were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included 
in financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that 
is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income. If the hedging 
relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value 
of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability  
at the time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging 
instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction 
affects net income. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives  
when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at 
fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded derivatives which are closely related  
to host contracts, including in particular price caps and floors within the Group’s oil sales contracts, are not separated and  
are not carried at fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for 
estimated transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques 
such as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and short-term deposits, less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise funds held in term deposit accounts with an original maturity not exceeding three months.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based 
vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 20 on page 156.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2015
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Convertible bonds
The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component 
at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar 
non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned  
to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included  
in equity and is not re-measured. The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative 
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time  
of issue, for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount  
and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of the Group’s significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial 
statements and are considered to be:
• the application of the going concern basis of accounting (basis of preparation section above)
• carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets (note 9 on page 143);
• carrying value of property, plant and equipment (note 10 on page 144);
• proved and probable reserves estimates (note 10 on page 144);
• decommissioning costs (note 17 on page 148); and
• tax and recognition of deferred tax assets (note 19 on page 155).

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 7. Discontinued operations
On 16 November 2015, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Premier Oil Norge AS (‘PONAS’), which held all 
of the Group’s licence interests in Norway, to Det norske oljeselskap ASA. The disposal was completed on 22 December 2015 
on which date control of PONAS passed to the acquiror.
As Norway was a separate operating segment, the results of this operating segment have been classified as a discontinued 
operation and prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly. The results included in the consolidated income 
statement were as follows:

During the year, PONAS paid US$17.0 million (2014: US$68.1 million) in respect of investing activities.
The loss of US$29.2 million on the disposal of PONAS is the amount by which the cash consideration of US$120.0 million received 
exceeded the carrying amount of PONAS’ net assets.

The amounts for intangible E&E assets represent costs incurred on active exploration projects. These amounts are written off 
to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is 
not completed and there are no indications of impairment. Assets written off in the year include costs previously capitalised  
for the Bonneville prospect in the UK (US$21.0 million), Block 2B in Kenya (US$30.9 million) and Iraq (US$20.8 million). The outcome 
of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
The disposal in 2015 is for E&E costs that were held in relation to the Group’s Norway business unit (see note 7 on the previous page).

Notes:
 Finance costs that have been capitalised within oil and gas properties during the year total US$58.8million (2014: US$42.2 million), at a weighted average interest rate  
of 4.4 per cent (2014: 4.4 per cent). Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The 2014 charge for the year has been restated in the income statement for the Norway discontinued operations.
During the year Premier acquired a further 40 per cent interest in the Solan field for nil upfront cash consideration to increase 
the Group’s total interest to 100 per cent. Under the terms of the transaction, the Group has agreed to make three types of 
contingent consideration (royalty) payments to Chrysaor which depend on the future profits that would arise from a 40 per cent 
interest in the Solan field. The terms of each royalty differ and in certain cases include a fixed monetary cap and in other cases 
allow for deductions designed to allow Premier to recover the loan previously advanced to Chrysaor and/or a 40 per cent share 
of the total project capex.
The consideration for the acquisition was US$614.8 million, representing the fair value at the transaction date of the outstanding 
loan balance due from Chrysaor which was waived (US$549.0 million), the fair value of the above contingent consideration due  
to Chrysaor using Premier’s long-term planning assumptions at the date of the transaction (US$56.0 million) and other working 
capital adjustments (US$10.0 million). This contingent consideration is included in long-term provisions at its fair value at  
31 December 2015. The fair value of the contingent consideration has been determined using our long-term corporate 
modelling assumptions consistent with those used for impairment testing purposes, as set out opposite, and has been 
reduced to US$24.1 million at year end (see note 17 on page 148).
During the year the Group completed the disposal of its interests in Block A Aceh in Indonesia and the Scott area in the UK, 
receiving total cash of US$82.7 million.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and 
gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end 
of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a 
number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, 
which are inherently uncertain. Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly 
references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount of reserves  
that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
144 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Impairment
The impairment charge in the current year relates to the Balmoral area (US$5.3 million), Huntington (US$80.5 million),  
Kyle (US$21.6 million) and Solan (US$891.0 million) fields in the UK, the Kadanwari field in Pakistan (US$7.8 million) and the 
Kakap field in Indonesia (US$17.5 million). The impairment charge of US$1,023.7 million was calculated by comparing the 
future discounted pre-tax cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves (the value-in-use) with 
the carrying value of the asset. The future cash flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent 
forward curve in 2016 and 2017 , US$65/bbl in 2018 and US$80/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter and were discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 8 per cent for the UK assets (2014: 10 per cent) and 12.5 per cent for the non-UK assets (2014: 12.5 per cent). 
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production volumes, future 
oil and gas prices, discount rates and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain. The principal 
cause of the impairment charge recognised in the year is a reduction in the short to medium-term oil price assumption being 
used when determining the future discounted cash flows for each field. In addition to the impact of the reduced oil price 
assumption, an increase in the expected decommissioning costs for the Solan field in the first half of 2015 has also driven  
part of the impairment charge, together with an increase in the expected costs to complete the project.
The recoverable amounts of the assets that have been impaired in the year, based on the value-in-use assumptions set  
out above, are: Balmoral area US$10.5 million, Solan US$1,106.9 million, Huntington US$12.4 million, Kyle US$15.0 million, 
Kadanwari US$6.2 million and Kakap US$5.8 million.
Goodwill
Goodwill of US$240.8 million has been specifically assigned to the Catcher field in the UK, which is considered the cash-generating 
unit for the purposes of any impairment testing of this goodwill. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more 
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts are determined from value-in-use 
calculations with the same key assumptions as noted for the impairment calculations above. The discount rate used is 8 per cent 
(2014: 10 per cent). The value-in-use forecast, which is formally approved by management, takes into consideration cash flows 
which are expected to arise during the life of the Catcher field as a whole, currently expected to be around 2030. This period 
exceeds five years but is believed to be appropriate as it is underpinned by estimates of commercial reserves provided by our 
in-house reservoir engineers using industry standard reservoir estimation techniques. The headroom between the recoverable 
amount and the carrying amount, including the goodwill, is US$3.5 million. If the long-term oil price assumption used to 
determine the value-in-use of the Catcher field is reduced from 2017 onwards, the recoverable amount of the Catcher field 
would be below its carrying value, including the goodwill, and would give rise to an impairment loss.
Sensitivity
A 1 per cent increase in the discount rates used when determining the value-in-use for each asset would result in a further 
impairment charge of approximately US$60 million and a US$1/bbl reduction to the oil price for the life of field for each asset 
would trigger an increase in the impairment charge of approximately US$80 million.

In June 2015, Premier received US$100.0 million from FlowStream in return for granting them 15 per cent of production from 
the Solan field until sufficient barrels have been delivered to achieve the rate of return within the agreement. As this is a contract 
to deliver a non-financial item, this has been recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet and will be released to the 
income statement as barrels are delivered to FlowStream following first oil from Solan. Although no barrels have been delivered 
to date, under the terms of the deal, the balance had increased to US$108.5 million by year end, with the resulting charge 
being recorded within finance costs.
The portion of the deferred income that is expected to be delivered to FlowStream within the next 12 months has been 
classified as a current liability.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Financial covenants
Financial covenants are the same across all the Group’s borrowings except for £150.0 million retail bonds and US$245.3 million 
convertible bonds which have no financial covenants. These financial covenants are tested on half-year (annualised) and 
full-year bases.
In August 2015, Premier agreed with its lending group to modify its financial covenants until mid-2017. Under this agreement 
our financial covenants have been modified as follows:
• Net debt/EBITDAX cover ratio increased to 4.75 times until the period ending 31 December 2016 and to 4.5 times for the 
period ending 30 June 2017, before returning to its pre-modified level of 3.0 times for the period ending 31 December 2017.
• Interest cover ratio (EBITDAX to Consolidated Net Interest Payable) reduced to 3.0 times until the period ending 30 June 2017 , 
before returning to its pre-modified level of 4.0 times for the period ending 31 December 2017.
Under the terms of the agreement with our lending group, we are restricted from proposing a dividend to the extent that our 
projections indicate that our financial covenants will be above their pre-modified levels.
The Company has financing in US$, £ and €. The £ and € loans have been swapped into US$ at the transaction dates. In total, 
£250.0 million and €60.0 million have been swapped into US$ using cross currency swap markets at an average exchange rate 
of US$1.64:£1 and US$1.37:€1 respectively. However, all liabilities in currencies other than US$ have been translated at the 
exchange rate prevailing at the year-end.
Convertible bonds
The bonds were issued on 1 November 2012, with a par value of US$245.3 million, exchange price of £4.34 (US$7.00 at fixed 
exchange rate) per share and a coupon of 2.5 per cent. These are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company at any  
time from 11 August 2016 until six days before their maturity date of 27 July 2018. Under the terms, the exchange price is to 
be adjusted on the occurrence of certain events, including any payment of dividends by the Company. The current exchange 
price is £4.21 (US$6.79) per share. The total number of Ordinary Shares to be issued, if all bonds are converted at this adjusted 
exchange price, is 36,117 ,351. If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will 
be redeemed at par value on 27 July 2018. Interest of 2.50 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.

Retail bonds
In December 2013, the Company put in place a £500.0 million Retail eligible Euro Medium Term Notes (‘EMTN’) programme 
under which it has issued £150.0 million UK retail bonds (the bonds). The bonds have been listed on the Official List of the UK 
Listings Authority and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s regulated market and the electronic Order Book 
of Retail Bonds (‘ORB’). The bonds have a fixed coupon of 5 per cent and maturity of seven years.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order  
to support its business and increase shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to  
it in light of changes in economic conditions. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years 
ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.

The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to oil and gas interests in  
the UK, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Mauritania which are expected to be incurred up to 2038. These provisions have 
been created based on Premier’s internal estimates and, where available, operator estimates. Based on the current economic 
environment, assumptions have been made which are believed to be a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future 
liability. These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual 
decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, 
which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend

which are inherently uncertain.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued New provisions and changes in estimates result largely from an increase in decommissioning estimates for the Solan field in

The onerous contract relates to the ongoing FPSO lease commitments for the Group’s interest in the Chinguetti field in 
Mauritania, following the decision to fully impair the related field interest in the prior year.
The contingent consideration is the closing year end fair value of the royalty stream payable to Chrysaor for the acquisition  
of 40 per cent of the Solan asset in May 2015 (see note 10 on page 144). The initial fair value recognised on acquisition was 
US$56.0 million. The change in fair value since the date of acquisition has been recognised as other operating income in the year.
18. Financial instruments
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments (derivatives), comprise accounts payable, 
bank loans, convertible bonds, retail bonds and senior loan notes. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
manage short-term cash flow and to raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme. The Group has various 
financial assets such as accounts receivable, and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is Group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the Group. 
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the Group’s financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, 
cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies, and approved 
by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and 
foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with swaps, collar options, reverse collars and hedges embedded in long-term crude 
offtake agreements. Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options. Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 
180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate 
borrowings within its debt portfolio. However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, 
a substantial portion of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
The Group has £ and € currency exposure as a result of the financial instruments. These are managed through cross currency 
swap arrangements.
As the Group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated, 
significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency (such as Pound Sterling, Norwegian Kroner) 
receipts and expenditures within individual business units. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy 
parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
Fair value hierarchy
In line with IAS 39 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ the Group uses the following hierarchy  
for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable,  
either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable 
market data.

IAS 39 hierarchy.
Commodity price risk
Oil
At 31 December 2015, the Group had 3.7 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged through forward sales for 2016 at an 
average floor price of US$68.3/bbl. The forward sales have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be 
effective, with a fair value movement of US$103.5 million charge (2014: US$224.1 million credit) in retained earnings. 
During the year, forward oil sales contracts for 5.6 million barrels matured generating an income of US$252.1 million (2014: 
US$30.8 million). This income is an addition to sales revenues.
Indonesian gas
At the year-end date, 72,000 mt of HSFO, which drives the Group’s gas pricing in Singapore, is subject to monthly forward 
sales contracts for 2016 at an average price of US$400.0/mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 120,000 mt expired, generating an income of US$26.8 million (2014: income 
of US$15.2 million) which has been included in the sales revenue. All contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and 
were assessed to be effective. In the current and prior year no movement in the fair value of these contracts was credited to the 
income statement relating to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39. The remaining movement, being a charge of 
US$11.0 million (2014: credit US$26.0 million), related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in 
retained earnings.

Commodity contract sensitivity analysis
The key variable which affects the fair value of the Group’s hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity 
prices. The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease in 
this variable:

Interest rate risk
At 31 December 2015 US$800 million (2014: US$300 million and €20.0 million) of the Group’s long-term bank borrowings have 
been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate. Under these interest rate swap contracts, the Group has agreed to exchange the 
difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable 
the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and are assessed as effective. The fair value of interest rate swaps 
at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date. The movement 
in fair values is shown in the table below: 
Asset/(liability)

Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis
The key variable which affects the fair value of the Group’s hedging instruments is market expectations about future interest rates. 
An increase of 50 basis points in this variable would increase the mark-to-market value, and hence other comprehensive 
income, by US$12.1 million.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
151
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 18. Financial instruments continued
A decrease of 50 basis points in this variable is not considered appropriate due to the current very low level of floating interest rates.
Foreign currency exchange risk
The Group has issued £150.0 million retail bonds and £100.0 million term loan at a fixed exchange rate of US$1.64: £1, €25.0 million 
at a fixed rate of US$1.328: €1 and €35.0 million at a fixed rate of US$1.423: €1. 
All of the above have been hedged under cross currency swaps into US dollars.

To cover sterling exposures an amount of £546.3 million was purchased and matured with spot and forward contracts during 
the year (2014: £777.2 million) to cater for its North Sea developments and operations. The Group’s activities are largely 
conducted in US dollars. The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency  
of the assets.
The impact of any reasonably possible variation in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s results would be immaterial.
Other financial instruments
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits. The amount of receivables presented in 
the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2015 and 2014, with the exception  
of a US$61.2 million joint venture loan allowance in 2014 (note 11 on page 145). The Group does not require collateral or  
other security to support receivables from customers or related parties. 
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1 on page 137, whereby the revenue from two customers 
each exceeded 10 per cent of the Group’s consolidated revenue in 2015 (2014: four).

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate  
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking and borrowing 
facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets 
and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has committed borrowing facilities of US$2,347.3 million (2014: US$2,655.8 million) and letter of credit facilities

Notes:
1 The UK deferred petroleum revenue tax relates mainly to temporary differences associated with fixed assets.
2 The overseas deferred tax relates mainly to temporary differences associated with fixed asset balances.  
The Group’s deferred tax assets at 31 December 2015 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise 
in the future against which tax losses and allowances in the UK can be utilised. In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 – 
‘Income Taxes’, the Group re-assessed its deferred tax assets at 31 December 2015 with respect to ring fence tax losses and 
allowances. The corporate model used to assess the extent to which it is appropriate to recognise the Group’s UK tax losses  
as deferred assets was re-run, using an oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in 2016 and 2017, US$65/bbl in 2018 
followed by US$80/bbl ‘real’ terms thereafter. The results of the corporate model demonstrated that it was appropriate not  
to recognise a deferred tax asset on US$1.1 billion (2014: US$96.0 million) of the Group’s UK ring fence corporate tax losses at  
31 December 2015 based on expected future profitability. The increase in the unrecognised loss amount results in a deferred tax 
charge of US$95.4 million for the year in respect of losses and allowances that were previously recognised as a deferred tax asset.
Premier Oil plc // 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements
155
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 19. Deferred tax continued
In addition to the above, there are carried forward non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$303.5 million  
(2014: US$263.1 million) and current year non-UK tax losses of approximately US$18.4 million (2014: US$40.8 million)  
for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised. 
None of the UK tax losses (ring fence and non-ring fence) have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes. 
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation 
in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions are satisfied. 
During the period the rate of supplementary tax charge on UK ring fence profits was reduced from 32 per cent to 20 per cent 
with effect from 1 January 2015. Deferred tax balances at 31 December 2015 have been recognised at the reduced rate and 
a deferred tax charge of US$167.1 million has been recognised in the income statement to reflect the decrease in the opening 
deferred tax assets at 1 January 2015. Legislation was also enacted in the period that will reduce the rate of petroleum revenue 
tax from 50 per cent to 35 per cent from 1 January 2016, and a credit of US$3.3 million has been recognised in the income 
statement as a result of the reduction in the deferred petroleum revenue tax liability recognised at 31 December 2015.

transactions is US$23.0 million (2014: US$23.3 million). A credit of US$23.0 million has been recorded in retained earnings 
(2014: US$23.3 million) for all equity-settled payments of the Group. Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is 
processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within 
the Group. Part of this cost is therefore recharged to the relevant subsidiary undertaking where it is capitalised as directly 
attributable to capital projects, or is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or 
general and administration costs.

156 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below:
(i) Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates 
all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise 
three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance 
period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing 
at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the 
Performance Share Awards. The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: 
Volatility: 34% to 41%
Risk free rate of interest: 1.0% to 2.6%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.30 to 0.35
(ii) Share Incentive Plan
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares. If an employee 
agrees to buy partnership shares the Company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award 
of shares (matching shares), on a one-for-one basis.
(iii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join 
the scheme. Employees can save up to a maximum of £500 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or 
five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

remaining contractual life of 3.63 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and

Funded pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan 
(the ‘Scheme’). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997 
and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the payment 
of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent 
actuary. The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Scheme’s assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present 
employees. The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The appointment 
of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out 
of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method. This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the balance sheet. 
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for 
projected earnings.

Projected components of pension expense for year to 31 December 2016
The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the IAS 19 figures for the next year 
with confidence. The following projections should therefore be treated with caution. Assumptions implicit in the following 
projections are:
• the return on assets from 31 December 2015 is 3.7 per cent per annum;
• contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2016 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place 
at the date of signing this report; and
• there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 24. Group pension schemes continued
Unfunded pensions
In Indonesia, the Group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour Agreement 
with the local workforce. This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the Group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in the UK in regard to which annual increases and  
a reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme. On the same actuarial basis 
as used to assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2015 of the future payments projected  
to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.7 million (2014: US$0.9 million).
Defined contribution benefit scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the 
retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions. Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as  
an expense as they fall due. The total cost charged to income of US$9.8 million (2014: US$9.6 million) represents contributions 
payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.

166 COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
As at 31 December 2015 1. Significant accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company 
meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (‘FRS 100’) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2015 the Company has changed its accounting framework 
from UK GAAP to FRS 101 as issued by the Financial Reporting Council and has, in doing so, applied the requirements of IFRS 
1.6 – 33 and related appendices. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’. The prior year financial statements were re-stated for material adjustments on adoption of FRS 101 in 
the current year. For more information see note 11 on page 169.
In addition, the Company has chosen to early adopt the new Accounting Regulations effected into UK Company law in April 
2015 via the implementation of the EU Accounting Directive.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in 
relation to accounting standards issued but not yet effective or implemented, share-based payment information, financial 
instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a 
cash-flow statement and certain related party transactions.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern 
assumption is provided in the Financial Review on page 54.
Where required, the equivalent disclosures are given in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Key sources of 
estimation uncertainty disclosure are provided in the Accounting Policies and in relevant notes to the Group consolidated 
financial statements as applicable. Details of the Company’s share-based payment schemes are provided in note 20 of the 
Group consolidated financial statements on page 156.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the remeasurement of certain financial 
instruments to fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out on pages 124 to 131 to the 
Group consolidated financial statements except as noted below:
• Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss 
account for the year. The Company reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 of US$20.5 million  
(2014: US$14.6 million).
Other comprehensive expense for the year was US$2.6 million (2014: US$6.0 million income).

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION EUAD – Basis of preparation
The Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations  
(‘UK Regulations’) came into force on 1 December 2014 and 
require UK companies in the extractive sector to publicly disclose 
payments made to governments in the countries where they 
undertake extractive operations. The aim of the regulations is 
to enhance the transparency of the payments made by companies 
in the extractive sector to host governments in the form of  
taxes, bonuses, royalties, fees and support for infrastructure 
improvements. The regulations implement Chapter 10 of EU 
Accounting Directive (2013/34/EU) (‘EU Directive’).
The UK Regulations have an effective date of 1 January 2015, 
and this section of the Annual Report is in line with the EU 
Directive and the UK Regulations. This basis of preparation 
provides an explanation of the payments that we are disclosing. 
The payments disclosed are based on where the obligation 
for the payment arose: Payments levied at a project level 
have been disclosed at a project level and payments levied  
at a corporate level have been disclosed on that basis. 
Within the UK Regulations, a project is defined as being  
the operational activities which are governed by a single 
contract, licence, lease, concession or a similar legal 
agreement. Premier undertakes extractive activities in 
different types of fiscal petroleum regimes and therefore  
the types of payments disclosed vary from country to 
country. For the purposes of our reporting, for the UK  
and Pakistan we have classified each individual concession/
licence as a project, whereas for Indonesia and Vietnam  
each PSC arrangement has been classified as a project. 
All of the payments disclosed in accordance with the  
EU Directive have been made to National Governments, 
either directly or through a Ministry or Department,  
or to a national oil company, who have a working interest  
in a particular licence. For projects where we are the operator 
we have disclosed the full payment made on behalf of the 
project; where we have a non-operated interest we have not 
disclosed payments made on our behalf by another party.
In line with the UK Regulations, where a payment or a series 
of related payments do not exceed US$134,160 (£86,000), 
they have not been disclosed. Where the aggregate payments 
made in the period for a project or country are less than 
US$134,160 we have not disclosed the payments made for  
this project or country.
Our total economic contribution to all stakeholders can be 
found on page 65 of the Annual Report. 
Reporting currency – Payments disclosed in this report have 
been disclosed in US Dollars, consistent with the rest of the 
2015 Annual Report. Where actual payments have been made 
in a currency other than US Dollars, they have been translated 
using the prevailing exchange rate when the payment was made.
Production entitlements in barrels – includes non-cash 
royalties and state non-participating interest paid in barrels  
of oil or gas out of the Group’s working interest share of 
production in a licence. The figures disclosed are on a cash 
paid liftings basis. 
Income taxes – This represents cash tax calculated on the 
basis of profits including income or capital gains and taxes  
on production such as Petroleum Revenue Tax (‘PRT’). Income 
taxes are usually reflected in corporate income tax returns. 
The cash payment of income taxes occurs in the year in which 
the tax has arisen or up to one year later. Income taxes also 
include any cash tax rebate received from the government  
or revenue authority during the year. Income taxes do not 
include fines and penalties. In accordance with the UK 
Regulations, payments made in relation to sales, employee, 
environmental or withholding taxes have not been disclosed.
Dividends – This includes dividends that are paid in lieu of  
a production entitlement or royalty. It does not include any 
dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder.
Royalties – This represents cash royalties paid to 
governments during the year for the extraction of oil or gas. 
The terms of the royalties are described within our PSCs and 
can vary from project to project within one country. Export 
duties paid in kind have been recognised within the royalties 
category. The cash payment of royalties occurs in the year in 
which the tax has arisen.
Bonus payments – This represents any bonus paid to 
governments during the year, usually as a result of achieving 
certain milestones, such as a signature, discovery or 
production bonuses.
Licence fees – This represents licence fees, rental fees, entry 
fees and other consideration for licences and/or concessions 
paid for access to an area during the year (with the exception of 
signature bonuses which are captured within bonus payments).
Infrastructure improvement payments – This represents 
payments made in respect of infrastructure improvements for 
projects that are not directly related to oil and gas activities 
during the year. This can be a contractually obligated payment  
in a PSC or a discretionary payment for building/improving 
local infrastructure such as roads, bridges and ports.

The Group provides for amortisation of costs relating to evaluated properties based on direct interests on an entitlement 
basis, which incorporates the terms of the PSCs in Indonesia, Vietnam and Mauritania. On an entitlement basis reserves were 
315.5 mmboe as at 31 December 2015 (2014: 218.1 mmboe). This was calculated at year-end 2015 using an oil price 
assumption equal to US$42/bbl in 2016, US$48.5/bbl in 2017, US$65/bbl in 2018 and US$80/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter 
(2014: Dated Brent, 2015: US$61.5/bbl, 2016: US$69/bbl and US$85/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter).

Share portal
As a shareholder you have direct access to an online share portal 
operated by Capita Asset Services at www.premier-oil-shares.com. 
You can access the share portal with your Investor Code (‘IVC’) 
which can be found on your share certificate. The portal provides 
a range of services, free of charge, to help you to administer 
your shareholding quickly and efficiently by allowing you to:
• check your share balance;
• change your address details;
• choose to receive electronic shareholder communications;
• set up or amend a dividend mandate so dividends can  
be paid directly to your bank account; and
• buy and sell Premier Oil plc shares using the dealing 
service operated by Capita Deal.
Dividends
Dividend history
Details of dividend payments made are included within  
the shareholder information section of the Investors area  
of the Premier website: www.premier-oil.com.
Tax on dividends up to April 2016
For any dividends paid up to April 2016, shareholders would 
have received a tax voucher showing a 10 per cent ‘tax credit’ 
representing the tax that has already been paid by the 
Company on profits generated. This 10 per cent tax credit 
can be offset against any UK income tax due on dividend 
income. For more information on the UK dividend tax credit, 
please visit the HMRC website: www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends.
Tax on dividends from April 2016
From 6 April 2016 the dividend ‘tax credit’ will be replaced  
by a new ‘dividend allowance’ in the form of a 0 per cent  
tax rate on the first £5,000 of dividend income per year. 
UK residents will pay tax on any dividends received over the 
£5,000 allowance at the following rates:
• 7.5 per cent on dividend income within the basic rate band; 
• 32.5 per cent on dividend income within the higher rate band;
• 38.1 per cent on dividend income within the additional  
rate band.
Dividends received on shares held in an Individual Savings 
Account (‘ISA’) will continue to be tax free.
E-communications
Shareholders have the option to receive communications 
including annual reports and notices of meetings 
electronically. For every shareholder that actively registers  
their email address online, Premier Oil plc has pledged to 
donate £1 to Pure Leapfrog’s carbon offsetting programme 
which supports carbon reduction projects in Africa, India  
and other developing countries (www.pureleapfrog.org).  
To register for this service, please visit the share portal:  
www.premier-oil-shares.com. You will need your Investor 
Code (‘IVC’) which can be found on your share certificate. 
Once registered, Premier Oil plc will communicate with  
you via email rather than post.
Shareholder security
Shareholders are advised to be cautious about any unsolicited 
financial advice, including offers to buy Premier shares at inflated 
prices, or offers of free reports about Premier. More information 
can be found at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams and in the 
Shareholder Information section of the Investors area of the 
Company website: www.premier-oil.com.
American Depositary Receipt programme
Premier Oil plc has a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt (‘ADR’) programme which BNY Mellon administers 
and for which it acts as Depositary. Each ADR represents one 
Ordinary Share of the Company. The ADRs trade on the US 
over-the-counter market under the symbol PMOIY. When 
dividends are paid to shareholders, the Depositary converts 
such dividends into US dollars, net of fees and expenses, and 
distributes the net amount to ADR holders.
Registered Depositary Receipt holders can trade, access 
account balances and transaction history, find answers to 
frequently asked questions and download commonly needed 
forms online at www.adrbnymellon.com. To speak directly  
to a BNY Mellon representative, please call 1-888-BNY-ADRS 
(1-888-269-2377) if you are calling from within the United 
States. If you are calling from outside the United States, 
please call 001-201-680-6825. You may also send an email 
inquiry to shrrelations@cpushareownerservices.com or visit

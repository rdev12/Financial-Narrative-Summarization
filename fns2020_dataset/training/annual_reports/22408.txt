fairly I would hope that we will be one of the survivors as many parts
of our industry are restructured.”

USA
Our second office was established
near Philadelphia in the United
States in 1995 to better service the
growing client base in North
America and to enable us to
provide investment management
from the Americas time zone.
Dubai
In 2008, we opened our fourth
office, in Dubai. The office is in
a prime location in the Dubai
International Financial Centre
and allows us to access investment
opportunities in the region as
well as to increase the Group’s
visibility with funds in the area.
Singapore
The third office, to cover 
Far East emerging markets in real
time, opened in central Singapore
in 2000, thus positioning the
Group to cover our worldwide
target investment markets 24
hours a day.
At a glance The emerging markets in
which the Group
principally invests declined
significantly during the
year ended 31st May 2009
but have staged a
substantial recovery in the
period since. I am pleased
to report that our
investment performance
was resilient during the
last financial year as our
markets fell, but also has
provided clients with
outperformance of
benchmarks during their
recent recovery.
From the end of May 2008 to the end of
May 2009, the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index (MXEF) fell by 36%. Our funds
under management (FuM) declined by
26% over the same period to end the
year at US$3.5 billion, or £2.2 billion,
(2008: US$4.7 billion or £2.4 billion).
Since our year end, the MXEF has risen
by 9% to the end of August while City
of London’s FuM have increased by 13%
to US$4.0 billion, or £2.4 billion.
The period end comparisons to MXEF
mask considerable volatility in emerging
markets during the year with the index at
the end of May 2009 being some 70%
above the lows in October 2008. Volatility
is not new to us, and our investment
model has been honed over our history
in an attempt to provide clients with
outperformance against benchmarks in
both falling and rising markets. Indeed,
during the almost unprecedented volatility
of emerging markets over the last two
years, the Group has added significant
new FuM from both existing and new
clients as recognition of the virtues of
our approach has increased.
Results
Fee income, predominantly US dollar
denominated, for the year to 31st May
2009 fell by 19% to £20.2 million
(2008: £24.9 million) reflecting the
significantly lower FuM resulting from
the falls in emerging markets during the
second and third quarters but benefitting
from the relative weakness of sterling
during most of the period. 
Profit before profit share, interest and
similar income, impairment charges and
tax declined by 41% to £8.6 million
(2008: £14.5 million). Pre-tax profit
declined by almost 50% to £5.4 million
(2008: £10.7 million), after £2.8 million
of profit related staff payments (2008:
£4.7 million), reduced interest receivable
of £0.1 million (2008: £0.4 million) and
a £0.2 million loss on liquidation of seed
investments (2008: gain of £0.4 million).
After a reduced tax charge of £1.5
million, representing 29% of pre-tax
profits (2008: £3.6 million representing
33% of pre-tax profits), basic earnings
per share were 16.1p (2008: 29.3p), a
decline of 45%. Diluted earnings per
share were 15.0p (2008: 26.0p).
The Group ended its financial year with
cash balances of £4.7 million (2008: £5.5
million) and no borrowings (2008: same).
Dividends
Shareholders will be aware that City of
London’s dividend policy is based on
paying dividends that are covered
approximately one and a half times by
full year earnings per share. Although the
Board has no plans to change this policy,
a temporary reduction in earnings cover
has been applied this year in determining
the level of dividends. This is a reflection
of the exceptional market conditions, our
expected strong cash position and the
recovery in our markets and FuM since
our year end. As a consequence, the
Board is recommending a final dividend
of 10p per share (2008: 13.5p), making 
a total for the year of 15p (2008: 19.5p),
covered 1.06 times by earnings per share
(2008: 1.50 times). The final dividend
will be paid on 20th November 2009 
to shareholders on the register on 
30th October 2009.
Operational highlights
The Group took the decline in the
markets as an opportunity and
maintained its focus on organic growth,
both in terms of new products and
geographical expansion of the client base.
We made good progress on both fronts.
In the US, we received our first mandate
– of some US$100 million - to invest in
developed markets via closed end funds
and recruited a fund manager to support
Chairman’s statement
4 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 5
this new product area. In the UK, shortly
after the year end on 1st July, we launched
the Asian Value & Growth fund (a spoke
of the World Markets Umbrella Fund),
which will invest directly in equities in
Emerging Asia. Again, a senior fund
manager specialising in Asian investment
was appointed to provide the necessary
expertise for this product, which is
currently being marketed to UK
institutional investors before roll-out, once
a track record has been established, to the
Group’s client base in North America.
Towards the end of 2008 a marketing
manager was appointed to implement
our decision to bring our US marketing
in-house, and ultimately therefore to
avoid the commissions which we have
historically paid to North Bridge Capital
who have served us well since we started
the US marketing activity. He will be
responsible for developing direct
relationships with the consultant industry
which advises institutional investors.
These developments are reported in 
more detail in the Chief Executive
Officer’s review.
Outlook
From the lows recorded following the
collapse of Lehman Brothers in
September 2008, emerging markets
recovered strongly to our financial year
end. The recovery has continued into our
new financial year as investors recognised
that the prospects for many emerging
markets are better, in both the short and
longer term, than those for developed
economies. This is not to say that we
believe there will be no further volatility
but we anticipate that the very
pronounced troughs and peaks of the
last year will be moderated.
The comparative attractions of emerging
markets for our core institutional clients
has led, and is still leading, to the
commitment of new money to the asset
class as evidenced by the outstanding
commitments to be funded in excess of
US$500 million, which will benefit FuM
in the current year. In addition, investors
are becoming receptive to increased
weightings in the natural resource sector
following the protracted period when
they were out of favour.
We plan to take advantage of these
trends by continuing to diversify our
product offering with an increased focus
on natural resources and the launch of
both the Asia Value & Growth fund
(investing directly in Asian equities 
ex-Japan) and the Emerging Markets
Value & Growth fund (also investing
directly in equities). Additionally, as
noted above, we have been mandated to
manage a new global closed end funds
account. We believe that this leveraging
of our expertise in emerging markets and
in closed end funds represents a risk-
managed route to enhancing the quality
and stability of the Group’s earnings 
and is a strategy which plays to our
proven strengths. 
Andrew Davison
Chairman
10th September 2009 At City of London, we focus not on gathering assets, but 
on building products that reflect our expertise. Initially, and
for many years since the firm was founded, that expertise
was very specific to closed end funds which offered emerging
markets exposure. 
This was subsequently complemented by research into the underlying equities,
both via natural resources and via country specific emerging markets stocks,
which in turn spawned regional and global emerging market equity funds. Most
recently, we have applied our unrivalled knowledge of closed end funds around
the world to the development of a global (ex US) closed end fund product.
So today, while we remain both proud and protective of our “boutique” status,
we offer a range of products which are defined by the twin pillars of our
expertise: emerging markets, and closed end funds.
6 City of London Investment Group Plc  Annual Report 2009 Expertise
City of London Investment Group Plc  Annual Report 2009 7 Chief Executive Officer’s review
Extreme emotional behaviour 
I have reproduced on the left a paragraph
from my review at the time of our
Interim Report, not just because the
markets have appreciated significantly
from then, but rather to demonstrate yet
again the extreme emotional behaviour
demonstrated by our asset class.
Placed in context, from the low of 450
in October 2008 the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF) rose 75%,
virtually uninterrupted over the next
seven months. You will recall that this
was around the time of some of the
initial references to “green shoots” in
May, which coincided with our year end. 
Since the end of May, MXEF rose to
around 870 in August, an increase of just
over 90% from the low.
Our FuM have appreciated similarly,
from US$1.95 billion in October 2008,
doubling to just over US$4 billion at the
beginning of August. However to
compare like with like, and to measure
the actual progress that we are making, 
I would suggest using straight index
tracking which would mean that we would
be managing US$5.4 billion if we returned
to the high that the index achieved in
October 2007, at which time we were in
fact managing US$4.95 billion. This figure
of “index-adjusted” FuM excludes monies
won via new mandates as yet unfunded
that are referenced under the “New
mandates” heading later in this statement.
Returning to the theme of “extreme
emotional behaviour”, what should
happen over the next few months based
upon precedent is that our asset class
should now take a breather for quite
some time. After the rises of 1999 and
2003 it took at least a year before further
highs were established, and whilst I’m
not suggesting that the circumstances are
similar this time around, the emotional
behaviour of participants within our
asset class will in my opinion be
similarly demonstrated. The index will
have increased in value too far too 
fast and there will be some time taken
for reflection prior to any further
significant advance.
Since the low last October, we have
been focusing our business with two
objectives in mind:
1. Diversification
We have established that our
shareholders, our staff and, I would
suggest, our clients do not like our asset
class’ volatility. Volatility equates to risk
and risk leads to insecurity. Whilst our
shareholders understand both what we
do and how we attempt to mitigate risk,
our staff, even in a year when we
outperform our benchmarks, potentially
receive significantly smaller bonuses. By
diversifying our business, employees, and
in particular our investment management
staff, will benefit in the same manner as
shareholders, and so interests are aligned.
In this regard therefore, we have been
attempting to diversify our business in a
number of ways, some of which have been,
very unusually, successful in the short
term, while other initiatives are taking us
longer to deliver. A recent success has been
the winning of a substantial mandate that
is to be invested in the MSCI All Country
World Index (ACWI) ex US. This is a
Closed End Fund mandate and is
becoming a significant area of focus for us
using the well established volatility of
Closed End Fund pricing as the major
source of alpha generation.
Other areas of diversification involving
our Emerging Markets Closed End
Fund business include the Emerging
Markets Plus Fund which allows us
opportunistically to invest in Developed
Markets when the Emerging Markets are
considered to be too high or when the
Developed Markets are attractively
priced. That Fund, which when initially
funded at the end of March 2009 had
8 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009
“In my opinion, without
additional new bad news, 
if this market follows its
predecessors, MXEF in
2009 will have appreciated
between 50% and 75%
before there is the first 
sign of good news. This 
is what occurred in 1999
and 2003 after similar falls
under similar emotional
circumstances in our 
asset class.”
Extract from CEO review –

assets of US$17 million, is now US$43
million (end August) after an additional
subscription of US$23 million and then
a rebalancing redemption of US$10
million at the end of June.
Our Equities (as compared to Closed
End Funds) Group has also developed.
We recently added both an Asia Value
and Growth spoke to The World Markets
Umbrella Fund (our Dublin based
mutual fund) and created a new
Delaware Statutory T rust called
Emerging Markets Value and Growth,
with the intention of marketing these
funds to institutional investors after they
have established first or second quartile
performance track records.
2. Employees
As referenced in the Interim Report we
have not made any of our staff redundant
during the difficult market conditions of
the past year or so. This is for two reasons
with which you are familiar:
(i) We run a low cost business. We do 
not spend what we consider to be
shareholders’ money unnecessarily. Our
offices are by no means the most fancy,
and when we travel we do not stay in
expensive hotels or use corporate jets!
Neither are we great entertainers, believing
that good investment performance is what
counts as an aid to winning mandates.
(ii)Our business model is (particularly as
our asset class is risky) as risk averse as
possible. We do not agree with very long
term plans, knowing that markets (as we
have just witnessed) can derail them. Also
we do not overstaff. We attempt to use
staff flexibly, increasing the head count
only when we are sure that in so doing
we would not potentially create a
position only to find that we were then
forced to reconsider due to changed
market circumstances.
Obviously we are fortunate in this regard
as we still remain small. I expect that as
we grow some of these values will be
compromised, but to the extent that we
can be careful with the allocation of our
human resources, I would suggest that
this should be for the benefit of our
shareholders, our clients, and ultimately
our staff.
However, having just implied that we do
not take any risks, we have in fact taken
on a number of experienced staff to fill
certain specialist positions in support of
our diversification plans. In this regard
we were taking on staff at a point when
other fund managers were letting staff go
for whatever reason.
The areas involved (all of which are areas
of diversification) are as follows:
Asian Equities, Developed Closed End
Funds, Absolute Return, US Marketing,
Asia Marketing.
Asian Equities, Developed Closed End
Funds and Absolute Return are all
product specific. However US
Marketing, as referenced in the Interim
CEO Review is a new position created as
a result of the end of our agreement with
North Bridge Capital, who have been our
third party marketing provider for many
years. This agreement ends in October
and we decided well over a year ago to
make an internal appointment that
would enable us to benefit and keep
100% of the new fees generated from 
US assets going forward subsequent to
October. There is one exception to this:
one consultant relationship has been left
with North Bridge Capital for one
further year.
In addition, we have made an
appointment in our Singapore office 
to explore marketing opportunities in
Asia. We hope that as we diversify our
business further we will be able to
continue to develop our business in Asia
potentially with new products from our
Equities group.  10 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009

Investments
We now hold positions in three CLIM
Funds. These positions have been taken to
facilitate the development of a performance
record in each of these areas. In each case,
at the point that the requisite record has
been established these investments will be
reduced and ultimately liquidated. In the
case of the Global Equity Fund these assets
have been reallocated to the newly-
launched funds. As can be seen below
these investments total US$3.543 million
as of the end of July.

Exercise of options
In my Interim Review I gave notice that 
I would be intending to exercise an option
over 189,000 shares at 29p prior to its
expiry in May this year, and would be
intending subject to market conditions to
simultaneously sell around half of the
resulting shares that I purchased. However,
as a result of changed market conditions 
I took up the entire position and have no
present plans for disposing of any shares.
Market volatility 
Last year I made the point that we had
dealt with a lot of volatility, in fact this
financial year just finished was even worse.
For information I have reprinted last year’s
graph and show it above this year’s.
New mandates
As referenced earlier we have been successful
in winning a number of new mandates. As
of the end of August these were in excess of
US$500 million. We expect these mandates
to be funded over the next few months.

The financial services industry
I really had hoped that our industry had
learnt some lessons as a result of what had
happened over the past few years, but
unfortunately already the signs are not
good in this regard. In many instances (yet
again) the rewards paid to staff seem to be
out of all proportion to the gains left over
for shareholders. In the US it seems that
there is still a need to legislate away
structural weaknesses with more and more
time consuming and expensive regulation. 
I had hoped that the managements of the
companies that have demonstrated some
of the worst excesses would have been
held accountable by shareholders and
thus would not have survived. But in the
event this has not, at least at the present
time, occurred. 
I fear that what will in fact happen is that
when the wake up call arrives the
restructuring of our industry will be
significantly broader and will leave
significantly more scars than anyone could
at present foresee. In my opinion the
barriers to entry within many areas of the
financial service industry are not high and
it is inevitable that what are now
considered very well capitalised emerging
market banks and other institutions will
assume a significant role within this
industry over the next few years. It can be
seen that there are many precedents for
what I am suggesting. You just have to
look around the changing competitive
landscape for other consumer products
around the world (separate from financial
service products) to see the potential.
For our part we are determined to
continue to run a competitive business
that avoids many of the structural
weaknesses demonstrated by our peers.
In my opinion, what we should be
attempting to do is to reward clients
(who pay the bills) with superior returns,
our shareholders (who own the business)
with significant dividends and capital
growth, and our employees (who manage
the business) with relative security and
participation in the firm’s success. If we
can continue to achieve these three goals
relatively fairly I would hope that we will
be one of the survivors as many parts of
our industry are restructured.
Retirement plans
At the end of this year I will be 65, and
subject to approval from the board and also
from my colleagues and from shareholders,
I would like to stay on in my present
position until I am 70, and then to retire.
The exact date of my retirement could
obviously be managed to suit all parties.
Over the next few years I will gradually be
delegating certain responsibilities to ensure
a smooth handover.
CLIG employees
I would again like to thank staff for their
support and hard work in what has
continued to be a volatile and testing
environment.

We have always strived to develop and nurture an investment
process which does not rely on ‘star’ fund managers, but
rather upon a series of analytical procedures that can produce
repeatable and sustainable first or second quartile
performance versus our peers.
Our process employs an array of proprietary tools for analysing and identifying
value. These quantitative tools supplement both macroeconomic analysis and
the trading expertise that has been developed over a period of nearly 20 years. 
Whether it is taking advantage of discount anomalies in closed end funds, or
company specific valuation in our equity business, through three full market
cycles in Emerging Markets, the process has delivered consistent relative

Financial review
Consolidated income statement
The financial year 2008-9 comprised
four very different quarters, so far as
profit was concerned. The year opened
strongly on the back of funds under
management (FuM) of US$4.7 billion
and, despite some significant market
erosion, averaged US$4.2 billion across
the first three month ends. This relative
stability ended suddenly in the quarter to
end November 2008, as stock markets
around the world fell precipitately,
causing our monthly average FuM for
the quarter to decline to US$2.6 billion.
At the mid-year point FuM stood at a
disappointing US$2.1 billion. The
recovery from the low point began slowly
during the third quarter as monthly
average FuM rose to US$2.3 billion, 
and accelerated in the final quarter of 
the year as global markets rose rapidly, 
with emerging markets leading the way.
Average monthly FuM for the fourth
quarter was slightly over US$3 billion
and the year end position was US$3.5
billion. In percentage terms, from the
start point of US$4.7 billion FuM fell by
60% during the first half year, and then
rose by 80% to the year end figure. Some
of that recovery was the result of new
money, but nevertheless the figures are
indicative of a level of volatility which
was perhaps without precedent. 
Unsurprisingly, given this background,
fee income and therefore profitability
was healthy in the first and fourth
quarters but significantly impaired in
the second and third quarters. Overall,
for the year as a whole, fee income
was £20.2 million (2008: £24.9 million)
and while the year on year reduction
was as unforeseen as it was marked,
the fact that the year closed relatively
strongly provided a considerable
degree of comfort. The Group’s FuM
and income in sterling terms was
smoothed by the 18% decline in the
sterling/dollar exchange rate – in
sterling the starting and ending
FuM for the year were £2.4 billion and
£2.2 billion respectively.
Administrative expenses were reduced but,
net of the inflationary impact of the fall in
the £/US$ exchange rate, that reduction
was only marginal, from £15.0 million to
£14.5 million. Variable costs – commission
paid on fees plus the profit-share pool –
fell back and as a result the overhead
component of total administrative costs
rose from 45% to 60%. The increase was
principally attributable to people costs and
systems, natural enough given that these
two make up 75% of the fixed cost base
(2008: 74%). Although reflecting an
increase in headcount from 52 to 58 and
some investment in systems (and in
particular in the adoption of the Charles
River front office system), in reality by
far the most significant driver of the
higher costs was the weakness of sterling,
not just as it related to our US office costs
but also, although less materially, as it
related to the costs of the Singapore and
Dubai offices.
In the half year results we took a write
down of £0.7 million against our seed
investments, reflecting a fall in value
from original investment. As markets
recovered during the second half, the
charge to the income statement for the
full year was reduced to £0.4 million
(coincidentally almost precisely matching
the gain of £0.5 million taken to profit
in the preceding two years).
Pre-tax profit of £5.4 million represents 
a fraction over 50% of the previous 
year’s £10.7 million. The tax charge is
equivalent to 28.6% of pre-tax profits
(2008: 33.3%) with the change
resulting from the reduction in the
UK corporation tax rate to 28%, the
changing mix of business as apportioned
under the Group’s transfer pricing policy
and a small write back of tax accrued 
in prior years. Profit after tax was 
£3.8 million (2008: £7.1 million).

Consolidated balance sheet 
and statement of changes in 
shareholders’ equity
Dividends paid to shareholders during
the year totalled £4.4 million, being 
£3.2 million for the 13.5p final dividend
for 2007/8 and £1.2 million for the
current year’s interim dividend of 5p per
share. The equivalent numbers for the
previous year were £1.7 million (7p) final
and £1.5 million (6p) interim, making 
a total of £3.2 million. None of the 
other components of the change in
shareholders’ equity impact cash in the
current period. The revaluation reserve,
reflecting the valuation of seed
investments, was effectively eliminated
during the year as value declined by 
£0.4 million, reversing the prior year
upward revaluation of £0.5 million. 
The share option reserve was reduced to 
£1.8 million (2008: £3.5 million) based
upon the effect on deferred tax of the
change in price of the Group’s shares,
which stood at £2.285 at 31st May 2009
(31st May 2008: £3.35). Also with 
respect to share options, a receivable of
£1.2 million has been recorded to reflect
the anticipated recovery of corporation
taxes in both the UK and the US in
respect of share option exercises during
the four years ending in May 2009, as
the corporation tax filings had not
hitherto acknowledged the deduction
available against taxable profits. The net
effect of these movements, together 
with the share-based payment charge of 
£0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million), was 
to reduce total equity from £9.8 million
to £8.7 million.
Cash remains the major part of net
assets: £4.7 million representing 54% 
of the total (2008: £5.5 million; 56%). 
The reduction in cash reflects the excess
of the net cash used in financing activities
at £4.1 million (2008: £9.0 million) over
the net cash generated from operating
activities of £3.3 million (2008: £7.4
million). Current and deferred taxes
represent receivables of £2.2 million
(2008: £1.5 million), including the
reclaim of £1.2 million of prior year
taxes as noted above. Investments in
property and equipment and in financial
assets total £1.3 million (2008: £2.2
million), and the balance of the total net
assets of £8.7 million (2008: £9.8
million) is represented by net trade
receivables/payables at £0.5 million
(2008: £0.5 million).
Currency exposure
The strength or weakness of sterling
relative to the US dollar has, and most
likely always will have, a significant
influence on reported earnings, as the
Group’s income is derived almost entirely
in US dollars, whereas close to half of its
expenses are incurred in sterling. As
observed many times before, there is an
inbuilt natural hedge, as US dollar fee
income will tend to rise as the dollar
weakens and fall as the dollar strengthens,
assuming that the weakness/strength is
reflected in the dollar’s value relative to
the currencies that underlie the funds
under management. Ultimately, in effect,
it is the value of sterling relative to those
underlying currencies that feeds through
to earnings. Nevertheless it is helpful to
consider the table below, which illustrates
the impact on post tax profits of moves in
the dollar/sterling rate, ceteris paribus:
FuM – US$bn
3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5
US$/£ Post-tax, £m
1.55 4.2 5.5 6.9 8.2
1.60 4.0 5.3 6.6 7.9
1.65 3.8 5.1 6.4 7.6
1.70 3.6 4.9 6.1 7.3
1.75 3.5 4.7 5.9 7.1
Assumes:
1. Average net fee 87 basis points
2. Annual operating costs £4.0 million
plus US$6.5 million
3. Profit-share 30%
4. Average tax of 31%
The table illustrates annualised profits –
for example at constant FuM of 
US$4.0 billion, and at a constant
exchange rate of 1.65, post-tax earnings
might be expected to be around £6.4
million, whereas the same level of FuM
would generate £6.9 million post-tax at
an exchange rate of 1.55.
While the Group does not aim to lock in
the sterling value of future revenues by
hedging, a portion of anticipated income
is sold forward principally as a mechanism
to hedge the long dollar position in the
balance sheet (i.e. essentially accrued 
fees plus certain of the seed investments). 
At 31st May these forward sales amounted
to US$3.6 million at an average rate of
1.7694 (2008: US$6.2 million at an
average rate of 1.9716).
Share options
As at 31st May 2009 there were
3,135,022 options on ordinary shares
outstanding (2008: 3,958,310). Of those
outstanding options, 1,262,375 (2008:
1,458,310) relate to shares held by the
Employee Share Option T rust, and the
balance of 1,872,647 (2008: 2,500,000)
relate to new shares that would be issued
at exercise. The reduction in the number
of dilutive options reflects the exercise 
of 621,103 options, which increased
shareholders’ equity by £0.3 million, and
the lapse of 6,250 options. At the period
end dilutive share options therefore
represent 7.2% (2008: 9.9%) of issued
share capital.

Client service
16 City of London Investment Group Plc  Annual Report 2009 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2008 17
Our clients are our business. If performance is our 
first priority, then client service is a close second. 
We understand that a “one size fits all” approach is 
not appropriate. 
Our aim is to be open and accessible to each and every client, and while
we have a designated client service team we also expect and encourage our
institutional clients to enjoy direct contact with fund managers and other
key individuals within the investment management team.
We acknowledge that our industry has faced some difficult issues in recent
times, both with respect to the opaque practices of a few, and with respect
to volatile market conditions. We are, and always have been, an open
book to our clients. While we would never seek to impose, we try to
anticipate the concerns of our clients, and with that in mind we offered
personal visits by our senior investment officers to all of our institutional
clients this year, and were delighted at the significant take up rate.
We believe that our focus on client service is a key driver of our long 
term client retention.

City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 25
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements,
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statement;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders
of City of London Investment Group Plc
26 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009
We have audited the financial statements of City of London Investment Group Plc for the year ended 31st May 2009 which
comprises the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and Company balance sheets, the Consolidated and Company
statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, the Consolidated and Company cash flow statements and the related notes. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495 - 496 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 25, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors;
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31st May 2009
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements.  City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 27
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31st May 2009
1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
(a) New IFRS Standards and Interpretations
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which are relevant to the
Group, were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 1 (revised) Presentation of financial statements – comprehensive revision including the requirement to extract “non-
owner changes in equity” from the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and present in a new
“statement of comprehensive income”.
IFRS 2 Share-based payment – amendments clarify that vesting conditions comprise only service conditions and
performance conditions, and specifies the accounting treatment for a failure to meet a non-vesting condition.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments disclosures – amendment relating to the reclassification of financial assets.
IFRS 8 Operating segments – introduces the “management approach” to segmental reporting whereby information 
is to be disclosed on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
There are a number of other Standards and Interpretations, and revisions to existing Standards and Interpretations, including the
improvements project, in issue but not in force at 31st May 2009. These are not considered relevant to the Group’s financial statements.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact
on the results or the financial statements of the Group.
(b) Basis of consolidation and preparation
These financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The
Company’s principal subsidiaries are City of London Investment Management Company Limited and City of London US
Services Limited, all other subsidiaries being dormant at 31st May 2009.
The Company is domiciled in the UK and its shares are issued in sterling. The functional currency of the business is however 
US Dollars. Management have decided that the presentational currency of the financial statements should be sterling rather than
the functional currency due to the Company being a UK registered entity.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments as outlined in point (c) (ii) below.
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Whilst estimates are
based on management’s best knowledge and judgement using information and financial data available to them, the actual
outcome may differ from those estimates.
The most significant areas of the financial statements that are subject to the use of estimates and assumptions are noted below:
Income taxes
Significant judgement is required in determining provisions for income taxes and in determining deferred tax assets.
Share-based payments
In order to calculate the charge for share-based compensation as required by IFRS 2, the Group makes estimates principally
relating to the assumptions used in its option pricing model.
The principal accounting polices adopted are set out below and have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these accounts. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 33
1 Basis of accounting continued
(c) Significant accounting policies
(i) Property and equipment
For all property and equipment depreciation is calculated to write off their cost to their estimated residual values by equal annual
instalments over the period of their estimated useful lives, which are considered to be:
Short leasehold property improvements – over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and equipment – four years
Computer and telephone equipment – four years
(ii) Financial instruments
Under IAS 39, “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, financial instruments must be classified as either:
• Loans and receivables
• Held-to-maturity investments
• Available-for-sale financial assets
• A financial asset or liability at fair value through profit or loss
The Group’s investments in the funds that it manages are designated as available-for-sale financial assets. Such investments are
initially recognised at fair value, being the consideration given together with any acquisition costs associated with the investment.
They are subsequently carried at fair value, with any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in equity.
Fair value is determined using the price based on the net asset value of the fund. Investments are derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred all risks and rewards of
ownership. When derecognition occurs a realised gain or loss is recognised in the income statement, calculated as the difference
between the net sales proceeds and the original cost of the financial asset. Any fair value gains or losses previously recognised directly
in equity are recycled into the income statement as part of this calculation of the gain or loss arising on derecognition.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is
impaired. In the case of an investment classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the
investment below its cost is considered as an indicator that the investment is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-
for-sale investments, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less
any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the income statement – is removed from equity and recognised
in the income statement.
The Group’s investments in derivatives are designated as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. Such investments
are accounted for in the same way as available-for-sale assets but any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are
recognised in the income statement. The fair value of the derivatives held by the Group is determined as follows:
• Options – priced using the quoted market bid price
• Forward currency trades – priced using prevailing exchange rates
The only exception is where the Group holds an investment in options on unquoted equity instruments, whose fair value cannot
be reliably measured. Such investments are measured at cost less impairment.
The Group’s investments have been classified here for recognition and measurement purposes under IAS39 but are not
necessarily reported in the balance sheet under those headings. Notes to the financial statements

The Group and Company’s investments are reported in the balance sheet as follows:

Non-current assets

Available-for-sale financial assets: investment in funds 431,365 1,861,375
Other financial assets: investment in quoted options – 30,335
Where the Group has invested in Delaware Statutory T rust funds there is a requirement to nominate a tax partner and as
Investment Manager, the Group has adopted this role which requires that a nominal investment be held in each fund for the life
of the fund. Therefore, such nominal investments are reported as other financial assets under non-current assets.
Where the Group has used its own cash to seed new funds, the investment is generally held until the fund’s performance is
established. Such investments are reported as available-for-sale financial assets under current assets.
(iii) T rade receivables
T rade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently carried at the lower of original fair value
and their recoverable amount. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income
statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
(iv) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand, deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, and
other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.
(v) T rade payables
T rade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
(vi) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. However, deferred tax is not
accounted for if it arises from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets or
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The
carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 35
1 Basis of accounting continued
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
The tax rates used are those that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is
charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
(vii) Share-based payments
The Company operates an Employee Share Option Plan. In accordance with IFRS2, the fair value of the employee services
received in exchange for share options is recognised as an expense. The fair value has been calculated using the Binomial pricing
model, and has then been expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the
number of shares that will actually vest.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 has been applied only to grants of share options after 7th November 2002
that had not vested as at 1st June 2006, although, as required by IFRS2, the disclosures in note 24(b) include grants of share
options prior to 7th November 2002.
(viii) Revenue
Revenue arises in North America, Europe and Australia and comprises investment management fees earned. Fees are recognised
in revenue as the investment management services are provided, in accordance with the underlying agreements.
(ix) Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of period-end monetary assets and
liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
The functional currency of the Group and its main trading subsidiaries, City of London Investment Management Company
Limited and City of London US Services Limited, is US dollars. The functional currency of City of London Investment Group
Plc (the “Company”) is sterling. The Group uses sterling as the presentation currency. Under IAS 21 this means that exchange
differences caused from translating from the functional currency to presentational currency for the main trading subsidiaries
would be recognised in equity. However, the Group operates a policy whereby the foreign exchange positions of the subsidiaries
are sold to the Company and therefore it is the only entity with any exchange differences. As such any exchange differences
arising in the Company are “real” in that the functional currency matches the presentational currency. This means that all such
exchange differences are included in the income statement and no split is required between equity and the income statement.
(x) Leases
The cost of operating leases is charged to the income statement in equal periodic instalments over the periods of the leases.
(xi) Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees. The costs of the pension
schemes are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Notes to the financial statements

10 Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit for the period of £3,846,783 (2008 – £7,135,716) divided by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended 31st May 2009 of 23,844,801 (2008 – 24,338,540).
As set out in Note 20 the Employee Benefit T rust held 1,617,650 ordinary shares in the Company as at 31st May 2009. The
T rustees of the T rust have waived all rights to dividends associated with these shares. In accordance with IAS 33 the ordinary shares
held by the Employee Benefit T rust have been excluded from the calculation of the weighted average of ordinary shares in issue.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year of £3,846,783 (2008 – £7,135,716) divided by
the diluted weighted average of ordinary shares for the year ended 31st May 2009 of 25,587,418 (2008 – 27,404,870).

The expected life of the options has been assumed to be three years based upon the empirical evidence available. The risk-free rate
has been assumed to be represented by the yield to maturity at the date of grant of a UK Gilt strip with term to maturity equal to

46 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009
26 Financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, investments and other receivables. Its financial liabilities include
accruals and other payables. The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is materially the same as the book value.
(i) Foreign currency risk
Most of the Group’s revenues, and a significant part of its expenses, are denominated in currencies other than sterling, principally
US and Canadian Dollars. These revenues are derived from fee income which is based upon the net asset value of accounts
managed, and have the benefit of a natural hedge by reference to the underlying currencies in which investments are held.
Inevitably, debtor and creditor balances arise which in turn give rise to currency exposure. Each of the Group’s subsidiaries
eliminates its currency exposure by transfer to the holding company. All hedging activity is therefore assessed at the Group level.
Forward foreign exchange transactions are executed so as to substantially reduce the Group’s exposure to currency market
movements. The level of forward currency hedging is such as is judged by the directors to be consistent with market conditions.
As at 31st May 2009, the Group had net asset balances of US$4,422,628 (2008 – US$6,625,564), offset by forward sales
totalling US$3,600,000 (2008 – US$6,200,000), and net asset balances of C$371,190 (2008 – C$532,661).
Had the US Dollar strengthened or weakened against Sterling as at 31st May 2009 by 10%, with all other variables held
constant, there would have been no material impact on the Group’s profit or equity.
Further details on the effects on the Group’s post-tax profits due to movements in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate have
been demonstrated in the Financial review on page 15.
(ii) Market risk
Changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income and the value of its
investments.
The Group is, from time to time, exposed to market risk directly via its investment holdings and indirectly via its assets under
management, from which its fee income is derived. T o hedge against any potential loss in fee income due to a fall in the markets, the
Group will look to invest in out of the money put options on the emerging markets index. The purchase and sale of these options are
subject to limits established by the Board and are monitored on a regular basis. The investment management and settlement
functions are totally segregated.
The income from hedging recognised in the Group income statement for the period is £21,194 (2008 – cost £26,886).
(iii) Credit risk
The majority of debtors relate to management fees due from funds and segregated account holders. As such the Group is able
to assess the credit risk of these debtors as minimal. For other debtors a credit evaluation is undertaken on a case by case basis.
The Group has zero experience of bad or overdue debts.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents held by the Group are with leading UK banks. The credit risk is managed by carrying
out regular reviews of each institution’s credit rating and of their published financial position. Given their high credit ratings,
management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 47
26 Financial instruments continued
(iv) Liquidity risk
The Group’s liquidity risk is minimal due to its strategy to maximise its cash position. In addition, the Group’s current
available-for-sale assets represent investments in funds that it manages and can be liquidated immediately if required.
(v) Interest rate risk
The Group has no borrowings, and therefore has no exposure to interest rate risk other than that which attaches to its interest
earning cash balances. The Group’s strategy is to maximise the amount of cash which is maintained in interest bearing accounts,
and to ensure that those accounts attract a competitive interest rate. At 31st May 2009 the Group held £4,718,766 (2008 –
£5,498,910) in cash balances, of which £4,693,287 (2008 – £5,492,455) was held in bank accounts which attract variable
interest rates. The effect of a 100 basis points increase/decrease in interest rates on pre-tax profits or equity would not be material.
(vi) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to operate as going concerns and exceed any
minimum externally imposed capital requirements. The capital of the Group and Company consists of equity attributable to the
equity holders of the Parent Company, comprising issued share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as
disclosed the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity on page 30.
The Group’s principal operating subsidiary company, City of London Investment Management Company Ltd is subject to the
requirements of the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) in the UK. This subsidiary held surplus capital over its requirements
throughout the year. 48 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
1. A member entitled to receive notice, attend and vote at the annual general meeting (“AGM”) is entitled to appoint a proxy or
proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of him. Such proxy need not be a member of the Company. Completion of a form
of proxy does not preclude the member attending the meeting and voting in person if they so wish. To be valid, the instrument
appointing a proxy, together, if appropriate, with a power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a
notarially certified copy of such authority, must be deposited at the offices of the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, The
Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no later than 11.30 am on 24th October 2009. A form of proxy
accompanies this notice.
2. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered on
the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the annual general meeting (and for
the purposes of the determination by the Company of the numbers of votes they may cast) is 6.00 pm on 24th October 2009.
The rights of members to attend and vote at the meeting will be determined by reference to entries on the register of members at
6.00 pm on 24th October 2009. Changes to entries on the register of members of the Company after that time will be disregarded
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
3. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that 
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote
on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then
on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a
vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the
same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as
its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who
attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate
representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance
includes a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
4. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose ordinary shares are held on their behalf by another person and who
have been nominated to receive communication from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006
(‘nominated persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds shares
on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have
such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person
holding the ordinary shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
5. In the case of joint holders, the signature of only one of the joint holders is required on the form of proxy, but the vote of the first
named on the register of members will be accepted to the exclusion of the other joint holders.
6. The following documents are available for inspection between 10.00 am and 12.00 noon at the registered office of the Company
on any weekday and will also be available for inspection at the place of the AGM from the commencement of the meeting until
the conclusion thereof:
(a) The register of interests of the directors (and their families) in the share capital of the Company.
(b) Copies of the directors’ contracts of service and letters of appointment of the non-executive directors.
(c) Terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
(d) Copies of the Company’s articles of association. Explanation of the business of the Annual General Meeting
City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009 51
Report and accounts (Resolution 1)
The first item on the agenda requires that the directors must present the accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st May 2009
together with the directors’ report and the independent auditors’ report thereon.
Re-appointment of directors (Resolutions 2 - 6)
Article 130 of the Company’s articles of association requires that at each annual general meeting, any director who has been in office
for more than three years or has been appointed by the directors since the last annual general meeting of the Company will stand for
re-appointment. In addition, such further directors (if any) shall retire by rotation as would bring the number retiring by rotation
up to one-third of the number of directors in office as at 10th September 2009 (or if their number is not a multiple of three,
the number nearest to but not greater than one third).
Article 136 of the Company’s articles of association requires that a resolution for the appointment or re-appointment of two or more
persons as directors by a single motion may not be moved unless a resolution that it shall be so moved has first been agreed to by the
meeting without any vote being given against it. Consequently separate resolutions will be put to the meeting.
Section A.7.2 of the Combined Code provides that non-executive directors may serve longer than nine years (e.g. three three year
terms), subject to annual re-election.
Brief biographical details of all the directors may be found on pages 18 and 19 of the annual report.
Re-appointment of Auditors (Resolution 7)
The Company is required at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the shareholders to appoint auditors for the next
financial year to hold office from the conclusion of that meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which audited
accounts are laid. Moore Stephens LLP are the current auditors and have indicated their willingness to continue in office. If Resolution 7
is passed, Moore Stephens LLP will be re-appointed as auditors to the Company, at a fee to be agreed by the board of directors.
Purchase by the Company of its own shares (Resolution 8)
Under section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 and section 701 of the Companies Act 2006 scheduled to come into force on
1st October 2009, the directors of a company may make market purchases of that company’s shares if authorised to do so.
The Company’s articles of association give a general authority to the directors to purchase shares on the market but that authority
is subject to the approval of shareholders. Your directors believe that granting such approval would be in the best interests of
shareholders in allowing directors the flexibility to react promptly to circumstances requiring market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 8, which will be proposed as a special resolution, will give the directors the authority to purchase issued shares
of the Company under section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 and section 701 of the Companies Act 2006. The authority contained
in this Resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of £26,030 which represents approximately 10% of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company as at the current time. The price which may be paid for those shares is also restricted as set out
in the Resolution. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s annual general meeting in 2010 or on 31st May
2011 (whichever is the earlier). 52 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009
The board has no present intention of exercising this authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the board will use this
power only if and when, taking account of market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate
gearing levels and the overall financial position of the Group, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be in the best interests
of shareholders generally and that they will result in an increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as treasury shares. The Company may purchase and hold shares as treasury shares
up to a maximum amount equal to 10% of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital at that time, rather than cancelling
them. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and no dividends will be paid on any such shares. Shares held in treasury in
this way can be sold for cash or cancelled. This would allow the Company to manage its capital base more effectively and to replenish
its distributable reserves.
If and when the board resolves to exercise its authority to make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether shares purchased
are to be cancelled or held in treasury.

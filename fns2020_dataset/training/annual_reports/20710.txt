    Chairman’s Statement
2 Alliance & Leicester
I am pleased to be able to report that
Alliance & Leicester plc again had a
successful year, achieving our strategic
targets in a challenging environment.
Financial Results
Pre-tax operating proﬁt was up 6% to
£556m in 2004. Pre-tax proﬁt was £608m,
including the £52m pre-tax proﬁt on the
sale of our merchant acquisition business,
up 16% on 2003. Basic underlying earnings
per share, which excludes the proﬁts from
the sale of our merchant acquisition business,
were up 12% to 88.2p. The Board has
proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 32.6p, making
a total dividend of 48.3p, a 10% increase
on the equivalent ﬁgure for 2003.
Alliance & Leicester is delivering sustainable
long term shareholder value. Since July
2000, when we launched our strategy,
Alliance & Leicester shareholders have
received a total shareholder return of over
120%, compared to minus 15% in the
FTSE 100 index and plus 44% for the
banking sector as a whole.
Strategy
Our strategy continues to deliver
shareholder value. 
The market is evolving in a way that gives
us competitive advantage. As the needs
and preferences of both personal and
commercial customers change, so we 
are changing with them. Our strategy 
of building a ‘direct bank with a high 
street presence’ and our proven skills in
direct channels enable us to evolve in 
a way that accommodates the changing
needs of customers.
Our brand values of offering better value
products, developing straightforward
processes, providing friendly and
approachable customer service, and
rewarding customers who buy more from 
us has enabled us to achieve franchise
growth in our Core 4 retail products. 
We have achieved increased market 
shares in current account openings, 
new personal loans and net mortgage
lending, and growth in personal 
customer deposit balances. 
Our Wholesale Banking strategy, of
focusing on the four key areas of cash,
lending, business banking and treasury, 
has also seen increasing success. There
were increases in both the value of cash
sales and new business accounts opened,
as well as strong growth in commercial
lending balances.
Group Board Directors
We were delighted to appoint Margaret
Salmon to our Group Board as a non-
executive director in July 2004. Margaret 
is a Fellow of the Institute of Personnel
Development, and brings extensive
experience of human resources and 
retail expertise to the Board.
Peter Stone resigned from the Board as 
a non-executive director in September
2004 for personal reasons, having made 
a valuable contribution to the Group 
in the period he spent with us.
On 31 December 2004, Frances Cairncross
stepped down from the Board as a non-
executive director, after a total of twelve
years’ service. I would like to thank Frances
for her invaluable contribution to the
Group, and we wish her every success 
in her new appointment as Rector 
of Exeter College, Oxford University.
Details of all directors can be found on
pages 22 and 23 of this Report & Accounts.
“Alliance & Leicester continues
to deliver shareholder value. 
In 2004 we achieved all 
our strategic targets in a
challenging environment.”

Management and Staff
The continued success of the Group reﬂects
the excellent leadership of Richard Pym and
the executive directors. Their constructive,
open team working and mutual support 
are key strengths of this business and have
enabled us to build a strong and capable
senior management team. The Group
Board is conﬁdent that this team will take
us forward in a very competitive market. 
Alliance & Leicester’s staff are among the
best in the industry. Their dedication and
ability is a key to our success, and I thank
them for their professionalism and
commitment to serving our customers
throughout 2004.
Corporate Governance
Alliance & Leicester recognises and fully
supports the value of good corporate
governance, not only in the areas of
accountability and risk management, 
but also as a positive contribution to
business prosperity. The Board believes 
that good corporate governance involves
applying the principles and provisions 
of The Combined Code on Corporate
Governance in a sensible and pragmatic
fashion, and remains satisﬁed that it
complies with all those provisions which
apply to the Group.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We believe that we have an important 
role to play in our local communities, 
by being a responsible employer and
through charitable giving and staff
volunteering. We strive on a day to 
day basis to make a valuable contribution
to our local communities through
donations, gifts in kind and staff
volunteering. We update our Corporate
Social Responsibility report annually.
The Future
Alliance & Leicester is well placed to 
remain successful in 2005 and to continue
to deliver good returns for our shareholders
in the future. 
We remain committed to responsible
lending in each of our markets, and to 
the principle of treating customers fairly.
We will continue to improve our cost
efﬁciency, enabling us to offer our
customers better value products than 
our competitors, whilst also delivering
valuable franchise growth and a strong
return on equity for our shareholders. 
We will deliver these objectives whilst
maintaining above average asset quality.
Our credit rating upgrade to Aa3 by
Moody’s in November 2004 demonstrated
both our ﬁnancial strength and the quality
of our earnings. This was a powerful
independent endorsement of our progress,
as we are the smallest UK bank to have
such a high rating. We have worked 
hard to gain our reputation of being 
a low risk bank and we believe that by
maintaining this position we will be well
placed to continue to perform strongly
should there be more difﬁcult market
conditions in the future.

Introduction
Alliance & Leicester delivered a good set 
of ﬁnancial results in 2004. 
Pre-tax operating proﬁt was up 6% to
£556m. Underlying basic earnings per
share increased by 12% to 88.2p. Our
underlying post-tax return on equity
increased to 23.3%. These all exclude 
the £52m of pre-tax proﬁt from the sale 
of our merchant acquisition business in
April 2004, but include the one-off costs 
of £9m arising from the rationalisation 
of our branch network. The Board has
proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 32.6p per
share, making a total dividend of 48.3p, 
an increase of 10% on 2003.
By delivering 12% growth in underlying
basic earnings per share, we achieved our
primary strategic target of double digit
percentage growth in 2004. We also
achieved each of our supporting objectives
of accelerated revenue growth, cost savings
and a more efﬁcient capital base. 
These results have been delivered in a very
competitive environment and reﬂect the
clear and coherent strategies we have
developed for our Retail and Wholesale
Banking businesses. Our strategic focus 
is to deliver shareholder value by growing 
our franchise, driving down costs to
improve cost efﬁciency, and delivering 
a strong return on equity of around 20%.
This will be achieved whilst ensuring 
above average asset quality, through 
our responsible lending policies.
Retail Banking 
Retail Banking pre-tax proﬁt increased by
£5m to £446m, after charging the one-off
costs of £9m relating to the rationalisation
of the branch network. 
We saw franchise growth in each of our
Core 4 Retail Banking products, with
increased market shares in current account
openings, net mortgage lending and new
personal loans, and growth in personal
customer deposit balances.
Growing our current account base is central
to our strategy. Historically, current account
customers have been unwilling to switch
banks, but there is increasing evidence that
this is changing. For example, the Mintel
report on Financial Intelligence, published
in 2004, found that the number of
customers now wanting to switch 
current accounts has doubled over the 
past 2 years. Current account customers 
are proﬁtable in their own right and
provide a long term relationship, with the
potential for further product sales during
the life of that relationship. We opened
228,000 new current accounts in 2004, 
a 25% increase compared to 2003.
Our gross mortgage lending during 2004
was up 7% to £8.7bn, a market share 
of 3.0%. Net mortgage lending increased
by 22% to £2.5bn, a market share 
of 2.4%. Our mortgage lending in the
second half of 2004 was lower than that
achieved in the first half of the year,
reﬂecting our continued stance of only
targeting high quality and profitable
lending, and avoiding some market
segments which we regard as higher risk.
Our unsecured personal loan gross
advances were £2.3bn, 23% higher than 
in 2003. Asset quality remains very strong.
Our personal customer deposit balances
grew by £0.6bn to £19.5bn.
We supplement the Core 4 Retail Banking
products by providing products in
“Our coherent strategy and
business model is well 
aligned to the changing 
needs of customers.”

conjunction with our key partners – MBNA
for credit cards, Legal & General for life
assurance and long term investments, 
and Zurich for household insurance. 
These partnerships continue to work 
well, and the total income we received
from our Partner 4 products grew in 2004.
Our ‘direct bank with a high street
presence’ business model is based 
on satisfying changing customer 
behaviour. Consumers are increasingly 
well informed about the products 
offered by different ﬁnancial services
providers and are looking for excellent
value. They are also increasingly 
conﬁdent in using the direct channels 
of the telephone and the internet to
purchase and to service those products.
By offering great value products, we attract
customers at a low unit acquisition cost.
Evidence of the excellent value we offer 
is provided by the 2,400 ‘Best Buy’
mentions that our products received 
in national newspapers in 2004, more 
than any of our competitors.
Our business model also provides customers
with convenient, efﬁcient ways to buy and
service products through direct channels.
This provides a positive experience for our
customers, delivered at a low unit cost.
The success of this approach has led to 
a trebling in our sales of Retail Banking
products over the internet in 2004, with
the proportion of our Core 4 products
sold online more than doubling to 20%.
More than 500,000 customers are now
registered for our internet bank service, 
an increase of 300,000 since the end 
of 2003, and the number of internet
transactions carried out each month has
more than doubled over the past year. 
A benchmarking study of leading UK
ﬁnancial service providers has shown 
that these rates of growth made Alliance 
& Leicester the fastest growing internet
bank in 2004. We have also received
further conﬁrmation of the strength 
of our internet business, including 
an award for ‘best site’ in the banking
category from Blays Net ratings. 
This further momentum towards direct
sales and service provides us with
signiﬁcant unit cost advantages, and 
we expect this to continue in the future.
Our branches provide customers with 
a place for face-to-face sales and support.
They also provide an important physical
presence for our brand. Our strategy
requires a strong retail network, with
branches in the right locations to serve 
our current and future customers.
Following the closure of some of our
branches in 2004, we now have a more
compact retail network providing us with
the branch distribution we need to grow
the business in the future.
Total sales through our branches continued
to increase in 2004, whilst the number 
of branch transactions continued to fall.
This focus on sales has enabled us to deliver
an increase of around 20% in product sales
per branch member of staff in 2004.
One of our key brand values is to deliver
friendly and approachable customer
service. We recently surveyed our own
customers and the customers of the 
seven largest high street ﬁnancial services
providers in the UK, asking them how
satisﬁed they were with the service they
receive. Customers rated our telephone
service higher than any of our competitors
and rated our branch service higher than 
all but one of them.
Wholesale Banking
Wholesale Banking delivered a strong
performance during 2004 in both
Commercial Banking and Treasury.
Pre-tax operating proﬁt in Commercial
Banking was up £11m to £91m. Strong
growth was achieved in each core 
product line. 
Cash sales to ﬁnancial institutions were 
up by 24% to £53.4bn, business banking
current account openings increased by
around 50% to more than 16,000, and
commercial lending balances grew by
£0.6bn to £4.7bn, with asset quality
remaining strong.
Pre-tax proﬁt in Treasury was £60m (2003:
£47m), beneﬁting from an increase in the
number of structured ﬁnance transactions
completed during the year.
We have made further progress in
implementing the Wholesale Banking
strategy we announced in 2003. During
the year we announced the sale of our
merchant acquiring business, enabling
Wholesale Banking to increase its focus on
its four core business lines of cash, lending,
business banking and treasury. 
Our lending and business banking
operations have seen signiﬁcant growth
over the past couple of years and currently
contribute around 60% of Commercial
Banking’s proﬁts. We expect these business
lines to be key drivers of proﬁt growth
within Wholesale Banking in the future. We
will, however, continue to grow our cash
business through our cash sales-led
strategy, and were pleased to complete
negotiations successfully with Abbey during
2004 to provide all of their ATM and
branch cash requirements.

Regulatory Developments
In 2004 we have maintained an excellent
regulatory record, but we will not be
complacent. Alliance & Leicester is a
responsible lender and we ensure, as 
best we are able, that our customers are
not borrowing more than they can afford
to repay. We recognise the importance 
of embedding the principle of treating
customers fairly into the culture of our
business and our brand values are already
well aligned to this. We also focus on
educating our customers, by improving 
the ways in which we provide information
and by simplifying our product portfolios
and marketing campaigns, to make them
more easily understood.
During the latter part of 2004 we trained
over 2,500 staff and implemented new
procedures to ensure we complied with 
the introduction of the Financial Services
Authority rules on the conduct of mortgage
business from the end of October 2004,
and the introduction of general insurance
regulation in January 2005.
For the year commencing 1 January 2005
we will be required to report our ﬁnancial
results under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The
implementation of the new processes 
and procedures required to introduce 
these standards has taken up considerable
resource. The most significant impact 
of these new rules will be to alter the
timing of when certain items will be
recognised in our financial results. 
Our Staff
I thank all our staff for their contribution 
to our progress in 2004, which reﬂects the
hard work of an excellent team of people
we have working across the Group, each
committed to achieving our business goals
and sharing a clear vision of where we are
heading. Throughout the Group we have
continued to strengthen our management
teams, by developing our existing
managers as well as recruiting new
managers from outside the organisation.
Over 80% of our staff replied to our annual
employee opinion survey, with the results
showing evidence of continuing
improvement in staff morale and 
job satisfaction.
The Future
Our strategy has delivered good returns
since its launch in July 2000, generating a
total shareholder return of over 120%. We
have performed well against the detailed
targets we set for ourselves and have
grown our chosen franchises, signiﬁcantly
improved our cost efﬁciency and delivered
a return on equity considerably higher than
the average for a European bank. This has
been achieved whilst maintaining strong
asset quality, as recently recognised by an
upgrade of our long term credit rating 
by Moody’s to Aa3.
The UK economy looks set for continued
growth in the future, with the likelihood
that interest rates will now peak at rates
lower than generally expected last year.
Unemployment remains low, a key
determinant of asset quality for the
personal sector. This scenario suggests 
an outlook of continued market growth 
in each of our core markets, albeit at
generally slower rates of growth than
experienced in recent years. 
Against this economic backdrop, we will
evolve our approach to credit risk. This 
will provide opportunities for future
revenue growth, whilst maintaining our
overall responsible approach to asset
quality. Our responsible lending policies
and strong asset quality will also leave us
well positioned, should future economic
conditions prove to be less benign.
We have a coherent strategy and business
model aligned to the changing needs 
of customers in an environment of lower
margins and intense competition. This
strategy ensures Alliance & Leicester is 
well placed to deliver good returns to
shareholders and remain successful in 
2005 and beyond.

Business Review
Retail Banking saw strong franchise growth
in 2004.
Retail Banking pre-tax proﬁt increased by
£5m to £446m (2003: £441m). Total
revenues increased by £20m. Operating
costs increased by £10m, reﬂecting good
cost control, and include the one-off costs
of £9m relating to the rationalisation of the
branch network. Excluding these one-off
costs, the cost base increased by £1m,
reﬂecting real unit cost reductions. Asset
quality remains very strong.
Core 4
Mortgages
Total UK gross mortgage advances
increased by 5% to £292bn in 2004, 
and net lending was £101bn, the same 
as in 2003. The UK mortgage market was
very strong in the ﬁrst half of 2004, but
slowed markedly in the second half of the
year compared to the same period in 2003.
In the ﬁrst half of 2004 total gross lending
increased by over 17% compared to the
same period in 2003, but in the second 
half of the year gross lending fell by 5%
compared to the same period in 2003. 
We anticipate that net mortgage lending 
in the UK will fall slightly in 2005.
Alliance & Leicester’s gross mortgage
lending increased by 7% to £8.7bn,
representing a market share of 3.0%, 
whilst net mortgage lending increased 
by 22% to £2.5bn, a market share 
of 2.4%. The value of redemptions 
in 2004 remained broadly similar to 
2003. Mortgage balances increased 
to £27.9bn, representing 3.2% of total 
UK mortgage balances.
During the second half of 2004 we
implemented successfully the training and
revised sales processes necessary to comply
with the introduction of mortgage
regulation on 1 November. As expected,
the introduction of the new regulations 
did temporarily dampen business volumes
across the market. Throughout 2004 we
have continued to focus on good quality,
proﬁtable lending. We will not sacriﬁce asset
quality to gain additional market share and
we continue to take a responsible approach
to our lending, including ensuring that
affordability is assessed for all applications.
Should the economy continue to show
growth, and unemployment continue at
low levels, we do see the opportunity for 
a potential widening of our target market
for mortgages, whilst maintaining a high
quality of lending.
We saw changes in both our type of
customer and the product mix during
2004. Our lending to remortgage
customers increased by over 20% in 
2004 and the proportion of new ﬁxed 
rate loans fell significantly, from over 
50% of gross lending in 2003 to around
35% in 2004, with customers favouring
short term discounted products. 
The value of mortgages on our balance
sheet paying standard variable rate is now
less than £6bn. The proportion of our
mortgage balances on standard variable
rate at the end of December 2004 was
21%, compared to 24% in December
2003. We continue to expect this
proportion to reduce over time, although
the number is volatile, varies by month,
and depends on the maturity profile 
of lending undertaken in previous years.
Personal Loans
Our gross unsecured personal loan
advances were £2.3bn in 2004, 23%
higher than 2003. Our unsecured personal
loan balances increased by £600m 
to £3.1bn (December 2003: £2.5bn),
representing a market share of around
2.5%. This compares with a total exposure
to personal unsecured lending (including
credit cards) of £3.0bn in June 2002.
During the second half of 2004 we
implemented the necessary actions 
to comply with changes in the Consumer
Credit Act, as well as ensuring that our 
sales processes met the requirements for
general insurance regulation, which was
introduced in January 2005.
The number of loan applications received via
the internet more than doubled in 2004,
reflecting our increasingly sophisticated
internet marketing techniques.
Creditor payment protection insurance
penetration in 2004 fell compared to 2003,
reﬂecting the competitive interest rates we
offered during the second half of the year.

During the periods when we offer the most
competitive rates we receive higher credit
quality applications from customers who
tend to take out less creditor insurance. 
The increased business volumes achieved
by offering such competitive rates, together
with the lower credit losses, more than
compensate for the lower interest spread
and reduced insurance penetration. 
In addition, around 80% of our personal
loans are sold over the telephone or via 
the internet. Our personal loans operation
is very cost efﬁcient, ensuring that whilst
margins are narrowing our overall returns
remain good, with the post-tax return on
assets increasing from around 1.6% in
2001 to around 2% in 2004.
The credit quality of our unsecured lending
remains very strong, with the increased
charge for bad debts reﬂecting the growth
in balances over the past 12 months. 
Current Accounts
Growing our current account base is an
important part of our strategy, and we 
saw strong, proﬁtable growth during 2004,
with 228,000 new accounts opened. 
Our active current account base increased
to 1.44m accounts representing over 
2m customers.
The majority of the new accounts opened
were either ‘Premier’ or ‘Premier Plus’
current accounts. These customers typically
have a significantly stronger relationship
with the Group. For example, the average
product holding of a ‘Premier’ current
account customer (excluding the free travel
insurance included with the product) is 
3.5 products, more than double that for 
a non-’Premier’ customer.
The ‘Premier Plus’ current account is
designed to reward those customers who
undertake the majority of transactions
themselves, either online or over the
telephone, by providing a higher rate 
of credit interest. It is a key product in 
the Group’s strategy of building a ‘direct
bank with a high street presence’.
Savings
Personal customer deposit balances
increased by £0.6bn to £19.5bn at the 
end of December 2004.
During 2004 we launched our ‘Online Saver’
account, enabling all of our Core 4 Retail
Banking products to be bought online. The
‘Online Saver’ account offers customers 
a market leading rate of interest, but has 
a low acquisition and servicing cost.
Partner 4
Revenues from our Partner 4 products of
credit cards, life assurance, long term
investments and general insurance
(building and contents and mortgage
payment protection policies) continued 
to grow in 2004.
We continue to work well with MBNA, with
over 170,000 new credit cards sold during
2004. Whilst this was lower than in 2003, 
it was signiﬁcantly higher than in 2002.
Sales through Alliance & Leicester channels
(branch, internet and contact centres),
from which we receive the highest levels 
of commission, continue to increase, with
sales 11% higher than in 2003. During 
the first half of 2004 we sold the small
remaining non-performing element of 
the old credit card book. 
Our partnership with Legal & General
continues to work well. The value of new
long term investment sales was 6% higher
in 2004 compared to 2003, despite a
reduction in the number of our ﬁnancial
advisors. Life assurance policy sales during
2004 were lower than in 2003. The
majority of our life assurance sales are
mortgage related. The reduction in the
number of new policies sold in 2004 is
primarily due to the increased proportion 
of remortgage applications.
Sales of household and mortgage payment
protection insurance products in 2004 were
overall broadly similar to 2003.
Distribution
During the year our internet generated
sales trebled, and the proportion of our
Core 4 product sales made via the internet
more than doubled to 20%. 
Since April 2004 all standard mortgage
applications from intermediaries have been
submitted via our online system, ISIS. The
majority of these applications receive a fully
credit scored mortgage decision within 
60 seconds, with the remainder being 
dealt with by underwriters within an hour.
The internet is also being used increasingly
for servicing banking products, and at 
the end of the year more than 500,000
customers were registered to use our
internet banking services, an increase 
of over 300,000 in the year.
Our branches remain an important part 
of Retail Banking’s strategy and distribution
capability, with sales once again increasing
in 2004. During the year we undertook a
detailed review of our branch network.
Following this review we announced the
closure of 46 branches where there were
both low sales and low customer footfall.
These branches closed in October 2004. 
We now have a more compact retail
network, providing 254 branches in the
right locations to grow the business and
provide face to face sales and support for
customers when required.

The implementation of new resource
scheduling processes and improvements 
to our interactive voice response systems
have enabled our call centres, all of which
are based in the British Isles, to handle
more incoming customer calls, and to
reduce the unit cost of customer service
during 2004.
Asset Quality
Asset quality within Retail Banking remains
very strong, with 90% of our loans and
advances to personal customers secured.
Our responsible approach to lending has
ensured that both our mortgage and
personal loan arrears levels are better than
industry averages. Whilst the proportion 
of accounts in arrears varies on a monthly
basis, the proportion of both non-
performing mortgage accounts in arrears
and non-performing personal loan assets
were lower at the end of December 2004
than at the end of December 2003.
The average loan to value (LTV) of our new
mortgage lending in 2004 was 57% (2003:
59%), with 79% of new lending having an
LTV of less than 75%. The estimated LTV 
of our total mortgage book, based on
house prices at 31 December 2004, 
was 42% (December 2003: 40%). 
The proportion of mortgage accounts 
in arrears at the end of December 2004
was 0.68% (December 2003: 0.73%). 
This is lower than the industry average 
of 0.79% published by the Council of
Mortgage Lenders.
Our unsecured lending asset quality
remains very strong. Non-performing 
assets (loans over 30 days in arrears)
comprise 4.2% of the unsecured loan 
book (December 2003: 4.4%). Our
unsecured loan arrears are more than 
40% below industry statistics published 
by the Finance & Leasing Association. Business Review

business, although the anticipated increase
in Wholesale Banking profit in 2005 will 
not be signiﬁcant. 
We are planning to continue to grow our
cash business through our cash sales-led
strategy. This will partially offset continued
declining returns from our traditional cash
handling and bill payments businesses 
in the future. We continue to look at
opportunities to improve the efﬁciency 
of this business and maintain its high 
return on capital.
Lending
During 2004 our commercial lending
balances increased by £0.6bn to £4.7bn.
Asset quality across the book remains good
with 0.33% of loans over 30 days in arrears
at the end of December 2004 (December
2003: 0.68%).
The £600m increase in commercial lending
balances was after a further £170m
reduction in the balances of the higher
margin small ticket leasing sectors, which
we announced in 2003 we were exiting.
The run-off is expected to take up to a
further three years to complete, with
£250m of balances outstanding at the
end of December 2004. 
Commercial lending is an increasingly
important driver of Wholesale Banking’s
proﬁts. During 2004 we continued to take
a responsible approach to growing our
lending book and are planning for future
growth. We have identiﬁed a number of
sectors of the commercial lending market 
in which we are under-represented and are
currently developing plans to increase our
presence without reducing our good asset
quality. For example, we have strong links
with the public sector and see signiﬁcant
potential for further growth in this area, 
as well as in adjacent areas such as Private
Finance Initiatives.
Business Banking
Business banking current account openings
increased by around 50% to more than
16,000 (2003: 11,000). We opened around
6,000 new community accounts in 2004
(2003: 8,000). At the end of 2004 we had
64,000 Business banking current accounts
(2003: 58,000) and 105,000 community
accounts (2003: 101,000).
Our new marketing and sales processes,
positioning Alliance & Leicester Commercial
Bank as the ‘A+Lternative Business Bank’,
are being rolled out across the UK in 2005
following the successful pilot in the Central
region of England in 2004. This roll-out,
together with an increased focus on
customers with a turnover of up to £10m,
rather than £1m as previously, will provide
the basis for additional growth in Business
Wholesale Banking delivered a strong
performance during 2004. It is focused 
on four core business lines: cash, lending,
business banking and treasury.
Pre-tax proﬁt in Commercial Banking,
excluding the £52m pre-tax proﬁt on the
sale of the merchant acquisition business,
was £91m (2003: £80m), up 13%.
Total income was £3m higher than in
2003, even after the sale of our merchant
acquisition business at the end of April
2004 and the continued roll-off of higher
margin commercial lending balances from
the small ticket leasing sectors we exited 
in July 2003. Operating expenses fell by
£17m, reﬂecting the sale of the merchant
acquisition business, a one-off cost
reduction as a result of the conclusion 
of our contractual negotiations with the
Post Ofﬁce, and beneﬁts from increased
levels of electronic, rather than paper,
transactions being processed. The bad 
debt charge in Commercial Banking fell 
by £5m compared to 2003, reﬂecting the
good quality of our commercial lending.
Pre-tax proﬁt in Treasury was £60m (2003:
£47m). Treasury’s ﬁnancial performance for
reporting purposes is included within the
Treasury & Group sector.
Cash
Total cash sales to ﬁnancial institutions 
were £53.4bn, 24% higher than in 2003.
We continued to increase our cash sales
customer base during 2004, and we
completed negotiations successfully with
Abbey to provide their ATM and branch
cash requirements. The provision of cash 
to Abbey commenced in November 2004.
Cash handling deposits in 2004 were
£59bn, slightly lower than in 2003,
reﬂecting the cash sales-led strategy we
have adopted. The number of cheques
processed continued to decline, reducing
by over 8.5m to 43.5m in 2004. During
the ﬁrst half of 2004 we signed new cash
contracts with the Post Ofﬁce. These
agreements enabled us to deliver some
one-off cost savings during 2004.
Since its creation in 1968, Girobank has
processed beneﬁt payments for the UK
Government. This is an important business
line for our commercial bank. The number
of beneﬁt payments we processed in 2004
was slightly lower than in 2003, as beneﬁt
payments are increasingly being paid
directly into the recipient’s bank account.
During 2005, however, we anticipate the
number of beneﬁt payments will increase 
as a result of the Department of Work 
and Pensions rationalising their banking
arrangements. The processing of beneﬁt
payments is a high cost but value-adding

banking. The opening of ﬁve business
centres across the country will support 
our plans to further enhance this franchise. 
Treasury
Pre-tax proﬁt in Treasury was £60m (2003:
£47m), with total income £13m higher.
During the year Treasury beneﬁted from 
an increase in the number of structured
ﬁnance transactions completed.
Treasury have continued to manage the
Group’s liquidity, funding and hedging
requirements successfully, and asset quality
remains strong with 97% (December 2003:
96%) of exposures having a long term
credit rating at or above single ‘A’.
Non-Core Product Lines
In April 2004 we completed the sale 
of our merchant acquisition business to
Nova Information Systems, a subsidiary 
of US Bancorp. Nova paid Alliance &
Leicester Commercial Bank £83.5m for the
business. This resulted in a net proﬁt of
£52m after taking into account the costs 
of exiting existing contracts, ﬁxed asset
write-offs, provisions and transaction costs.
The £52m is being accounted for as 
a non-operating FRS 3 exceptional item. 
As part of the contract Nova provides an
Alliance & Leicester branded merchant
acquisition service. As a result of the sale
of the business, Commercial Banking
income was reduced by around £14m, 
and operating costs reduced by around
£9m, compared to 2003.
Overall, the impact on the Group 2004
proforma proﬁt and loss account and 2005
opening reserves is not expected to be
signiﬁcant. Pre-tax proﬁt is expected to
reduce by between £10m and £30m, less
than 5% of total pre-tax proﬁt. Earnings
per share will be reduced by a similar
proportion. The impact on opening
reserves at 1 January 2005 is an estimated
change of between plus and minus £25m,
less than 5% of opening reserves. In
addition, the beneﬁcial impact on the
Group’s regulatory capital at 1 January
2005 will be between £0 and £50m.
Further details are shown on page 18.
Capital
In 2004 we bought back 17.6m shares at 
a cost of £153m, reducing our equity tier 
1 capital ratio to 7.2%. During 2005 we
plan to continue to manage our equity tier
1 ratio at around 7% on a regulatory basis.
In March 2004 we issued £300m of non-
equity tier 1 capital. This has resulted in 
our total tier 1 capital ratio increasing 
from 7.4% at the end of 2003 to 8.4% 
at the end of December 2004.
We will continue to manage our capital
base proactively in the future and plan for 
a further share buyback in 2005. We expect
this buyback to be signiﬁcantly smaller than
in 2004 and to commence in the second
half of the year, following the ﬁnalisation,
auditing, and announcement of our 2004
results under IFRS in May 2005.
Strategic investment costs
During 2004 one-off strategic investment
expenditure was £8m. This expenditure
completes the investment programme set
out at the launch of our strategy in 2000.
We will continue to invest in the Group’s
development, the cost of which will be
managed within our ‘business as usual’ 
cost base in 2005 and beyond.
Basel 2
We continue to make good progress to
ensure that we meet all the necessary
criteria to maximise the beneﬁts from Basel
2. We intend to adopt an Internal Ratings
Based (IRB) approach for credit risk and
have implemented the core credit models
to ensure compliance with Pillar 1 of the
accord. The models are now embedded
within our risk management processes.
Given the high quality of our balance 
sheet and our responsible lending policies
we continue to expect a reduction in risk
weighted assets under the new rules.
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS)
We are currently working on restating our
2004 results on an IFRS basis. This will form
the 2004 comparative results which we will
disclose in the 2005 interim and annual
results. These restatements will be on both
a statutory basis (excluding IAS 39) and 
a proforma basis (including the impact of
IAS 39, other than hedge ineffectiveness).
They will also include the restated opening
reserves positions at 1 January 2004 and 
1 January 2005.
The Group is planning to provide this 2004
information in an announcement to be
issued towards the end of May 2005,
giving an explanation of the changes from
UK GAAP to IFRS. At this point the IFRS
statutory comparative ﬁgures and opening
reserves will have been audited. Financial Review
12 Alliance & Leicester
Completion of Strategic Targets 2000 – 2004
Since we launched our strategy in 2000, we have been delivering
against a set of strategic objectives. These objectives were all
successfully achieved by the end of 2004.
The Group achieved its primary target in 2004 of:
Double digit percentage growth in underlying basic earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share increased by 12% compared
to 2003. Underlying basic earnings per share were 88.2p, whilst
basic earnings per share were 95.8p. Underlying basic earnings 
per share is defined as excluding the non-operating FRS3
exceptional item (£52m pre-tax proﬁt on the sale of our merchant
acquisition business) but including the operating FRS3 exceptional
item (the one-off costs of £9m arising from the rationalisation 
of the branch network).
We also achieved each of our supporting objectives of:
Accelerating revenue growth 
Group revenues on a like for like basis (excluding merchant
acquisition revenues in 2003 and 2004 and any distortion from
signiﬁcant property disposals) were 2.7% higher than in 2003. 
This is a faster rate of growth than the 2.5% achieved in 2003.
Total Group revenues increased by 2% in 2004. These include 
£7m of revenue from our merchant acquisition business prior to 
its sale in April 2004 (2003: £21m) and £4m (2003: £nil) from 
the sale of a branch in Edinburgh in the ﬁrst half of 2004.
Delivering our targeted cost base
Operating costs (excluding depreciation on operating lease assets
and one-off strategic investment costs, but including the one-off
exceptional costs associated with the changes in our branch
network) were £707m in 2004, £6m lower than the £713m in
2003. This reﬂects our focus on controlling costs and is a better
performance than our target of keeping 2004 costs broadly
similar to 2003.
Our software accounting policy has been changed from immediate
write-off to capitalisation, consistent with the requirements of IFRS.
If the impact of the change in accounting policy for software costs
is excluded, operating costs would have been £712m in 2004,
similar to 2003. 
We have also delivered £109m of core operating cost savings,
exceeding our £100m target (announced in 2000 and based 
on 2000 business volumes and prices).
Improved capital efficiency
During 2004 we bought back 17.6m shares at a cost of £153m,
reducing our equity tier 1 capital ratio to 7.2% and achieving our
goal of reducing the ratio towards the lower end of a 7.0% to
7.5% range. In March 2004 we issued £300m of non-equity tier 1
capital. This resulted in our total tier 1 capital ratio increasing from
7.4% at the end of 2003 to 8.4% at the end of December 2004.
Strategic Objectives 2005 – 2007
Over the next three year period we aim to grow our franchise, 
to improve our cost efﬁciency further, and to continue to deliver 
a strong return on equity, whilst maintaining above average 
asset quality.
We are speciﬁcally targeting a single quantiﬁed external target 
of a Group post-tax return on equity tier 1 capital of 20%, plus 
or minus 3%, in each of the next three years on an IFRS basis. 
This will be after excluding impacts arising from fair valuing
derivatives under IAS 39. Achieving this should continue to 
place us in the top tier of European banks in this measure.

these costs, are 48.8% for MLI and 46.1% for Retail Banking. Retail Banking pre-tax proﬁt of £446m was £5m higher than 2003.
Total income growth was 2% (£20m), whilst operating expenses,
excluding one-off branch rationalisation costs, remained broadly 
in line with 2003. The loss charge was £5m higher than 2003,
primarily due to an increased Personal Banking charge, reﬂecting
growth in balances.
MLI pre-tax proﬁt of £240m was £10m lower than 2003, reﬂecting
the up-front costs associated with the higher volume of new
mortgage business, and the £9m of one-off costs arising from 
the rationalisation of the branch network. These costs were partly
offset by increased income from long term investment products,
and a £4m one-off proﬁt on the disposal of a branch property.
In the ﬁrst half of 2004 we terminated the insurance agreement
with our offshore captive insurance subsidiary (“ALMIG”), which
resulted in the transfer of funds to Alliance & Leicester plc. This
increased net interest income and the residential loss charge by
£8m, with no impact on MLI proﬁt. This increased loss charge 
was offset by a write back of provisions resulting from continued
strong asset quality. In 2003 £6m of ALMIG related revenues 
were recognised.
Personal Banking pre-tax proﬁt of £206m was £15m higher than
2003, due to growth in unsecured personal lending and current
account volumes. This was partly offset by the credit card excess
being lower by £15m. Our personal loans operation contributes
around 40% of Personal Banking pre-tax proﬁt.
Total revenues from our Partner 4 products were £134m (2003:
£131m). Credit card revenues, including the recognition of the
excess from MBNA, were £58m (2003: £70m).
Net interest income
Net interest income of £556m was £32m lower than 2003. MLI
net interest of £317m was £45m lower than 2003. This reduction
was partly offset by higher net interest income in Personal Banking. 
The Retail Banking net interest margin in 2004 was 1.57%,
compared to 1.88% in 2003. This 0.31% fall reﬂected a reduction
in the interest spread of 0.38%, partly offset by an increase in the
contribution from interest-free liabilities of 0.07%.
The MLI net interest margin fell from 1.40% in 2003 to 1.08%.
The 0.32% margin reduction reﬂected a fall in interest spread,
driven by the up-front costs of higher mortgage lending in the
second half of 2003 and the ﬁrst half of 2004, a fall of £1.1bn 
in the average value of mortgages paying standard variable rate,
and an increase in the cost of funding compared to bank base 
rate. The value of deferred mortgage incentives on the Group
balance sheet increased by £20m to £23m at the end of 2004.
Further details are disclosed on pages 73 and 74.
The Personal Banking net interest margin fell from 4.23% in 2003
to 3.93%, mainly as a result of competitive market pricing on new
unsecured personal lending and a reduction in the contribution
from interest-free liabilities, partly offset by an improved interest
spread on current accounts. A fall in the contribution from 
interest-free liabilities was due to a reduction in the proportion 
of non-interest paying current accounts. Further details are
disclosed on page 73.
Average interest-earning assets within Retail Banking increased by
14% in 2004 compared to 2003.

Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased by £52m to £370m in 2004, reﬂecting
higher mortgage related fee income, increased income from long
term investments, higher insurance commission income from
unsecured personal loans, higher current account income and 
a £4m one-off proﬁt on the sale of a branch property. 
Included in non-interest income is £41m of the excess being
recognised from the sale of our credit card accounts to MBNA
(2003: £56m). Non-interest income from unsecured personal
loans was £72m (2003: £64m). 
Our Partner 4 products of credit cards, life assurance, general
insurance and long term investments, in total contributed £128m
of non-interest income. This was £4m higher than 2003, reﬂecting
higher income from long term investment products, partly offset
by a £15m reduction in the credit card excess recognised.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses of £417m remained broadly in line with 2003.
The costs associated with growth in business volumes and inﬂation
were largely offset by lower customer acquisition and servicing costs.
Including the £9m of exceptional costs arising from the closure 
of 46 branches in 2004, total operating costs increased by just
over 2% to £426m. 
The cost:income ratio, excluding the £9m of exceptional costs
from the branch rationalisation programme, was 45.1%, 0.9%
lower than 2003. 
Bad debt provisions 
The charge for bad and doubtful debts increased by £5m 
to £54m. This reﬂects a £7m increase in the Personal Banking
charge to £50m, due to the growth in balances.
The MLI charge decreased by £2m to £4m. During the year 
the insurance agreement with our offshore captive insurance
subsidiary (“ALMIG”) was terminated. This termination resulted 
in the transfer of funds from ALMIG to Alliance & Leicester 
plc, which increased MLI provisions and revenues by £8m. 
This compares with a transfer of funds of £6m in 2003.
Continued strong asset quality performance resulted in a £4m 
write back of mortgage provisions in the second half of 2004.
The arrears performance for both our mortgage and unsecured
lending businesses continues to compare favourably with industry
data. The value of residential mortgage arrears has fallen by 4%
since December 2003, and at 31 December 2004 represented
0.02% of mortgage balances. For unsecured personal lending 
the value of loans over 30 days in arrears as a percentage of total

by average interest-earning assets including operating lease assets.
(Note 2) Excluding net income from operating lease assets, and excluding
operating lease assets from average interest-earning assets, the net interest
margin is 1.53% (2003: 1.70%).
(Note 3) Included within mean interest-earning assets are operating lease assets
of £379m (2003: £372m).
(Note 4) The cost:income ratio has been calculated, consistent with previous

assets, divided by total income less depreciation on operating lease assets.
(Note 5) Including depreciation on operating lease assets, the cost:income ratio is
76.1% (2003: 77.4%).
Operating proﬁt for Commercial Banking increased by 13% 
to £91m. Pre-tax proﬁt, including the £52m proﬁt on the sale 
of the merchant acquisition business, was £143m (2003: £80m).
Net interest income
Net interest income remained in line with 2003 at £88m. Interest-
earning assets increased by 11% in 2004 as a result of growth 
in lending balances. The average margin decreased from 2.06% 
in 2003 to 1.81%, reﬂecting the focus on higher quality, lower
margin commercial lending and the run-off of the small ticket
leasing balances.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased by £3m to £316m. Income
increased in our operating lease and cash businesses. Income
reduced in merchant services following the sale of our business,
and in bill payments, due to a declining number of higher margin
paper transactions. 
Operating expenses
Operating expenses decreased by £17m to £238m, reflecting
lower merchant acquiring costs, lower paper processing costs 
and one-off cost savings relating to the conclusion of contractual
negotiations with the Post Ofﬁce.
Depreciation on operating lease assets
Although operating lease balances were similar to 2003, depreciation
increased by £14m to £70m, reﬂecting the maturity of the book.
Operating lease assets incur a higher depreciation charge towards
the latter stages of their term.
Bad debt provisions 
The charge for bad and doubtful debts decreased from £10m 
to £5m, with lower speciﬁc provisions reﬂecting the good quality
of our commercial lending.

Net interest income
Net interest income in the Treasury & Group sector includes
income from the Group’s capital not allocated to the other
business sectors. Net interest income within our Treasury
operations increased by £13m compared with 2003, reﬂecting 
the benefit of an increased number of structured finance
transactions and growth in the medium term asset book. 
This was partly offset by lower earnings on our excess capital,
mainly due to share buybacks and the increased cost of debt
capital resulting from the issue of non-equity tier 1.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income of £5m was broadly similar to 2003.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses remain broadly in line with 2003.

(Note 2) The net interest margin above is calculated, consistent with previous
years, as net interest including net income from operating lease assets, divided by
average interest-earning assets including operating lease assets.
(Note 3) Excluding net income from operating lease assets and excluding

margin is 1.48% for the year ended 31 December 2004 (2003: 1.75%), 1.48%
for the six months ended 30 June 2004 and 1.48% for the six months ended 31
December 2004.
Group net interest income, including income on operating lease
assets, was £732m, £32m lower than 2003, reﬂecting lower MLI
income. Average total interest-earning assets were 13% higher 
in 2004 compared to 2003. 
The net interest margin in 2004 was 1.52%, compared to 1.79%
in 2003. The fall in margin of 0.27% reﬂects a reduction in interest
spread of 0.31%, partly offset by an increase of 0.04% in the
contribution from interest-free liabilities. The fall in interest spread
is driven by reduced spreads in Retail Banking. 
In 2005 we expect each of our core markets to grow, albeit 
at generally slower rates than in previous years, and the growth 
in our average interest earning assets in 2005 will be against 
this background. We also continue to plan for a narrower margin
environment, with the decline in 2005 anticipated to be less than
in 2004, but greater than the decline experienced in the second
half of 2004 compared with the ﬁrst. Factors which will inﬂuence
the margin include the new business margin on unsecured
personal loans, the proportion of mortgage balances paying
standard variable rate and the continued run-off of the higher
margin small ticket leasing balances which we announced we were
exiting in 2003.
The fall in interest income in 2004 was more than offset by the
increase in non-interest income, which grew by £56m.

Group non-interest income of £691m was 9% higher than 2003.
Excluding merchant acquiring income, non-interest income
increased by 11%. This reflects higher mortgage-related fee
income, higher unsecured personal loans and current account
income, increased income from long term investment products
and higher Commercial Banking income, partly offset by a £15m
reduction in the credit card excess recognised.
The sale of the merchant acquisition business contributed to a
reduction in both fees and commissions receivable and payable 
in the second half of 2004. Other operating income includes 
£41m excess from the sale of credit card accounts to MBNA 
(2003: £56m) and in 2005 this excess will be £34m.

Total expenses of £785m were £2m lower than 2003,

of the branch network. 
The accounting policy for software development costs has been
changed from immediate write-off to capitalisation, where the
criteria under FRS 15 are met. This new policy is consistent with
the requirements of IFRS. The change in policy has resulted in the
capitalisation of £5m of software costs.
Our 2004 target was for operating costs, excluding depreciation
on operating lease assets and one-off strategic investment costs,
but including the one-off exceptional costs associated with the
changes in our branch network, to be broadly similar to 2003. 
Operating costs of £707m were £6m lower than 2003. If the
beneﬁcial impact of the capitalisation of £5m of software costs 
was excluded, operating costs would have been £712m, similar 
to 2003.

in 2004 included £74m of inﬂation related expenses, £63m 
of volume related expenses and £20m of cash market related 
costs compared to the core cost base in 2000. The remaining 
core costs were £541m (2000: £650m), demonstrating that 
we achieved our target of £100m core cost savings.
Strategic investment costs for the year were £8m and represent 
the ﬁnal part of the programme set out in 2000.
We intend to grow our franchise in 2005 and plan to deliver this
with operating costs only increasing broadly in line with inﬂation.
This excludes any cost increase as a result of the anticipated
growth in beneﬁt payment volumes in Wholesale Banking.
The Group cost:income ratio, excluding depreciation on operating
lease assets, was 53.7% (2003: 55.6%). Excluding strategic
investment costs, and the £9m exceptional costs arising 
from rationalisation of the branch network, the Group core cost:
income ratio was 52.5% (2003: 54.2%). Including depreciation 
on operating lease assets, the Group cost:income ratio was
56.1% (2003: 57.4%), with a core Group cost:income ratio
of 54.8% (2003: 56.1%).

(Note 1) Personal Banking comprises unsecured loans, current accounts and

The loss charge for the Group reduced by £2m to £59m in 2004.
The loss charge in the second half of 2004 was £26m, £7m lower
than the ﬁrst half of 2004.
The first half of 2004 included an increase in the residential
mortgage loss charge as a result of the termination of the
insurance agreement with our offshore captive insurance
subsidiary. This resulted in a ﬁnal transfer of funds from ALMIG 
to Alliance & Leicester plc, increasing the bad debt charge by 
£8m (2003: £6m). Continued strong asset quality resulted in 
a £4m write back of mortgage provisions in the second half 
of 2004.
The increase in the Personal Banking loss charge reﬂected the
growth in balances, whilst a lower charge in Commercial Banking
reﬂected the good quality of lending.

Total 174 185
(Note 1) Personal Banking comprises unsecured personal loans, current accounts
and credit cards.
For residential lending, the ratio of closing provisions to gross loans
and advances remains at 0.13%. In addition to the £37m of
residential provisions above, the Group has £9m of high percentage
loan fees held on balance sheet. These funds are deducted from
‘Loans and advances to customers’ in the Group balance sheet.
Together this pool provides £46m (2003: £52m) of cover within
the Group for losses in the residential mortgage book. Further
cover is provided through insurance of risk with external insurers. 
The Personal Banking provision decreased from £115m to 
£110m. Provisions increased as a result of growth in lending
balances, but this was more than offset by the sale of the
remaining non-performing element of the credit card book 
in the ﬁrst half of 2004, which removed all remaining credit 
card balances and provisions. The Personal Banking provision
represents 3.43% of gross balances. The comparable ﬁgure for
2003, excluding credit cards, was 3.70%. 
The Commercial Banking lending book is split between ‘big ticket’
structured finance transactions of £1.8bn (December 2003: 
£1.4bn) and other commercial loans and smaller ‘ticket’ leases
of £2.9bn (December 2003: £2.7bn). The total level of provisions 
at 31 December 2004 was £20m (December 2003: £30m),
representing 0.4% (2003: 0.7%) of gross balances. The fall in
provisions reﬂects principally the write off of a fully provided loan.
In addition, there is a further £7m residual value provision against
the carrying value of operating lease assets. The vast majority 
of the £1.8bn ‘big ticket’ portfolio is guaranteed by banks.
Pensions
The total charge to the Group’s proﬁts in respect of pensions was
£25.4m for 2004 (2003: £24.6m). Under FRS 17, at 31 December
2004 the net retirement beneﬁts liability was £60.3m (2003:
£144.1m). This includes the effect of a one-off contribution
of £114m. This is explained further in Note 40 on pages 63 to 65.
Taxation
A corporation tax rate of 30% (2003: 30%) has been used in
preparing these results. The tax charge for the year of £168.1m 
(2003: £145.5m) represents 27.6% of profit before tax 
(2003: 27.7%).
Included within the £168.1m corporation tax charge is £17.3m 
in respect of the £52.0m proﬁt on disposal of group operations
(sale of merchant acquiring business) shown in the proﬁt and 
loss account after operating proﬁt. Excluding this, the underlying
effective tax rate for 2004 was 27.1%. Annual Report & Accounts 2004 17

Dividends
A ﬁnal dividend of 32.6p per share is proposed, giving a total
dividend of 48.3p for the year, up 10% on 2003. This compares 
to underlying basic earnings per share of 88.2p. 
The underlying dividend cover in 2004 was 1.9 (2003: 1.8), based
on post-tax proﬁt excluding the sale of the merchant acquisition
business, divided by dividends payable.

and advances to banks decreased by £2.5bn to £12.8bn, partly
reﬂecting the fall in short term money market funds following the
strong inﬂow in December 2003. The balance sheet growth was
funded primarily by an increase in customer accounts and debt
securities in issue.

(December 2003: 7.4%).
During 2004 the Group repurchased and cancelled 17.6m shares,
at a total cost of £152.8m. In March 2004 the Group issued
£300m of non-equity tier 1 capital, resulting in an increase in 
the total tier 1 ratio to 8.4% at 31 December 2004.
The fall in deductions was primarily due to the changes in legal
entity structure following the ceasing of underwriting activities 
in our insurance businesses. 
The Group’s proﬁt ratios compared to 2003 were as follows:

International Financial Reporting Standards 
We are currently working on restating our 2004 results on an IFRS basis. This will form the 2004 comparative results which we will
disclose in the 2005 interim and annual results. These restatements will be on both a statutory basis (excluding IAS 39) and a proforma
basis (including the impact of IAS 39, other than hedge ineffectiveness). They will also include the restated opening reserves positions 
at 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2005. 
The Group is planning to provide this 2004 information in an announcement to be issued towards the end of May 2005, giving an
explanation of the changes from UK GAAP to IFRS. At this point the IFRS statutory comparative ﬁgures and opening reserves will have
been audited.
Our view of the key areas that will be affected by IFRS, and the current estimates of these impacts, are shown in the table below.
These numbers have not been audited and are therefore subject to change.
Impact on 2004 Impact on 2005
Profit & Loss Account Opening Reserves
Statutory Proforma
£m £m £m
Mortgages and Loans at Amortised Cost – IAS 39
Under UK GAAP the Group generally recognises discounts, incentives, fees and costs to proﬁt as 
incurred. Under the effective interest rate rules in IAS 39, all discounts and incentives, and most 
fees and commissions receivable and payable, are spread over the average life of the loan. N/a 0 to +20 +50 to +100
Impairment – IAS 39
From January 2005 the Group can only provide for losses on an incurred basis. This will reduce 
the level of provisions held within the Group. N/a 0 to +20 0 to +50
Re-recognition of Financial Liabilities at their contractual value
Under IFRS it is not possible to de-recognise any contractual ﬁnancial liability. As a consequence 
amounts de-recognised and taken to proﬁt during 2004 under UK GAAP will be restated. 0 to -20 0 to -20 0 to -50
Pension Fund Deﬁcit 
The pension fund deﬁcit of £65.3m, and the existing SSAP 24 prepayment of £264.1m, less 
associated corporation tax, will be written off to reserves. N/a N/a -200 to -250
Finance Leases 
Finance Leases will be accounted for on a pre-tax actuarial basis rather than a post-tax basis. 
The overall return from a transaction will not change, but proﬁts will be recognised later in 
a transaction compared to UK GAAP. 0 to -20 0 to -20 0 to -50
Operating Leases
The calculation of operating lease depreciation will change from an actuarial basis to a straight 
line basis. This will lead to higher depreciation in the early years of a lease but lower depreciation 
towards the end of a lease. 0 to -20 0 to -20 0 to -50

Fair Value of Derivatives – IAS 39
Derivatives will be brought on to the Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value taken

Overall, the impact on the Group 2004 proforma proﬁt and loss account is expected to be a reduction of pre-tax proﬁt of between 
£10m and £30m, less than 5% of total pre-tax proﬁt. Earnings per share will be reduced by a similar proportion. The impact on 
opening reserves at 1 January 2005 is an estimated overall change of between plus and minus £25m, less than 5% of opening reserves.
Due to the different regulatory capital treatment for pensions, cashﬂow hedges and available for sale assets, the overall beneﬁcial impact

Financial Review
Risk management and control
As a result of its normal business activities, the Group is exposed 
to a variety of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are operational
risk, credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The following table
details the work of the main committees that have been
established within the Group to manage these risks:-

policy in these 
areas to GCPC.
Operational risk
Operational risk is deﬁned as ‘the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems 
or from external events’. Within the Group operational risk 
is sub- categorised by type such as criminal, legal, systems 
failure and personnel risk.
The Group monitors its operational risks through a variety 
of techniques. These include the six monthly Group internal
control certiﬁcation by senior management undertaken across all
the Group’s business areas. This process includes an operational 
risk self-assessment schedule which sets out both likelihood and
ﬁnancial impact of operational risk exposures. Output from the 
self assessment process is used to calculate unexpected loss and
economic capital for operational risk. Also the Group Board is
presented with a monthly dashboard assessing the extent 
of each of the Group’s key operational risks. In addition the 
Group compiles and reports on actual operational loss events.
An independent operational risk function has the overall
responsibility for establishing the framework within which
operational risk is managed and for its consistent application 
across the Group. The framework is based on industry best 
practice and anticipated regulatory requirements. Day to day
management of operational risk rests with line managers. It is
managed through a combination of internal controls, processes
and procedures and various risk mitigation techniques, including
insurance and business continuity planning.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss where counterparties are not
able to meet their obligations as they fall due. The Group is ﬁrmly
committed to the management of this risk in both its retail and
wholesale lending activities.
The Group employs sophisticated credit scoring, behavioural
scoring, underwriting and fraud detection techniques to support
sound decision making and minimise losses in its lending activities.
Behavioural scoring also operates within the personal account
management and collections processes. A proactive approach to
the control of bad and doubtful debts is maintained within the
collections areas. 
Experienced credit and risk functions operate within the Group,
and are driven both by the recognised need to manage the
potential and actual risks, and also by the need to continually
develop new processes to ensure sound decisions into the future.
In this way, any variations in risk from market, economic or
competitive changes are identiﬁed and the appropriate controls
developed and put in place. 
Comprehensive management information on movement and
performance within the various personal and wholesale portfolios
ensure that credit risk is effectively controlled and trends identiﬁed
prior to any potential impact on performance. Group performance
is also measured against the industry, where appropriate, to ensure
debt default levels remain below that of the industry average. 
This management information is distributed widely across the
Group and monitored within tight boundaries at Board and 
credit policy committees. 
Policy statements covering, amongst other things, criteria to be
used in considering limits on counterparties and countries, are
reviewed at least annually by the GCPC. Authorised limits on 
a counterparty are determined following rigorous analysis giving 
due consideration to both internal and external credit ratings. 
Market risk
Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or 
the value of Group net worth arising from movements in interest
rates, exchange rates or other market prices. Market risk exists to
some extent in all the Group’s businesses. The Group recognises
that the effective management of market risk is essential to the
maintenance of stable earnings and the preservation 
of shareholder value.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is governed by a policy
approved by the GCPC. This policy sets out the nature of risk
which may be taken and aggregate risk limits. Based on these
aggregate limits, the ALCO assigns risk limits to all Group
businesses and monitors compliance with these limits. Each
business has its own market risk policy which is approved by 
the ALCO. At each meeting the ALCO reviews reports showing 
the Group’s exposure to market and liquidity risks. 
The Group has established a transfer pricing system with the
intention of transferring materially all of the market risks that 
arise in the various Group businesses to Group Treasury. Most 
of the Group’s market risk is transferred to Group Treasury by 
way of appropriate hedging arrangements. Group Treasury plays 
a pivotal role in managing the Group’s market risk. Group Treasury
acts as a ‘Risk Clearing House’, managing these risks within its 
own limits, and seeks to take advantage of natural hedges within
the Group’s businesses. 
Market risk is measured and reported using a variety of techniques,
according to the appropriateness of the technique to the exposure
concerned. The techniques used include interest rate gap analysis,
basis point value analysis, scenario analysis and value at risk. Financial Review continued
20 Alliance & Leicester
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the most signiﬁcant market risk to which the
Group is exposed. This risk mainly arises from mismatches between
the re-pricing dates of the interest bearing assets and liabilities on
the Group’s balance sheet, and from the investment proﬁle of the
Group’s reserves and other net non-interest bearing liabilities.
Outside of Group Treasury, interest rate risk primarily arises in the
Group’s mortgage, savings, personal and commercial loans and
leasing businesses. The exposure in these portfolios is hedged 
with Group Treasury using interest rate swaps and other
appropriate instruments.
Net non-interest bearing liabilities comprise mainly interest-free
personal and corporate current accounts and shareholders’ funds,
and totalled £4.7bn at 31 December 2004 (2003: £4.3bn).
Wherever it decides to invest these funds, the Group is exposed 
to market risk – if the funds are invested short term net interest
income will be very volatile but the market value of the assets will
be relatively stable, whilst investing the funds longer term will
achieve more stability in net interest income but at the expense 
of greater volatility in the market value of the assets. In balancing
these two extremes the Group’s objective is to minimise volatility 
in net interest income over the medium term. 
A full interest rate repricing table is shown in Note 43 on Page 67. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s policy is not to run material, speculative foreign
exchange positions.
The Group offers foreign exchange services to customers through
both Group Treasury and Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank,
and detailed limits and controls are established within those
businesses to control the exposure. Alliance & Leicester
Commercial Bank clears its positions with Group Treasury 
in accordance with the policy of transferring market risk 
positions to Group Treasury wherever possible.
As part of its normal operations Group Treasury raises and invests
funds in currencies other than Sterling. The foreign exchange risks
of these activities are hedged within Group Treasury’s limits.
Equity risk
The Group markets equity related products to its customers,
including guaranteed stock market bonds. The Group’s policy 
is to have no material exposure to equity markets. The exposures
arising from the Group’s products are eliminated as far as is
practicable by appropriate hedging contracts.
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to ensure that sufﬁcient liquid assets are 
at all times available to meet the Group’s obligations including 
the withdrawal of customer deposits, the draw-down of customer
facilities and growth in the balance sheet. The development and
implementation of policy is the responsibility of the ALCO. 
The day to day management of liquidity is the responsibility 
of Group Treasury, which provides funding to and takes surplus
funds from each of the Group’s businesses as required.
Liquidity policy is approved by the GCPC and agreed with 
the Financial Services Authority. Limits on potential cashﬂow
mismatches over deﬁned time horizons are the principal basis 
of liquidity control. The size of the Group’s holdings of readily
realisable liquid assets is primarily driven by such 
potential outﬂows.
Derivatives
A derivative is an off balance sheet agreement which deﬁnes
certain ﬁnancial rights and obligations which are contractually
linked to interest rates, exchange rates or other market prices.
Derivatives are an efﬁcient and cost effective means of managing
market risk and limiting counterparty exposures and are an
indispensable tool in treasury management. Derivatives are
primarily used by the Group for balance sheet management
purposes. However the bank also runs trading book positions 
in derivatives; details of the level of interest rate risk in the 
trading book are contained in Note 43 on page 68.
Types of derivatives and uses
The principal derivatives used in balance sheet risk management
are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements (FRAs), futures,
interest rate options and foreign exchange contracts which 
are used to hedge balance sheet exposures arising from fixed 
and capped rate mortgage lending, personal and commercial 
loans, leasing arrangements, ﬁxed rate savings products, 
funding and investment activities and foreign exchange 
services to customers.
The following table describes the signiﬁcant activities undertaken
by the Group, the related risks associated with such activities and
the types of derivatives which are typically used in managing such
risks. These risks may alternatively be managed using on balance
sheet instruments or natural hedges that exist in the Group
balance sheet.

Control of derivatives
With the exception of credit exposures, which are managed within
policies approved by the GCPC, all limits over the use of derivatives
are the responsibility of the ALCO. 
All exchange traded instruments are subject to cash requirements
under the standard margin arrangements applied by the individual
exchanges and are not subject to signiﬁcant credit risk. Other
derivatives contracts are on an ‘Over the Counter’ basis with OECD
ﬁnancial institutions. The exposures arising from these contracts are
shown in Note 43 to the Accounts on page 69. Directors’ Report

representing 3.95% of the Company’s issued capital as at 31
December 2004. The aggregate consideration (including stamp
duty) paid for the shares was £152.8m. The purpose of the share
buyback programme was to reduce the equity tier 1 capital ratio 
to within our target range of 7.0%-7.5% by the end of 2004.
Capital efﬁciency remains a key ﬁnancial objective and shareholder
authority will again be sought, at the Annual General Meeting, 
for the Company to purchase in the market up to 44.6 million 
of its shares, representing some 10% of the issued share capital,
in order to retain ﬂexibility in managing the Company’s 
capital requirements.
Auditors
A resolution re-appointing Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
Company’s auditors and authorising the Group Audit & Risk
Committee to determine their remuneration will be proposed 
at the Annual General meeting.

24 Alliance & Leicester
The following report contains extracts from
our 2004 Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) Report, the third annual report we
have produced outlining our CSR-related
activities and which is published on the
Group’s CSR website (www.alliance-
leicester-csr.co.uk).
Our Marketplace
Access to products and services 
We aim to provide our customers with
simple and straightforward access to our
products and services. Our branches
operate across the whole of the UK, and
our personal current account and card-
based savings account customers, as well 
as our commercial customers, can also use
around 15,000 Post Ofﬁces across the UK
to deposit and withdraw cash. Each of our
core Retail Banking products can be bought
or serviced over the telephone or via the
internet, and we have more than 500,000
customers using our internet banking
package to service their current and savings
accounts. We also have over 2,500 Alliance
& Leicester ATM machines across the UK
which provide our customers with free
access to their money. Our customers can
also withdraw money at over 50,000 LINK
branded ATM machines.
We take considerable care to ensure 
good access to our products and services
for all parts of the community. We have 
a Customer Disability Support Unit,
dedicated to providing customers who
have disabilities with the support necessary
for them to operate their account. This
includes aids for customers with visual or
hearing impairments and those with special
needs. We are a subscriber to the national
disabled access register, DirectEnquiries,
accessible via www.directenquiries.com. 
All of our branches are listed on the
register, together with the facilities available
to customers with additional needs. 
Our new and refurbished branches are
designed, wherever possible, to make them
more convenient and accessible for our
customers. We have over the past year
invested over £1.5m in providing accessible
services for our customers who have
additional needs.
Treating customers fairly 
The Board has recently approved a formal
policy to show our commitment to the
principle of treating customers fairly and 
to taking responsibility for embedding it in
the culture of the Group. We have reviewed
how we interact with customers at every
stage in the product life cycle and for 
each stage speciﬁed key principles for how
we will deliver the concept of treating
customers fairly. We will continue to work
with the Financial Services Authority to
ensure that our practices are in line with
industry best practice on this issue.
Business ethics
Our Key Business Principles can be found 
in the policies section of the Group’s CSR
website – www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
These encapsulate the Group’s business
ethics and have been endorsed by the
Board and communicated to our
employees through the Group’s intranet.
Our core policies are regularly reviewed 
by the Directors and our Group Audit &
Risk Committee has the responsibility of
reviewing and approving them. 
Responsible and ethical lending
Alliance & Leicester is both an ethical 
and a responsible lender. 
When lending money to customers we 
aim to ensure that they understand the
product they are buying and can afford to
repay the amount borrowed. Our lending
processes comply with a wide number of
regulatory standards and industry codes 
of practice and we also work closely with
the police and other relevant agencies to
ensure that we do not facilitate fraudulent
or illegal activities.
Although all lending applications are
considered in their own right, there 
are some sectors in which we do not
operate. As part of our lending strategy 
we do not offer self-certiﬁed mortgages,
participate in ﬁnancing Sovereign debt 
to Third World countries, provide funding
for the tobacco manufacturing industry,
knowingly support customers whose
business activities give rise to exploitation
of children or minority groups, lend to 
any individual or business whose activities
could lead to reputational damage to
Alliance & Leicester, lend to any individual
that we know to have an unspent criminal
conviction, or lend to any individual
entitled to claim diplomatic immunity.
We do not invest directly in corporate
bonds, emerging markets, venture capital
or hedge funds.
All of our personal customer loan
applications are credit scored, a well 
proven method of determining an
individual’s ability to repay. Credit scoring
takes into account the customers’ details 
as submitted in their application forms 
as well as an independent review of the
customer’s payment behaviour from 
credit reference agencies. In addition, 
all applications must pass an affordability
test which takes into account a number 
of elements of a person’s outgoings,
including the servicing costs of 
the customer’s outstanding loans 
and mortgages.
As a result of our responsible approach 
and rigorous underwriting processes, our
book has a lower level of arrears than the
industry average for both the mortgage
and personal unsecured loan sectors.
It is not easy to tell customers that we 
will not lend to them because we believe
they may not be able to afford to repay the
loan. It is, however, in the interests of our
customers and our shareholders that we
take this responsible approach. We believe
it is better to have a difﬁcult conversation
before advancing a loan than have to
repossess a property at a later date. 
As part of our sales process we offer all our
mortgage and unsecured loan customers
the opportunity to buy credit protection
insurance products. These products cover 
a customer’s monthly loan repayments for
a speciﬁed period of time should certain
events occur. We seek to fully inform our
customers of the terms and conditions
relating to our payment protection
insurance to ensure that it best meets their
needs. We also offer a 30 day ‘cooling off’
period to enable our customers to change
their mind should they wish to do so.
In our Retail Banking business, there 
will inevitably be some customers who 
do experience difﬁculties in repaying 
their loans. We treat these customers
sympathetically. We also support a number
of external organisations who are able 
to provide independent advice to these
customers and help them resolve their
repayment problems. We support the
Money Advice Trust and Citizens Advice
Bureau and also direct customers who are
experiencing difﬁculties towards Payplan
and the Consumer Credit Counselling
Service (CCCS), two organisations who
specialise in managing debt repayment
difﬁculties. The Group has supported these
latter two organisations with donations 
of over £250,000 over the past two years,
and has also committed further ﬁnancial
support to the Citizens Advice Bureau and 
Money Advice Trust for their ‘Towards 
a National Support Service for Money
Advisers’ project.
We do not manufacture life assurance 
or long term investment products. These
are provided for our customers by Legal 
& General, who have their own socially
responsible investment guidelines. Similarly,
Alliance & Leicester branded credit cards
are provided by MBNA who are the world’s
largest independent credit card provider.
MBNA is an ethical company that invests 
its money responsibly.
Within our Commercial Banking business,
our lending decisions are based upon a
  Annual Report & Accounts 2004 25
CSR Report
thorough individual customer assessment,
including the use of credit scoring
techniques for smaller business banking
customers. In reaching a decision we also
recognise our wider duty to act as a lender
of integrity, having due regard to our wider
responsibilities to society, the communities
we serve and to customers, shareholders
and employees.
Creditor payment policy
We continue to be a signatory of the 
DTI’s Better Payment Practice Code, 
details of which can be found at
www.payontime.co.uk. Our policy is to
agree the terms of payment at the start of
business with a supplier, ensure suppliers
are aware of the payment terms, and pay
in accordance with any contractual and
other legal obligations.
Trade creditors of the company for the year
ended 31 December 2004 were 29 days
(2003: 29 days), based on the ratio of
company trade creditors at the end of the
year to the amounts invoiced during the
year by trade creditors.
Our Workplace
Responsibility for all employee related
matters, including health and safety, 
rests with the Group’s Director of Group
Human Resources, who reports to the
Group Chief Executive. We believe in
providing appropriate levels of reward and
recognition for our employees. In addition
to basic remuneration, we also provide
bonus schemes and a number of schemes
aimed at recognising and rewarding
excellent customer service. All our staff
have the ability to share in the success 
of the Company through a range of share
schemes and well over 90% of employees
are shareholders in the company.
Diversity and equal opportunities
We are committed to equality of
opportunity for all our employees. We 
will not condone discrimination on the
grounds of sex, race or national origin,
colour, religious belief, disability (mental 
or physical), marital status, age or sexual
orientation. We have an equal opportunities
policy, agreed with our trade unions.
We already operate a number of diversity
forums, including a Women in Business
programme, together with a joint Equal
Opportunities and Disability Forum with
our trade unions, which provides support
and guidance on diversity issues. In 2004
an ‘Equal Opportunities and You’ booklet
was distributed to all employees, containing
information on equal opportunities issues. 
Learning and development
We are keen to provide our employees 
with a range of training and development
courses to ensure they have the knowledge
and skills necessary to carry out their
responsibilities effectively, and to fulﬁl their
career potential within the business. 
During 2004 we have spent £4m to
support improved staff performance. 
This equates to an average spend per
employee of £500. On average, staff 
will complete 3 days of development 
per year, 95% of which will be workshop
based, the remainder ‘on the job’,
including e-learning. 
During 2004, the Financial Services
Authority introduced new regulations 
on the conduct of mortgage business. 
A major training exercise was undertaken,
with the Group’s staff being trained in
these new rules and sales processes. To
deliver this amount of training in the short
period available without causing signiﬁcant
disruption to the business, a series of 
e-learning packages for each of the
regulations were developed and made
available to staff via the Group intranet.
Health & safety
It is our policy to provide a safe and healthy
working environment for our staff, our
customers and our contractors. Although
ﬁnancial sector employment is generally
regarded as low risk, every occupation
involves its own hazards with the potential
for injury, damage or loss.
Alliance & Leicester has a well established
health and safety committee structure in
place, which involves both management
and trade union representatives.
Bullying and harassment
Alliance & Leicester has a robust policy
against bullying and harassment, developed
in partnership with our union colleagues.
Public interest disclosures
We are committed to ensuring that 
any suspicion of malpractice is reported
and therefore encourage all employees 
to raise any genuine concerns about
potential malpractice at the earliest
practicable stage. The Group treats 
all such concerns very seriously. 
All staff initially report any concerns, 
in conﬁdence, to the Director of Group
Human Resources, the Group Secretary
or the Head of Money Laundering.
Disciplinary policy
Alliance & Leicester has a formal
disciplinary policy. The aim of the policy 
is to be corrective rather than punitive 
and it is in line with the ACAS Code of
Practice on discipline at work. It sets
reasonable standards of performance and
behaviour and aims to ensure consistency
and fairness of treatment of all employees
when these standards are not met.
Grievance procedures
Alliance & Leicester has a formal grievance
policy and procedure which is in line with
ACAS guidelines and enables employees 
to raise a grievance or a dispute either
individually or collectively.
Use of the grievance procedure is not
recorded if it is dealt with at ﬁrst line
management level. We ﬁnd this more
informal approach works well. During 2004
there have been fewer than 10 grievances
that have gone further than this ﬁrst level.
Freedom of association and collective
bargaining
The Group recognises the Communications
Workers Union (CWU), Alliance & Leicester
Group Union of Staff (ALGUS) and the
Public and Commercial Services Union
(PCS) for collective bargaining purposes.
We enjoy good relations with these
recognised unions and endeavour to
involve their representatives at all levels. 
For example, union representatives are
invited to attend our regular senior
management brieﬁngs.
Forced child labour
The Group’s operations are all based in the
British Isles and our products are aimed at
UK-based customers, or expatriates. We are
not involved in forced or child labour.
International human rights and 
indigenous rights
All of our operations are based in the 
British Isles, and all our products are aimed
at UK-based customers or expatriates. 
In this context, human rights and
indigenous rights issues are not material 
for the Group, nor does our behaviour
signiﬁcantly impact on such issues.
Our Community
Our Director of Corporate
Communications, who reports directly to
the Group Chief Executive, is responsible
for community affairs.
During 2004 we have reviewed our
community investment and charitable
donations programmes and identiﬁed ﬁve
key areas of focus: supporting our staff’s
efforts in raising money for charity through
the Group’s Matched Donation Scheme,
supporting initiatives aimed at improving
both local and national education,
supporting organisations who help those
who are experiencing ﬁnancial difﬁculties,
supporting charities and organisations
within the local communities in which 
our staff live and work, and supporting
organisations who aim to improve the links
between businesses and the communities
in which they operate. Corporate Social Responsibility continued
26 Alliance & Leicester
During 2004, we again increased the
amount of money invested in our local
communities. Donations for charitable
purposes amounted to £690,000, a 4%
increase compared to 2003. In addition to
these donations our corporate community
investment programme has given support
to a number of local organisations. In 2004
we have invested over £350,000 in local
community events and programmes, an
increase of 6% compared to 2003.
Our staff play a key role in our relationships
with our local communities. The estimated
value of our staff volunteering efforts, gifts
in kind such as the use of ofﬁce space, 
and other non-ﬁnancial gifts to our local
communities, amounted to a further
£180,000 in 2004. 
We also support our staff wishing to give
donations to charities through payroll
giving. In 2004 a total of £31,500 was
donated to various charities through this
scheme, which the Charity Aid Foundation
manages on behalf of the Group. The
administration costs of the scheme are 
met by the Group.
In 2004 our branches helped raise 
around £500,000 for a variety of charities.
A key element of our community
investment programme is supporting
charities and projects involved in improving
the educational standards of young people
and their general ﬁnancial literacy.
Examples during 2004 include continuing
to support our staff who volunteer to 
help primary children improve their 
reading through the Right to Read scheme,
providing support to the Leicester Learning
Zone, which is working with schools across
the city of Leicester to raise education
standards, and supporting the Hamilton
Trust education charity by sponsoring 
their planning packs for newly qualiﬁed
teachers. We have also continued to
support the National Gallery’s ‘Take 
One Picture’ educational web site –
www.takeonepicture.org. 
Our efforts in encouraging our staff to
volunteer to be school governors were
acknowledged during 2004 when we
received a national award from the school
governor recruitment campaign School
Governors’ One-Stop Shop.
During 2004 we launched a partnership
with Soar Valley Community College 
in Leicester, donating £50,000 which
enabled the school to gain Specialist School
status in Maths and Computing, and access
to over £1m of Government money over
the next 8 years. We are currently working
with Soar Valley to set up a number of
initiatives through which our staff can play
an active role in the development of 
the school. 
Our Environment
Environmental best practice is, wherever
reasonably practicable, incorporated into
our decision making processes. We invest 
in environmentally friendly and sustainable
products and services where it is practical
to do so. Environmental risk is part of 
the Group’s overall Risk Management
Framework which is monitored by the
Group Audit & Risk Committee.
The Group’s environmental policy, which 
is applied consistently across the whole
Group, is the responsibility of the Managing
Director, Wholesale Banking, an executive
director and member of the Board who 
is also responsible for the Group’s Supply
Chain Management department. 
During 2004 we have developed 
and implemented an Environmental
Management System (EMS), providing 
a framework to ensure that we maintain
focus on the environmental stewardship 
of our buildings, working environment, 
and the activities of our employees 
and suppliers.
Alliance & Leicester’s principal direct
environmental impacts are through the
buildings we operate, the staff working
within them and the resources used by 
staff in their day to day work. The Group’s
environmental activity is, therefore, focused
on the key areas of energy and water,
transport, waste and pollution, and the
working environment.
The Group complies with all legal 
and other environmental requirements 
and these are monitored through the
appropriate responsible department. 
There has been no legal action incurred as
a result of any environmental issues during
2004. We continue to be accredited under
the Energy Efﬁciency Accreditation Scheme,
run by the Institute of Energy and the
National Energy Foundation. During 2004
we continued to enter Business in the
Community’s annual BiE environment index
and saw our score improve for the third
consecutive year.
The nature of the Group’s business means
that many of our environmental issues are
focused on our buildings. We employ
facilities management companies to ensure
that our buildings are well maintained. 
We conduct environmental risk assessments
at the feasibility design stage of any new
ofﬁce development and ensure that all
major projects are assessed on the Building
Research Establishment Environmental
Assessment Method (BREEAM) to achieve 
a ‘very good’ rating as a minimum.
The Group’s energy usage is reported
monthly to the Group Board and our
energy costs in 2004 represented less than
0.5% of the Group’s overall operating costs.
During 2004, our usage of both gas and
water has reduced compared to 2003. 
Our usage of electricity has risen primarily
due to increased use of air conditioning in
our main administration centres. Whilst the
usage has increased this is all now supplied
from renewable sources and hence carbon
dioxide emissions have fallen. Statutory Accounts

For the Year Ended 31 December 2004

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A 
of the Companies Act 1985, which sets out the statutory
requirements for disclosure on directors’ remuneration and 
the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration Committee
Role
The Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) is responsible for
determining the pay and beneﬁts and contractual arrangements
for the Chairman, executive directors and the Group Secretary, 
and for overseeing the Group’s Share Schemes. The Committee
also recommends and monitors the structure and levels of
remuneration for senior managers throughout the Group. In
fulﬁlling its role, the Committee develops and recommends to the
Board remuneration strategies that drive performance and reward
that performance appropriately. It operates under the delegated
authority of the Board and its Terms of Reference are available 
to view on the Group’s website – www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk. 
It is committed to principles of accountability and transparency 
to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a clear 
link between reward and performance. In its work, the Committee
considers fully the principles and provisions of the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance.
Membership 
The Committee comprises the following non-executive directors:
Mr M P S Barton
(Committee Chairman and senior independent 
non-executive director)
Mr M J Allen
The Hon. D Brougham
Mr R M McTighe
Mrs M Salmon (from 1 December 2004)
Miss F A Cairncross and Mr E J Watts were members of the
Committee until 1 December 2004.
The Group Secretary, Mr T S Lloyd, acted as secretary to the
Committee throughout 2004, and provided professional assistance
to the Committee on governance issues. 
Meetings
The directors’ attendance at Committee meetings held during their
period of membership and the number of meetings held during
2004 is set out on page 38. The Chairman, Mr J R Windeler, the
Group Chief Executive, Mr R A Pym, and the Director of Human
Resources, Ms F Rodford, are invited to attend the Committee
meetings, except when the Committee discusses matters relating
to their personal remuneration. 
Advisers
The Committee used the services of Towers Perrin during the 
year to provide general remuneration advice and comparator
information, and Mercer Human Resource Consulting (“Mercer”)
to advise speciﬁcally on pension related issues. With the agreement
of the Committee, the Company’s external auditor – Deloitte 
& Touche LLP – continues to provide specialist advice on the
Group’s Share Schemes. Mercer also act as actuaries and 
advisers to the Group’s pension scheme and advise the 
Company on matters relating to its operation.
The Committee consults with the Chairman and Group Chief
Executive, as appropriate, and is also supported by Ms F Rodford,
the Director of Human Resources.
Remuneration Policy
The Board’s remuneration policy remains to attract and retain high
calibre executives, with individual rewards and incentives being
aligned with the performance of the Group and with the interests
of the shareholders. Remuneration for executive directors is
intended to reward both individual and company performance
measured against performance criteria that are relevant and
realistic but also challenging, so that good performance is
encouraged. Therefore, remuneration arrangements will 
continue to focus on incentive plans that encourage delivery 
of operating plans and shareholder value. 
Also, under Committee guidelines, each executive director is
required to build up over a period of ﬁve years and retain, whilst 
a director, a minimum holding of shares in the Company
equivalent to his or her annual basic salary.
For 2005 and beyond, annual salary will continue to be set at 
levels not normally exceeding market median, whilst bonuses 
and long term incentive plans will reﬂect market upper quartile
competitive levels and be based on achieving targets.
Proposed Changes to Long Term Incentives from 2005 
Shareholder approval will be sought for the following proposed
changes to the bonus and long term incentive arrangements for
executive directors.
Proposed Structure
Target annual bonus level will be 75% of salary, capped at 
a maximum of 150% of salary. A bonus will be payable on
achievement of corporate and individual performance targets and 
at the discretion of the Committee. There will be a requirement
to take at least 25% of the bonus in the form of shares, deferred
for 3 years, for any individual who has not yet met the
shareholding guideline. 
The share-matching element of the Deferred Bonus Scheme, 
which carries an absolute maximum beneﬁt of 300% of salary, 
will be replaced with a long-term incentive plan. The new plan 
will provide for a maximum annual award of 200% of salary, 
but the annual award will normally be over shares to the value 
of 125% of annual salary. Vesting of the award will be subject 
to performance conditions. More detail of the new plan is set 
out under Long Term Incentive Schemes on page 30. 
Existing Structure
Target annual bonus level is 60% of salary with a maximum
potential bonus level of 200% of salary. A bonus will be payable 
on achievement of corporate and individual performance targets
and at the discretion of the Committee. 25% of the bonus must 
be deferred into shares and each executive director has an
entitlement to defer up to 100% of the bonus. 
Any bonus that is deferred may be matched by the Company
depending on the Company’s relative Total Shareholder Return
performance against a group of its retail banking peers. The
maximum match available, for upper quartile achievement 
against this group, is 300% of the deferred amount.
It is intended to continue the policy of granting options on an
annual basis, with a typical total exercise price of 150% of annual
salary. Such options are only exercisable if the percentage growth
in earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeds the increase in the Retail
Price Index (“RPI”) by at least 9% over a three-year period. 
The facility of retesting the performance condition in the fourth 
or ﬁfth year will cease. More detail on the options is set out 
on pages 29 and 30.
  Performance Graph
The performance graph below shows the Company’s performance
in comparison with the FTSE 100 Index over the ﬁve years ended
31 December 2004. The FTSE Index was chosen as it is a broad
equity market index consisting of companies of similar complexity
and size to the Company. 
TSR Performance: 
Alliance & Leicester v FTSE 100, 01.01.2000 to 31.12.2004
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main components of the remuneration package for executive
directors are:
Basic Salary
Basic salary for executive directors takes into account the role,
responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. 
This is normally reviewed annually unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are set against background information from
independent advisers on salary levels for similar positions amongst 
a speciﬁc comparator group of ﬁnancial organisations and with
due regard to general salary trends within companies in the FTSE
100 Index, with individual salaries being then placed at a level that
reﬂects the personal contribution and experience of each executive
director. Details of salaries payable for 2004 are set out on page 31.
Annual Bonus 
At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors are eligible
to receive an annual performance bonus. 
For 2004, bonuses were contingent on achievement of one-year
performance targets set by the Committee. These comprise a mix
of corporate targets (revenue growth, cost reduction, pre-tax proﬁt
and growth in EPS) and individual personal performance targets.
The target annual bonus was 60% of salary with a maximum
achievable bonus of 200%. 
For 2005, bonuses will again be contingent on achievement of
performance targets set by the Committee. These will combine
corporate (pre-tax proﬁt and return on equity) and individual
performance targets. The bonus for on target performance will 
be 75% of salary, with a maximum of 150% of salary for
exceptional performance.
In order to encourage executive directors to build up a signiﬁcant
personal stake in the Company, they have been required to receive
one quarter of their annual bonus in the form of a deferred shares
option award which the Company will match, under the 2004
bonus arrangements, if related performance criteria are achieved
(see below under Long Term Incentive Scheme). Under the 2004
bonus arrangements, executive directors were able to voluntarily
defer up to 100% of their annual bonus (to a maximum of 100%
of salary) for this purpose. 
Annual Report & Accounts 2004 29
Remuneration Report
For 2005 and beyond, it is proposed that the requirement to take at
least one quarter of the annual bonus in deferred shares will continue
for any executive director who has not yet met the requirement 
to hold shares in the Company, equivalent to his or her basic salary,
but there will be no match of deferred shares by the Company.
The rights to deferred shares cannot normally be exercised for three
years and lapse if not exercised within seven years. Deferred shares
are not awarded within two years of an individual’s 60th birthday.
Bonuses are discretionary and are non-pensionable. 
There are share schemes for executive directors designed to align
the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
Share Options
Each executive director is eligible for the grant of options under
the Alliance & Leicester Approved and Unapproved Company
Share Option Schemes. The price at which shares can be acquired
on exercise of options is the market value of the shares on the day
prior to the date of grant. Accordingly, the share price has to rise
above the price at which the option is granted before an executive
director can beneﬁt. 
The aggregate value of new shares, for which options to subscribe
may be granted to each executive director in any year, cannot
normally exceed a maximum total annual award of two times 
basic salary, with a power for the Committee to increase this 
up to four times basic salary if it considers that this is warranted 
in exceptional circumstances. 
The value of shares subject to option grants has typically been 
up to one and a half times basic salary (two times for new
appointments), with the grants being made in two tranches
following the ﬁnal and interim results. Options cannot normally 
be exercised for three years from the date of grant. The
performance condition applied to grants is that options are
exercisable if the percentage growth in EPS exceeds the increase 
in the RPI by at least 9% over that three year period (grants, 
prior to 2002, have used a percentage between 6% and 9%). 
The Committee reviews this condition before each new grant
paying due regard to market practice. The Committee considers
this performance condition to be suitable and appropriate
as a means of focusing executive directors on generating 
earnings growth and accords with market practice. No options 
are awarded within two years of an individual’s 60th birthday. 
Options normally vest after three years subject to attainment 
of the relevant performance conditions. Provisions previously
existed for the retesting of performance after year 4 and year 
5, calculated from the base grant year and based on percentage
growth in EPS exceeding the increase in RPI by at least 12% (year
4) or 15% (year 5). No re-testing of performance will take place 
for grants made in 2005 and thereafter. Options granted prior to
2002 are subject to performance conditions that may be measured
over any three-year period, within the term of the option. 
Under the rules of the share option schemes, options are
exercisable prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant 
where an option holder ceases to be employed by the Company
by reason of death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy,
retirement or transfer of the employing company outside the
Group or at the discretion of the Committee in any other
circumstances. Also, in these circumstances, any performance
conditions attaching to the exercise of the options cease to apply.

FTSE 100 Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
For the Year Ended 31 December 2004
30 Alliance & Leicester
for 2004 and previous years but proposed to be replaced for 2005
and thereafter, the Company may match an award of deferred
shares on the basis of up to three matched shares for each deferred
share awarded. The maximum matched award is given for upper
quartile performance in terms of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)
measured relative to a peer group of retail banks. TSR measures 
the change in value of a share and reinvested income over the
period of measurement. The constituents of the peer group,
excluding the Company, are:
Barclays Bank plc Bradford & Bingley plc
HBOS plc Lloyds TSB Group plc
Northern Rock plc The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc
These banks were chosen because they are all in the ﬁnancial
services sector and are broadly comparable in the range of
activities undertaken. Awards only begin to vest when median
performance relative to the peer group is achieved, with linear
progression from one matching share at median performance 
up to three matching shares for upper quartile performance. 
The rights to matching shares cannot normally be exercised for
three years, except in the circumstances set out below, and lapse 
if not exercised within seven years. TSR is considered by the
Committee to be a suitable measure for this type of scheme, 
as it provides clear links with the creation of shareholder value.
Further details are set out on page 34.
Under the Deferred Bonus Scheme, options may be exercised 
prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant where the
executive director ceases to be employed by reason of death,
injury, ill-health, disability, retirement or at the discretion of the
Trustees to the Scheme (based on recommendations of the
Committee) in any other circumstances. Performance conditions
apply unless waived by the Committee and are normally subject 
to a three-year performance period, without re-testing. 
Performance Share Plan
From 2005, it is proposed that the Deferred Bonus Scheme will 
be replaced by a new Performance Share Plan (“Plan”), under
which the maximum annual award will normally be shares 
to the value of 125% of salary, with the Committee retaining
discretionary ﬂexibility to adjust this level up or down, having
regard to the performance of the business and the individual. 
Any adjustment is likely to be in the range of plus or minus 25% 
of salary with an absolute maximum annual award of 200% 
of annual salary. The performance period will be 3 years with 
no re-testing. The performance test will be in 2 parts:
• The vesting of 50% of the award will depend on the
performance of the Company’s TSR relative to a peer group 
of retail banks initially consisting of the following:
Allied Irish Banks plc Bank of Ireland Group
Barclays Bank plc Bradford & Bingley plc
HBOS plc HSBC plc
Lloyds TSB Group plc Northern Rock plc
Standard Chartered plc The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc
• 30% of the award will be payable at median performance and
maximum vesting will be for achieving upper quartile performance,
with straight line interpolation between these points. 
• The vesting of the other 50% of the award will depend on the
Company’s adjusted EPS growth relative to inﬂation over each
performance period. Vesting will begin when the adjusted EPS
growth equals RPI + 3% over the performance period and the
award will fully vest at a growth of RPI + 8% over the
performance period, with straight line interpolation between
these points.
In the event of a change of control of the Group taking place, the
Remuneration Committee, in its absolute discretion, will determine
the extent to which an award may vest, having regard to the
length of time that it has been held and the extent to which the
performance targets have been satisﬁed.
If an individual leaves the Group, an unvested award will normally
lapse. However, in exceptional circumstances (for example, as 
a result of retirement) the rules of the Plan allow awards to vest
early at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The shares required in connection with the Plan will be sourced
from market purchase or, subject to the usual dilution limits, 
new issue or treasury shares.
None of these beneﬁts will be pensionable.
Employee Share Schemes
Executive directors may also participate in the Company’s existing
Employee Share Schemes, including the Savings Related Share
Option Scheme and the Company’s Share Incentive Plan, on 
the same basis as all other employees. There are no performance
conditions attached to these schemes.
Service Contracts
Executive directors have service contracts that continue until
terminated by twelve months’ notice (but which in any event
terminate on their 60th birthday). 
The contractual provisions state that, if the employment 
of an executive director is terminated by the Company for 
any reason (other than due cause) without twelve months’ 
notice being given, the director is entitled to receive payment 
of twelve months’ basic salary and pension beneﬁts. In addition, 
the Committee, having regard to the individual director’s
performance for the period worked, may in its absolute
discretion, award a cash bonus in respect of the period worked.
Life insurance and medical insurance cover will be maintained 
for twelve months from the termination date. No such payments
of salary and pension beneﬁts, on termination by the Company,
will exceed a payment based on the number of months from 
the date of termination of employment to the executive 
director’s normal retirement date. There is no provision for 
receipt of additional compensation in the event of a change 
of control.
The executive directors may terminate their contracts of
employment at any time by giving six months’ prior notice.
Pensions
Executive directors are members of the Deﬁned Beneﬁt Section 
of the Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme, which has a normal
retirement age of 60. 
The main features of the pension promise for executive directors,
based on the standard terms of the Scheme, are:
(a) Pensions from age 60 of 1/60th of basic salary averaged 
over the last twelve months prior to retirement for each year 
of pensionable service.
(b) A cash beneﬁt on death in service of 4x annual rate of basic
salary at date of death.
(c) Pensions payable in the event of ill-health.
(d) Pensions for dependants on a member’s death are generally
equal to half the member’s prospective retirement pension at
60 on death in service, or half the member’s pension
entitlement on death in retirement.
Member contributions are 5% of basic salary. Annual Report & Accounts 2004 31
Remuneration Report
The following directors have special arrangements:
(a) Mr Pym and Mr Bennett are entitled to a pension of 2/3rd of
their ﬁnal pensionable salary on retirement at age 60 inclusive
of retirement beneﬁts from service at other organisations.
(b) Mr Pym is not required to contribute. Mr Bennett contributes
15% of the Earnings Cap. 
There is an unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement to
increase the pension and lump sum life assurance beneﬁt to 
the level promised, where, because of Inland Revenue limitations
(including those resulting from the Earnings Cap), these cannot 
be paid in total from the Scheme. Such arrangements apply to 
Mr Pym and Mr Bennett.
On retirement from service an executive director may, with the
consent of the employer, draw his accrued pension from the
Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme at any time after his 50th
birthday (subject to a reduction of 3% for each year by which
retirement precedes his 60th birthday). 
Pensions in payment are subject to contractual increases each 
April in line with the annual percentage rise in the RPI over the
previous calendar year, subject to a maximum of 5%.
There are no discretionary practices that are taken into account 
in calculating transfer values on leaving service.
The Committee is reviewing the impact of the Pension
Simpliﬁcation regime that is due to come into effect from 
April 2006 and will complete the review during 2005.
Other Benefits
Executive directors are eligible for a range of beneﬁts, which
include the provision of a company car, payment of car operating
expenses including fuel, concessionary mortgage facilities, life
assurance and membership of a private medical insurance scheme.
Other Directorships
The Group is supportive of executive directors who wish to take
one non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company 
in order to broaden their experience. They are entitled to retain
any fees they may receive. Mr R A Pym was appointed 
a non-executive director of Halfords plc on 17 May 2004. 
His fees for the period from 17 May 2004 to 31 December 
2004 were £37,300.
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee
and that of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board
as a whole, both in the light of recommendations by the Group
Chief Executive, based on comparator information, and within 
the limits speciﬁed in the Articles of Association of the Company. 
No non-executive director has an employment contract with the
Company. On joining the Board, non-executive directors are issued
with an appointment letter. 
New non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period 
of two years, which may be renewed for one or more terms 
of two years. An example of a non-executive director’s letter 
of appointment can be found on the Group’s web site 
www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk. 
Mr Windeler enjoys the beneﬁt of non-exclusive use 
of a chauffeured car for business purposes. 
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build up their
shareholding to 5,000 shares. No options have been, or will 
be, granted to any non-executive directors in their capacity 
as non-executive directors of the Company.
Non-executive directors who are in full-time employment with a
third party employer may elect to pay the whole or part of their
fees to it. Payments in respect of Mr Stone’s fees were made to 
his service company, and in respect of Mrs J V Barker are made 
to her employer. 
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon
early termination of an appointment. The non-executive directors
are not eligible for share options.

On behalf of the Board
M P S Barton
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
24 February 2005 Annual Report & Accounts 2004 35
Corporate Governance
Principles of Corporate Governance
The Board recognises and fully supports the value of good
corporate governance not only in the areas of accountability and
risk management but also as a positive contribution to business
prosperity. It believes that good corporate governance involves
applying the principles and provisions, as set out in the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (“Code”) issued by the Financial
Reporting Council in July 2003, in a sensible and pragmatic fashion,
having regard to the individual circumstances of the Group’s business.
The key objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value. 
Compliance Statement
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2004 the Company has
been in compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Code. How the Group has applied the principles, and complied
with those provisions is summarised in this statement.
Directors
Board Structure
The Board comprises the Chairman, seven independent non-
executive directors and four executive directors, who have the
collective responsibility for ensuring that the affairs of the Company
and its subsidiaries are managed competently and with integrity. 
The Chairman is Mr J R Windeler. The senior independent non-
executive director is the Deputy Chairman, Mr M P S Barton, and
Mr R A Pym is Group Chief Executive. The names of the Directors
in ofﬁce at the date of this report and their biographical details 
are set out on pages 22 and 23. 
The composition of the Board is kept under review, with the aim 
of ensuring that there is an appropriate balance of power and
authority between executive and non-executive directors, and that
the directors collectively possess the necessary skills and experience
for properly directing the Group’s business activities. 
The non-executive directors constructively challenge the
management team, and play a full part as members of the Board.
They bring a diversity of business perspective and objectivity which
complements the management expertise of their executive director
colleagues. The Chairman and non-executive directors meet
regularly without the executives present. 
The Board has determined that all non-executive directors 
are independent and free from any material business or other
relationship with the Group. 
Newly appointed directors submit themselves for election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst General Meeting after their appointment
and at least every three years thereafter. An induction programme
provides an understanding of the Group and its strategy, products,
markets and ﬁnancial position, as well as the legal responsibilities 
of a director. All directors make regular visits to the Company’s
operational locations. The appointment of non-executive directors
is documented in a letter, the standard terms of which are available
from the Group website at www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
Operation of the Board
The Board determines the Group’s strategic direction and
objectives. There is a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally
reserved to the Board, including the setting of corporate
objectives, major capital expenditure, annual budgets and
signiﬁcant changes to the Group’s structure and product range.
The Group Chief Executive is empowered to approve any matter
not reserved to the Group Board within agreed ﬁnancial limits, 
and in turn delegates the operational and ﬁnancial management 
of the business to the executive directors to achieve agreed
budgets and objectives.
There are scheduled Board meetings every month to review
operating, ﬁnancial and risk performance, management
performance against key targets and objectives, and internal
control reports. The Board also receives presentations from
individual business units.
Details of the number of Board and Committee meetings, and 
the attendance at those meetings, is set out on page 38. 
Procedures are in place which allow directors to take independent
professional advice in the course of their duties and all directors
have access to the advice and services of the Group Secretary.
Board Committees
There are several Committees with speciﬁed terms of reference 
to assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities. The terms
of reference for each of these Committees are available from the
Group website at www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprising non-executive directors
has the task of:
• evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience
required on the Board and the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and its Committees;
• recommending new appointments to the Board and reviewing
re-appointments when they become due;
• annually reviewing the performance of and the time required
from the non-executive directors and Board Committees;
• overseeing succession planning for the Board.
There is a formal succession and contingency plan in place for all
Board and Committee appointments. One additional independent
non-executive director, Mrs M Salmon, has been appointed to the
Board with the speciﬁc objective of increasing the breadth 
of recent human resources and retail management experience. 
A detailed candidate profile was prepared for this 
appointment and an external search consultancy retained 
to identify prospective candidates from which a short-list 
was presented to the Committee.
The Committee membership as at 24 February 2005 is:
Mr J R Windeler (Chairman) 
Mr M J Allen
Mr M P S Barton
Mrs M Salmon (from 1 December 2004)
Mr E J Watts

Group Audit & Risk Committee 
The Group Audit & Risk Committee supports the Board’s Corporate
Governance responsibilities, including risk management and
compliance with the Code.
The duties of the Committee fall into these areas: 
• Risk Management and Internal Control: the Committee reviews
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control and
risk management and monitors compliance with regulatory
requirements. To do this, the Committee reviews the annual
Group Risk Plan and approves the annual Internal Audit and
Compliance plans, which are based on thorough risk assessments
of the full scope of the Group’s business activities, and monitors
progress against the plans. Each meeting of the Committee
receives reports from the Director of Group Risk, Head of Group
Internal Audit, the Head of Group Compliance and the Money
Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer (“MLRO”) regarding the state of
risk management, internal control and compliance within the
Group. The Committee also receives, on behalf of the Board, 
the annual report from the MLRO. 
• Financial Reporting: the Committee’s role is to review on behalf
of the Board the Annual Report & Accounts and the Interim
Results, the Management Representations and Summary Annual
Report. The Committee focuses on reviewing any changes 
in accounting policy, major areas of judgement and 
estimates, and compliance with accounting principles 
and regulatory requirements.

* The Board considers that these non-executive members of the

Ms A Ward, Head of Group Internal Audit, is the Secretary of the
Group Audit & Risk Committee.
The Group Chief Executive, and other Executive Directors, Director
of Group Risk, Director of Accounting & Taxation, Group Secretary,
Head of Group Internal Audit, Head of Group Compliance and 
a Partner from the external auditors normally attend meetings. 
Other Group Board members are also invited to all meetings. 
The Chairman of the Committee has independent access to 
both internal and external auditors, and to the Group’s statutory
regulator, the Financial Services Authority.
The Committee is also responsible for recommending the
appointment and reappointment of the external auditors, the
appropriateness of the audit fee and the engagement letter,
ensuring that it has been updated to reﬂect changes in
circumstances arising since the previous year, any questions 
of resignation or dismissal of external auditors and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the audit process. In compliance with the
rotation requirements relating to audit engagement partners, 
there will be a change to the lead audit partner of our external
auditors for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The Group has a formal policy for the engagement of its external
auditors to supply non-audit services. The policy is designed to
ensure that neither the nature of the service to be provided nor 
the level of reliance placed on the service could impair the
objectivity of the external auditors’ opinion on the Group’s
ﬁnancial statements. The policy incorporates a comprehensive
system for reporting to the Group Audit & Risk Committee and 
the fees payable to the external auditors for non-audit services. 
The policy is available from the Group website at 
www.alliance-leicester-csr.co.uk.
The Committee also reviews arrangements by which staff may, 
in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters.
The Committee recognises the importance of maintaining a sound
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments
and the Group’s assets. Further information on the systems 
of business control appears later in this Statement. 
Other Committees
The Group Credit Policy Committee reviews all aspects of credit,
liquidity and market risk, and the Group Assets and Liabilities
Committee establishes strategies for, and monitors and controls,
the levels of balance sheet risk including liquidity, funding and
currency exposures across the Group, and the monitoring 
of interest rate reﬁxing proﬁles. The Chairman’s Committee 
is empowered to take urgent decisions between Board meetings 
and comprises the Chairman or a non-executive director, the
Deputy Chairman or another non-executive director, and the
Group Chief Executive or one other executive director.
Evaluation of Board Performance
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation 
of its own performance. All Board directors are required to
complete a detailed questionnaire which seeks to identify any 
areas in which improvements might be made to the information
provided to the Board or to the conduct of its proceedings. The
evaluation takes the form of a series of speciﬁc questions within
general subject headings, using the guidance provided in the
Code. The directors are required to score performance according
to a scale, and give qualitative comments where appropriate. 
The Board subsequently discusses the results of the evaluation and
uses the process to constructively improve the effectiveness of the
Board by maximising the strengths and tackling any weaknesses.
Board Committees undertake an annual evaluation of their
performance in the same way as the Board, and report their
ﬁndings and any resulting recommendations to the Board.
Individual performance evaluations of the Chairman and of the
non-executive directors takes place annually. All directors are
required to score performance according to a scale, and give
qualitative comments where appropriate. The evaluation results
enable the Chairman to discuss with individual directors their
particular contributions and commitment to the Group, and any
development action that may be required. The Nomination
Committee then receives the results of the individual 
evaluations to assist in its annual review of the performance 
and re-appointment of non-executive directors. The evaluation  Annual Report & Accounts 2004 37
Corporate Governance
of the Chairman is reviewed by the senior independent 
non-executive director and the Board. In addition, the 
non-executive directors meet at least once a year under the
guidance of the senior independent non-executive director 
to review the performance of the Chairman. 
The Chairman is responsible for appraising the performance 
of the Group Chief Executive against objective criteria agreed 
by the Remuneration Committee prior to the commencement 
of any appraisal period. The Chairman presents the results of 
his appraisal to the Remuneration Committee for consideration 
and determination of remuneration.
The Group Chief Executive is responsible for appraising the
performance of the other executive directors individually, against
objective criteria agreed by the Remuneration Committee prior 
to the commencement of any appraisal period. The Group 
Chief Executive presents the results of these appraisals to the
Remuneration Committee for consideration and determination 
of remuneration.

The Directors’ Remuneration Report can be found on pages 28 to
34 and sets out the Group’s remuneration policy, procedures and
the remuneration of individual directors and related information.
Accountability and Audit
Internal Control
The Group Audit & Risk Committee has regularly reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the 
year to 31 December 2004 on behalf of the Board, and has 
taken account of any material developments that may have 
taken place since the year end.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls
and for monitoring its effectiveness. The Group’s business involves
the identiﬁcation, acceptance and mitigation of risk, and appropriate
internal control systems have been implemented and embedded.
These systems of internal control are designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and provide reasonable assurance as to the effectiveness of the
safeguards protecting the business against the risk of material 
error, loss or fraud, but it must be recognised that they cannot
provide absolute assurance.
The directors are required by law to establish systems for the
control of the conduct of the business in accordance with the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and to conduct the
business with prudence and integrity, ensuring that there are
adequate reserves and other capital resources and assets in 
liquid form for the protection of depositors.
There has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of this report a process of identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. This process 
is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Turnbull
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in
September 1999.
The Board receives monthly reports from key executives identifying
performance against budget, major business issues and the impact
of the external business and economic environment on their areas
of responsibility. The Board also receives minutes and reports from
the Chairmen of the Group Audit & Risk Committee and the
Group Credit Policy Committee. These Committees identify any
signiﬁcant issues relating to the adequacy of the Group’s risk
management policies and procedures across the full range of risk
to which the Group is exposed.
The Board has delegated oversight of the Group’s Internal Control
Policy to the Group Audit & Risk Committee. Each regular meeting
of this Committee receives a report identifying the effectiveness 
of internal control together with speciﬁc reports on major issues.
An annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal control within
the Group is submitted by the Head of Group Internal Audit to this
Committee. The Board retains control over this area through the
presentation of a regular Group Audit & Risk Committee ‘activities’
report together with the minutes of the Committee meetings.
The key features of the system of business control established 
by the Board are:
• A Group Internal Control Policy requiring senior management 
to identify major risks and monitor the effectiveness of internal
controls through key performance indicators and certify to 
the Board on a twice yearly basis that they are effective. 
The operation of internal controls are subject to internal audit 
scrutiny and are reported via the Group Audit & Risk Committee.
• A well deﬁned management structure with clear accountabilities
and delegations.
• A system of executive management committees, including the
Executive Directors Meeting, Group Executive Meeting, and the
Executive Credit Committee. These committees enhance and
support the oversight role of the Board.
• A planning and budget process that delivers detailed annual
ﬁnancial forecasts and targets for Board approval.
• Management information systems enabling the Board to 
receive comprehensive monthly analysis of ﬁnancial and 
business performance including variance against budget.
• A Group Risk Management function with overarching responsibility
for the monitoring and reporting of all major risks to which the
Group is exposed, supported by specialist risk functions.
• An Internal Audit function to report to the Board on the
effectiveness of key internal controls in relation to these 
major risks.
• A Compliance function to manage relationships with the Group’s
key regulators and to identify and control major compliance risks. 
• The appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer and
the establishment and maintenance of anti-money laundering
procedures and controls including training programmes for staff. 
• Documented procedures and authority levels to ensure that risks
involved in major projects are properly assessed and controlled.
The activities of the Group, including the systems of business
control, are subject to supervision by the Financial Services
Authority. The Group is required on a regular basis to submit
detailed prudential and statistical returns covering all areas 
of its business and meets regularly with its supervisors, 
conducting the relationship in an open and constructive manner.
Going Concern
The directors conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company values dialogue with its institutional shareholders
through meetings, presentations and results brieﬁngs.
The Board receives monthly updates on changes in the Company’s
institutional share register, together with details and feedback from  Statement of Corporate Governance continued
38 Alliance & Leicester
any meetings held with shareholders. To ensure the directors are
kept up to date on current external views they also receive copies
of analyst research notes on the Company. 
During the year the Company has undertaken surveys of both
analyst and investor views on the Company. The Board is provided
with a summary of the ﬁndings of these surveys, and has access 
to the full reports. 
The Company’s major institutional shareholders regularly meet
with the Company’s management. The Chairman and senior 
non-executive director attend results presentations, together 
with other non-executive directors who are able to do so. 
All institutional shareholders have the opportunity to request 
a meeting with the Chairman and non-executive directors via 
the Company’s web site. The senior independent non-executive
director is available to deal with the concerns of institutional
shareholders that cannot be resolved through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or the Group Chief Executive.
All shareholders have the opportunity to meet the directors at the
Annual General Meeting (AGM). The Company facilitates this by
holding the AGM in the evening at the Company’s Leicestershire
head ofﬁce, which is at the heart of its individual shareholder base.
The Company website provides investors and potential investors
with information about the Company, share price information,
annual and interim results, company announcements, investor
presentations, group policies and terms of reference for its Board
Committees. Additionally, shareholders are also able to put
questions to the Company via the website.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
UK company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial
accounts for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end 
of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial accounts, the directors 
are required to:
• select appropriate accounting policies and apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts; and
• prepare ﬁnancial accounts on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to assume the Group will continue to be 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and to enable them to
ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Alliance & Leicester plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2004 39
Auditors’ Report
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Alliance & Leicester 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the
consolidated proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the
consolidated cash ﬂow statement, the reconciliation of movements
in shareholders’ funds, the statement of accounting policies and
the related notes 1 to 45. These ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We 
have also audited the information in the part of the directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the
preparation of the other information contained in the annual
report including the directors’ remuneration report. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the 
part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having 
been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom 
legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by
law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the
Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects 
the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements 
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the Annual Report for the above year as described in the
contents section including the unaudited part of the directors’
remuneration report and consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the 
Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December
2004 and of the proﬁt of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the ﬁnancial statements and part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Statutory Accounts
1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with the 
special provisions of Part VII, Chapter II of the Companies Act 
1985 applicable to banking companies and banking groups.
Accounting convention
The Group prepares its accounts under the historical cost convention,
except for the revaluation of securities used in trading activities,
and in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the bank and 
all its subsidiaries at the end of the year. Where subsidiaries are
acquired during the year, their results are included in the Group
accounts from the date of acquisition.
In accordance with FRS 9 ‘Associates and Joint Ventures’, investments
in joint arrangements that are not entities are included in the group
ﬁnancial statements through the recognition of the group’s share 
of the assets, liabilities and cashﬂows arising from the arrangement.
Statements of Recommended Practice (SORPs)
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with British
Bankers’ Association SORPs on Advances, Securities, Derivatives,
Contingent Liabilities and Segmental Reporting by Banks, and 
the Finance & Leasing Association SORP ‘Accounting issues 
in the asset ﬁnance and leasing industry’.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Company balance
sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill
In accordance with FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’,
goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies, 
which is represented by the excess of fair value of the purchase
consideration over the fair value of assets acquired, is capitalised
and shown as an asset in the balance sheet and subsequently
amortised over a period of between 3 and 10 years on a straight
line basis as a charge to the profit and loss account. Negative
goodwill is amortised over a period of 3 years. Goodwill written 
off to reserves before the adoption of FRS 10 amounts to £42.2m.
This would be charged to the proﬁt and loss account in the event
of the disposal of the relevant business.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the full provision method in
accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’. Deferred tax is recognised 
in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed at the balance sheet date. Provision is calculated at 
rates expected to be applicable when the liability or asset
crystallises. Deferred tax is provided on a non-discounted basis.
Fixed assets and depreciation
The cost of additions and major alterations to ofﬁce premises,
plant, fixtures, equipment and motor vehicles is capitalised. 
The cost of ﬁxed assets less estimated residual value is written off
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 75 years
Leasehold buildings over the remainder of the
lease up to 75 years
Fixtures and major alterations 10 to 15 years
Equipment and motor vehicles 3 to 9 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course 
of construction.
Software development costs are capitalised where they meet the
criteria set out in FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’. Capitalised costs
are amortised on a straight line basis over the useful economic life
of the software, normally between 1 and 5 years. Due to the rate 
of current technological change in respect of existing projects, 
this policy is currently materially the same as the policy of
immediate write-off.
Operating lease assets
Assets acquired for the purpose of renting out under operating
lease agreements are capitalised and depreciation is provided at
rates calculated to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated
residual value, over their useful lives using methods which allocate
depreciation charges on a systematic basis to the periods which 
are expected to beneﬁt from their use.
Finance and rental agreements
The minimum lease payments receivable from ﬁnance lease and
other ﬁnance agreements, less appropriate future income arising
from ﬁnance charges, are included in net investment in ﬁnance
leases and hire purchase contracts.
Gross earnings on ﬁnance and rental agreements comprise the
income component of repayments, after recognising sufﬁcient
income to cover initial direct costs, which are credited to the 
proﬁt and loss account using methods which produce an
approximate constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals under operating leases are charged to administrative
expenses on a straight line basis.
Finance lease agreements
Assets acquired under ﬁnance leases are capitalised at fair value 
at the start of the lease, with the corresponding obligations being
included in other liabilities. The finance lease costs charged to 
the profit and loss account are based on a constant periodic 
rate as applied to the outstanding liabilities.
Wholesale funding issue costs
Premiums or discounts, net of commission costs associated with the 
issue of fixed and floating rate notes and subordinated liabilities, 
are amortised over the relevant period to maturity and are
included in the proﬁt and loss account within interest payable.
Pensions and post-retirement medical beneﬁts
The Group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution
pension arrangements. Under the deﬁned beneﬁt section the cost 
of providing pensions and related beneﬁts is charged to the proﬁt 
and loss account so as to spread the costs evenly over the
employees’ working lives. The difference between the charge 
to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the
scheme is shown as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet. 
The assets of the deﬁned contribution section are held separately 
in an independently administered fund. Contributions to the
scheme are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as they fall due.
The cost of providing post-retirement medical beneﬁts is charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the costs evenly over 
the employees’ working lives. A provision is included within ‘Other
provisions for liabilities and charges’.
Securities
Securities intended for use on a continuing basis in the Group’s 
activities are classiﬁed as investment securities and are stated in the
balance sheet at cost less any impairment in value. Adjustments are
made to cost for premiums and discounts arising on the purchase 
of investment securities, which are amortised over the period to 
the maturity date of the security, and for the effect of the annual
movement in the retail price index where redemption is so ﬁxed 
under the terms of the issue. Securities used in trading activities 
are carried at fair value, with all gains and losses taken directly 
to the proﬁt and loss account.
Notes to the Accounts
  46 Alliance & Leicester
1 Principal accounting policies continued
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Specific provisions are made in respect of loans and advances
where recovery is considered doubtful; a general provision is made
for losses which, although not specifically identified, are known 
to be inherent in any portfolio of lending. Provisions for residential
mortgages are reduced by high percentage loan fees held in the
Group balance sheet.
Where the collection of interest is in signiﬁcant doubt, it is credited 
to a suspense account and written off when there is no longer 
any realistic prospect of recovery. The outstanding provisions 
are deducted from loans and advances, along with the interest 
on non-performing loans held in suspense. The charge in the 
proﬁt and loss account represents the net increase (or decrease) 
in the provisions less recoveries for the year.
Income recognition
Interest is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account on an accruals
basis. The costs of mortgage cashbacks, discounts and other
incentives to borrowers are charged as incurred to interest
receivable, except for products where the customer has an
obligation over a period of time to return the incentive if they
redeem the mortgage, and the early redemption fee is closely
linked to the incentive cost. For these products the incentive is
recorded within ‘Prepayments and accrued income’ and spread
over the term of the customer’s obligation.
Mortgage arrangement fees are taken to income in the proﬁt and 
loss account on a received basis. Other fees receivable are credited 
to income when the related service is performed.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, other 
than those covered by forward contracts which are translated 
at contracted rates, are translated into sterling using year end
exchange rates and any differences charged or credited to the
proﬁt and loss account.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives used in trading activities are carried at fair value, with 
all gains and losses taken directly to the proﬁt and loss account.
Gains and losses on non-trading derivatives are taken to the 
profit and loss account in accordance with the accounting
treatment of the underlying transaction being hedged. Accrued
income or expense is reported in ‘Prepayments and accrued
income’ or ‘Accruals and deferred income’ as appropriate. 
Proﬁts and losses relating to hedges of commitments and
anticipated transactions are deferred and taken to the proﬁt 
and loss account over the life of the underlying hedge.
Hedging contracts and instruments are used by the Group as 
part of its overall risk management strategy. Instruments used for
hedging purposes include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps,
collars and ﬂoors, futures, forward rate agreements and spot and
forward foreign exchange transactions.
The criteria required for a derivative instrument to be classiﬁed 
as a designated hedge are:
i) the transaction must be reasonably expected to match or
eliminate a signiﬁcant proportion of the risk inherent in the
assets, liabilities or positions being hedged which results from
potential movements in interest rates and exchange rates;
ii) adequate evidence of the intention to hedge and linkage with
the underlying risk inherent in the assets and liabilities being
hedged must be established at the outset of the transaction.
Hedge transactions which cease to be effective or are terminated 
early are measured at fair value. Any proﬁt or loss arising is deferred
and amortised over the remaining life of the asset, liability or
position being hedged. Where the underlying asset, liability or
position no longer exists, the hedging transaction is measured 
at fair value and any proﬁt or loss arising is recognised in full.
Mortgage guarantee income
The bank charges a fee to reﬂect the increased risk on high loan 
to value advances. In the Group accounts, fees are taken to ‘Other
interest receivable and similar income’ over the average anticipated
life of the loan. The deferred element is shown as a deduction from
‘Loans and advances to customers’ in accordance with ICAEW
Technical Release 20/01.
Securitisation
Securitisation transactions are reported in accordance with FRS 5,
‘Reporting the Substance of Transactions’. Where assets are sold
under securitisation, if there is no signiﬁcant change to the Group’s
rights and benefits to those assets and its exposure is limited to a
fixed monetary ceiling, linked presentation is used. Under linked
presentation the finance is shown deducted from the gross
amount of the item it finances on the face of the balance sheet
within a single asset caption ‘Loans and advances to customers’.

These balances include £2.9m in respect of loans to bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicles (SPVs). The SPVs, owned by charitable trusts,
are funded by Asset Backed Commercial Paper and invest in ‘AAA’ rated assets. In addition to these loans the Group provides liquidity facilities 
to the SPVs. The SPVs are not consolidated into the Group accounts on the basis that the SPVs are not controlled by the Group and the
beneﬁts the Group receives from the SPVs are restricted to interest and fees relating directly to the loans and liquidity facilities provided.
16 Securitisation
On 1 November 2000, the Company sold residential mortgage assets of £250.0m to Fosse Securities No.1 plc (Fosse). Fosse issued Mortgage
Backed Floating Rate Notes to finance the purchase of the portfolio of loans. These notes are serviceable only from cash flows generated
by the mortgage assets together with £2.2m (2003: £2.7m) of subordinated finance from the Company. 
The Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of these mortgages other than to the extent of its subordinated loans, nor does 
it intend to do so. This is clearly stated in the agreements with bondholders. 
The Company has an option to sell further mortgage loans to Fosse where at the end of any interest period the actual rate of repayment 
of principal (ARR) exceeds 20% per annum, so long as the sale price of such loans does not exceed the principal repayments received in the
interest period and the ARR after the sale is not less than 20% per annum.
The controlling interest of Fosse is held by a discretionary trust established for charitable purposes. The Group receives administration fees for
servicing Fosse’s mortgage portfolio together with its residual income arising after the claims of the bondholders and other creditors 
are met. Fosse is consolidated and included in the Group ﬁnancial statements as a quasi-subsidiary.

In previous years capital gains have been rolled-over against the acquisition cost of assets acquired by the Group including freehold land and
buildings. These gains will crystallise if the new assets are disposed of and will result in a liability of £2.7m (2003: £4.7m). There are no plans 
to dispose of any of these assets in the foreseeable future. In the event of such a sale the Group also has capital losses of £2.7m (2003: £8.3m)

The Group has hedged all material foreign currency exposures by using off balance sheet hedging instruments so that there are no material
unmatched exposures at the balance sheet date. All of the principal subsidiaries owned by Alliance & Leicester plc use sterling as their
functional currency. Therefore, the Group is not subject to any structural currency exposures.
40 Pensions
Pension costs relating to deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution sections of the Scheme can be analysed as follows:
2004 2003
(a) SSAP 24 Disclosures (Group) £m £m
Regular cost 18.6 17.8
Variations from regular cost (i) 6.6 6.6
Notional interest on prepayment (1.9) (1.4)
Total 23.3 23.0
(i) Variations from regular cost arise from the scheme deﬁcit being spread on a basis changing in line with pensionable payroll over the average expected future working life 
of the membership (13 years).
The Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme (the Scheme) comprises funded deﬁned beneﬁt sections which became closed to new entrants on 
31 March 1998. New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a deﬁned contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death beneﬁts are provided for Group employees. 
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the ﬁnances of the participating employers.
In addition beneﬁts are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989
whose beneﬁts would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualiﬁed actuaries using the projected unit method. The latest
actuarial valuation was made as at 31 March 2004. The signiﬁcant assumptions in these valuations were that salaries increase on average by 
2% p.a. above inﬂation, long term return on investments is 6.25% p.a. in the period before members reach retirement and 5.0% p.a. in the 
post-retirement period, and that pensions increase at 2.75% p.a. Assets were valued at their market value as at 31 March 2004.
At 31 March 2004 the market value of the assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Scheme was £861.8m and this was sufﬁcient to cover 
85% of the liabilities for beneﬁts due to members in respect of service prior to that date. 
Contributions to the Scheme in 2004 amounted to £152.9m (2003: £138.3m), including a one-off contribution of £114m. The excess of £129.6m
of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension contribution over the charge has increased the prepayment of £134.5m at the start of the year. An asset 
of £264.1m representing total net accumulated prepaid contributions is included in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2004.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group provides post-retirement medical beneﬁts to certain pensioners and active employees. The liability has been assessed by an independent
qualiﬁed actuary as at 31 December 2004, using the projected unit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were 
a discount rate of 5.4% and medical beneﬁt cost inﬂation of 8% for one year, reducing to 4.35% over 5 years and remaining at 4.35% thereafter.
The charge in the year for post-retirement medical beneﬁts in the Group accounts is £1.7m (2003: £1.6m). 
(b) FRS 17 Retirement Beneﬁts: Group accounts
(i) Deﬁned beneﬁt section
The following disclosures are provided under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 which requires certain disclosures only for periods ending
subsequent to 22 June 2002. The amounts disclosed under these transitional arrangements, which apply to both the funded and unfunded
Schemes, are not included in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. If FRS 17 were to be fully adopted, the impact on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, Proﬁt and Loss Account and Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses would be as set out below. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 and updated by an independent
qualiﬁed actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2004. Scheme
assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004. 64 Alliance & Leicester

There is a provision of £22.3m in the Group accounts at 31 December 2004 (2003: £20.8m) for post-retirement medical beneﬁts (see note 33),
which is based on SSAP 24. Under FRS 17, the provision would be £20.8m (2003: £20.6m).

(ii) Trading book
The Group’s trading activities are conducted through the Group’s Treasury division. Material trading assets comprise debt securities for which 
the carrying value is equal to the fair value at 31 December 2004 and 2003. Dealing proﬁts are disclosed in note 2.
The bank uses a variety of techniques to measure market risk in the trading book, including calculating the sensitivity of the market value 
of positions to hypothetical changes in interest rates. The following table sets out the change in the value of the trading book arising from
a 1% change in market interest rates, for the year ended 31 December 2004, with all other variables remaining constant:
Change in value
£m £m
2004 2003
Highest exposure 0.8 0.9
Lowest exposure – 0.3
Average exposure 0.3 0.6
Exposure as at 31 December 0.6 0.5
The sensitivity analysis technique used by the Group measures the change in the fair value of the Group’s trading book arising from hypothetical
changes in market rates. Actual results in the future could differ from these projected figures if fluctuations in interest rates exceeded the
hypothetical 1% shift. The Group’s trading book is not materially exposed to other market risks.
(iii) Fair values
The table below compares the book and fair values of some of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments by category at the balance sheet date. Where
available, market prices have been used to determine fair values. Where market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated for
options by using option-pricing models and for other ﬁnancial instruments by discounting cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Minor changes in assumptions used could have a signiﬁcant impact on the resulting estimated fair values, and, as a result, readers of these
ﬁnancial statements are advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
The concept of fair value assumes realisation of ﬁnancial instruments by way of sale. However, in many cases, the Group intends to realise
assets through collection over time.

The tables below analyse the Group’s derivatives portfolios by type of contract and maturity and shows the contract amount and the
replacement cost. Contract amount indicates the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and does not represent amounts at
risk. The replacement cost represents the cost of replacing contracts, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date and reﬂects
the Group’s exposure should counterparties default. No account is taken of offsetting positions with the same counterparty.

(iv) Hedging
As explained in the Financial Review on pages 19 to 20, the Group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures:
• Interest rate risk – using interest rate swaps, caps, collars and ﬂoors, futures and forward rate agreements;
• Transactional currency exposures – using spot and forward foreign exchange transactions.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows:

The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group. The gains and losses do
not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from
on-balance sheet instruments.

Notes
(a) Capital is allocated to business sectors on the basis of 7% equity and 3.5% subordinated debt. Excess capital is held within Treasury & Group.
(b) Costs have been assigned to each sector based on resources consumed. Corporate overheads not directly attributable to business units, including strategy costs of £8.0m
(2003: £18.0m) are included within Treasury & Group.
(c) The Group operates entirely within the banking and insurance business, and operations are not managed on the basis of an allocation of net assets. The level of banking 
assets can ﬂuctuate throughout the year, therefore the information derived from the year end ﬁgures does not provide a picture representative of the year as a whole. 
A more meaningful analysis of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities by business sector is contained within the Business and Financial 
Reviews on pages 7 to 20.
(d) The Commercial Banking proﬁt for 2004 includes £52.0m pre-tax proﬁt on the sale of the merchant acquisition business.
(e) No geographical analysis is presented because substantially all of the Group’s activities are in the UK.

(Note 1) Included within Commercial Banking and Total Group mean interest-earning
assets are operating lease assets of £380m for the six months ended 30 June 2004,
£378m for the six months ended 31 December 2004 and £379m for the year ended 
31 December 2004 (£368m for the six months ended 30 June 2003, £376m for the six
months ended 31 December 2003 and £372m for the year ended 31 December 2003).
(Note 2) The net interest margin is calculated above, consistent with previous years,
as net interest income, including net income from operating lease assets, divided by
average interest-earning assets including operating lease assets.
(Note 3) Excluding net income from operating lease assets and excluding operating
lease assets from average interest-earning assets, the net interest margin for Commercial
Banking is 1.53% for the six months ended 30 June 2004, 1.53% for the six months
ended 31 December 2004 and 1.53% for the year ended 31 December 2004 
(1.78% for the six months ended 30 June 2003, 1.64% for the six months ended 
31 December 2003 and 1.70% for the year ended 31 December 2003). For the
Group, the net interest margin is 1.48% for the six months ended 30 June 2004,
1.48% for the six months ended 31 December 2004 and 1.48% for the year ended

Cashbacks 40 31
Variable rate discounts (15) (20)
Fixed and capped rate discounts 18 7
Total 43 18
Mortgage incentive costs, as a discount to the appropriate headline
mortgage rate, increased by £94m to £421m. Expressed as a discount
to bank base rate, incentives increased by £25m to £43m. The cost 
of discounts relative to bank base rate provides a close proxy to the
actual cost of discounts which impact the proﬁt and loss account.
Our accounting policy is generally for the cost of mortgage cashbacks,
discounts and other incentives to borrowers to be charged to interest
receivable in the Group’s profit and loss account as incurred.
However, under the accounting treatment we introduced in 2002, 
for those mortgage products with early repayment fees which recover
the value of the initial discount, the cost to the Group of the initial
discount is amortised over the early repayment period. As a result 
of an increase in sales of such products, together with the
amortisation of costs incurred in respect of free valuation and legal
fees for a number of our mortgage products since May 2004, referred
to as our ‘Help with Fees’ option, the value of deferred mortgage
incentive costs held on the Group’s balance sheet has increased from
£3m at the end of 2003 to £23m at the end of 2004. Under IFRS,
effective from 1 January 2005, all mortgage incentives will be
amortised over the average life of the mortgage product.
The variable rate discounts have an average remaining life of 23
months (December 2003: 21 months). For ﬁxed rate discounts, the
average remaining period was 18 months (December 2003: 23
months). At the end of December 2004, 66% (December 2003: 54%)
of balances on individual mortgage accounts, including ﬁxed and
variable rate mortgages, were covered by early repayment fees. 
At December 2004 the value of our mortgage balances paying SVR
was £5.9bn, representing 21% (December 2003: 24%) of balances,
£0.1bn lower than December 2003.

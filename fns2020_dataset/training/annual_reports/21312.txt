Forward-looking statements
This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to certain of the Group’s plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its
future financial condition and performance. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current
facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, or other words of
similar meaning. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the Group’s future financial position, income growth,
impairment charges, business strategy, projected levels of growth in the banking and financial markets, projected costs, estimates of capital expenditures, and
plans and objectives for future operations.
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the further development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable to past, current and future
periods, evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, as well as UK domestic and global economic and
business conditions, market related risks such as changes in interest rates and exchange rates, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory
authorities, changes in legislation, progress in the integration of Absa into the Group’s business and the achievement of synergy targets related to Absa, the
outcome of pending and future litigation, and the impact of competition – a number of which factors are beyond the Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s
actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the Group’s forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statements made by or on behalf of Barclays speak only as of the date they are made. Barclays does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to
reflect any changes in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
The reader should, however, consult any additional disclosures that Barclays has made or may make in documents it has filed or may file with the SEC.

Expense growth reflected significant investment in organic growth
across the business and performance related costs.
•
In UK Retail Banking accelerated income momentum drove very
strong profit growth.
•
UK Banking delivered a further three percentage points underlying
improvement in the cost:income ratio; the six percentage point
target for 2005-2007 has been achieved a year ahead of schedule;
we still target a further two percentage point improvement in 2007.
•
Outstanding growth in Barclays Capital was driven by continued
expansion of the business, the success of past investment and the
focus of our client driven model.
•
Barclays Global Investors delivered another year of excellent
growth. Assets under management increased US$301bn to
US$1.8trn.
•
Absa’s first full year contribution was well ahead of the acquisition
business plan.
•
Barclaycard profits were affected by industry-wide impairment
pressures in UK cards and unsecured loans; UK consumer credit
performance is beginning to improve.
•
Capital ratios strengthened through retained earnings and active
balance sheet management; the Tier 1 capital ratio rose to 7.7%.
•
We delivered a total shareholder return for 2006 of 25%.
•
Approximately 50% of profits came from outside the UK.
“Barclays had an excellent year in 2006. We delivered outstanding performance in Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors. Momentum has
accelerated in UK Retail Banking and Absa has outperformed our acquisition business plan delivering very strong growth. Conditions in UK cards
and consumer loans were difficult but Barclaycard UK consumer credit performance is beginning to improve. We are well positioned to deliver
further growth in the years ahead.”

Chairman’ s statement
An excellent year with total 
shareholder return of 25%
Delivering growth
Marcus Agius Chairman Barclays PLC
On the non-executive side, Fulvio Conti joined the Board as previously
reported. Fulvio is Chief Executive Officer of Enel SpA, the Italian energy
group. Sir David Arculus retired from the Board after serving for nine
years. Bob Steel resigned as a Director, following his appointment as
Under Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America.
Finally, Chris Lucas will be joining the Group and the Board on 
1st April 2007 as Group Finance Director. Chris was previously with
PricewaterhouseCoopers and has worked across financial services for
most of his career. He will succeed Naguib Kheraj who will be leaving 
the Board on 31st March 2007. Naguib has made an outstanding
contribution to Barclays, for which we are most grateful. We wish him
well for the future.
Responsible banking
A key objective of the Board is for Barclays to be a leader in the area 
of corporate responsibility. 2006 saw significant progress towards 
this objective. 
We continued to give high priority to financial inclusion and improving
access to banking services and affordable credit. The number of UK
Cash Card accounts designed for low income and vulnerable people
increased by 22% to 464,000, while Absa remains the leading bank
provider of Mzansi basic bank accounts and launched an innovative
new service to help beneficiaries of social grants.
In terms of environmental management, Barclays UK operations are
now carbon neutral. Our involvement in the Business Leaders’ Initiative
on Human Rights continues and we retain membership of the Dow

Marcus Agius
Chairman
arclays had an excellent 2006. Profit before tax rose by 35%,
with outstanding performances from Barclays Capital and
Barclays Global Investors. Of particular note is the continued
turnaround in UK Retail Banking, which this year delivered
very strong growth along with UK Business Banking. We also
saw a very strong performance from Absa in its first full year
contribution and are ahead of plan in delivering the income and cost
synergies from the acquisition.
Profit before tax at Barclaycard decreased as good income growth was
offset by higher impairment charges and increased costs from the
continued development of the international businesses. We started to
see in the second half of 2006 the benefit of the actions taken to address
the deterioration in the UK consumer credit environment.
The Group declared a final dividend for the year of 20.5p per share,
making a total payment for the year of 31p, an increase of 17%. 
We delivered a total shareholder return (share price appreciation 
plus reinvested dividend payments) of 25% for the year.
The strong performance for the year is a tribute to the immense
contribution made by my predecessor, Matthew Barrett, initially as 
Chief Executive and subsequently as Chairman. Profit before tax
increased from £2.5bn to £7.1bn during his time with the Group and
Barclays would not be in the strong position it is today without his
contribution. I look forward to working with the Board and the executive
team to build on this platform and continue to take Barclays forward.
Corporate governance
As Chairman, it is my responsibility to ensure that the highest 
standards of corporate governance are in place and I am committed 
to maintaining Barclays strong reputation in this area.
2006 saw a number of Board changes. On the executive side, Frits
Seegers joined Barclays as a Director and Chief Executive of Global Retail
and Commercial Banking in July. Gary Hoffman, who was Chairman 
of UK Banking and of Barclaycard, was appointed as Group Vice
Chairman. He is accountable for a range of issues, including corporate
responsibility, public policy and equality and diversity. David Roberts,
previously Chief Executive of International Retail and Commercial
Banking, left Barclays at the end of the year. I would like to thank David
for his significant contribution to the Group.

Annual Report 2006 8
Earn, invest and grow
Delivering on our strategy
John Varley Group Chief Executive Barclays PLC
start this review by thanking the 123,000 employees of the Barclays
Group, whose dedication and creativity helped us achieve record
results. Our strategy of ‘earn, invest and grow’ continued to deliver
very strong growth in profits in 2006. Our ambition is to become one
of the handful of universal banks leading the global financial services
industry. I believe that the universal banking model is helping us 
drive the higher growth for shareholders that I set out to achieve three
years ago, by providing us with new options in products, services 
and markets.
In our business, strategy simply stated is anticipation followed by
service: we anticipate the needs of customers and clients. We then serve
them, by helping them achieve their goals. The needs of customers and
clients are changing. The drivers of change include: the privatisation 
of welfare; wealth generation and wealth transfer; explosive growth in
demand for banking products in emerging markets; the securitisation 
of assets and cash flows; the use of derivatives in risk management; the
significant growth in the use of credit cards for payment and borrowing;
and the opportunity for capital markets and private equity to fund
infrastructure development around the world. 
To capitalise on these sources of growth, I have put a new structure in
place by creating Global Retail and Commercial Banking (GRCB) under
the leadership of Frits Seegers, who joined Barclays in July 2006. GRCB
brings together: UK Banking, International Retail and Commercial
Banking and Barclaycard. GRCB gives Barclays a single point of strategic
direction and control to these businesses, thereby increasing our
capability to drive growth and synergies globally and to enter new
markets. We believe this will enable us to replicate success from one
part of the world in another. This GRCB structure mirrors the
organisation of Investment Banking and Investment Management
under Bob Diamond, which also gives a single point of strategic
direction and control to a group of global businesses which enjoy
substantial synergies.
My obligation as Group Chief Executive is to assemble the best team 
I can. We have added significantly to our management bench strength
in 2006, particularly in GRCB, and have concentrated on supplementing
our existing talent with deep specialist retail and commercial banking
and card experience across a range of international markets. 
Performance versus goals
For the three years from 31st December 2003 to 31st December 2006,
Barclays delivered a total shareholder return (TSR) of 66% and was
positioned 6th within its peer group, which is second quartile. 
The TSR of the FTSE 100 Index for this period was 54%. For the year to
31st December 2006, we delivered a TSR of 25% and were positioned
5th in our peer group. The TSR for the FTSE 100 for the year was 14%.
Economic profit for 2006 was £2.7bn, which, added to the £3.3bn
generated in 2004 and 2005, delivered a cumulative total of £6.0bn for
the goal period to date. This equates to compound annual growth in
economic profit of 28% per annum over the period, which is well ahead
of our target range.

Group performance
We made substantial progress on our strategic priorities and delivered
record financial results. Profit before tax increased 35% to £7,136m.
Earnings per share rose 32% to 71.9p, and economic profit was up 54%
to £2,704m. Profit excluding business disposals of £323m increased
29% to £6,813m, and earnings per share increased 23% to 66.8p. 
We increased the total dividend payout to 31p, a rise of 17%. 
Income grew 25% to £21,595m, well ahead of expense growth of 20%.
The growth was broadly based by business and geography, reflecting
momentum in each business. All businesses made significant
contributions, with especially strong performances from Barclays
Capital, UK Banking and Barclays Global Investors, and a substantial
contribution to income from Absa in its first full year of ownership.
Excluding Absa, Group income grew 18%, compared with expense
growth of 13%. The mix of income and profit continued to evolve.
Approximately half our profits came from outside the UK, up from 
about 30% in 2003.
Operating expenses increased 20% to £12,674m. The Group
cost:income ratio improved two percentage points to 59%. 
We continue to target top quartile productivity for all businesses, 
and in 2006 the ratio improved or remained flat in all businesses.
Operating expenses include gains on the sale of properties of £432m
partly offset by accelerated incremental investment expenditure of
approximately £280m.
Impairment charges rose 37% to £2,154m. Excluding Absa, impairment
charges on loans and advances increased 26%. The increase was
mostly attributable to the challenging credit environment in UK
unsecured retail lending, which was partly due to the continued rise in
the level of personal insolvencies. In the second half of 2006, as a result
of a number of management actions, flows into delinquency decreased
and arrears balances declined across the UK cards and unsecured loans
portfolios. We therefore believe that we passed the worst in Barclaycard
UK impairment in the second half of 2006. UK mortgage impairment
charges remained negligible, and the wholesale and larger corporate
sectors continued to be stable with a low level of defaults.
When I look at these results, I am pleased to see increased productivity
in our use of capital, risk and costs. Return on average shareholders’
funds improved four percentage points to 25%; profits grew much
faster than Daily Value at Risk and risk weighted assets and the
associated consumption of capital; and income growth exceeded cost
growth by five percentage points.
Capital management
Our strong credit rating and disciplined approach to capital
management remain sources of competitive advantage. Our capital
management policies are designed to optimise the returns to
shareholders whilst maintaining our credit rating. 
At the end of 2006, our Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.7% (2005: 7.0%). 
The improved capital ratio was driven by the strong capital generation 
of our business portfolio, the impact of disposals, including our stake in
FirstCaribbean International Bank, and the efficient management of the
balance sheet through the use of the capital markets. We have invested
almost £2bn to support the capital required for our organic growth
throughout the portfolio at a very attractive rate of return and we also
increased the dividend to shareholders by 17%. 
We commenced parallel running for Basel II at the end of 2006. Whilst
there are still areas in which the regulators have not yet defined the
requirements for detailed implementation, we continue to anticipate 
a modest benefit to our capital ratios from Basel II. For 2007 we will
continue to report our capital ratios under Basel I.
Executive management 
I want to acknowledge the significant contributions of two executive
directors who are leaving Barclays. David Roberts, previously Chief
Executive of International Retail and Commercial Banking, left Barclays
at the end of 2006 after 23 years of outstanding service. Naguib Kheraj
has been a generator of very significant value for the Group over the last
ten years in a number of different roles at Barclays, most recently as
Group Finance Director. He will be leaving us in 2007. I thank David and
Naguib warmly for their dedication to the success of Barclays and I wish
them well for the future. Our new Group Finance Director, Chris Lucas
joins us in April and brings a wealth of experience in financial services.
Outlook
We enter 2007 with strong income momentum in Barclays, driven 
by high levels of customer activity and good risk control. The global
economic outlook continues to be positive and we are well positioned 
to capture further growth in the years ahead.

collections throughout 2006 and, as a consequence, believes we have
passed the worst in Barclaycard UK impairment in the second half of
2006. There has also been a review of some partnership businesses and
lending to higher risk customers. An operational review is also under
way, to improve efficiency and enhance Barclaycard’s ability to provide
the best service to customers, wherever they are in the world.
We continued to invest in Barclaycard US. Since we bought the 
business in December 2004, outstandings have grown from US$1.4bn
to US$4.0bn, and cards in issue have increased from 1.1 million to 
4.2 million. Income grew 73% in 2006. We are on track to become
profitable in 2007.
International Retail and Commercial Banking achieved a step
change in profitability to £1,270m (2005: £633m), reflecting the
inclusion of Absa for a full year, the impact of corporate development
activity and growth in key geographies.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa
achieved a profit before tax of £572m (2005: £335m), including a 
gain of £247m from the disposal of our interest in FirstCaribbean
International Bank. Excluding this gain, profit before tax was £325m
(2005: £335m). Good organic growth in the businesses across
continental Europe was offset by incremental investment in distribution
capacity and technology across the businesses in 2006. We expect to
double the rate of investment in infrastructure and distribution in 2007. 
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa contributed
£698m profit before tax in the first full year of ownership and is
performing well ahead of our acquisition business case. Absa Group
Limited achieved year on year growth in profit before tax of 24% in 
Rand terms, reflecting very strong growth in mortgages, credit cards
and commercial property finance. The benefits of Barclays ownership
are evident in 46% attributable earnings growth in both Absa Card and
Absa Capital (reported in Barclays Capital), with total synergy benefits
well ahead of plan.
Barclays Capital produced an outstanding performance with profit
before tax rising 55% to £2,216m. Income growth of 39% was driven 
by doing more business with new and existing clients and was broadly
based across asset classes and geographies. Growth was particularly
strong in areas where we have invested in recent years, including
commodities, equity products and credit derivatives. Profit growth 
was accompanied by improvements in productivity: income and 
profits grew significantly faster than Daily Value at Risk, risk weighted
assets, economic capital, regulatory capital and costs. The ratio of
compensation costs to net income improved two percentage points 
to 49% and the cost:net income ratio improved three percentage points
to 64%. We continued to invest for future growth, increasing headcount
3,300 including 1,300 from the acquisition of HomEq, a US mortgage
servicing business.
Barclays Global Investors delivered excellent results, with profit 
before tax up 32% to £714m. Income growth of 26% was attributable
to increased management fees, particularly in the iShares and active
businesses. Assets under management grew US$301bn to US$1.8trn,
including net new assets of US$68bn, reflecting very strong inflows in
iShares and active assets. The cost:income ratio improved two
percentage points to 57%.
Group financial performance
The Group’s profit before tax in 2006 increased 35% (£1,856m) to
£7,136m (2005: £5,280m). Income increased 25% (£4,262m) to
£21,595m (2005: £17,333m) whilst operating expenses rose 20%
(£2,147m) to £12,674m (2005: £10,527m). Impairment charges
rose 37% (£583m) to £2,154 (2005: £1,571m).
Earnings per share rose 32% to 71.9p (2005: 54.4p), diluted earnings
per share rose 33% to 69.8p (2005: 52.6p). Dividends per share rose
17% to 31p (2005: 26.6p). Return on average shareholders’ funds was
25% (2005: 21%). Economic profit was up 54% (£952m) to £2,704m
(2005: £1,752m).
Business performance
In UK Banking we made significant strides towards our strategic priority
of building the best bank in the UK. Strong growth in income enabled us
to increase our profit before tax 17% to £2,578m. The improvement in
the cost:income ratio was four percentage points in headline terms to
52% (2005: 56%). Excluding the impact of property gains and
accelerated investment, the improvement in the cost:income ratio was
three percentage points making a cumulative total for 2005-2006 of 
six percentage points. This means that we have achieved our target of 
a six percentage point improvement over the period 2005-2007, one
year ahead of schedule. We continue to target a further two percentage
point improvement in the cost:income ratio for 2007 to 51%. 
UK Retail Banking delivered a 17% profit before tax increase to
£1,213m. This was driven by broadly based income growth of 7%, with
particularly strong performances in savings, Local Business and UK
Premier and good growth in current accounts. Our mortgage market
share and processing capacity also increased strongly leading to a net
market share of 4% for the second half of the year. We doubled
investment across the business. We focused on upgrading distribution
capabilities, transforming the performance of the mortgage business,
revitalising product offerings, and improving core operations and
processes. The additional investment substantially offset the impact of
property gains, leading to broadly flat costs. In 2007 we expect to make
further significant investment, including the restructuring of the branch
network and the migration of Woolwich customers.
UK Business Banking delivered very strong growth in profit before tax
of 18% to £1,365m. Strong growth in loans and deposits drove income
growth of 11%. Profit before business disposals grew 11%. UK Business
Banking maintained its competitive position and also funded significant
investment in improving its infrastructure and customer service. 
At Barclaycard profit before tax fell 40% to £382m. Good income
growth of 8%, driven by very strong momentum in Barclaycard
International, was more than offset by a further rise in impairment
charges, principally in the UK lending portfolios, and by higher costs,
mainly as a result of continued investment in Barclaycard US. In the UK,
high debt levels and changing attitudes to bankruptcy and debt default
contributed to increased impairment charges. As the consumer lending
market in the UK changes, Barclaycard is repositioning its business to
achieve sustainable, profitable growth. Higher borrowing by UK
consumers, lower disposable household incomes and a tougher
regulatory environment have seen Barclaycard take a number of actions.

Barclays Wealth profit before tax rose 28% to £213m. 
This reflected broadly based income growth and favourable market
conditions, partially offset by a significant increase in investment 
in people and infrastructure to build a platform for future growth.
Total client assets increased 19% to £93bn. The cost:income ratio
improved three percentage points to 79%.
In Head office functions and other operations the loss before tax
decreased £64m to £259m, reflecting the Head office relocation
costs incurred in 2005.
Goals
Barclays primary focus is to deliver superior value to its shareholders. 
The primary goal remains to achieve top quartile total shareholder
return (TSR) relative to a peer group of 11 other UK and
international financial services institutions. TSR is defined as the
value created for shareholders through share price appreciation,
plus reinvested dividend payments. In 2004, we announced a new
performance cycle TSR goal for the 2004 to 2007 period.
The TSR peer group is reviewed annually to ensure it aligns with our
business mix and the direction and scale of our ambition. The peer
group for 2006 was: ABN Amro, BBV A, BNP Paribas, Citigroup,
Deutsche Bank, HBOS, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Lloyds TSB, Royal
Bank of Scotland and UBS. For 2007 the peer group is unchanged.
For the first three years of the new goal period, from 31st December
2003 to 31st December 2006, Barclays was positioned sixth within
its peer group, which is second quartile TSR performance.
In addition, economic profit (EP) is used to support the pursuit of
the top quartile TSR goal. The strategies we follow and the actions
we take are aligned to value creation for all stakeholders. Barclays
uses EP , a non-IFRS measure, as a key indicator of performance
because it believes that it provides important discipline in decision-
making. Barclays believes that EP encourages both profitable
growth and the efficient use of capital. More information on the
reconciliation of EP to profit before tax can be found on page 51.
At the time of setting the TSR goal, we estimated that achieving top
quartile TSR would require the achievement of compound annual
growth in economic profit of 10% to 13% per annum (£6.5bn to
£7.0bn cumulative economic profit) over the 2004 to 2007 goal
period. Economic profit for 2006 was £2.7bn, which, added to the
£3.3bn generated in 2004 and 2005, delivered a cumulative total 
of £6.0bn for the goal period to date. This equates to compound
annual growth in economic profit of 28% per annum for the goal
period to date. Barclays PLC

2006/05
UK Retail Banking profit before tax increased 17% (£173m) to £1,213m
(2005: £1,040m), driven by good income growth and well controlled
costs. There has been substantial additional investment to transform
the business.
Income increased 7% (£242m) to £3,828m (2005: £3,586m),
continuing the momentum reported at the half year. Income growth
was broadly based. There was strong income growth in Personal
Customers retail savings, Local Business and UK Premier and good
growth in Personal Customers current account income. Sales volumes
increased, with a particularly strong performance from direct channels. 
Net interest income increased 6% (£125m) to £2,333m (2005:
£2,208m). Growth was driven by a higher contribution from deposits,
through a combination of good balance sheet growth and a stable
liability margin. Total average customer deposit balances increased 8%
to £79.2bn (2005: £73.5bn), supported by new products. Growth of
personal savings was above that of the market. 
Mortgage volumes improved significantly , driven by a focus on improving
capacity , customer service, value and promotion. UK residential mortgage
balances ended the year at £61.9bn (2005: £59.6bn). Gross advances
were 60% higher at £18.4bn (2005: £11.5bn), with a market share of 5%
(2005: 4%). Net lending was £2.4bn, with performance improving during
the year , leading to a market share of 4% in the second half of the year .
The mortgage margin was reduced by changed assumptions used in the
calculation of effective interest rates, a higher proportion of new
mortgages and base rate changes. The new business spread was in line
with the industry . The loan to value ratio within the residential mortgage
book on a current valuation basis was 34% (2005: 35%). 
There was good balance growth in non-mortgage loans, where Local
Business average balances increased 9% and UK Premier average
balances increased 25%. 
Net fee and commission income increased 8% (£88m) to £1,219m
(2005: £1,131m). There was strong current account income growth in
Personal Customers and Local Business. UK Premier delivered strong
growth reflecting higher income from banking services, mortgage sales
and investment advice. 
Net premiums from insurance underwriting activities decreased 4%
(£11m) to £269m (2005: £280m). There continued to be lower
customer take-up of loan protection insurance. Net claims and benefits
on insurance contracts improved to £35m (2005: £58m). Other income
increased £26m to £42m (2005: £16m), principally representing the
benefit from reinsurance.
Impairment charges increased 39% (£59m) to £209m (2005: £150m).
The increase principally reflected balance growth and some
deterioration in delinquency rates in the Local Business loan book.
Losses from the mortgage portfolio remained negligible, with arrears 
at low levels.
Operating expenses were steady at £2,408m (2005: £2,390m).
Substantially all of the gains from the sale and leaseback of property 
of £253m have been reinvested in the business to improve customer
service and deliver sustainable performance improvements. Around half
of the incremental investment was directed at upgrading distribution
capabilities, including restructuring and improving the branch network.
Further investment was focused on upgrading the contact centres,
transforming the performance of the mortgage business, revitalising
the retail product range to meet customers’ needs, improving core
operations and processes and rationalising the number of operating
sites. The level of investment reflected in operating expenses in 2006
was approximately double the level of 2005.
The cost:income ratio improved four percentage points to 63% 
(2005: 67%).
2005/04
Profit before tax increased 4% (£38m) in 2005 to £1,040m (2004:
£1,002m). Profit before tax increased 8% excluding the impact of
£42m profit on business disposals in 2004.
Income increased 3% (£98m) to £3,586m (2004: £3,488m). There was
good growth in Personal Customer current accounts, Local Business
and UK Premier, whilst income from Personal Customers retail savings
was weaker. The application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1st January 2005
resulted in the reclassification of certain lending related fees from net
fee and commission income to net interest income. 
Net interest income increased 5% (£101m) to £2,208m (2004:
£2,107m). Growth was driven by higher contributions from Home
Finance and Local Business, partly offset by some margin pressure on
savings and deposits.
UK residential mortgage balances ended the period at £59.6bn 
(2004: £61.7bn). Total average customer deposit balances increased
5% to £73.5bn (2004: £69.7bn).
Net fee and commission income decreased 2% (£18m) to £1,131m
(2004: £1,149m) with lending related fees impacted by the application
of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1st January 2005.
Income from principal transactions was £9m (2004: £nil) representing
the gain on the sale of the investment in Gresham, an insurance
underwriting business.
Net premiums from insurance underwriting activities increased 12%
(£31m) to £280m (2004: £249m). In 2004 there was a provision
relating to the early termination of contracts. Excluding this provision,
there was a slight underlying reduction in net premiums.
Impairment charges increased 117% (£81m) to £150m (2004: £69m).
Excluding UK mortgage releases of £10m (2004: £40m), impairment
charges increased 47%, reflecting some deterioration in the
delinquencies experience and balance growth in overdrafts and Local
Business.
Operating expenses decreased 3% (£71m) to £2,390m (2004:
£2,461m). The cost:income ratio improved four percentage points to
67% (2004: 71%). Financial review

2005/04
Profit before tax increased 7% (76m) to £1,160m (2004: £1,084m),
driven by strong income growth. 
Both Larger Business and Medium Business performed well.
Income increased 10% (£198m) to £2,159m (2004: £1,961m), driven
by strong balance sheet growth. The application of IAS 32 and IAS 39
from 1st January 2005 resulted in the reclassification of certain lending
related fees from net fee and commission income to net interest
income. Excluding the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39, both net interest
income and net fee and commission income continued to grow.
Impairment charges increased 49% (£58m) to £177m (2004: £119m).
Excluding the impact of a £57m recovery in 2004, the impairment
charge was broadly stable. 
Operating expenses increased 8% (£64m) to £825m (2004: £761m),
reflecting volume growth, increased expenditure on frontline staff and
the costs of Iveco Finance since acquisition. 
The cost:income ratio improved one percentage point to 38% 
(2004: 39%).
2006/05
UK Business Banking profit before tax increased 18% (£205m) to
£1,365m (2005: £1,160m), driven by continued strong income growth.
UK Business Banking maintained its market share of primary customer
relationships. The 2006 result included a £23m (2005: £13m)
contribution from the full year consolidation of Iveco Finance, in which 
a 51% stake was acquired on 1st June 2005. Profit before business
disposals increased 11% to £1,289m (2005: £1,160m).
Income increased 11% (£236m) to £2,395m (2005: £2,159m), driven
by strong balance sheet growth. The uplift in income was broadly based
across income categories. 
Net interest income increased 11% (£166m) to £1,702m (2005:
£1,536m) driven by strong balance sheet growth. There was strong
growth in all business areas and in particular Larger Business. The
lending margin improved slightly. Average deposit balances increased
11% to £44.8bn (2005: £40.5bn) with good growth across product
categories. The deposit margin was stable.
Net fee and commission income increased 9% (£53m) to £642m (2005:
£589m). There was a strong rise in income from foreign exchange and
derivatives business transacted through Barclays Capital on behalf of
Business Banking customers. 
Income from principal transactions was £30m (2005: £17m), primarily
reflecting the profit realised on a number of equity investments. 
As expected, impairment rates trended upwards during the year
towards a more normalised level. Impairment increased 42% (£75m) 
to £252m (2005: £177m), with the increase mainly reflecting higher
charges from Medium Business and balance growth. Impairment
charges in Larger Business were stable.
Operating expenses increased 4% (£32m) to £857m (2005: £825m).
Cost growth reflected higher volumes, increased expenditure on front
line staff and the costs of Iveco Finance for a full year. Operating
expenses included a credit of £60m on the sale and leaseback of
property, of which approximately half was reinvested in the business,
including costs relating to the acceleration of the rationalisation of
operating sites and technology infrastructure. 
The cost:income ratio improved two percentage points to 36% 
(2005: 38%).
Profit on disposals of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of
£76m (2005: £nil) arose from the sales of interests in vehicle leasing 
and European vendor finance businesses. Financial review

2006/05
Barclaycard profit before tax decreased 40% (£258m) to £382m 
(2005: £640m) as good income growth was more than offset by 
higher impairment charges and increased costs from the continued
development of international businesses. 
Income increased 8% (£222m) to £2,937m (2005: £2,715m). 
Growth was driven by very strong momentum in the United States 
and by strong performances in Barclaycard Business, FirstPlus, 
SkyCard and continental European markets. 
Net interest income increased 7% (£117m) to £1,843m (2005:
£1,726m). UK average extended credit card balances fell 7% to £8.0bn
(2005: £8.6bn), reflecting the impact of tighter lending criteria. UK
average consumer lending balances increased 16% to £11.9bn (2005:
£10.3bn) driven by secured lending in FirstPlus. International average
extended credit card balances rose 39% to £2.5bn (2005: £1.8bn). 
Margins in credit cards improved to 8.73% (2005: 7.96%), due to the
impact of increased card rates and a reduced proportion of promotional
rate balances in the UK. Margins in consumer lending fell to 4.11%
(2005: 4.96%), due to a higher proportion of secured lending and
continued competitive pressure.
Net fee and commission income increased 8% (£82m) to £1,054m
(2005: £972m) as a result of increased contributions from Barclaycard
International, SkyCard, FirstPlus and Barclaycard Business. Barclaycard
reduced its late and overlimit fee charges in the UK on 1st August 2006
in response to the Office of Fair Trading’s findings. 
Investment income of £15m (2005: £nil) represents the gain arising from
the sale of part of the stake in MasterCard Inc, following its flotation.
Impairment charges increased 36% (£395m) to £1,493m (2005:
£1,098m). The increase was driven by a rise in delinquent balances 
and increased numbers of bankruptcies and Individual Voluntary
Arrangements. As a result of management action in 2005 and 2006 to
tighten lending criteria and improve collection processes, the flows of
new delinquencies reduced, and levels of arrears balances declined in
the second half of 2006 in UK cards and unsecured loans.
Operating expenses increased 8% (£76m) to £1,054m (2005: £978m).
This included a £38m gain from the sale and leaseback of property.
Excluding this item, underlying operating expenses increased 12%
(£114m) to £1,092m. This was largely as a result of continued
investment in Barclaycard International, particularly Barclaycard US, 
and the development of UK partnerships.
Barclaycard International continued its growth strategy in the
continental European business delivering solid results. The Entercard
joint venture, which is based in Scandinavia, performed ahead of plan.
Barclaycard International loss before tax reduced to £30m (2005: loss
£37m), including the loss before tax for Barclaycard US of £56m 
(2005: loss £59m). Barclaycard US continued to perform ahead of
expectations, delivering very strong growth in balances and customer
numbers and creating a number of new partnerships including US
Airways, Barnes & Noble, Travelocity and Jo-Ann Stores. 
Barclaycard UK customer numbers declined 1.4 million to 9.8 million
(2005: 11.2 million). This reflected the closure of 1.5 million accounts
that had been inactive.
2005/04
Barclaycard profit before tax decreased 23% (£190m) to £640m (2004:
£830m). Excluding Barclaycard US loss before tax of £59m, profit before
tax fell 16% (£131m) to £699m.
Income increased 13% (£321m) to £2,715m (2004: £2,394m) driven 
by good performances across the diversified UK cards and loans
businesses and Barclaycard Business, and by very strong momentum in
international cards. Excluding Barclaycard US income of £117m, income
increased 9%. 
Net interest income increased 9% (£139m) to £1,726m (2004:
£1,587m) as a result of growth in average balances. 
UK average extended credit balances rose 5% to £8.6bn (2004: £8.2bn)
and international average extended credit balances doubled to £1.8bn
(2004: £0.9bn). Excluding Barclaycard US average extended credit
balances of £0.9bn, international average extended credit balances
increased 26%. 
UK average consumer lending balances increased 10% to £10.3bn
(2004: £9.4bn). Margins in the cards business improved during 2005 
to 7.96% (2004: 7.34%) due to the impact of increased card rates and 
a reduced proportion of total balances on promotional offers. Margins 
in consumer lending fell to 4.96% (2004: 6.27%), due to the impact of
IAS 32 and IAS 39, competitive pressure and a change in the product
mix. Excluding the impact of the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39, net
interest income increased 12%.
Net fee and commission income increased 23% (£182m) to £972m
(2004: £790m) as a result of the inclusion of Barclaycard US and
increased contributions from Barclaycard Business and FirstPlus.
Excluding the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39, net fee and commission
income increased 16%.
Impairment charges increased 44% (£337m) to £1,098m (2004:
£761m). The increase was driven by a rise in delinquent balances, lower
rates of recovery from customers, the inclusion of Barclaycard US, and
an increase in the size of the average loan book. Excluding Barclaycard
US impairment charges of £53m, impairment charges increased 38%.
Operating expenses rose 21% (£171m) to £978m (2004: £807m),
mostly as a result of the inclusion of Barclaycard US. Excluding
Barclaycard US operating expenses of £111m, operating expenses rose
7% reflecting continued investment in the UK and continental European
card businesses and the development of the UK Partnerships business.
Barclaycard International performed strongly, with Germany and Spain
delivering excellent results. Excluding Barclaycard US, Barclaycard
International profit before tax was £22m (2004: £8m), with income
ahead 22%. The loss before tax for Barclaycard US was £59m (2004:
loss of £2m). Financial review

2006/05
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa profit
before tax increased 71% (£237m) to £572m (2005: £335m), including
a gain on the disposal of the interest in FirstCaribbean International
Bank of £247m. Profit before business disposals was £325m (2005:
£335m). This reflected good growth in continental Europe offset by a
decline in profits in Africa caused by higher impairment, and increased
costs reflecting a step change in the rate of organic investment in 
the business. 
Income increased 8% (£85m) to £1,134m (2005: £1,049m). Excluding
gains from asset sales in 2005, income increased 11% (£116m) to
£1,134m (2005: £1,018m). 
Net interest income increased 9% (£48m) to £610m (2005: £562m),
reflecting strong balance sheet growth in continental Europe, Africa 
and the Middle East, and the development of the corporate business 
in Spain.
Total average customer loans increased 20% to £27.4bn (2005:
£22.9bn). Mortgage balance growth in continental Europe was
particularly strong, with average Euro balances up 22%. There was a
modest decline in lending margins partly driven by a greater share of
mortgage assets as a proportion of the total book in continental Europe.
Average customer deposits increased 17% to £10.8bn (2005: £9.2bn),
with deposit margins stable.
Net fee and commission income increased 19% (£71m) to £448m
(2005: £377m). This reflected a strong performance from the Spanish
funds business, where average assets under management increased
11%, together with very strong growth in France, including the first 
full year contribution of the ING Ferri business which was acquired on 
1st July 2005. Net fee and commission income showed solid growth 
in Africa and the Middle East.
Principal transactions decreased £36m to £83m (2005: £119m). 
2005 included £23m from the redemption of preference shares in
FirstCaribbean International Bank.
Impairment charges increased £28m to £41m (2005: £13m). This
reflected the absence of one-off recoveries of £12m which arose in
2005 in Africa and the Middle East, and strong balance sheet growth
across the businesses.
Operating expenses increased 9% (£68m) to £808m (2005: £740m).
This included gains from the sale and leaseback of property in Spain 
of £55m, just under half of which were reinvested in accelerated staff
restructuring and infrastructure upgrades. Excluding these net gains,
operating expenses increased 14% to £840m (2005: £740m).
Operating expenses also included incremental investment expenditure
of £25m to expand the distribution network and enhance IT and
operational capabilities.
Barclays Spain continued to perform strongly. Profit before tax increased
21% (£30m) to £171m (2005: £141m), excluding net one-off gains on
asset sales of £32m (2005: £8m) and integration costs of £43m (2005:
£57m). This was driven by the continued realisation of benefits from
Banco Zaragozano, together with strong growth in assets under
management and solid growth in mortgages. 
Africa and the Middle East profit before tax decreased 9% (£12m) to
£126m (2005: £138m) driven by higher impairment charges reflecting
one-off recoveries of £12m that arose in 2005 and an increase in
investment expenditure.
Profit before tax increased strongly in Portugal reflecting good flows of
new customers and increased business volumes. France also performed
well as a result of good organic growth and the acquisition of ING Ferri. 
The profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures of
£247m (2005: £nil) comprised the gain on the sale of Barclays interest
in FirstCaribbean International Bank. The share of post-tax results of
FirstCaribbean International Bank included in 2006 was £41m 
(2005: £37m).
2005/04
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa
performed strongly, with profit before tax increasing 16% (£47m) 
to £335m (2004: £288m). The performance was broad-based, featuring
stronger profits in all geographies. 
Income increased 18% (£162m) to £1,049m (2004: £887m). 
Net interest income increased 6% (£33m) to £562m (2004: £529m),
reflecting strong balance sheet growth in Europe, Africa and the Middle
East, and the development of the corporate businesses in Spain. 
Total average customer loans increased 28% to £22.9bn (2004:
£17.8bn). Mortgage balance growth in continental Europe was
particularly strong with average euro balances up 25%. 
Net fee and commission income increased 31% (£89m) to £377m
(2004: £288m). This reflected a strong performance from the Spanish
funds business, where assets under management increased 15%,
together with good growth in France, including the contribution of the
ING Ferri business which was acquired on 1st July 2005. 
Principal transactions reduced to £119m (2004: £135m), reflecting 
the change in accounting for insurance business, partly offset by
investment realisations during 2005 including a gain of £23m from the
redemption of preference shares in FirstCaribbean International Bank.
Impairment charges decreased 58% (£18m) to £13m (2004: £31m).
Operating expenses increased 20% (£123m) to £740m (2004: £617m).
The increase was in line with the growth in income, and was due to
higher integration costs in Spain, the continued expansion of the
business in Africa and the Middle East, investments in the European
distribution network, particularly in Portugal and Italy, and the
acquisition of the ING Ferri business in France. The cost:income ratio
remained stable at 71% (2004: 70%).
Barclays Spain performed very strongly with profit before tax, excluding
integration costs, up 19% to £149m (2004: £125m). Including
integration costs, profit before tax was up 11% to £92m (2004: £83m).
Africa and the Middle East profit before tax increased 10% to £138m
(2004: £125m) reflecting continued investment and balance sheet
growth across the businesses.
The post-tax profit from associates decreased £10m to £39m 
(2004: £49m) due to a lower contribution from FirstCaribbean
International Bank. Financial review

2006/05
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa profit before 
tax increased 134% to £698m (2005: £298m) reflecting the full year 
to 31st December 2006 compared with the five months ended 
31st December 2005. Barclays acquired a controlling stake in Absa
Group Limited on 27th July 2005.
In the commentary below, the comparable period referred to, for
illustrative purposes only, is the proforma full year to 31st December
2005 and is based on performance in Rand.
Absa Group Limited’s profit before tax increased 24% reflecting a very
good performance from banking operations, with retail, corporate and
business banking operations performing exceptionally well. Absa Group
Limited delivered a return on equity of 27.4% (2005: 25.6%). Key factors
impacting the results included very strong asset growth, strong revenue
growth, an increased credit impairment charge, the realisation of
synergies from leveraging Barclays expertise and economies of scale
and the sale of non-core operations. The South African economy
continued to expand at a solid pace with real growth expected to be
about 4.9% for 2006 (2005: 5.1%).
Net interest income grew 27%. Loans and advances to customers
increased 26% underpinned by very strong growth in mortgages, 
credit cards and commercial property finance.
Non-interest income increased 12% reflecting higher transaction
volumes, strong growth in insurance related earnings and gains on
asset sales. 
As expected the impairment charge on loans and advances increased
from the very low levels of the prior year, particularly in Absa Home
Loans, Absa Card and Retail Banking Services. 
Operating expenses increased 14% resulting from increased investment
in the business in order to support continued growth in volumes and
customers.
Excellent progress was made with the realisation of synergy benefits. 
In 2006 synergies of ZAR753m were delivered, in excess of the target
originally communicated for the year. Integration costs for the period
were in line with expectations.
Impact on Barclays results
Absa Group Limited’s profit before tax of ZAR11,417m is translated into
Barclays results at an average exchange rate for 2006 of ZAR12.47/£
(2005: ZAR11.57/£). Consolidation adjustments reflected the
amortisation of intangible assets of £75m and internal funding and
other adjustments of £72m. The resulting profit before tax of £769m
(2005: £337m) is represented with International Retail and Commercial
Banking – Absa £698m, (2005: £298m) and Barclays Capital, £71m
(2005: £39m).
Absa Group Limited’s total assets at 31st December 2006 were
ZAR495,112m (31st December 2005: ZAR404,561m), growth of 22%.
This is translated into Barclays results at a year-end exchange rate of
ZAR13.71/£ (31st December 2005: ZAR10.87/£). The consolidation 
of total assets reflected the impact of the 21% depreciation in the 
Rand largely offsetting the growth in the Rand balance sheet. Financial review

2006/05
Barclays Capital delivered record profit before tax and net income. Profit
before tax increased 55% (£785m) to £2,216m (2005: £1,431m). This
was the result of a very strong income performance, driven by higher
business volumes, continued growth in client activity and favourable
market conditions. Net income increased 42% (£1,831m) to £6,225m
(2005: £4,394m). Profit before tax for Absa Capital was £71m (2005
(a)
:
£39m). Excluding Absa Capital, profit before tax increased 54%. 
Income increased 39% (£1,762m) to £6,267m (2005: £4,505m) as a
result of very strong growth across the Rates, Credit and Private Equity
businesses. Income increased in all geographic regions with significant
contributions outside the UK from the US, continental Europe and Asia.
The top line performance reflected returns from past investments and
the strength of the global client franchise. Average DVaR increased 
16% to £37.1m (2005: £32.0m) significantly below the rate of 
income growth.
Secondary income, comprising principal transactions (net trading
income and net investment income) and net interest income, is mainly
generated from providing client financing and risk management
solutions. Secondary income increased 43% (£1,584m) to £5,293m
(2005: £3,709m).
Net trading income increased 60% (£1,331m) to £3,562m (2005:
£2,231m) with very strong contributions across the Rates and Credit
businesses, in particular, commodities, fixed income, equities, credit
derivatives and emerging markets. The performance was driven by
higher volumes of client led activity and favourable market conditions.
Net investment income increased 39% (£160m) to £573m (2005:
£413m) driven by investment realisations, primarily in Private Equity,
offset by reduced contributions from credit products. Net interest
income increased 9% (£93m) to £1,158m (2005: £1,065m) driven by 
a full year contribution from Absa Capital. Corporate lending remained
flat at £40.6bn (2005: £40.1bn).
Primary income, which comprises net fee and commission income 
from advisory and origination activities, grew 23% (£176m) to £952m
(2005: £776m). This reflected higher volumes and continued market
share gains in a number of key markets, with strong contributions from
issuances in bonds, European leveraged loans and convertibles. 
Impairment charges of £42m (2005: £111m), including impairment 
on available for sale assets of £83m (2005: £nil), were 62% lower than
prior year reflecting recoveries and the continued benign wholesale
credit environment.
Operating expenses increased 35% (£1,046m) to £4,009m (2005:
£2,963m), reflecting higher performance related costs, increased levels
of activity and continued investment across the business. The cost:net
income ratio improved to 64% (2005: 67%) and the compensation to
net income ratio improved to 49% (2005: 51%). Performance related
pay, discretionary investment spend and short-term contractor 
resource costs represented 50% of operating expenses (2005: 46%).
Amortisation of intangible assets principally relates to mortgage service
rights obtained as part of the purchase of HomEq, a US mortgage
servicing business acquired on 1st November 2006.
Total headcount increased 3,300 during 2006 to 13,200 (2005: 9,900)
and included 1,300 from the acquisition of HomEq. Organic growth was
broadly based across all regions and reflected further investments in the
front office, systems development and control functions to support
continued business expansion.
2005/04
Profit before tax increased 25% (£289m) to £1,431m (2004: £1,142m).
Net income increased 29% (£982m) to £4,394m (2004: £3,412m). 
Income increased 28% (£987m) to £4,505m (2004: £3,518m). 
Income by asset category and geography was broadly based. Areas 
of investment in 2004, such as commodities, commercial mortgage
backed securities and equity derivatives, performed well, delivering
significant income growth. Market risk was well controlled with average
DVaR falling 7% to £32.0m (2004: £34.3m) as a result of increased
diversification across asset classes.
Secondary income increased 31% (£876m) to £3,709m (2004:
£2,833m).
Net trading income increased 52% (£768m) to £2,231m (2004:
£1,463m). Net investment income increased 37% (£111m) to £413m
(2004: £302m), driven by realisations from credit products. Net interest
income was flat at £1,065m (2004: £1,068m), reflecting flattening yield
curves and the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Primary income grew 16% (£106m) to £776m (2004: £670m).
Impairment charges of £111m (2004: £106m) were in line with the
prior year reflecting the stable wholesale credit environment.
Operating expenses increased 31% (£693m) to £2,963m (2004:
£2,270m), reflecting higher business volumes and the ongoing costs
associated with staff hired during 2004 and 2005 as part of the business
expansion plan. Performance related costs increased due to the strong
profit performance. Investment expenditure, primarily in the front office,
continued to be significant although less than 2004 as headcount
growth slowed. The cost:net income ratio remained stable at 67%.

2006/05
Barclays Global Investors delivered another year of outstanding results.
Profit before tax increased 32% (£174m) to £714m (2005: £540m),
reflecting very strong income growth and higher operating margins.
The performance was broadly based across products, distribution
channels and geographies. 
Net fee and commission income increased 27% (£354m) to £1,651m
(2005: £1,297m). This growth was attributable to increased
management fees, particularly in the iShares and active businesses, 
and securities lending, offset by lower incentive fees. Incentive fees
decreased 9% (£18m) to £186m (2005: £204m). Higher asset values,
driven by higher market levels and good net new inflows, contributed 
to the growth in income. 
Operating expenses increased 22% (£172m) to £951m (2005: £779m)
as a result of significant investment in key growth initiatives, ongoing
investment in product development and infrastructure and higher
performance-based expenses. The cost:income ratio improved two
percentage points to 57% (2005: 59%). 
Total headcount rose 400 to 2,700 (2005: 2,300). Headcount increased
in all regions, across product groups and the support functions,
reflecting continued investment to support strategic initiatives. 
Total assets under management increased 5% (£46bn) to £927bn
(2005: £881bn) primarily due to net new inflows of £37bn. The positive
market move impact of £98bn was largely offset by £89bn of adverse
exchange rate movements. In US$ terms assets under management
increased by US$301bn to US$1,814bn (2005: US$1,513bn),
comprising US$68bn of net new assets, US$177bn of favourable market
movements and US$56bn of positive exchange rate movements. 
2005/04
Barclays Global Investors delivered a year of outstanding financial
results in 2005. The performance was spread across a diverse range 
of products, distribution channels and geographies. Profit before tax
increased 61% (£204m) to £540m (2004: £336m) reflecting
substantial income growth and focused investment spend. 
Net fee and commission income increased 47% (£415m) to £1,297m
(2004: £882m), driven by significant increases in management,
incentive and securities lending revenues. 
Investment performance remained very good for the majority of active
funds as they outperformed their respective benchmarks. 
Operating expenses increased 40% (£223m) to £779m (2004: £556m)
as a result of higher performance-based expenses, significant
investment in key growth initiatives and ongoing investment in
infrastructure required to support business growth. The cost:income
ratio improved to 59% (2004: 62%).
Total assets under management increased 24% (£172bn) to £881bn
(2004: £709bn). The growth included £48bn of net new assets, £53bn
attributable to favourable exchange rate movements and £71bn as a
result of market movements. In US$ terms, the increase in assets under
management to US$1,513bn from US$1,362bn (2004) included
US$88bn of net new assets and US$121bn of market movements,
partially offset by adverse exchange rate movements of US$58bn.  Financial review

2006/05
Barclays Wealth profit before tax showed very strong growth of 28%
(£47m) to £213m (2005: £166m). Performance was driven by broadly
based income growth and favourable market conditions. This was
partially offset by additional volume related costs and a significant
increase in investment in people and infrastructure to support 
future growth.
Income increased 12% (£114m) to £1,036m (2005: £922m).
Net interest income increased 11% (£37m) to £366m (2005: £329m)
reflecting growth in both customer deposits and customer lending.
Average customer deposits grew 6% (£1.3bn) to £24.7bn (2005:
£23.4bn). Average loans to customers grew 16% to £5.1bn (2005:
£4.4bn), driven by increased lending to offshore and private banking
clients. Asset and liability margins were higher relative to 2005.
Net fee and commission income increased 13% (£76m) to £665m
(2005: £589m). This reflected growth in client assets and higher
transactional income, including increased sales of investment 
products to private banking and financial planning clients, and 
higher stockbroking volumes.
Operating expenses increased 9% (£67m) to £821m (2005: £754m)
with greater volume related and investment costs more than offsetting
efficiency gains. Investment costs included increased hiring of client-
facing staff and improvements to infrastructure with the upgrade of
technology and operations platforms. The cost:income ratio improved
three percentage points to 79% (2005: 82%).
Total client assets, comprising customer deposits and client
investments, increased 19% (£14.7bn) to £93.0bn (2005: £78.3bn)
reflecting good net new asset inflows and favourable market conditions.
Multi-Manager assets increased 68% (£4.1bn) to £10.1bn (2005:
£6.0bn); this growth included transfers of existing client assets.
2005/04
Barclays Wealth profit before tax increased 54% (£58m) to £166m
(2004: £108m), driven by broad-based income growth and 
improved cost efficiency. Income increased 10% (£85m) to £922m
(2004: £837m). 
Net interest income increased 9% (£28m) to £329m (2004: £301m)
reflecting strong growth in loans and deposits. Average customer
deposits increased 14% to £23.4bn (2004: £20.6bn), driven by strong
growth from offshore and private banking clients. Average loans
increased 22% to £4.4bn (2004: £3.6bn), reflecting growth from
corporate clients in the offshore business. 
Net fee and commission income increased 11% (£60m) to £589m
(2004: £529m). The increase was driven principally by sales of
investment products to private banking and financial planning clients,
stronger equity markets and higher client transaction volumes.
Operating expenses increased 3% (£24m) to £754m (2004: £730m).
The cost:income ratio improved five percentage points to 82% 
(2004: 87%).

Barclays Wealth – closed life assurance activities profit before tax

Profit before tax excluding customer redress costs was £89m 
(2005: £78m).
Income grew 9% (£11m) to £131m (2005: £120m) principally due to
reduced funding costs.
Operating expenses decreased to £109m (2005: £127m). Costs relating

operating expenses remained steady at £42m (2005: £42m).
2005/04
Barclays Wealth – closed life assurance activities loss before tax reduced

(2004: £44m).
Total income decreased to £495m (2004: £908m), largely due to the

reduction in net claims and benefits.

2006/05
Head office functions and other operations loss before tax decreased
£64m to £259m (2005: loss £323m). 
Net interest income decreased £80m to £80m (2005: £160m) reflecting
a reduction in net interest income in Treasury following the acquisition
of Absa Group Limited. Treasury’s net interest income also included the
hedge ineffectiveness for the period, which together with other related
Treasury adjustments amounted to a gain of £11m (2005: £18m) and
the cost of hedging the foreign exchange risk on the Group’s equity
investment in Absa, which amounted to £71m (2005: £37m).
Group segmental reporting is performed in accordance with Group
accounting policies. This means that inter-segment transactions are
recorded in each segment as if undertaken on an arms-length basis.
Adjustments necessary to eliminate the inter-segment transactions 
are included in Head office functions and other operations.
The impact of such inter-segment adjustments reduced £72m to
£147m (2005: £219m). These adjustments related to internal fees for
structured capital market activities of £87m (2005: £67m) and fees 
paid to Barclays Capital for capital raising and risk management advice
of £16m (2005: £39m), both of which reduce net fees and commission
income. In addition the impact of the timing of the recognition of
insurance commissions included in Barclaycard and UK Retail Banking
reduced to £44m (2005: £113m). This reduction was reflected in a
decrease in net fee and commission income of £242m (2005: £258m)
and an increase in net premium income of £198m (2005: £145m).
Principal transactions decreased £51m to £42m (2005: £93m). 2005
included hedging related gains in Treasury of £80m. 2006 included
£55m (2005: £nil) in respect of the economic hedge of the translation
exposure arising from Absa foreign currency earnings.
The impairment charge improved £12m to a release of £11m (2005:
£1m charge) as a number of workout situations were resolved.
Operating expenses decreased £78m to £269m (2005: £347m)
primarily due to the expenses of the 2005 Head office relocation to
Canary Wharf not recurring in 2006 (2005: £105m) and the gains 
of £26m (2005: £nil) from the sale and leaseback of property offset 
by increased costs, principally driven by major project expenditure
including work related to implementing Basel II.
2005/04
Head office functions and other operations loss before tax increased
£166m to £323m (2004: loss £157m), reflecting the elimination of
inter-segment transactions and increased operating expenses.
The increase in inter-segment consolidation adjustments of £150m to
£219m (2004: £69m) mainly arises from the timing of the recognition
of insurance premiums included in Barclaycard and UK Banking
amounting to £113m (2004: £nil). In 2004 and prior years, Barclaycard
dealt with third-party underwriters but from the start of 2005 this
activity was undertaken with the captive insurance operation within 
UK Banking.
In addition, there were two other significant consolidation adjustments
in 2005: internal fees for structured capital markets activities arranged
by Barclays Capital of £67m (2004: £63m); and the fees paid to Barclays
Capital for capital raising and risk management advice of £39m (2004:
£nil). Previously, capital raising fees were amortised over the life of the
capital raising and taken as a charge to net interest income. Under IFRS
they are recognised as a cost in the year of issue.
Net trading income of £85m (2004: £21m) primarily arose as a result 
of hedging related transactions in Treasury. The hedge ineffectiveness
from 1st January 2005, together with other related Treasury
adjustments, amounted to a gain of £18m (2004: £nil) and was
reported in net interest income. The cost of hedging the foreign
exchange risk on the Group’s investment in Absa amounted to £37m
(2004: £nil) and was deducted from net interest income.
Other income primarily comprised property rental income.
Impairment reflected recoveries made on loans previously written off 
in the transition businesses.
Operating expenses rose £156m to £347m (2004: £191m) and
included non-recurring costs relating to the Head office relocation to
Canary Wharf of £105m (2004: £32m) and a charge to write-down
capitalised IT related assets held centrally of £60m (2004: £nil). Barclays PLC

A component of the benefit of free funds included in Group net interest
income is the structural hedge which functions to reduce the impact of
the volatility of short-term interest rate movements. The contribution of
the structural hedge decreased to £26m (2005: £145m), largely due to

all businesses.
The contribution of the structural hedge decreased to £145m (2004:

Group net interest income 9,143 8,075 6,833
Business net interest income is derived from the interest rate earned on
average assets or paid on average liabilities relative to the average Bank
of England base rate, local equivalents for international businesses or
the rate managed by the bank using derivatives. The margin is
expressed as annualised business interest income over the relevant
average balance. Asset and liability margins cannot be added together
as they are relative to the average Bank of England base rate, local
equivalent for international businesses or the rate managed by the bank
using derivatives. The benefit of capital attributed to these businesses is
excluded from the calculation of business margins and business net
interest income.
Average balances are calculated on daily averages for most UK banking
operations and monthly averages elsewhere.
Within the reconciliation of Group net interest income, there is an
amount captured as Other. This relates to: benefit of capital excluded
from the business margin calculation, Head office functions and other
operations; net funding on non-customer assets and liabilities; and
Barclays Wealth – closed life assurance activities. 
2006/05
UK Retail Banking assets margin decreased 8 basis points to 0.84%
(2005: 0.92%). The mortgage margin has been impacted by changed
assumptions used in the calculation of effective interest rates, a higher
proportion of new mortgages and base rate changes. This was partially
offset by increased contributions from non-mortgage assets. UK Retail
Banking liabilities margin was stable at 2.01% (2005: 1.99%).
UK Business Banking assets margin improved to 1.92% (2005: 1.87%). 
UK Business Banking liabilities margin was stable at 1.46% (2005: 1.46%).
Barclaycard margins in credit cards improved to 8.73% (2005: 7.96%)
due to the impact of increased card rates and a reduced proportion of
promotional rate balances in the UK. Margins in consumer lending fell to
4.11% (2005: 4.96%) due to a higher proportion of secured lending and
continued competitive pressure.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa assets
margin decreased 8 basis points to 1.28% (2005: 1.36%) partly
reflecting a greater share of mortgage assets as a proportion of the 
total book in continental Europe.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa assets margin
decreased 57 basis points to 2.95% (2005
(b)
: annualised 3.52%)
reflecting a higher proportion of mortgage assets and competitive
pressures in mortgages and asset finance. The liabilities margin
decreased 10 basis points to 2.29% (2005
(b)
: annualised 2.39%). The
Absa Group Limited net interest margin remained stable compared to
the year to 31st December 2005 as the asset margin decrease was
offset by the benefit of higher returns on free funds and a higher
proportion of preference share capital in the funding mix.
Barclays Wealth assets margin increased 12 basis points to 1.11%
(2005: 0.99%) largely reflecting higher margins on new lending
business and a small increase in mortgage margins. The liabilities
margin increased 7 basis points to 1.11% (2005: 1.04%) principally 
due to a slight increase in currency deposit spreads. 
2005/04
In 2005, UK Retail Banking assets margin increased 14 basis points to
0.92% (2004: 0.78%) due to improved mortgage margins and higher
contributions from Personal Customer overdrafts and Local Business
loans. The UK Retail Banking liabilities margin decreased by 15 basis
points to 1.99% (2004: 2.14%), reflecting the reduced contribution
from the structural hedge, and competition for retail savings and
deposits. The movements in both the assets and liabilities partly reflect
changes in UK base rates.
UK Business Banking assets margin increased 31 basis points to 1.87%
(2004: 1.56%). Excluding the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 the asset
margin was broadly stable. UK Business Banking liabilities margin
decreased 12 basis points to 1.46% (2004: 1.58%), principally reflecting
the reduced contribution from the structural hedge.
Barclaycard cards margin increased 62 basis points to 7.96% (2004:
7.34%) principally reflecting the impact of increased card rates and a
reduced proportion of total balances on promotional offers. Barclaycard
loans margin decreased 131 basis points to 4.96% (2004: 6.27%), due
to the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39, competitive pressure and a change
in the product mix with a higher weighting to secured loans.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa assets
margin decreased 20 basis points to 1.36% (2004: 1.56%) reflecting the
impact of a change in mix as a result of growth in mortgage assets in
Europe and competitive pressures. International Retail and Commercial
Banking – excluding Absa liabilities margin was broadly stable at 2.02%
(2004: 2.06%). 
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa assets margin of
3.52% (2005
(b)
: annualised) for the period since acquisition reflected
the impact of competitive pressure. The liabilities margin of 2.39%
benefited from an increasing interest rate cycle.
Barclays Wealth assets margin increased slightly by 2 basis points to
0.99% (2004: 0.97%). The application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 did not
impact the assets margin. Barclays Wealth liabilities margin decreased
modestly by 3 basis points to 1.04% (2004: 1.07%). Excluding the
reduced contribution from the structural hedge, underlying margins
were firmer. Barclays PLC

In 2005, net fee and commission income increased 18% (£858m) to
£5,705m (2004: £4,847m) reflecting good growth across all businesses.
The inclusion of Absa increased net fee and commission income by

The growth was driven by Barclays Global Investors, reflecting strong
growth in net new assets, a strong investment performance and higher
market levels, and by Barclays Capital, as a result of increased business
volumes and higher market share. In addition, Barclaycard fee and
commission income increased as a result of higher contributions from
Barclaycard Business and FirstPlus and the inclusion of Barclaycard US
for the full year. Fee and commission expense increased 10% (£63m) 
to £725m (2004: £662m), largely reflecting the inclusion of Absa which
added £52m.

Most of the Group’s trading income is generated in Barclays Capital.
Net trading income increased 56% (£1,293m) to £3,614m (2005:
£2,321m) due to excellent performances in Barclays Capital Rates and
Credit businesses, in particular in commodities, fixed income, equities,
credit derivatives and emerging markets. This was driven by higher
volumes of client – led activity and favourable market conditions. The
inclusion of Absa contributed net trading income of £60m (2005

increased 3%.
The cumulative gain from disposal of available for sale assets increased
156% (£187m) to £307m (2005: £120m) driven by investment
realisations, primarily in Private Equity.
Fair value movements on certain assets and liabilities have been
reported within net trading income or within net investment income
depending on the nature of the transaction. Fair value movements on
insurance assets included within net investment income contributed
£205m (2005: £317m). 
2005/04
In 2005, net trading income increased 56% (£834m) to £2,321m 
(2004: £1,487m) due to strong performances across Barclays Capital
Rates and Credit businesses, in particular from commodities, foreign
exchange, fixed income and credit derivatives. This was driven by the
continued return on prior-year investments and higher volumes of
client-led activity across a broad range of products and geographical
regions. Group net trading income excluding £9m of Absa income, 
grew 55%.
Net investment income decreased 16% (£169m) to £858m (2004:
£1,027m). The inclusion of Absa increased net investment income

Following the application of IAS 39 at 1st January 2005, certain assets
and liabilities were designated at fair value. Fair value movements on
these items were reported within net trading income or within net
investment income depending on the nature of the transaction. 
Fair value movements on insurance assets included within net
investment income contributed £317m. 
From 1st January 2005, investment and insurance contracts are
separately accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 4. This 
has resulted in investment income and the corresponding movement 
in investment contract liabilities being presented on a net basis within
other income. In 2004, all contracts were accounted for as insurance
contracts and the gross income relating to these contracts was reported
as income from assets backing insurance policies.

Impairment charges on loans and advances and other 
credit provisions
Impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit provisions
increased 32% (£501m) to £2,068m (2005: £1,567m). Excluding Absa,
the increase was 26% (£395m) and largely reflected the continued
challenging credit environment in UK unsecured retail lending through
2006. The wholesale and corporate sectors remained stable with a low
level of defaults. 
The Group impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit
provisions as a percentage of year-end total loans and advances of
£316,561m (2005: £303,451m) increased to 0.65% (2005: 0.52%). 
Retail impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit
provisions increased to £1,809m (2005: £1,254m), including £99m
(2005
(b)
: £10m) in respect of Absa. Retail impairment charges on loans
and advances amounted to 1.30% (2005
(c)
: 0.93%) as a percentage of
year-end total loans and advances of £139,350m (2005
(c)
: £134,420m),
including balances in Absa of £20,090m (2005: £20,836m).
In the UK retail businesses, household cash flows remained under
pressure leading to a deterioration in consumer credit quality. High debt
levels and changing social attitudes to bankruptcy and debt default
contributed to higher levels of insolvency and increased impairment
charges. In UK cards and unsecured consumer lending, the flows of new
delinquencies and the levels of arrears balances declined in the second
half of 2006, reflecting more selective customer recruitment, limit
management and improved collections. 
In UK Home Finance, delinquencies were flat and amounts charged-off
remained low. The weaker external environment led to increased credit
delinquency in Local Business, where there were both higher balances
on caution status and higher flows into delinquency, which both
stabilised towards the year end.
In the wholesale and corporate businesses, impairment charges on
loans and advances and other credit provisions decreased to £259m
(2005: £313m), including £27m (2005
(b)
: £10m) in respect of Absa. 
The fall was due mainly to recoveries in Barclays Capital as a result of 
the benign wholesale credit environment. This was partially offset by an
increase in UK Business Banking, reflecting higher charges in Medium
Business and growth in lending balances.
The wholesale and corporate impairment charge was 0.15% (2005
(c)
:
0.19%) as a percentage of year-end total loans and advances to banks
and to customers of £177,211m (2005
(c)
: £169,031m), including
balances in Absa of £9,299m (2005: £9,731m).
In Absa, impairment charges increased to £126m (2005
(b)
: £20m)
reflecting a full year of business and normalisation of credit conditions
in South Africa following a period of low interest rates.
Impairment on available for sale assets
The total impairment charges in Barclays Capital included losses of
£83m (2005: £nil) on an available for sale portfolio where an intention
to sell caused the losses to be viewed as other than temporary in nature.
These losses in 2006 were primarily due to interest rate movements,
rather than credit deterioration, with a corresponding gain arising on
offsetting derivatives recognised in net trading income.

Impairment charges (continued)
2005/04
Total impairment charges and other credit provisions increased 44%
(£478m) to £1,571m (2004: £1,093). This reflected some large one-off
releases and recoveries in 2004, the impact of acquisitions in 2005 and
changes in methodology.
In the UK, pressure on household cash flows due to a range of factors
and the high level of household indebtedness led to a greater strain on
personal budgets. This resulted in a deterioration in consumer credit
quality which was evident from higher average delinquency balances
and shorter periods between delinquency and charge-off. Smaller
business customers also showed some limited deterioration in credit
quality. Wholesale and corporate credit conditions remained steady. 
As a result of an increase in impairment charges to the retail portfolios,
and to a lesser extent in the wholesale and corporate portfolios, the
impairment charges for the Group (excluding Absa charges of £20m)
for the full year were £1,547m (2004: £1,093m). Impairment charges
excluding Absa amounted to 0.57% (2004: 0.48%), as a percentage of
period-end total non-trading loans and advances.
Retail impairment charges, excluding Absa charges of £10m, increased
to £1,244m (2004: £811m), accounting for just under 80% of the
Group’s impairment charges. Excluding Absa, retail impairment charges
amounted to 1.10% (2004: 0.72%) of the period-end total non-trading
loans and advances. The increase was predominantly in the UK cards
and consumer loans portfolios. 
In the wholesale and corporate businesses, excluding Absa impairment
charges of £10m, impairment charges increased to £303m 
(2004: £282m). The increase occurred largely in UK Business Banking
and reflected the fact that the 2004 results included a large one-off
recovery of £57m. Underlying impairment charges excluding this 
item were broadly flat. Wholesale and corporate impairment charges,
excluding Absa, were 0.19% (2004: 0.25%) of period-end total 
non-trading loans and advances. 
Absa’s impairment charge of £20m for the five-month period was low 
in a benign credit environment and also reflected a reduction in the
number and value of non-performing loans and a higher level of
releases and recoveries.

2006/05
Operating expenses increased 20% (£2,147m) to £12,674m (2005:
£10,527m). The inclusion of Absa contributed operating expenses of
£1,496m (2005
(b)
664m). Group operating expenses excluding Absa
grew 13%, reflecting a higher level of business activity and an increase
in performance related pay.
Administrative expenses increased 16% (£537m) to £3,980m (2005:
£3,443m). The inclusion of Absa contributed administrative expenses
of £579m (2005
(b)
: £257m). Group administrative expenses excluding
Absa grew 7% principally as a result of higher business activity in UK
Banking and Barclays Capital. 
Operating lease rentals increased 9% (£29m) to £345m (2005: £316m).
The inclusion of Absa contributed operating lease rentals of £73m
(2005
(b)
: £27m), which more than offset the absence of double
occupancy costs incurred in 2005, associated with the Head office
relocation to Canary Wharf. 
Operating expenses were reduced by gains from the sale of property of
£432m (2005: £nil) as the Group took advantage of historically low
yields on property to realise gains on some of its freehold portfolio. 
Amortisation of intangible assets increased 72% (£57m) to £136m
(2005: £79m) primarily reflecting the inclusion of Absa for the full year.
The Group cost:income ratio improved to 59% (2005: 61%). This
reflected improved productivity. The Group cost:net income ratio was
65% (2005: 67%).
2005/04
Operating expenses increased 23% (£1,991m) to £10,527m (2004:
£8,536m). The inclusion of Absa added operating expenses of £664m
to the second half of 2005. Group operating expenses excluding Absa
grew 15% reflecting higher business activity. 
Administrative expenses increased 24% (£677m) to £3,443m (2004:
£2,766m). The inclusion of Absa added administrative expenses of
£257m in the second half of 2005. Group administrative expenses
excluding Absa grew 15% principally as a result of higher business
activity in Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors and the
inclusion of Barclaycard US for the full year.
Administrative expenses included non-recurring costs relating to the
write-down of capitalised IT related assets held centrally of £60m
(2004: £nil). Impairment losses of £9m (2004: £9m) reflected a further
charge for the impairment of certain capitalised IT related assets
following a review of their likely future economic benefit.
Operating lease rentals increased 47% (£101m) to £316m (2004:
£215m). The inclusion of Absa added operating lease rentals of £27m 
in the second half of 2005. Operating lease rentals excluding Absa
increased primarily as a consequence of the double occupancy costs
associated with the Head office relocation to Canary Wharf. 
The Group cost:income ratio remained steady at 61%. This reflected
improved productivity in UK Banking, Barclays Global Investors and
Barclays Wealth; and a stable performance by International Retail and
Commercial Banking, offset by an increase in non-recurring operating
expenses in Head office and other functions.
The Group cost:net income ratio was 67% (2004: 66%).

internationally.
UK Banking staff numbers increased 1,300 to 41,100 (31st December
2005: 39,800), primarily reflecting the inclusion in UK Retail Banking of
mortgage processing staff involved in activities previously outsourced.
Barclaycard staff numbers rose 800 to 8,600 (31st December 2005:

Staff numbers (continued)
Barclays Wealth staff numbers rose 600 to 7,800 (31st December 2005:
7,200) to support the continued expansion of the business, including
increased hiring of client-facing staff.
Head office functions and other operations staff numbers grew 300 to
1,200 (31st December 2005: 900) primarily reflecting the centralisation
of functional activity and the increased regulatory environment and
audit demands as a result of the expansion of business areas.
Agency staff numbers rose 2,100 to 9,100 (31st December 2005:
7,000), largely due to an increase in temporary staff at Absa.
2005/04
In 2005, total Group permanent and contract staff comprised 59,100
(31st December 2004: 60,000) in the UK and 54,200 (31st December
2004: 18,400) internationally.
Since 2004 permanent and contract staff numbers increased 34,900,
primarily as a result of the acquisition of Absa Group Limited, offset in
part by the implementation of restructuring programmes resulting in 
a decrease of 2,400 staff.
UK Banking staff numbers fell 1,900 to 39,800 (31st December 2004:
41,700), reflecting the cost management programme in UK Retail
Banking partially offset by an increase in UK Business Banking frontline
staff and the inclusion of 200 Iveco Finance staff.
Barclaycard staff numbers rose 1,100 to 7,800 (31st December 2004:
6,700), reflecting growth of 300 in Barclaycard US, an increase of 200 in
other international operations and growth in customer-facing staff in
the UK.
International Retail and Commercial Banking increased staff numbers
33,300, primarily due to the inclusion of 32,700 Absa staff. International
Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa increased staff
numbers by 600 to 12,700 (31st December 2004: 12,100), mainly due
to growth in continental Europe, including over 100 from the acquisition
of the ING Ferri business in France.
Barclays Capital staff numbers rose 2,000 to 9,900 (31st December
2004: 7,900), reflecting the continued expansion of the business. 
Barclays Global Investors increased staff numbers 400 to 2,300 to
support strategic initiatives (31st December 2004: 1,900).
Head office functions and other operations staff numbers remained
stable at 900 (31st December 2004: 900).
The increase in agency staff worldwide largely reflected the inclusion 
of 3,300 temporary staff at Absa.

performance by FirstCaribbean in 2005 was more than offset by the
impact of a gain in 2004 relating to the sale of shares held in Republic
Bank Ltd (Barclays share £28m). Losses from joint ventures primarily
related to Intelligent Processing Systems Limited, a cheque processing

Overall tax charge 1,941 1,439 1,279

2006/05
The charge for the period is based upon a UK corporation tax rate of
30% for the calendar year 2006 (2005: 30%). The effective rate of tax
for 2006, based on profit before tax, was 27.2% (2005: 27.3%). The
effective tax rate differs from 30% as it takes account of the different tax
rates which are applied to the profits earned outside the UK, disallowable
expenditure, certain non-taxable gains and adjustments to prior year
tax provisions. The effective tax rate for 2006 is consistent with the prior
period. The tax charge for the year includes £1,234m (2005: £961m)
arising in the UK and £707m (2005: £478m) arising overseas.
The profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of
£323m was substantially offset by losses or exemptions. The effective
tax rate on profit before business disposals was 28.5%.
2005/04
In 2005, the charge for the period was based upon a UK corporation tax
rate of 30% for the calendar year 2005 (2004: 30%). The effective rate
of tax for 2005 was 27% (2004: 28%). This was lower than the standard
rate due to the beneficial effects of lower tax on certain overseas income
and certain non-taxable gains. The tax charge for the year included
£961m (2004: £1,028m) arising in the UK and £478m (2004: £251m)
arising overseas.

Changes in net interest income – volume and rate analysis
The following tables allocate changes in net interest income between changes in volume and changes in interest rates for the last two years. 
Volume and rate variances have been calculated on the movement in the average balances and the change in the interest rates on average interest
earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities. Where variances have arisen from changes in both volumes and interest rates, these have 
been allocated proportionately between the two.

Total assets and risk weighted assets
2006/05
Total assets increased 8% to £996.8bn (2005: £924.4bn). Risk weighted
assets increased 11% to £297.8bn (2005: £269.1bn). Loans and
advances to customers that have been securitised increased £5.8bn to
£24.4bn (2005: £18.6bn). The increase in risk weighted assets since
2005 reflects a rise of £18.1bn in the banking book and a rise of £10.9bn
in the trading book. 
UK Retail Banking total assets increased 5% to £74.0bn (2005:
£70.4bn). This was mainly attributable to growth in mortgage balances.
Risk weighted assets increased 6% to £34.9bn (2005: £32.8bn) also
primarily reflecting the growth in mortgage balances.
UK Business Banking total assets increased 10% to £65.9bn (2005:
£59.9bn) reflecting good growth across short, medium and long term
lending products. Risk weighted assets increased 6% to £50.0bn (2005:
£47.1bn), reflecting asset growth and increased regulatory netting.
Barclaycard total assets increased 7% to £27.6bn (2005: £25.8bn)
driven by growth in lending balances in the international businesses 
and FirstPlus. Risk weighted assets increased 16% to £25.2bn (2005:
£21.8bn), primarily reflecting the increase in total assets and lower
securitised balances.
International Retail and Commercial Banking-excluding Absa total
assets increased 13% to £38.5bn (2005: £34.2bn) mainly reflecting
increases in mortgage and other lending. Risk weighted assets
remained flat at £20.3bn (2005: £20.4bn), with balance sheet growth
offset by the sale of FirstCaribbean International Bank.
International Retail and Commercial Banking-Absa total assets
increased 3% to £30.4bn (2005: £29.4bn). Risk weighted assets
remained flat at £20.7bn (2005: £20.8bn). This reflects very strong
growth in Rand terms offset by a 21% decline in the value of the Rand. 
In Rand terms assets grew 31% to ZAR417bn (2005: ZAR319bn) 
and risk weighted assets grew 25% to ZAR284bn (2005: ZAR227bn)
due to strong growth in mortgage lending along with growth in
corporate lending.
Barclays Capital total assets increased 9% to £657.9bn (2005:
£601.2bn). This reflected continued expansion of the business with
growth in reverse repurchase agreements, debt securities and traded
equity securities. Risk weighted assets increased 18% to £137.6bn
(2005: £116.7bn) in line with risk, driven by the growth in equity
derivatives, credit derivatives and fixed income.
Barclays Global Investors total assets remained flat at £80.5bn (2005:
£80.9bn). The majority of total assets relates to asset management
products with equal and offsetting balances reflected within liabilities to
customers. Risk weighted assets decreased 7% to £1.4bn (2005: £1.5bn).
Barclays Wealth total assets increased 20% to £7.3bn (2005: £6.1bn)
reflecting strong growth in lending to high net worth, affluent and
intermediary clients. Risk weighted assets increased 39% to £5.7bn
(2005: £4.1bn) above the rate of balance sheet growth driven by
changes in the mix of lending and growth in guarantees.
Head office functions and other operations total assets decreased 
24% to £7.1bn (2005: £9.3bn). Risk weighted assets decreased 53% 
to £1.9bn (2005: £4.0bn).

Note
(a) 2004 figures do not reflect the applications of IAS 32, and IAS 39 and IFRS 4 which became effective from 1st January 2005.  2005/04
Total assets increased 72% to £924.4bn (2004: £538.2bn). Risk
weighted assets increased 23% to £269.1bn (2004: £218.6bn). Loans
and advances to customers that have been securitised increased
£14.3bn to £18.6bn (2004: £4.3bn). The increase in risk weighted
assets since 2004 reflects a rise of £37.6bn in the banking book and 
a rise of £12.9bn in the trading book.
UK Retail Banking total assets decreased 3% to £70.4bn (2004: £72.8bn).
This was mainly attributable to lower residential mortgage balances. Risk
weighted assets decreased 14% to £32.8bn (2004: £38.2bn), reflecting
lower mortgage balances and a £4.5bn securitisation of mortgage assets
in the second half of 2005, which more than offset strong growth in
non-mortgage loans.
UK Business Banking total assets increased 42% to £59.9bn 
(2004: £42.2bn) due to the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and
IAS 39 and strong growth in lending balances. Risk weighted assets
increased 12% to £47.1bn (2004: £42.3bn), the increase being lower
than asset growth, mostly as a result of £5bn securitisation of corporate
loans in the second half of 2005. The acquisition of a 51% stake in Iveco
Finance, completed in June, increased total assets and risk weighted
assets by £1.8bn.
Barclaycard total assets increased 10% to £25.8bn (2004: £23.4bn).
Risk weighted assets rose by 8% to £21.8bn (2004: £20.2bn), which 
is less than the increase in assets, reflecting increased securitisation
activity during the second half of 2005.
International Retail and Commercial Banking excluding Absa total
assets increased 20% to £34.2bn (2004: £28.5bn) reflecting strong
volume growth in European mortgages and African corporate lending.
Risk weighted assets increased 6% to £20.4bn (2004: £19.3bn), 
which was lower than the increase in assets, reflecting strong growth 
in mortgage balances, which carry a 50% weighting, and the
securitisation of assets in Spain during the second half of 2005. 
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa total assets were
£29.4bn and risk weighted assets £20.8bn. 
Barclays Capital total assets increased 70% to £601.2bn (2004:
£353.2bn). £107.5bn of this increase was the result of the adoption of
IAS 32 and IAS 39. The underlying growth was mainly attributable to
increases in debt securities and reverse repurchase agreements as the
business continued to grow, and in derivative financial instruments as a
result of business growth and market movements. Risk weighted assets
increased 30% to £116.7bn (2004: £90.1bn). Excluding the impact of
the transfer of a number of clients from UK Business Banking and Absa
Capital from IRCB, effective 1st January 2006, the underlying growth
was 20%. This reflected trading book risk weighted assets moving in
line with risk rather than the balance sheet and the lower weighting 
of fully collateralised reverse repurchase agreements.
Barclays Global Investors total assets increased £79.9bn to £80.9bn 
(2004: £1.0bn) due to the impact of the adoption of IAS 32, IAS 39 
and IFRS 4 and growth in asset management products reported on the
balance sheet. For the amounts related to asset management products,
equal and offsetting balances are reflected within liabilities to
customers. Risk weighted assets rose 25% to £1.5bn (2004: £1.2bn)
due to growth in the business.
Barclays Wealth total assets increased 9% to £6.1bn (2004: £5.6bn).
Risk weighted assets increased 3% to £4.1bn (2004: £4.0bn). 
Head office functions and other operations total assets increased 82%
to £9.3bn (2004: £5.1bn). The increase included financial instruments
acquired for hedging purposes. Risk weighted assets increased 21% to
£4bn (2004: £3.3bn), reflecting assets held for hedging purposes.

Capital management
Barclays operates a centralised capital management model, considering
both regulatory and economic capital. The capital management
strategy is to continue to maximise shareholder value through
optimising both the level and mix of capital resources in order to:
•
Meet the individual capital ratios required by our regulators plus 
a prudent buffer.
•
Maintain an AA credit rating.
•
Generate sufficient capital to support asset growth.
•
Manage the currency exposure to its overall Sterling equivalent
capital requirement.
Decisions on the allocation of capital resources are based on a number
of factors including return on economic and regulatory capital. This is
conducted as part of the strategic planning review.
Capital resources
The Group manages both its debt and equity capital actively. The
Group’s authority to buy-back equity shares was renewed at the 2006
AGM to provide additional flexibility in the management of the Group’s
capital resources.

The authorised share capital of Barclays PLC was £2,500m (2005:
£2,500m) comprising 9,996 million (2005: 9,996 million) ordinary
shares of 25p each and 1 million (2005: 1 million) staff shares of 
£1 each. Called up share capital comprises 6,535 million (2005: 6,490

staff shares of £1 each. 
Total capital resources increased £4,283m to £41,176m since 
31st December 2005.
Shareholders’ equity, excluding minority interests, increased £2,373m
since 31st December 2005. The increase reflected profits attributable to
equity holders of the parent of £4,571m, increases in share capital and
share premium of £179m and other increases in retained reserves of
£412m. Offsetting these movements were dividends paid of £1,771m,
decreases in the available for sale and cash flow hedging reserves of
£93m and £300m respectively, a £594m decrease in the currency
translation reserve and a £31m decrease due to changes in treasury 
and Employee Share Ownership Plan shares.
Subordinated liabilities increased £1,323m since 31st December 2005.
The increase reflects capital raisings of £2,493m and interest charges 
of £11m; offset by exchange rate movements of £575m, redemptions 
of £366m, fair value adjustments of £214m and amortisation of issue
expenses of £26m.
Minority interests increased £587m since 31st December 2005. The
increase primarily reflected the issue by Barclays Bank PLC, during April
2006, of 30,000,000 Preference Shares of US$25 each (US$750m;
£419m) with a 6.625% dividend. In addition, during April 2006, Absa
issued 3,000,000 preference shares of ZAR1,000 per share (£218m).

The authorised share capital of Barclays PLC was £2,500m (2004:
£2,500m) comprising 9,996 million (2004: 9,996 million) ordinary
shares of 25p each and 1 million (2004: 1 million) staff shares

(2004: 6,454 million) ordinary shares of 25p each and 1 million 
(2004: 1 million) staff shares of £1 each. 
Total capital resources increased £7,852m to £36,893m since 2004.
Shareholders’ equity, excluding minority interests, increased £1,556m
since 2004. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the adoption
of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4, profits attributable to equity holders of the
parent of £3,447m, offset by dividends of £1,581m.
Subordinated liabilities rose £186m reflecting capital raisings of £1,283m,
acquisition of Absa Group Limited’s loan capital of £669m, interest 
charge of £210m and exchange rate movements of £207m; offset by
redemptions of £464m, fair value adjustments of £43m and amortisation
of issue expenses of £5m, and IFRS adjustments of £1,671m.
Minority interests increased £6,110m since 2004, primarily reflecting:
the purchase of Absa Group Limited (£1,351m), the IFRS
reclassification of £2,493m of certain capital instruments from loan
capital to minority interests and the following issuances of Preference
Shares by Barclays Bank PLC during 2005:
•
140,000 Preference Shares of nominal ¤100 each (Principal
amount: ¤1.4bn; £978m) with a 4.75% dividend issued on
15th March 2005.
•
100,000 Preference Shares of nominal US$100 each (Principal
amount: US$1bn; £551m) with a 6.278% dividend issued on

Capital ratios
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) and European Union Directives, as implemented by the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) for supervisory purposes. 
These techniques include the risk asset ratio calculation, which the FSA regards as a key supervisory tool. The FSA sets ratio requirements for
individual banks in the UK at or above the internationally agreed minimum of 8%. The ratio calculation involves the application of designated risk
weightings to reflect an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with broad categories of transactions and counterparties. Regulatory
guidelines define three ‘Tiers’ of capital resources. Tier 1 capital, comprising mainly shareholders’ funds and including Reserve Capital Instruments
and Tier One Notes, is the highest tier and can be used to meet trading and banking activity requirements. Tier 2 includes perpetual, medium-term
and long-term subordinated debt and collectively assessed impairment allowances. Tier 2 capital can also be used to support both trading and
banking activities. Tier 3 capital also comprises short-term subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of two years. The use of tier 3 capital
is restricted to trading activities only and it is not eligible to support counterparty or settlement risk. The aggregate of Tiers 2 and 3 capital included in
the risk asset ratio calculation may not exceed Tier 1 capital.

At 31st December 2006, the Barclays PLC Group Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.7% and the Risk asset ratio was 11.7%. From 31st December 2005, total
net capital resources rose £4.2bn and risk weighted assets increased £28.7bn.
Tier 1 capital rose £4.1bn, including £2.8bn arising from profits attributable to equity shareholders net of dividends paid. Minority interests within
Tier 1 capital increased £1.3bn primarily due to the issuance of £1.2bn of Reserve Capital Instruments and £0.7bn of Preference Shares partially
offset by a decrease in regulatory associates of £0.4bn driven by the sale of FirstCaribbean International Bank and exchange rate movements of
£0.5bn. Tier 2 capital increased £0.7bn mainly as a result of the issuance of £1.5bn of loan capital partially offset by exchange rate movements of
£0.6bn and redemptions of £0.4bn. 
Similar movements are reflected in the risk weighted assets and total net capital resources of Barclays Bank PLC Group, however the retention by
Barclays PLC of dividends paid by Barclays Bank PLC gave rise to a reduction in the capital of Barclays Bank PLC Group relative to that of Barclays PLC
Group, resulting in Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.5% and 11.5% respectively.
The weakening of the Rand against Sterling had a positive impact on capital ratios in 2006.

Off-balance sheet arrangements
Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 63
Operating review
1
Off-balance sheet arrangements
In the ordinary course of business and primarily to facilitate client
transactions, the Group enters into off-balance sheet arrangements.
These arrangements include the provision of guarantees on behalf 
of the Group’s customers, retained interests in assets which have been
transferred to an unconsolidated entity and obligations arising out 
of variable interests in an unconsolidated entity.
Guarantees 
In the normal course of business, the Group issues guarantees on behalf
of its customers. In the majority of cases, Barclays will hold collateral
against the exposure, have a right of recourse to the customer or both.
In addition, Barclays issues guarantees on its own behalf. The main
types of guarantees provided are financial guarantees given to banks
and financial institutions on behalf of customers to secure loans,
overdrafts and other banking facilities, including stock borrowing
indemnities and standby letters of credit. Other guarantees provided
include performance guarantees, advance payment guarantees, tender
guarantees, guarantees to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and
retention guarantees. Further details on these guarantees are provided
in Note 60 (o) to the accounts.
Derivatives on own shares
During the period Barclays entered into a cash-settled total return swap
referencing its own ordinary shares. This instrument provides a hedge
against the employers’ national insurance liability arising on employee
share schemes, where the eventual liability is determined by reference
to the Barclays share price. As at 31st December, the notional of this
derivative was 12.4 million shares and the fair value was £9.5m. Under
IFRSs, cash flow hedge accounting has been applied when accounting 
for the gains and losses arising on this derivative.
Special purpose and variable interest entities
The off-balance sheet arrangements entered into by the Group typically
involve the use of special purpose entities (SPEs) as defined under SIC 12
and variable interest entities (VIEs) under FIN 46-R. These are entities
that are set up for a specific purpose and generally would not enter into
an operating activity nor have any employees. The most common form
of SPE involves the acquisition of financial assets that are funded by the
issuance of securities to external investors, which have cash flows
different from those of the underlying instruments. The repayment 
of these securities is determined by the performance of the assets
acquired by the SPE. These entities form an integral part of many
financial markets, and are important to the development of the
securitisation markets and functioning of the US commercial 
paper market. The accounting treatment under IFRSs and US GAAP is
summarised in Note 60 on page 251, with further information on the 
US GAAP treatment provided in Note 60 (m) on pages 268 and 269.
Credit structuring business
The Group structures investments with specific risk profiles which are
attractive to investors. This business involves the sale by the Group of
credit exposures based on an underlying portfolio of assets into SPEs,
often using credit derivative contracts. The assets are funded by 
issuing securities with varying terms. The Group may also provide other
financial services, which include the provision of liquidity or contingent
liquidity facilities, act as derivatives counterparty as well as the
purchasing and warehousing of securities until they are sold to the SPE.
The commitments to provide liquidity to these SPEs is a maximum of
£6.4bn (2005: £1.1bn).
Asset securitisations
The Group assists companies with the formation of asset
securitisations. These entities have minimal equity and rely on 
funding in the form of notes to purchase the assets for securitisation.
The Group provides financing in the form of senior notes and/or junior
notes and may also provide derivatives to the SPE. 
The Group has also used SPEs to securitise part of its originated and
purchased retail and commercial lending portfolios and credit card
receivables. Under US GAAP , where the Group has sold the assets to a
Qualifying SPE (QSPE), the QSPE is not consolidated by the Group. This
resulted in the derecognition of assets of £5,359m as at 31st December
2006 (2005: £6,953m) under US GAAP . Following the sale of these
assets to the securitisation vehicles, the Group may retain servicing
rights and an interest in the residual income of the SPEs. Under IFRS, the
SPEs are consolidated where the Group is exposed to the majority of the
risks and rewards of the transaction. Further details are included in Note
60 (n) to the accounts.
Client intermediation
The Group is involved in structuring transactions as a financial
intermediary to meet investor and client needs. These transactions
involve entities structured by either the Group or the client and they are
used to modify cash flows of third-party assets to create investments
with specific risk or return profiles or to assist clients in the efficient
management of other risks. The Group also invests in lessor entities
specifically to acquire assets for leasing. Client intermediation also
includes arrangements to fund the purchase or construction of specific
assets (most common in the property industry). Certain entities that are
consolidated in accordance with IAS 27 and SIC 12 under IFRS are
deconsolidated under US GAAP where the Group is not the primary
beneficiary. The impact on the Group’s total assets under US GAAP is 
an increase of £5,920m (2005: reduction of £327m).
Fund management 
The Group provides asset management services to a large number of
investment entities on an arms-length basis and at market terms and
prices. The majority of these entities are investment funds that are
owned by a large and diversified number of investors. These funds are
not consolidated under either IFRS or US GAAP because the Group does
not own either a significant portion of the equity, or the risks and
rewards inherent in the assets. Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 64
Risk factors
Risk factors
The following discussion sets forth certain risk factors that the Group
believes could cause its actual future results to differ materially from
expected results. However, other factors could also adversely affect the
Group results and so the factors discussed in this report should not be
considered to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties.
Business conditions and general economy
The profitability of Barclays businesses could be adversely affected by 
a worsening of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom,
globally or in certain individual markets such as the US or South Africa.
Factors such as interest rates, inflation, investor sentiment, the
availability and cost of credit, the liquidity of the global financial markets
and the level and volatility of equity prices could significantly affect the
activity level of customers, for example:
•
An economic downturn or significantly higher interest rates could
adversely affect the credit quality of Barclays on-balance sheet and
off-balance sheet assets by increasing the risk that a greater
number of Barclays customers would be unable to meet their
obligations.
•
A market downturn or worsening of the economy could cause the
Group to incur mark to market losses in its trading portfolios.
•
A market downturn could reduce the fees Barclays earns for
managing assets. For example, a higher level of domestic or
foreign interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect
the flows of assets under management; and
•
A market downturn would be likely to lead to a decline in the
volume of transactions that Barclays executes for its customers
and, therefore, lead to a decline in the income it receives from fees
and commissions and interest.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’s
customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual
obligations to the Group. Credit risk may also arise where the
downgrading of an entity’s credit rating causes the fair value of the
Group’s investment in that entity’s financial instruments to fall. The
credit risk that the Group faces arises mainly from commercial and
consumer loans and advances, including credit card lending.
Furthermore, credit risk is manifested as country risk where difficulties
may arise; in the country in which the exposure is domiciled thus
impeding or reducing the value of the asset; or where the counterparty
may be the country itself.
Settlement risk is another form of credit risk and is the possibility that
the Group may pay a counterparty – for example, a bank in a foreign
exchange transaction – but fail to receive the corresponding settlement
in return.
Market risk
The most significant market risks the Group faces are interest rate,
credit spread, foreign exchange, commodity price and equity price risks.
Changes in interest rate levels, yield curves and spreads may affect the
interest rate margin realised between lending income and borrowing
costs. Changes in currency rates, particularly in the Sterling-US Dollar,
Sterling-Euro and Sterling-Rand exchange rates, affect the value of
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and affect
earnings reported by the Group’s non-UK subsidiaries and may affect
revenues from foreign exchange dealing. The performance of financial
markets may cause changes in the value of the Group’s investment and
trading portfolios and in the amount of revenues generated from assets
under management. The Group has implemented risk management
methods to mitigate and control these and other market risks to which
it is exposed. However, it is difficult to predict with accuracy changes in
economic or market conditions and to anticipate the effects that such
changes could have on the Group’s financial performance, business
operations and the value of assets held in the Group’s pension and long-
term assurance funds.
Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has insufficient capital resources to:
•
Meet minimum regulatory capital requirements in the UK and in
other markets such as the US and South Africa where regulated
activities are undertaken. The Group’s authority to operate as a
bank is dependent upon the maintenance of adequate capital
resources.
•
Support its strong credit rating. In addition to capital resources, the
Group’s rating is supported by a diverse portfolio of activities, an
increasingly international presence, consistent profit performance,
prudent risk management and a focus on value creation. A weaker
credit rating would increase the Group’s cost of funds; and
•
Support its growth and strategic options.
The Group’s capital management activities seek to maximise
shareholder value by optimising the level and mix of its capital
resources. Capital risk is mitigated by:
•
ensuring access to a broad range of investor markets;
•
management of the Group’s demand for capital; and
•
management of the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
movements.
Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its obligations when
they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn, with
consequent failure to repay depositors and fulfil commitments to lend.
The risk that it will be unable to do so is inherent in all banking
operations and can be impacted by a range of institution specific and
market-wide events including, but not limited to, credit events, merger
and acquisition activity, systemic shocks and natural disasters.
Operational risks
The Group’s businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large
number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risks and
losses can result from fraud, employee errors, failure to properly
document transactions or to obtain proper internal authorisation,
failure to comply with regulatory requirements and conduct of business
rules, equipment failures, natural disasters or the failure of external
systems (see page 90 for a detailed list). Although the Group has
implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial
resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures and to staff
training, it is only possible to be reasonably, but not absolutely, certain
that such procedures will be effective in controlling each of the
operational risks faced by the Group.
Insurance risk
Insurance risk is the risk that the Group will have to make higher than
anticipated payments to settle claims arising from its long-term and
short-term insurance businesses.
Legal risk
The Group is subject to a comprehensive range of legal obligations in all
countries in which it operates. As a result, the Group is exposed to many
forms of legal risk, which may arise in a number of ways. Primarily:
•
the Group’s business may not be conducted in accordance with
applicable laws around the world;
•
contractual obligations may either not be enforceable as intended
or may be enforced against the Group in an adverse way;
•
the intellectual property of the Group (such as its trade names)
may not be adequately protected; and
•
the Group may be liable for damages to third parties harmed by the
conduct of its business.
The Group faces risk where legal proceedings are brought against it.
Regardless of whether such claims have merit, the outcome of legal
proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in financial loss. Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 65
Operating review
1
Defending legal proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming
and there is no guarantee that all costs incurred will be recovered even if
the Group is successful. Although the Group has processes and controls
to manage legal risks, failure to manage these risks could impact the
Group adversely, both financially and by reputation.
T ax risk
The Group is subject to the tax laws in all countries in which it operates.
A number of double taxation agreements entered between countries
also impact on the taxation of the Group. The Group is also subject to
European Community tax law.
Tax risk is the risk associated with changes in tax law or in the
interpretation of tax law. It also includes the risk of changes in tax rates
and the risk of failure to comply with procedures required by tax
authorities. Failure to manage tax risks could lead to an additional tax
charge. It could also lead to a financial penalty for failure to comply with
required tax procedures or other aspects of tax law. If, as a result of a
particular tax risk materialising, the tax costs associated with particular
transactions are greater than anticipated, it could affect the profitability
of those transactions.
Effect of governmental policy and regulation
The Group’s businesses and earnings can be affected by the fiscal or
other policies and other actions of various governmental and regulatory
authorities in the UK, the European Union (EU), the US, South Africa 
and elsewhere.
There is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of
the retail banking and consumer credit industries in the UK and
elsewhere. The nature and impact of future changes in policies and
regulatory action are not predictable and beyond the Group’s control
but could have an impact on the Group’s businesses and earnings.
In the EU as a whole, these regulatory actions included an inquiry into
retail banking in all of the then 25 Member States by the European
Commission’s Directorate General for Competition. The inquiry 
looked at retail banking in Europe generally and the Group has fully
co-operated with the inquiry. On 31st January 2007 the European
Commission announced that the inquiry had identified barriers to
competition in certain areas of retail banking, payment cards and
payment systems in the EU. The Commission indicated it will use 
its powers to address these barriers, and will encourage national
competition authorities to enforce European and national competition
laws where appropriate. Any action taken by the Commission and
national competition authorities could have an impact on the payment
cards and payment systems businesses of the Group and on its retail
banking activities in the EU countries in which it operates.
In the UK, in September 2005 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) received 
a super-complaint from the Citizens Advice Bureau relating to payment
protection insurance (PPI). As a result, the OFT commenced a market
study on PPI in April 2006. In October 2006, the OFT announced the
outcome of the market study and, following a period of consultation,
the OFT referred the PPI market to the UK Competition Commission for
an in-depth inquiry on 7th February 2007. This inquiry could last for up
to two years. Also in October 2006, the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) published the outcome of its broad industry thematic review of
PPI sales practices in which it concluded that some firms fail to treat
customers fairly. The Group has cooperated fully with these
investigations and will continue to do so.
In April 2006, the OFT commenced a review of the undertakings given
following the conclusion of the Competition Commission Inquiry in
2002 into the supply of banking services to Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs). The Group is co-operating fully with that review.
The OFT has carried out investigations into Visa and MasterCard credit
card interchange rates. The decision by the OFT in the MasterCard
interchange case was set aside by the Competition Appeals Tribunal in
June 2006. The OFT’s investigation in the Visa interchange case is at an
earlier stage and a second MasterCard interchange case is ongoing. 
The outcome is not known but these investigations may have an 
impact on the consumer credit industry in general and therefore on 
the Group’s business in this sector. On 9th February 2007 the OFT
announced that it was expanding its investigation into interchange 
rates to include debit cards.
The OFT announced the findings of its investigation into the level of 
late and over-limit fees on credit cards on 5th April 2006, requiring a
response from credit card companies by 31st May 2006. Barclaycard
responded by confirming that it would reduce its late and over-limit fees
on credit cards from 1st August 2006.
On 7th September 2006, the OFT announced that it had decided to
undertake a fact find on the application of its statement on credit card
fees to current account unauthorised overdraft fees. The OFT expects
this work to take up to six months, at which stage the OFT will consider
whether a further detailed investigation into unauthorised overdraft fees
is needed.
On 26th January 2007, the FSA issued a Statement of Good Practice
relating to Mortgage Exit Administration Fees. Barclays will charge the
fee applicable at the time the customer took out the mortgage, which 
is one of the options recommended by the FSA.
Other areas where changes could have an impact include:
•
the monetary, interest rate and other policies of central banks and
regulatory authorities;
•
general changes in government or regulatory policy that may
significantly influence investor decisions in particular markets in
which the Group operates;
•
general changes in the regulatory requirements, for example,
prudential rules relating to the capital adequacy framework 
(page 59);
•
changes in competition and pricing environments;
•
further developments in the financial reporting environment;
•
expropriation, nationalisation, confiscation of assets and changes
in legislation relating to foreign ownership; and
•
other unfavourable political, military or diplomatic developments
producing social instability or legal uncertainty which in turn may
affect demand for the Group’s products and services. 
Impact of strategic decisions taken by the Group
The Group devotes substantial management and planning resources to
the development of strategic plans for organic growth and identification
of possible acquisitions, supported by substantial expenditure to
generate growth in customer business. If these strategic plans do not
deliver as anticipated, the Group’s earnings could grow more slowly 
or decline.
Competition
The global financial services markets in which the Group operates are
highly competitive. Innovative competition for corporate, institutional
and retail clients and customers comes both from incumbent players
and a steady stream of new market entrants. The landscape is expected
to remain highly competitive in all areas, which could adversely affect
the Group’s profitability if the Group fails to retain and attract clients 
and customers.
Impact of external factors on the Group and peer group
The Group’s primary performance goal is to achieve top quartile Total
Shareholder Return performance for 2004 to 2007 (inclusive) against 
a group of peer financial institutions. This goal assumes that external
factors will impact all peer group entities similarly. The Group’s ability  Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 66
Risk factors
to achieve the goal will be significantly impacted if the Group is
disproportionately impacted by negative external factors. Even if the
Group performs well, if others perform better or the market believes
others have performed better, we may not achieve our goal (as
defined on page 8).
Additionally some peers are listed on exchanges other than the
London Stock Exchange and so may react to differing external
factors. Barclays devotes considerable resources and expertise to
managing the risks to which it is exposed. Our risk management is
described in the following pages (pages 67 to 107). Please also refer
to the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking
statements on the inside of the front cover in conjunction with this
section.
Regulatory compliance risk
Regulatory compliance risk arises from a failure or inability to
comply fully with the laws, regulations or codes applicable
specifically to the financial services industry. Non compliance could
lead to fines, public reprimands, damage to reputation, enforced
suspension of operations or, in extreme cases, withdrawal of
authorisations to operate.
Supervision and regulation
The Group’s operations, including its overseas offices, subsidiaries
and associates, are subject to rules and regulations, including reserve
and reporting requirements and conduct of business requirements,
imposed by the relevant central banks and regulatory authorities.
In the UK, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is the independent
body responsible for the regulation of deposit taking, life insurance,
home mortgages, general insurance and investment business. The
FSA was established by the Government and it exercises statutory
powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. 
Barclays Bank PLC is authorised by the FSA to carry on a range of
regulated activities within the UK and is subject to consolidated
supervision. In its role as supervisor, the FSA seeks to ensure the
safety and soundness of financial institutions with the aim of
strengthening, but not guaranteeing, the protection of customers.
The FSA ’s continuing supervision of financial institutions authorised
by it is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the
collection of information from statistical and prudential returns,
reports obtained from skilled persons, visits to firms and regular
meetings with management to discuss issues such as performance,
risk management and strategy. 
The FSA adopts a risk-based approach to supervision. The starting
point for supervision of all financial institutions is a systematic
analysis of the risk profile for each authorised firm. The FSA has
adopted a homogeneous risk, processes and resourcing model in its
approach to its supervisory responsibilities (known as the ARROW
model) and the results of the risk assessment are used by the FSA to
develop a risk mitigation programme for a firm. The FSA also
promulgates requirements that banks and other financial
institutions are required to meet on matters such as capital
adequacy (see capital ratios on page 59), limits on large exposures
to individual entities and groups of closely connected entities, and
liquidity. Certain of these requirements derive from EU directives as
described below.
Banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions in the
UK are subject to a single financial services compensation scheme
(the Financial Services Compensation Scheme) where an authorised
firm is unable or is likely to be unable to meet claims made against 
it because of its financial circumstances. Different levels of
compensation are available to eligible claimants depending upon
whether the protected claim is in relation to a deposit, a contract of
insurance or protected investment business and certain types of
claims are subject to maximum levels of compensation. Most
deposits made with branches of Barclays Bank PLC within the
European Economic Area (EEA) which are denominated in Sterling
or other EEA currencies (including the euro) are covered by the
Scheme. Most claims made in respect of designated investment
business will also be protected claims if the business was carried 
on from the UK or from a branch of the bank or investment firm in
another EEA member state. 
Outside the UK, the Group has operations (and main regulators)
located in continental Europe, in particular France, Germany, Spain,
Switzerland, Portugal and Italy (local central banks and other
regulatory authorities); Asia Pacific (various regulatory authorities
including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Financial Services
Agency of Japan, the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission and the Monetary Authority of Singapore); Africa
(various regulatory authorities including the South African Reserve
Bank and the Financial Services Board) and the United States of
America (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the
Securities and Exchange Commission). 
In Europe, the UK regulatory agenda is considerably shaped and
influenced by the directives emanating from the EU. A number of EU
directives are currently being implemented, for example the Capital
Requirements Directive, the Third Money Laundering Directive and
the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (‘MiFID’). These form
part of the European Single Market programme, an important
feature of which is the framework for the regulation of authorised
firms. This framework is designed to enable a credit institution or
investment firm authorised in one EU member state to conduct
banking or investment business through the establishment of
branches or by the provision of services on a cross-border basis in
other member states without the need for local authorisation.
Barclays operations in Europe are authorised and regulated by a
combination of both home (the FSA) and host regulators. 
Barclays operations in South Africa, including Absa Group Limited,
are supervised and regulated by the South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) and the Financial Services Board (FSB). SARB oversees the
banking industry and follows a risk-based approach to supervision
whilst the FSB oversees the non-banking financial services industry
and focuses on enhancing consumer protection and regulating
market conduct. 
In the United States, Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and certain 
US subsidiaries and branches of the Bank are subject to a
comprehensive regulatory structure, involving numerous statutes,
rules and regulations, including the International Banking Act of
1978, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the
Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991 and the USA
P ATRIOT Act of 2001. Such laws and regulations impose limitations
on the types of businesses, and the ways in which they may be
conducted, in the United States and on the location and expansion
of banking business there. The Bank’s branch operations are subject
to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation by the FRB,
the New Y ork State Banking Department and the OCC (in the case of
Barclays Global Investors, NA); and the Delaware State Banking
Commissioner and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (in
the case of Barclays Bank Delaware). The investment banking and
asset management operations are subject to ongoing supervision
and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as
well as a comprehensive scheme of regulation under the US federal
securities laws, as enforced by, for example, the NASD and the OCC. Barclays PLC

Introduction
Barclays approach to risk management
Risk management is a fundamental part of Barclays business activity
and an essential component of its planning process. This is achieved by
keeping risk management at the centre of the executive agenda and 
by building a culture in which risk management is embedded in the
everyday management of the business. Barclays ensures that it has the
functional capability to manage the risk in new and existing businesses,
and that business plans are consistent with risk appetite.
Risk appetite is the level of risk that Barclays is willing to accept in
fulfilling business objectives. To determine this acceptable level of risk,
potential earnings volatility against financial objectives are considered
first. As part of the planning process, management estimates the
potential earnings volatility from different businesses under various
scenarios. Barclays estimates the capacity to absorb unexpected losses
in terms of the tolerable level of variance from financial targets, by
considering the ability to support business growth, desired dividend
payout levels and capital ratio targets. If the projections entail too high 
a level of risk, management will challenge each area to find new ways 
to rebalance the business mix to incur less risk on a diversified basis.
Barclays believes that this enables it to improve risk and return
characteristics across the business and help meet growth targets 
within an overall risk appetite. 
Across Barclays, every business manager is accountable for managing
risk in his or her business area; they must understand and control the
key risks inherent in the business undertaken. Each business area also
employs risk specialists to provide an independent control function and
to support the development of a strong risk management environment.
This functional approach to risk management is built on formal control
processes that rely on individual responsibility and independent
oversight, as well as challenge through peer reviews. Barclays continues
to use and develop advanced analysis, with comprehensive reporting 
of risk positions against their key risk factors and against risk appetite.
To support expanded risk taking, Barclays has continued to strengthen
the independent and specialised risk teams in each of its businesses,
supported by matching teams at Group level, acting in both a
consultancy and oversight capacity. It has made the recruitment,
development and retention of risk professionals a priority because it is
believed that it is a prerequisite to business growth plans. Barclays also
continues to make significant investment in the infrastructure to
identify, measure and report risk positions.
Barclays remains committed to the objective of increasing shareholder
value by developing and growing business that is consistent with risk
appetite, and through building more effective risk management
capabilities. Responsibility for risk management resides at all levels
within the Group, from the Executive down through the organisation 
to each business manager and risk specialist. We are seeking an
appropriate balance in our business, and continuing to build the risk
management capabilities that will help us to deliver our growth plans 
in a controlled environment.
2006 developments
In broad terms, Risk Appetite increased by about 20% during 2006, 
in conjunction with increased and more diversified earnings and a
continued strong capital base. Barclays will continue to deploy this
expanded appetite across many businesses and risk types. During 2006
it expanded the range and level of credit risk it runs across geographies
and products, and this will continue as part of its developing business
plans. Traded market risk levels grew at a slower level than trading
revenues; these and the other risk types are addressed below. 
The risk environment in 2006 had very different characteristics across
the risk types, with continued benign conditions in wholesale and
corporate credit risk, a continued difficult environment in the UK
unsecured retail credit sector, stable operational risk, and periods of
moderate volatility in some areas of market risk. The UK unsecured retail
credit market experienced a continuation of recent trends, arising from
a high level of household debt and continued strain on the discretionary
cash flow in some parts of the retail customer population. Higher
interest rates, energy costs and some higher taxation have put strain on
UK consumer portfolios, which has been exacerbated by increasing
levels of personal bankruptcy and Individual Voluntary Arrangements.
This deterioration in consumer credit quality, coupled with the changing
social attitudes to bankruptcy and debt default in general, contributed
to a higher impairment charge in our UK credit card and unsecured 
loan portfolios. 
Notwithstanding the difficult conditions in the UK credit environment,
Barclays experience shows that the actions taken in Barclaycard,
including revised underwriting rules, tighter limit assignment and line
management, and improved collections have had a positive effect. The
quality of new accounts, as measured by average credit scores, has
consistently improved since 2005, while in our UK cards and unsecured
loan portfolios the flows into early stage and later cycle delinquency as
well as arrears balances decreased in the second half of 2006.
Barclays has been alert to contagion from the retail sector influencing
the Local Business portfolio and although increasing credit delinquency
has been anticipated and experienced, management actions have been
taken to mitigate the impact. Conditions in this area have been more
directly affected by the conditions prevailing in the retail market,
especially those sectors closer to the consumer. All of these businesses
are dependent on the UK economy and it is expected that the outlook
for economic growth in 2007 will be similar to that experienced in 2006.
Some important changes to the retail risk profile in 2006 were volume
related. In the UK, the size of the card portfolio reduced as a result of the
management actions in Barclaycard outlined above, while international
activities in the USA, Europe and South Africa expanded.
Looking outside the UK, Barclaycard US has been growing its card
portfolio and Absa also operated in a growing market in South Africa.
The business model explicitly includes the benefits of risk diversification
of new products with new clients and in new geographies. Risk
diversification was therefore a significant factor in the decision to
acquire a majority stake in Absa in 2005, which provided strong
earnings in 2006 that are less correlated to the core UK business. The
same is true for Barclaycard US and the other areas of international
growth within existing businesses, such as Barclays Capital and BGI.
The credit environment in the larger corporate and wholesale sector
continued to benefit from relatively stable conditions, although there
was some evidence of slightly increasing corporate defaults. Overall
global credit conditions, based on economic growth, low inflation and
rising stock markets, have led to a very competitive market and credit
spreads are still at very low levels in most markets. Borrower quality has
remained good across the capital market corporate sector. There has
been continued market demand for credit assets resulting from strong
financial industry liquidity, which has been important in maintaining 
the strong corporate credit environment. 
Investors in the leveraged finance market displayed a continued strong
demand for assets in 2006. With so much liquidity in the market,
transaction leverage multiples have risen, maturities have lengthened
and amounts financed have increased. Barclays remained focused on
the structure of such deals and it declines transactions that are beyond
its appetite. It runs a distribution-led leveraged finance business in
Barclays Capital and has a strong track record of selling down
underwriting positions rather than holding larger positions in the credit
portfolio, and it is alert to any slowdown in the distribution performance
of the syndication markets. In the UK market for smaller transactions, it
has also maintained caps on risk positions in this business during 2006.

Barclays is also focused on the UK commercial property lending market,
where property yields in 2006 declined as financing costs have risen. 
As a result, there has been further constriction of the available cash 
flow margin to support higher valuations and increased debt levels.
Barclays therefore has increased hold levels and while the business has
expanded, none of the caps governing exposure in this sector has
been increased.
Overall, the contrast in credit conditions in the retail and wholesale
markets is reflected in the different trends of principal metrics. While
Risk Tendency and Non-Performing Loan balances both rose in the 
retail sector, they fell or held steady in the wholesale portfolios.
The market risk environment in 2006 offered clients the opportunity to
benefit from market movements in a controlled manner through their
own risk management activities. Although Barclays Capital ran higher
levels of market risk as measured by daily value at risk (DVaR), this was
in line with Risk Appetite and the growth in trading revenues more than
kept pace with rising DVaR. The two principal areas where the risk
profile at Barclays Capital altered were commodities and interest rates.
The commodities business saw an increase in client demand for
structured products and risk management solutions, which led to a
strong trading performance in Barclays Capital and an increase in risk
positions arising from client business needs. In contrast, interest rate
markets were quieter, leading to a smaller requirement from clients to
hold such market risk positions on the books. 
Market risks outside Barclays Capital, which mainly include interest rate
exposures within the various banking books and some Treasury risks,
remained very modest, consistent with the Group’s policy of hedging
these positions to a material degree. 
Barclays defined benefit pension risks are also closely monitored. 
The actuarial funding surplus of the UK pension scheme improved 
on the back of strong asset returns and contributions from Barclays.
These factors, together with several market developments that led to
adjustments in accounting assumptions, also drove a reduction in the
IAS 19 deficit.
The challenges in operational risk management arise from the strong
growth in the transaction volumes contained within the business plans
and from the increasing internationalisation of operations. However,
Barclays has been successful in reducing the level of operational risk
through improving key end-to-end processes and increasing their
resilience and capacity to sustain the increasing demands of higher
business volumes.
Internet banking was an important focus of financial crime risk
management in 2006, with increasing numbers of fraud attacks in the
first quarter. These occurred through both attempted identity thefts
(‘phishing’) and the placing of electronic devices in systems to 
extract personal data (‘trojans’). Such attempts are becoming more
sophisticated in nature but Barclays was able to stem and then 
reverse the growth in net losses through the aggressive deployment 
of additional controls, supported by extra resources within fraud
operations. The improved capacity for early detection of compromised
accounts meant that a recrudescence of fraud attacks later in the year
did not lead to any increase in losses.
In 2006 Barclays continued to strengthen its anti-money laundering
activities, to enhance the Group’s financial sanctions screening
capability and to implement more robust controls. These measures
enable it to comply with the ever more complex demands of the
international regulatory environment and to resist increasingly
sophisticated criminal operations. As such, Barclays believes that it
has further improved the management of financial crime risk globally,
an integral part of protecting its reputation and brand.
Basel II
The implementation of the new Basel II regulatory requirements is the
principal area of regulatory change ahead for the risk management area.
The main purpose of this is to promote a more sophisticated capital
assessment and risk management framework for the international
banking industry.
In October 2006 Barclays formally applied to the FSA to adopt the
advanced approaches for both Credit and Operational risk from 
1st January 2008, and the FSA is expected to provide its decision by 
30th June 2007. A positive consequence of the advanced approaches 
is closer alignment between internal economic capital and regulatory
capital measures and processes, thus helping Barclays to manage its
capital ratios more effectively over time.
The successful implementation of the Basel II requirements has required
some data, model, and system changes in many of Barclays businesses.
The investment it has made in this area is part of the business strategy
to ensure that Barclays continues to be at the leading edge of risk
management and, as such, it continues to believe that achieving
advanced status is appropriate and realistic.
The Group commenced the parallel run process required to adopt 
Basel II at the end of 2006. During 2007, the results of the parallel run 
of the Group’s Basel II models will be an important consideration in the
management of its capital resources. A further requirement of Basel II 
is enhanced market disclosure and to support this, Barclays is moving
towards an improved reporting capability. Barclays PLC

In addition to the Committees shown in the chart, there is a Brand and

significant reputational impact.
These Committees receive regular and comprehensive reports. The
Board Risk Committee receives a quarterly report covering all of our
principal risks. The Board Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on
control issues of significance and half-yearly impairment allowances
and regulatory reports. Both Committees also receive reports dealing in
more depth with specific issues relevant at the time. The proceedings of
both Committees are reported to the full Board, which also receives a
concise quarterly risk report. Internal Audit supports both Committees
by attendance and/or the provision of quarterly reports resulting from
its work on governance, risk and control issues of significance. The
Board Audit Committee reviews and approves Internal Audit’s plans 
and resources, and evaluates the effectiveness of Internal Audit. 
An assessment by external advisers is also carried out periodically.
Under Basel II, Barclays aims to achieve advanced status under credit
and operational risks. Barclays considers that the investment required 
to attain this status is warranted by the internal risk management
improvements that will follow, the reputational benefits and the
potential for greater capital efficiency.

Risk management – overview
Risk management
The pages that follow describe how Barclays conducts risk
management, including the key risk concepts it uses and how it
manages specific types of risk.
To ensure the Group maintains effective governance and control over 
its risk management processes, Group Risk sets policies and standards
for each risk type. Group Risk breaks down the risk management
process into five discrete steps: direct, assess, control, report and
manage/challenge. It is Group Risk’s responsibility to ensure that each
of the five steps is embedded across the Group for each risk type.

Risk Appetite
Risk Appetite is the level of risk Barclays chooses to take to reach its
strategic objectives, recognising a range of possible outcomes, as
business plans are implemented. Barclays framework, approved by the
Board Risk Committee, combines a top-down view of its capacity to
take risk, with a bottom-up view of the business risk profile requested
and recommended by each business area.
The objectives of the Risk Appetite framework are to:
•
help protect the Group’s performance;
•
improve management confidence and debate regarding our risk
profile; 
•
help executive management improve control and co-ordination of
risk-taking across businesses; and,
•
enable unused risk capacity to be identified and thus profitable
opportunities to be highlighted.
The internal control framework at Barclays is aligned with the
internationally accepted standard Internal Control – Integrated
Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Group’s principal risk
categories (set out below) are the subject of Board approved risk 
control requirements.

Operating review
1
The Risk Appetite framework considers credit, market and operational
risk and is applied using two perspectives: ‘earnings volatility’ and
‘mandate and scale’.
Earnings Volatility: This is the level of potential deviation from expected
financial performance that Barclays is prepared to sustain at relevant
points on the risk profile. It is established with reference to the strategic
objectives and to the business plans of the Group, including the
achievement of annual financial targets, payment of dividends, funding
of capital growth and maintenance of acceptable capital ratios. The
portfolio is analysed in this way at four representative levels:
•
expected performance (including the average credit losses based on
measurements over many years);
•
a moderate stress level of loss that is likely to occur only infrequently
and is meant to correspond to a macroeconomic cycle;
•
a severe stress which is much less likely;
•
an extreme but highly improbable level of stressed loss which is used
to determine the Group’s economic capital.
These potentially larger but increasingly less likely levels of loss are
illustrated in the following chart.
Mandate and scale: This second perspective is a risk management
approach that seeks to formally review and control our business
activities to ensure that they are within our mandate (i.e. aligned to the
expectations of external stakeholders) and are of an appropriate scale
(relative to the risk and reward of the underlying activities). This is
achieved by using limits and triggers to avoid concentrations and
operational risks which could lead to unexpected losses of a scale that
would result in a disproportionate fall in Barclays market capitalisation.
Taken as a whole, the Risk Appetite framework provides a basis for the
allocation of risk capacity to each business. Since the level of loss at any
given probability is dependent on the portfolio of exposures in each
business, the statistical measurement for each key risk category gives
the Group clearer sight and better control of risk-taking throughout 
the enterprise. The Risk Appetite framework is designed to be:
•
simple and practical to apply by measurement and monitoring 
of exposures;
•
geared to risk/return where capacity is directly related to
opportunity; 
•
based on a top-down capacity for earnings volatility;
•
based on bottom-up identification of risk factors in each business;
•
relevant, recognising the impact and likelihood of losses;
•
aggregated across businesses where appropriate.

Stress testing
The Risk Appetite numbers are validated by estimating the Group
sensitivity to macroeconomic events using stress testing and scenario
analysis. Changes in certain macroeconomic variables represent
environmental stresses which may reveal systemic credit and market
risk sensitivities in our retail and wholesale portfolios. The stresses
considered include, for example, the following sensitivities:
• 
Gross Domestic Product weaker;
• 
employment weaker;
• 
interest rates higher or lower;
• 
interest rate curve shifts;
• 
equity prices lower;
• 
property prices weaker;
• 
credit spreads wider;
• 
country exposure stressed;
• 
industry exposure stressed;
• 
currency fluctuations.
More complex scenarios, such as recessions, can be represented by
combinations of variables. These scenarios allow senior management
to gain a better understanding of how portfolios are likely to react to
changing economic and geopolitical conditions and how the Group 
can best react to them. The stress test simulates the balance sheet and
profit and loss effects of stresses across the Group, investigating the
impact on profits and the ability to maintain appropriate capital ratios.
Insights gained are fully integrated into the senior management process
and the Risk Appetite framework. This process of analysis and senior
management oversight also provides the basis for fulfilling the stress
testing requirements of Basel II advanced approach.
Barclays estimates the capital needed to survive an extreme but highly
improbable level of stressed loss. The calculation is based on the
historical volatility of losses. Capitalisation occurs to a level sufficient 
to provide a high level of confidence in the Group, consistent with the
Group’s AA rating.
The Group macroeconomic stress test is only one of a number of stress
test analyses that are performed as part of the wider risk management
process. Specific stress test analysis is used across all risk types to gain a
better understanding of the risk profile and the potential effects of
changes in external factors. These stress tests are performed at a
number of different levels, from analysis covering specific stresses on
individual sub-portfolios (e.g. high value mortgages in the South East 
of England), to portfolio level stresses (e.g. the overall commodities
portfolio) to Group-wide stresses for particular asset types (e.g.
wholesale credit risk stress tests). 
Capital management
Barclays considers both regulatory (see page 89) and economic capital
(see page 74) as part of its capital management. In respect of economic
capital, Group Risk owns the methodology and policy whilst the
businesses are responsible for the calculation. Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 74
Risk management
Risk management – overview
Economic capital
Barclays assesses capital requirements by measuring the Group risk
profile using both internally and externally developed models. The
Group assigns economic capital primarily within seven risk categories:
Credit Risk, Market Risk, Business Risk, Operational Risk, Insurance Risk,
Fixed Assets and Private Equity.
The Group regularly enhances its economic capital methodology and
benchmarks outputs to external reference points. The framework has
been enhanced to reflect default probabilities during average credit
conditions, rather than those prevailing at the balance sheet date, thus
seeking to remove cyclicality from the economic capital calculation.
The framework also adjusts economic capital to reflect time horizon,
correlation of risks and risk concentrations. 
Economic capital is allocated on a consistent basis across all of Barclays
businesses and risk activities. A single cost of equity is applied to
calculate the cost of risk. Economic capital allocations reflect varying
levels of risk.
The total average economic capital required by the Group, as
determined by risk assessment models and after considering the
Group’s estimated portfolio effects, is compared with the supply of
economic capital to evaluate economic capital utilisation. Supply of
economic capital is calculated as the average available shareholders’
equity after adjustment and including preference shares.
The economic capital methodology will form the basis of the 
Group’s submission for the Basel II Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process.

(c) Available funds for economic capital as at 31st December 2006 stood at £25,150m (31st December 2005: £21,850m).
Economic capital supply
The capital resources to support economic capital comprise adjusted
shareholders’ equity including Preference Shares but excluding other
minority interests. Preference Shares have been issued to optimise the
long-term capital base of the Group.
The capital resources to support economic capital are impacted by a
number of factors arising from the application of IFRSs and are modified
in calculating available funds for economic capital. This applies
specifically to:
•
Cash flow hedging reserve – to the extent that the Group undertakes
the hedging of future cash flows, shareholders’ equity will include
gains and losses which will be offset against the gain or loss on the
hedged item when it is recognised in the income statement at the
conclusion of the future hedged transaction. Given the future offset
of such gains and losses, they are excluded from shareholders’ 
equity when calculating economic capital.
•
Available for sale reserve – unrealised gains and losses on such
securities are included in shareholders’ equity until disposal or
impairment. Such gains and losses are excluded from shareholders’
equity for the purposes of calculating economic capital. Realised
gains and losses, foreign exchange translation differences and any
impairment charges recorded in the income statement will impact
economic profit.
•
Retirement benefits liability – the Group has recorded a deficit with 
a consequent reduction in shareholders’ equity . This represents a
non-cash reduction in shareholders’ equity . For the purposes of
calculating economic capital, the Group does not deduct the pension
deficit from shareholders’ equity . Barclays PLC

(a) Includes Transition business and Capital for centre functional risk.
(b) The Group’s practice is to maintain an appropriate level of excess capital held at the Group centre, which is not allocated to business units. This variance arises as 
a result of capital management timing and includes Captial held to cover pension contributions.
(c) Includes excess capital held at the Group centre; investments in associates; private equity risk and insurance risk.
In 2006, the average allocated economic capital of the Group was
£15.95bn (2005: £14.05bn). In addition, average economic capital 
held against unamortised goodwill was £7.75bn for the year ended 
31st December 2006 (2005: £6.45bn), resulting in the total economic
capital requirement of £23.7bn (2005: £20.5bn).
UK Retail Banking economic capital allocation increased £50m to
£2,400m (2005: £2,350m), reflecting exposure growth in the portfolio.
UK Business Banking economic capital allocation increased £100m to
£2,700m (2005: £2,600m) as a consequence of asset growth offset by
changes to estimates of risk correlation.
Barclaycard economic capital allocation increased £50m to £2,850m
(2005: £2,800m). Exposure growth, primarily in the international cards
and secured loans portfolio, was partially offset by risk transfer activity,
the decline in UK Card balances and the transition to default probability
methodology which is based on average credit conditions rather than
those prevailing at the balance sheet date.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa
economic capital allocation increased £50m to £1,200m (2005:
£1,150m). This was due to lending growth primarily in Africa and Iberia.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa economic capital
allocation (excluding the risk borne by the minority interest) increased
£450m to £750m (2005: £300m), reflecting loan growth and the
inclusion of Absa for a full year. 
Barclays Capital economic capital increased £850m to £3,750m (2005:
£2,900m) due to growth in equity investments, market, business and
operational risk and changes in the sector mix of the corporate lending
portfolio. The growth also reflects holding the Absa Capital portfolio for
the full year.
Barclays Wealth economic capital allocation decreased £50m to £350m
(2005: £400m) due to changes to estimates of risk correlation on
average economic capital.
Capital held at the Group centre increased £400m to £1,450m (2005:
£1,050m). Demand for economic capital in the businesses was more
than offset by growth in the funds available to support economic capital. Risk management

Annual Report 2006 76
Credit risk management
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’s
customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual
obligations to the Group. Credit risk may also arise where the
downgrading of an entity’s credit rating causes the fair value of the
Group’s investment in that entity’s financial instruments to fall. The
credit risk that the Group faces arises mainly from commercial and
consumer loans and advances, including credit card lending.
The granting of credit is one of the Group’s major sources of income and
as its most significant risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to
controlling it. The importance of credit risk is illustrated by noting that
nearly two-thirds of risk-based economic capital is allocated to credit risk.
Credit exposures arise principally in loans and advances. 
In managing credit risk, the Group applies the five-step risk management
process and internal control framework described previously (page 72).
The credit risk management teams in each business are accountable to
the Business Risk Directors in those businesses who, in turn, report to the
heads of their businesses and also to the Risk Director .
These credit risk management teams assist Group Risk in the formulation
of Group Risk policy and the implementation of it across the businesses.
Examples include:
• 
maximum exposure guidelines are in place relating to the exposures 
to any individual customer or counterparty;
• 
country risk policy specifies risk appetite by country and avoids
excessive concentration of credit risk in individual countries;
• 
policies are in place that limit lending to certain industrial sectors
(commercial real estate being one example).
Within Group Risk, the Credit Risk function, led by the Credit Risk Director ,
provides Group-wide direction of credit risk-taking. This functional team
manages the resolution of all significant credit policy issues and runs the
Credit Committee, which approves major credit decisions. 
The principal Committees that review credit risk management, formulate
overall Group credit policy and resolve all significant credit policy issues
are the Group Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee, the Group
Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, the Risk Oversight Committee
and the Board Risk Committee (see page 70 for more details of this
Committee). The Board Audit Committee also reviews the impairment
allowance as part of financial reporting.
Credit risk measurement 
Barclays uses statistical modelling techniques throughout its business
in its credit rating systems. These systems assist the Bank in frontline
credit decisions on new commitments and in managing the portfolio 
of existing exposures. They enable the application of consistent risk
measurement across all credit exposures, retail and wholesale. The key
building blocks in the measurement system, which are described below,
are the probability of customer default (expressed through an internal
risk rating), exposure in the event of default, and severity of loss-
given-default. Using these, Barclays builds the analysis that leads to 
its decision support systems in the Risk Appetite context described
previously. However, it should be noted that credit risk measurement,
particularly Risk Tendency, can be contrasted with impairment
allowances required under accounting standards, which are based on
losses known to have been incurred at the balance sheet date and not
on expected loss.
Probability of customer default – commonly known as Probability
of Default (PD): Internal risk ratings
Barclays assesses the credit quality of borrowers and other
counterparties and assigns them an internal risk rating. There are two
different categories of default rating used. The first reflects the statistical
probability of a customer in a rating class defaulting within the next
12-month period, and is referred to as a point in time rating (PIT). 
The second also reflects the statistical probability of a customer in a
rating class defaulting, but the period of assessment is different, in this
case the period is defined as 12 months of average credit conditions for
the customer type. This type of rating therefore provides a measure of
risk that is independent of the current credit conditions for a particular
customer type, is much more stable over time than a PIT rating and is
referred to as a through the cycle rating (TTC).
Multiple rating methodologies may be used to inform the rating
decision on individual large credits, such as internal and external
models, rating agency ratings, and for wholesale assets market
information such as credit spreads. For smaller credits, a single source
may suffice such as the result from a rating model.
In 2005, Barclays improved upon the granularity of its earlier 12-grade
internal credit rating scale for wholesale credit. This was achieved by
increasing the number of ratings across the same range to 21. The
12-grade rating scale has historically been mapped to long-term agency
ratings. The new 21 default grades represent Barclays best estimate of
the level of credit risk for each counterparty based on current economic
conditions, and as a result a static link to long-term rating agency
ratings is no longer used.
Exposure in the event of default – commonly known as Exposure 
at Default (EAD)
Exposure in the event of default represents the expected level of usage
of the credit facility when default occurs. At default the customer may
not have drawn the loan fully or may already have repaid some of the
principal, so that exposure is typically less than the approved loan limit.
When the Group evaluates loans, it takes exposure at default into
consideration, using its extensive historical experience. It recognises
that customers may make heavier than average usage of their facilities
as they approach default. 
For derivative instruments, exposure in the event of default is the
estimated cost of replacing contracts with a positive value should
counterparties fail to perform their obligations.
Severity of loss given default – commonly known as Loss Given
Default (LGD)
When a customer defaults, some part of the amount outstanding on its
loans is usually recovered. The part that is not recovered, the actual loss,
together with the economic costs associated with the recovery process
combine to a figure called the LGD. The severity of the LGD is measured
as a percentage of the EAD. 
Using historical information, the Group can estimate how much is likely
to be lost, on average, for various types of loans. To illustrate, LGD is
lower for residential mortgages than for unsecured loans because of the
property pledged as collateral.
The level of LGD depends on the type of collateral (if any); the seniority
or subordination of the exposure; the industry in which the customer
operates (if a business); the jurisdiction applicable and work-out
expenses. The outcome is also dependent on economic conditions that
may determine, for example, the prices that can be realised for assets or
whether businesses can readily be refinanced. Individual defaults show
a wide range of outcomes, varying from full to nil recovery and all points
in between.
Expected Loss: Risk T endency 
The three components described above – the probability of default,
exposure at default and loss given default – are building blocks used in 
a variety of applications that measure credit risk across the entire
portfolio. One of these applications is a measurement of expected loss
that we use at Barclays, that we call Risk Tendency (RT). Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 77
Operating review
1
RT is a statistical estimate of the average loss for the loan portfolio for 
a 12-month period, taking into account the portfolio’s size and risk
characteristics under current credit conditions. It is a PIT measure and
therefore requires a point in time PD (PDPIT) as an input. RT provides
insight into the credit quality of the portfolio and assists management 
in tracking risk changes as the Group’s stock of credit exposures evolves
in size or risk profile in the course of business.
RT is calculated for both corporate and retail loans as follows:
RT = PDPIT x EAD x LGD.
The RT of each individual loan is aggregated to produce the RT of the
various sub-portfolios in the Group and ultimately for the whole Group.
At this aggregate level, RT is a statistical estimate of the average loss
over a 12-month period that is inherent in the Group’s credit exposures. 
Many models are used in the estimation of the components of RT in each
of the Group’s businesses. The majority of the models are internally
developed using Barclays own historical data and other external
information. In some cases we use externally developed models and
rating tools. The appropriateness of these external models for use within
Barclays is validated as part of the model approval process. It is also a
Barclays policy that all existing models are validated annually to ensure
their applicability to the current portfolios and credit conditions.
To interpret RT, the following should be considered:
•
RT is calculated using probabilities of default that are relevant to 
the current credit conditions for each customer. These figures are
therefore a point-in-time estimate based on current economic and
credit conditions.
• 
RT is calculated for different purposes and through different
methods to impairment allowances, so RT cannot be used as 
a forecast of the total allowances for impairment. It is rather a
statistical estimate that reflects changes in the size and quality 
of the loan portfolio. RT does not equate to the Group’s budget 
or internal forecast of impairment allowance in the coming year.
• 
The principal reasons for the difference between impairment and 
RT are:
– RT is a forecast estimate of the average loss associated with the
current performing portfolio over a 12-month period, impairment
is the accounting value of incurred loss realised on the whole
portfolio.
– RT covers only the loans at the date of estimation and does not
make allowance for subsequent growth or change in the
composition of the loan book which can affect impairment. 
– RT is a statistical estimate of losses arising only in the current
performing loan portfolio and therefore it is not calculated for
non-performing loans in the wholesale portfolio or for retail loans
in arrears.
– Impairment can include significant additional charges, write-backs
and recoveries arising during the year from impaired loans. These
items can materially affect the impairment allowance charge, but
are not included in RT.
– The actual credit impairment charge arising from new defaults in
any one year, from loans that are performing at the start of the year,
vary significantly around the RT value. This can be due to changes
during the year in the economic environment or in the business
conditions in specific sectors or countries and from unpredictable
or unexpected external events. This applies especially in wholesale
portfolios where the default of a small number of large exposures
will significantly increase the period’s impairment allowance but
will not have been included in the RT figure. For retail portfolios,
consisting of a very large number of small exposures, the variation
in the rate of change in new impairment compared to the RT figure
is usually much smaller than for wholesale portfolios. 
RT increased £415m to £2,260m (2005: £1,845m). 
UK Retail Banking RT increased £45m to £225m (2005: £180m)
reflecting a methodology enhancement to better reflect expected loss
rates in the Local Business portfolio.
The increase in Barclaycard RT was £310m, the total rising to £1,410m
(2005: £1,100m). This reflected the deterioration in credit conditions 
in the UK credit card and unsecured loan market as well as loan 
balance growth.

Credit risk mitigation
The Group uses a wide variety of techniques to reduce credit risk on its
lending. The most basic of these is performing an assessment of the
ability of a borrower to service the proposed level of borrowing without
distress. In addition, the Group commonly obtains security for the funds
advanced, such as in the case of a retail or commercial mortgage, a
reverse repurchase agreement, or a commercial loan with a floating
charge over book debts and inventories. The Group also uses various
forms of specialised legal agreements to reduce risk, including netting
agreements which permit it to offset positive and negative balances
with customers in certain circumstances to minimise the exposure at
default, financial guarantees, and the use of covenants in commercial
lending agreements. Other techniques include the use of credit
derivatives and other forms of credit protection.
Barclays manages the diversification of its portfolio to avoid unwanted
credit risk concentrations. This takes several dimensions. Maximum
exposure guidelines are in place relating to the exposures to any
individual counterparty. These permit higher exposures to highly rated
borrowers than to lower rated borrowers. 
They also distinguish between types of counterparty, for example,
between sovereign governments, banks and corporations. Excesses are
considered individually at the time of credit sanctioning, are reviewed
regularly, and are reported to the Risk Oversight Committee and the
Board Risk Committee.
Similarly, country risk policy specifies Risk Appetite by country and
avoids excessive concentrations of credits in individual countries. 
Finally, there are policies that limit lending to certain industries, for
example, commercial real estate.
Barclays actively manages its credit exposures. When weaknesses in
exposures are detected – either in individual exposures or in groups of
exposures – action is taken to mitigate the risks. These include steps to
reduce the amounts outstanding (in discussion with the customers,
clients or counterparties if appropriate), the use of credit derivatives
and, sometimes, the sale of the loan assets. Credit derivatives are traded
for profit and are used for managing credit exposures. Details of these
activities may be found in the statistical section (page 101) and Note 52
to the accounts.
Country risk
Country grades
Country risk grades are assigned to all countries where the Group has,
or is likely to have, exposure and are reviewed every quarter to ensure
they remain appropriate. Country grades, which are derived from
long-term sovereign foreign currency ratings, range from 1 (lowest
probability of default) to 21 (highest probability of default). A ceiling is
applied where a country is graded 12 or worse so that the counterparty
cannot be graded better than the country, unless some form of
protection is available in the event of a cross-border event, such as a
significant portion of a counterparty’s assets or income being held or
generated in hard currency.
Country risk appetite
To manage exposure to country risk the Group uses two country limits:
the Prudential Guideline and the Country Guideline. The Prudential
Guideline is identified through the strict mapping of a country grade to
derive a model-driven acceptable level of loss given default. The
Country Guideline for all graded countries is set by the Group Credit
Committee (GCC) based on the Prudential Guideline and the internal
appetite for country risk. The Country Guideline may therefore be above
or below the Prudential Guideline.
Measuring country risk
Country risk is managed through the application of Country Loss Given
Default (CLGD). All cross-border or domestic foreign currency
transactions incur CLGD from the Country Guideline agreed at GCC. 
The level of CLGD incurred by a counterparty transaction will largely
depend on three main factors: the country severity, the product severity
and counterparty grade.
CLGD is incurred in the country of direct risk, defined as where the
majority of operating assets are held. This may be different to the
country of incorporation. However, where transactions are secured with
collateral, the country risk can be transferred from the country of the
borrower to the country of the collateral provider. This is only permitted
where the collateral definitely covers the borrowing and is not expected
to decrease over time.
Country executives
Country Managers are in place for all countries where the Group has
exposure and they, under the direction of GCC, have responsibility for
allocating country risk to individual transactions. The total allocation 
of country limits is monitored on a daily basis by Group Credit Risk, as
headed by the Group Credit Risk Director. Discretions exist to increase
the Country Guideline above the level agreed by GCC where the Country
Guideline is below the Prudential Guideline. All requests to increase the
Country Guideline in line with individual discretions must be submitted
to and applied centrally through Group Credit Risk.
Credit concentration
A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties
are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic
characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other
conditions. 
The Risk Oversight Committee has delegated responsibility for
management of retail exposure, which comprises personal lending
(including small businesses), mortgages and credit cards, to the Group
Retail Credit Risk Management Committee (RCRMC) and wholesale
exposure, which comprises lending to businesses, banks and other
financial institutions to the Group Wholesale Credit Risk Management
Committee (WCRMC). The RCRMC, considers, among others metrics,
the ratio of loan to value for home loans and the exposure by the
Barclays Retail Grade (BRG) of the customer, whilst the WCRMC
monitors exposure by country and by industry sector and individual
large exposures and exposures to sub-investment grade countries. 
A further protection against undesirable concentration of risk is the
mandate and scale framework described on page 73. Mandate and
scale limits, which can also be set at Group level to reflect overall risk
appetite, can relate either to the stock of current exposures in the
relevant portfolio or to the flow of new exposures into that portfolio.
Typical limits include the caps on UK commercial investment property
lending, the proportion of lending with maturity in excess of seven years
and the proportion of new mortgage business that is buy-to-let.
The concentrations of credit exposure described in the next section
(Risk management: loans and advances to customers) and in the
statistical sections are not proportionally related to credit loss. Some
segments of the Group’s portfolio have and are expected to have
proportionally higher credit charges in relation to the exposure than
others. Moreover, the volatility of credit loss is different in different parts
of the portfolio. Thus comparatively large credit impairment charges
could arise in parts of the portfolio not mentioned below.

Risk profile of customer loans and advances
The chart below shows Barclays wholesale loan profile by existing risk
grade (see page 76 for a description of the rating system). It is important
to note that Barclays prices loans for risk. Thus higher risk loans will
usually have higher interest rates or fees or both. A portfolio of higher
risk loans may therefore be as profitable as, or more profitable than, a
portfolio of lower risk loans.

Loans and advances to customers
Industry analysis 
An industry analysis of customer loans is shown in the chart below.
These classifications have been prepared at the level of the borrowing
entity. This means that a loan to the subsidiary of a major corporation is
classified by the industry in which the subsidiary operates, even though
the parent’s predominant business may be in a different industry. 
(See also Table 6 on page 97.)
Excluding financial services, the chart shows that Barclays largest
sectoral exposures are to home loans, other personal and business and
other services. These categories are generally comprised of small loans,
have low volatility of credit risk outcomes, and are intrinsically highly
diversified. 
Just over two-thirds of the Group’s home loans exposure is to customers
in the UK. The loan-to-value ratios (LTV) on the Group’s UK home loan
portfolio are indicated in the next chart.

The valuations in the chart are those which applied at the last credit
decision on each loan, i.e. when the customer last requested an increase
in the limit or, if there has been no increase, at inception of the loan and
shows that the business flows (new business versus loans redeemed)
has not materially changed the risk profile of the portfolio. 
The impact of house price inflation will result in a reduction in LTV ratios
within the mortgage book on a current valuation basis. On this basis,
LTV on the mortgage book averaged 34% at the end of 2006 (2005:
35%). This ratio is a point in time analysis of the stock with LTV updated
to current house prices by reference to an external price index and as a
result may be influenced by external market conditions as well as
changes in the stock of loans.
Maturity analysis 
The analysis by contractual maturity, shown in the chart below,
indicates that more than a third of loans to customers have a maturity 
of more than five years, the majority of which are mortgages.

Risk management
Other credit risks
Other credit risks
In addition to drawn loans and advances, Barclays is exposed to other
credit risks. These exposures comprise loan commitments, contingent
liabilities, debt securities and other exposures arising in the course of
trading activities. The risks are managed in a similar way to those in
loans and advances, and are subject to the same or similar approval and
governance processes.
The nature of the credit risks among these exposures differ
considerably.
•
Loan commitments may become funded loans and the risks are thus
similar to loans.
•
Contingent liabilities (guarantees, assets pledged as security,
acceptances and endorsements) historically experience low loss
rates.
•
Losses arising from exposures held for trading (derivatives, debt
securities) are accounted for as trading losses, rather than credit
charges, even though the fall in value causing the loss may be
attributable to credit deterioration.
Further details of these exposures are shown in the tables below and
Note 39 to the accounts. The most notable other credit risks are to
guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments, to settlement risk and 
to debt securities.
Guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments
The Group is exposed to loss through the financial guarantees it issues
to clients and commitments to provide loan finance which cannot be
withdrawn once entered in to. The credit risks associated with such
contracts are managed in a similar way to loans and advances, and 
form part of the exposure at default measure.
Settlement risk
Barclays is exposed to settlement risk in its dealings with other financial
institutions. These risks arise, for example, in foreign exchange
transactions when Barclays pays away its side of the transaction to
another bank or other counterparty before receiving payment from the
other side. The risk is that the counterparty may not meet its obligation.
While these exposures are of short duration, they can be large. In recent
years settlement risk has been reduced by several industry initiatives
that have enabled simultaneous and final settlement of transactions to
be made (such as payment-versus-payment through Continuous
Linked Settlement and delivery-versus-payment).
Barclays has worked with its peers in the development of these
arrangements. Increasingly the majority of high value transactions are
settled by such mechanisms. Where these mechanisms are not
available, the risk is addressed by dealing predominantly with highly
rated counterparties, holding collateral and limiting the size of the
exposures according to the rating of the counterparty, with smaller
exposures to those of higher risk. 
Debt securities
Managing the risks associated with debt securities differs in two
important respects from the process for loans. Firstly, a market price is
generally available for a bond or other debt security, which gives a good
indicator of creditworthiness. The financial position of the issuer still
needs to be assessed and monitored, just as with the borrower of a loan.
Moreover, care needs to be taken when using market price as a proxy for
credit risk. To give a simple example, if a bond pays a coupon lower than
equivalent market yields, it will tend to trade at below par (say 98 rather
than 100) so as to realign the yield to market levels. In this case, the
market is not expecting a credit loss of 2% of the face value of the bond.
A second key difference is that many debt securities are rated by
independent rating agencies, giving a further indicator of credit quality.
However, even with continuous monitoring by the rating agencies, there
is often a lag between a credit event and rerating. So, while useful,
external ratings can only inform and are not a substitute for the credit
assessment undertaken for each exposure by Barclays, using its own
grading system (see page 78).

Risk management
Potential credit risk loans
Potential credit risk loans
Non-performing loans and potential problem loans
Potential Credit Risk Loans (PCRLs) comprise Non-Performing Loans
(NPLs) and potential problem loans (PPLs). NPLs are loans where the
customers have failed to meet their repayment commitments, either in
part or in whole. PPLs are loans where payment of principal and interest
is up-to-date and the loans are therefore fully performing, but where
serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrowers to continue to
comply with repayment terms in the near future. 
The amounts are shown before deduction of the value of security held,
impairment allowances (from 2005 onwards) and provisions or interest
suspense (2004 and earlier), all of which might reduce the impact of an
eventual loss, should it occur.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires loans to be
classified, where applicable, as non-accrual, accruing past due 90 days
or more, ‘troubled debt restructurings’ and potential problem loans.
Whilst the Group’s risk procedures do not include the classification of
loans along these lines, historically balances have been reported based
on the SEC categories but with additional categories reported to reflect
the particular circumstances pertaining to the UK market. With effect
from 1st January 2005, the application of IAS 39 required interest to be
recognised on the remaining balance of an impaired financial asset (or 
a group of financial assets) at the effective interest rate for that asset. 
As a result, interest is credited to the income statement in relation to
impaired loans, therefore these loans technically are not classified as
‘non-accrual’ but are, nonetheless, non-performing. In order to reflect
this treatment under IAS 39, in 2005 the Group replaced the ‘non-
accrual’ category with one termed ‘Impaired loans’. Impaired loans are
non-performing loans where, in general, an impairment allowance has
been raised. This category may also include non-performing loans
which are fully collateralised or where the indebtedness has already
been written down to the expected realisable value.
Since 31st December 2005, NPL balances fell by £122m (2%) to
£5,088m. In the retail portfolios, NPLs increased by £179m (5%),
primarily in the UK unsecured cards and loans portfolios, while those 
in the wholesale portfolios (including transition balances) decreased 
by £301m (18%) reflecting the divergent credit environments. 
PPL balances decreased by £168m (18%) during 2006 to £761m. This
was primarily as a result of a fall in wholesale portfolios which decreased
by £202m to £404m reflecting the favourable credit environment. 
As a result, overall PCRL balances fell by £288m (5%) to £5,850m, in line
with the 3% fall in impairment stocks (see page 85). 
As a result, NPL and PCRL balances as a percentage of impairment stock
(coverage ratios) remained broadly stable (see page 83).

Allowances for impairment
Barclays establishes, through charges against profit, an impairment
allowance for the incurred loss inherent in the lending book.
Under IFRS, impairment allowances are recognised where there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events
that have occurred after initial recognition, and where these events have
had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset
or portfolio of financial assets. Impairment of loans and receivables is
measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial
asset’s original effective interest rate. If the carrying amount is less than
the discounted cash flows, then no further allowance is necessary. 
Impairment is measured individually for assets that are individually
significant, and collectively where a portfolio comprises homogenous
assets and where appropriate statistical techniques are available.
In terms of individual assessment, the trigger point for impairment is
formal classification of an account as exhibiting serious financial
problems and where any further deterioration is likely to lead to failure.
Two key inputs to the cash flow calculation are the valuation of all
security and collateral and the timing of all asset realisations, after
allowing for all attendant costs. This method applies in the corporate
portfolios – Business Banking, Barclays Capital and certain areas within
International Retail and Commercial Banking and Barclaycard. 
For collective assessment, the trigger point for impairment is the
missing of a contractual payment. The impairment calculation is based
on a roll-rate approach, where the percentage of assets that move from
the initial delinquency to default are derived from statistical probabilities
based on experience. Recovery amounts and contractual interest rates
are calculated using a weighted average for the relevant portfolio. 
This method applies to parts of Global Retail and Commercial Banking 
– International, Barclaycard and UK Banking and is consistent with
Barclays policy of raising an allowance as soon as impairment is
identified. 
Unidentified impairment allowances, albeit significantly lower in
amount than those reported above, are also raised to cover losses 
which are judged to be incurred but not yet specifically identified in
customer exposures at the balance sheet date, and which, therefore,
have not been specifically reported. 
The incurred but not yet reported calculation is based on the asset’s
probability of moving from the performing portfolio to being specifically
identified as impaired within the given emergence period and then on to
default within a specified period. This is calculated on the present value
of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s
original effective interest rate. 
The emergence periods vary across businesses and are based on actual
experience and are reviewed on an annual basis. This methodology
ensures that the Group only captures the loss incurred at the balance
sheet date.
These impairment allowances are reviewed and adjusted at least
quarterly by an appropriate charge or release of the stock of impairment
allowances based on statistical analysis and management judgement.
Where appropriate, the accuracy of this analysis is periodically assessed
against actual losses.

Allowances for impairment
Writing-off of assets
After an advance has been identified as impaired and is subject to 
an impairment allowance, the stage may be reached whereby it is
concluded that there is no realistic prospect of further recovery.
Write-off will occur, when, and to the extent that, the whole or part 
of a debt is considered irrecoverable.
The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of
subjective judgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted
by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or
other formal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that
some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery. In
any event, the position of impaired loans is reviewed at least quarterly 
to ensure that irrecoverable advances are being written off in a prompt
and orderly manner and in compliance with any local regulations.
Such assets are only written off once all the necessary procedures have
been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are written
back and hence decrease the amount of the reported loan impairment
charge in the income statement. 
Total write-offs of impaired financial assets increased to £2,174m
(2005: £1,587m).
Treatment of interest on impaired loans
IFRSs require that interest on impaired loans be recognised on the net
asset value (gross asset value less impairment allowance) at the rate
used to discount the expected cash flows (i.e. the original effective
interest rate).

the increase was 26% (£395m) and largely reflected the continued
challenging credit environment in UK unsecured retail lending through
2006. The wholesale and corporate sectors remained stable with a low
level of defaults.
The Group impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit
provisions as a percentage of year-end total loans and advances of
£316,561m (2005: £303,451m) increased to 0.65% (2005: 0.52%).
Retail impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit
provisions increased to £1,809m (2005: £1,254m), including £99m
(2005
(b)
: £10m) in respect of Absa. Retail impairment charges on loans
and advances amounted to 1.30% (2005
(c)
: 0.93%) as a percentage of
year-end total loans and advances of £139,350m (2005
(c)
: £134,420m),
including balances in Absa of £20,090m (2005: £20,836m).
In the UK unsecured retail businesses, household discretionary cash
flows remained under pressure leading to deterioration in consumer
credit quality. High debt levels and changing social attitudes to
bankruptcy and debt default contributed to increased impairment
charges. In UK cards and unsecured consumer lending, the flows of 
new delinquencies and the levels of arrears balances declined in the
second half of 2006, reflecting more selective customer recruitment
limit management and improved collections.
In UK Home Finance, delinquencies were flat and amounts charged-off
remained low. The weaker external environment led to increased credit
delinquency in Local Business, where there were both higher balances
on caution status and higher flows into delinquency, which both
stabilised towards the year end.
In the wholesale and corporate businesses, impairment charges on
loans and advances and other credit provisions decreased to £259m
(2005: £313m), including £27m (2005
(b)
: £10m) in respect of Absa. 
The fall was due mainly to recoveries in Barclays Capital as a result of 
the benign wholesale credit environment. This was partially offset by an
increase in UK Business Banking, reflecting higher charges in Medium
Business and growth in lending balances.

Risk management
Market risk management
Market risk management
Market risk is the risk that Barclays earnings or capital, or its ability to
meet business objectives, will be adversely affected by changes in the
level or volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, credit
spreads, commodity prices, equity prices and foreign exchange rates. 
The main market risks arise from trading activities. Barclays is also
exposed to non-trading market risks relating to asset and liability
management and to the Pension Fund.
Categorisation of market risk 
To facilitate the management, control, measurement and reporting 
of market risk, Barclays has grouped market risk into three broad
categories:
•
Trading market risk
These risks arise in trading transactions where Barclays acts as
principal with clients or with the market. Barclays policy is that
market risks arising from trading activities are concentrated in
Barclays Capital.
•
Asset and liability risk
These risks arise from banking activities, including those incurred 
on non-trading positions such as customer assets and liabilities 
and capital balances.
•
Other market risks
Barclays also incurs market risks that are assessed under a slightly
different framework. The principal risks of this type are defined
benefit pension scheme risk and asset management structural
market risk.
Market risk management and control responsibilities
The Board approves the market risk appetite for all types of market risk.
The Market Risk Director is responsible for the market risk control
framework and, under delegated authority from the Risk Director, sets a
limit framework within the context of the approved market risk appetite.
A daily market risk report summarises Barclays market risk exposures
against agreed limits. This daily report is sent to the Risk Director, the
Market Risk Director, the Finance Director and the appropriate Business
Risk Directors.
The Head of each business, assisted by the business risk management
team, is accountable for identifying, measuring and managing all
market risks associated with its activities. Oversight and support is
provided by the Market Risk Director, assisted by the central market 
risk team. 
In Barclays Capital, the Head of Market Risk is responsible for
implementing the market risk control framework. Day to day
responsibility for market risk lies with the senior management of
Barclays Capital, supported by the Market Risk Management team that
operates independently of the trading areas. Daily market risk reports
are produced for the main Barclays Capital business areas covering the
six main risk factor categories, namely interest rate, inflation, credit
spread, commodity, equity and foreign exchange. A more detailed
trading market risk presentation is produced fortnightly and discussed
at Barclays Capital’s Traded Products Risk Review meeting. The
attendees at this meeting include the senior managers from Barclays
Capital and the central market risk team. 
Outside Barclays Capital, Treasury manages treasury market risk and
structural risk. Retail market risk, a consequence of the UK banking
operations, is managed by the Retail Market Risk team. In the non-UK
banking operations, market risk is managed mainly by local treasuries.
The chart overleaf gives an overview of the business control structure.

Market risk measurement
The techniques used to measure and control market risk include:
•
Daily Value at Risk;
•
Stress Tests;
•
Annual Earnings at Risk;
•
Economic capital.
Daily value at risk (DVaR)
DVaR is an estimate of the potential loss which might arise from
unfavourable market movements, if the current positions were to be
held unchanged for one business day, measured to a confidence level 
of 98%. Daily losses exceeding the DVaR figure are likely to occur, on
average, twice in every 100 business days.
In Barclays Capital, DVaR is an important market risk measurement tool.
DVaR is calculated using the historical simulation method with a
historical sample of two years. 
The effectiveness of the DVaR model is assessed principally by back-
testing which counts the number of days when trading-related losses
are bigger than the estimated DVaR figure. Back-testing results are
shown on page 88. Outside Barclays Capital, Barclays uses a simplified
approach to calculate DVaR.
Stress tests
Stress tests provide an indication of the potential size of losses that
could arise in extreme conditions. The stress tests carried out by
Barclays Capital include risk factor stress testing where stress
movements are applied to each of the six main risk categories, namely
interest rate, inflation, credit spread, commodity, equity and foreign
exchange rate; emerging market stress testing where emerging market
portfolios are subject to stress movements; and ad hoc stress testing,
which includes applying stress scenarios to the trading risk book.
If the potential stress loss exceeds the trigger limit, the positions
captured by the stress test are reviewed and discussed by Barclays
Capital market risk and the respective Barclays Capital Business
Head(s). The minutes of the discussion, including the merits of the
position and the appropriate course of action, are then sent to the
Market Risk Director for review.
Outside Barclays Capital, stress testing is carried out by the business
centres and is reviewed by the senior management and business-level
asset and liability committees. The stress testing is tailored to the
business and is typically scenario analysis and historical stress
movements applied to respective portfolios.
Annual earnings at risk (AEaR)
AEaR measures the sensitivity of annual earnings to shocks in 
market rates at the 99th percentile for change over a one-year period.
This shock is consistent with the standardised interest rate shock
recommended by the Basel II framework for assessing banking book
interest rate risk.
AEaR is used to measure structural interest rate market risk and
structural asset management risk (see the Other market risks section
(page 88) for more details).
Economic capital
Economic capital methodologies calculate market risk sensitive capital
allocations and are used to determine each business’s capital charge.
Trading market risk
Barclays policy is to concentrate trading activities in Barclays Capital.
This includes transactions where Barclays Capital acts as principal with
clients or with the market. For maximum efficiency, Barclays manages
client and market activities together. In Barclays Capital, trading risk
occurs in both the trading book and the banking book as defined for
regulatory purposes.
In anticipation of future customer demand, Barclays maintains access 
to market liquidity by quoting bid and offer prices with other market
makers and carries an inventory of capital market and treasury
instruments, including a broad range of cash, securities and derivatives.
Trading positions and any offsetting hedges are established as
appropriate to accommodate customer or Barclays requirements.
Derivatives entered into for trading purposes include swaps, forward
rate agreements, futures, credit derivatives, options and combinations
of these instruments. For a description of the nature of derivative
instruments, see page 94.
Analysis of trading market risk exposures 
The table below shows the DVaR statistics for Barclays Capital’s trading
activities (trading book and banking book).
Total DVaR as at 31st December 2006 was £41.9m (31st December
2005: £37.6m
(c)
). Barclays Capital’s market risk exposure, as measured
by average total Daily Value at Risk (DVaR), increased by 16% to £37.1m 
(2005: £32.0m
(a)
). Interest rate risk fell while non-interest rate risks were
higher, primarily in commodities. The range of total DVaR between high
and low was consistent with 2005 and diversification across risk types
remained significant, reflecting the broad business mix.

DVaR Back-testing 
Barclays recognises the importance of assessing the effectiveness of its
DVaR model. The main approach employed is the technique known as
back-testing, which counts the number of days when trading losses
exceed the estimated DVaR figure. The regulatory standard for back-
testing is to measure DVaR assuming a one-day holding period with a
99% level of confidence. For Barclays Capital’s regulatory trading book,
there were no instances in 2006 or 2005, of a daily trading revenue loss
exceeding the corresponding back-testing DVaR.
Asset and liability market risk 
Interest rate exposures arising from mismatches of fixed rate assets and
liabilities in UK banking operations are passed to Treasury where these
positions are aggregated and the net position passed to the market via
Barclays Capital. Due mainly to timing considerations, market risk can
arise when some of the net position stays with Treasury. Similarly,
market risk can arise due to the impact of interest rates on customer
behaviour. The latter risk is managed and measured by the Retail Market
Risk Team using behavioural models. The positions are converted into
wholesale swap or option exposures, passed to Treasury and managed
by the process described above. 
Structural interest rate risk arises from the variability of income from
non-interest bearing products, managed variable rate products and the
Group’s equity. Structural foreign currency risk results from holding
non-Sterling investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates or joint
ventures. These structural risks are managed by Treasury.
Market risk is also taken in overseas treasuries to support and facilitate
customer activity. The risk is comparatively modest. The market risks
are managed by local treasury functions and local asset and liability
committees. The central market risk team maintains regular contact
with the businesses and oversees a comprehensive risk reporting
framework.
Other market risks 
Defined benefit pension scheme risk 
Barclays maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for
past and current employees. The ability of the Pension Fund to meet 
the projected pension payments is maintained through investments.
Market risk arises because the estimated market value of the pension
fund assets might decline or their investment returns might reduce or
because the estimated value of the pension liabilities might increase. In
these circumstances, Barclays could be required or might choose to
make extra contributions to the pension fund. Financial details of the
pension fund are in Note 35.
Asset management structural market risk 
Asset management structural market risk is the risk that the value 
of funds managed by Barclays on behalf of clients might reduce leading
to a reduction in fee and commission income. It affects Barclays Global
Investors, Global Retail and Commercial Banking, Barclays Wealth and
Barclays Life. The risk is controlled and managed by the respective
businesses and the central market risk team. Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 89

Risk management
Capital and liquidity risk management
Liquidity management within the Group has several strands:
•
Day to day funding, managed by monitoring expected cash flows to
ensure that requirements can be met. This includes replenishment 
of funds as they mature or are borrowed by customers. The Group
maintains an active presence in global money markets to enable that
to happen.
•
Maintain a portfolio of highly marketable assets that can easily 
be liquidated as protection against any unforeseen interruption 
to cash flow.
•
Monitor, manage and control intraday liquidity in real time is
recognised by the Group as a mission critical process: any failure 
to meet specific intraday commitments would have significant
consequences.
•
Stress testing is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of
various scenarios which may put the Group’s liquidity at risk. 
The ability to raise funds is in part dependent on maintaining the Bank’s
credit rating. The funding impact of a credit downgrade is regularly
estimated. Whilst the impact of a single downgrade may affect the price
at which funding is available, the effect on liquidity is not considered
material in Group terms.
Liquidity risk measurement
Monitoring and reporting take the form of cash flow measurement and
projections for the next day, week and month as these are key periods
for liquidity management. This is based on principles agreed by the FSA.
In addition to cash flow management, Treasury also monitors
unmatched medium-term assets and the level and type of undrawn
lending commitments, the usage of overdraft facilities and the impact of
contingent liabilities such as standby letters of credit and guarantees.
Treasury develops and implements stress tests on the Group’s projected
cash flows. The output informs the Group’s contingency funding plan.
This is maintained by Treasury and is aligned with the Group and
country business resumption plans to encompass decision-making
authorities, internal and external communication and, in the event of 
a systems failure, the restoration of liquidity management and 
payment systems.
Sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed to maintain a wide
diversification by currency, geography, provider, product and term.
Whilst the past year saw relatively stable markets, with no significant
consequences for the Group’s liquidity, significant market events over
recent years including corporate scandals contributed to a short-term
flight to quality in financial markets from which Barclays benefited. 
An important source of structural liquidity is provided by our core retail
deposits in the UK, Europe and Africa, mainly current accounts and
savings accounts. Although current accounts are repayable on demand
and savings accounts at short notice, the Group’s broad base of
customers – numerically and by depositor type – helps to protect
against unexpected fluctuations. Such accounts form a stable funding
base for the Group’s operations and liquidity needs.
To avoid reliance on a particular group of customers or market sectors,
the distribution of sources and the maturity profile of deposits are 
also carefully managed. Important factors in assuring liquidity are
competitive rates and the maintenance of depositors’ confidence. 
Such confidence is based on a number of factors including the Group’s
reputation, the strength of earnings and the Group’s financial position. 
For further details see contractual cash obligations and commercial
commitments of the Group on page 81.
Capital and liquidity risk management
The Board Risk Committee has approved minimum control
requirements for capital and liquidity risk management.
The Treasurer has established risk control frameworks and a policy and
assurance structure to ensure that capital and liquidity risks are managed
in accordance with the requirements of the Board. Policies are set by the
Treasury Committee which is chaired by the Group Finance Director .
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital resources to meet regulatory capital
requirements. The FSA requires the Group to hold sufficient capital
resources to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements. In
addition, the Group manages its capital resources to maintain financial
holding company status under the rules of the US Federal Reserve Bank
and also to ensure Group entities, that are subject to local capital
adequacy regulation in individual countries, meet their minimum 
capital requirements. 
Minimum requirements under FSA rules are expressed as the ratio 
of capital resources to risk weighted assets (Risk Asset Ratio). Risk
weighted assets are a function of risk weights applied to the Group’s
assets using calculations developed by the Basel Committee for Banking
Supervision. In anticipation of the Group’s implementation of the new
Basel II standards on 1st January 2008, the Group will also manage its
capital resources in accordance with the Basel II advanced approaches
during 2007.
In 2006, the Group continued to manage its capital resources, including
accessing the capital markets, in order to exceed the minimum capital
requirements of its regulators. As at December 2006, the Barclays
Group Risk Asset Ratio was 11.7% and the Tier 1 Ratio was 7.7%.
The graph shows the Group’s regulatory capital resources broken down
by tier. Further information on the Group’s capital resources is provided
in the Financial Review on pages 58 and 60.
Liquidity risk management 
This is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its obligations when
they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn, with
consequent failure to repay depositors and fulfil commitments to 
lend. The risk that it will be unable to do so is inherent in all banking
operations and can be impacted by a range of institution specific and
market-wide events including, but not limited to, credit events, merger
and acquisition activity, systemic shocks and natural disasters.

Operational risk and business risk management
Operational risk and business risk management
Operational and business risks are inherent in Barclays operations and
are typical of any large enterprise.
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect losses resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, 
or from external events. Major sources of operational risk include:
operational process reliability, IT security, outsourcing of operations,
dependence on key suppliers, implementation of strategic change,
integration of acquisitions, fraud, error, customer service quality,
regulatory compliance, recruitment, training and retention of staff, 
and social and environmental impacts.
Business risk is the risk of adverse outcomes resulting from a weak
competitive position or from poor choice of strategy, markets, products,
activities or structures. Major potential sources of business risk include:
revenue volatility due to factors such as macroeconomic conditions;
inflexible cost structures; uncompetitive products or pricing; and
structural inefficiencies.
Barclays is committed to the advanced management of operational 
and business risks. In particular, we are implementing improved
management and measurement approaches for operational risk to
strengthen control, improve customer service and minimise operating
losses. In addition, this investment is being made to improve risk
sensitivity, to enhance the Operational Risk Capital model and to obtain
approval to apply the Advanced Measurement Approach under the
Basel II Accord when that option first becomes available in 2008.
Barclays works closely with peer banks to benchmark our internal
Operational Risk practices and to drive the development of advanced
Operational Risk techniques across the industry.
It is not cost effective to attempt to eliminate all operational and business
risks and in any event it would not be possible to do so. Events of small
significance are expected to occur and are accepted as inevitable; events
of material significance are rare and the Group seeks to reduce the risk
from these in a framework consistent with its agreed Risk Appetite.
Responsibility for and control of operational risk 
Barclays has a Group Operational Risk Framework, which is consistent
with and part of the Group Internal Control and Assurance Framework.
Minimum control requirements have been established for all key areas
of identified risk. The risk categories relevant to operational and
business risks are: Financial Crime, Financial Reporting, Taxation, Legal,
Operations, People, Regulatory Compliance, Technology, Brand
Management, Change, Corporate Responsibility and Strategic.
Responsibility for implementing and overseeing these policies is to be
found throughout the organisation as follows:
•
The prime responsibility for the management of operational risk and
the compliance with control requirements rests with the business
and functional units where the risk arises. Frontline risk managers
are widely distributed throughout the Group in business units. They
service and support these areas assisting line managers in managing
these risks.
•
Business Risk Directors in each business are responsible for
overseeing the implementation of and compliance with 
Group policies.
•
Governance and Control Committees in each business monitor
control effectiveness. The Group Governance and Control
Committee receive reports from the committees in the businesses
and considers Group-wide control issues and their risk mitigation.
•
In the corporate centre, the Operational Risk Director oversees the
range of operational risks across the Group in accordance with the
Group Operational Risk Framework.
•
The Internal Audit function provides assurance for operational risk
control across the organisation and reports to the Board and senior
management.
The management and measurement of operational risk
A consistent approach to the identification and assessment of key risks
and controls is undertaken across all business units. Self-assessment
techniques are used by business management for risk identification 
and for evaluation of control effectiveness and monitoring capability.
Business management determines whether particular risks are
effectively managed within business risk appetite and otherwise take
remedial action. The risk assessment process is consistent with the
principles in the integrated framework published by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Risk event data collection and reporting
A standard process is used Group-wide for the recognition, capture,
assessment, analysis and reporting of risk events. This process is used
to help identify where process and control requirements are needed to
reduce the recurrence of risk events. Risk events are loaded onto a
central database and reported monthly to the Operational Risk
Executive Committee.
Barclays also uses a database of external public risk events and is part 
of a consortium of international banks that share anonymised loss data
information to assist in risk identification and assessment.
Key risk scenarios
Using the above components of the Operational Risk Framework 
we generate Key Risk Scenarios which identify our most significant
operational risks across the Group. It is these that are the main input 
to our economic capital model.
Reporting
Business units are required to report on both a regular and an event-
driven basis. The reports include a profile of the key risks to their
business objectives, control issues of Group-level significance, and
operational risk events. Specific reports are prepared on a regular basis
for the Risk Oversight Committee, the Board Risk Committee and the
Board Audit Committee. In particular the Group Operational Risk Profile
Report is provided quarterly to the Risk Oversight Committee.
Economic capital
Methodologies are used to model both operational and business risk
exposures. These are allocated, on a risk sensitive basis, to business
units in the form of economic capital charges, providing an incentive to
manage these risks within appetite levels.

covering all risk types, including Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational
Risk, and Finance. To minimise the risk of loss through model failure, 
a Group Policy for the Control of Model Risk has been developed. 
The Policy helps reduce the potential for model failure by setting
minimum standards around the end-to-end model development and
implementation process. The Policy also sets the Group governance
processes for all models, which allows model risk to be monitored
across the Group, and seeks to identify and escalate any potential
problems at an early stage.
The key areas where minimum requirements are defined are:
Model materiality
To help ensure that sufficient management time is spent on the more
material models, there is a method of providing each model with a
materiality rating. The materiality rating for an individual model
depends on the assets for which the model is used and the Expected
Loss and Economic Capital associated with the assets. Models of 
higher materiality are subject to higher levels of independent scrutiny
and challenge prior to implementation.
Model documentation
Documentation should be sufficiently detailed to allow an expert to
recreate the model from the original data sources. It must include a
description of the data used for model development, the methodology
used (and the rationale for choosing such a methodology), a description
of any assumptions used in the model, and details of where the model
works well, and areas that are known as model weaknesses.
Initial model validation
All models are subject to a validation and independent review process
before the model can be signed-off for implementation. The model
validation exercise must demonstrate that the model is fit for purpose
and provides accurate estimates. The independent review process will
also ensure that all aspects of the model development process have
been performed in a suitable manner.
Model sign-off
The rules for model sign-off are based on model materiality. The sign-off
process ensures that the model is technically fit for purpose as well as
ensuring that the model satisfies the business requirements and all the
relevant regulatory requirements. The most material models used
within the Group receive their final sign-off for implementation from
Group ExCo, while other models are usually signed-off by their
respective business risk committees.
Basel II models
Barclays has spent a considerable amount of time in developing and
upgrading a number of credit risk models across the Group moving
towards compliance with the Basel II advanced approach. As part of 
this process all Basel credit risk models are assessed against the Basel II
minimum requirements prior to model sign-off to ensure that once
signed-off they are fit to be used for regulatory purposes. Basel II 
models will also be used during the 2007 parallel run process in
anticipation of implementation from 1st January 2008 in accordance
with Basel requirements.
Ongoing model validation and monitoring
All models within the Group are subject to an annual review, to ensure
that the models are working well, and that assumptions used in model
development are still appropriate. All credit risk models can also be
subject to more frequent monitoring. Model performance monitoring
ensures that deficiencies in models are identified early, and remedial
action can be taken before the deficiency becomes serious and affects
the decision-making process.
Taxation risk
The Group is subject to the tax laws in all countries in which it operates.
A number of double taxation agreements entered between countries
also impact on the taxation of the Group. The Group is also subject to
European Community tax law.
Tax risk is the risk associated with changes in tax law or in the
interpretation of tax law. It also includes the risk of changes in tax 
rates and the risk of failure to comply with procedures required by 
tax authorities. 
Failure to manage tax risks could lead to an additional tax charge. 
It could also lead to a financial penalty for failure to comply with
required tax procedures or other aspects of tax law. If, as a result 
of a particular tax risk materialising, the tax costs associated with
particular transactions are greater than anticipated, it could affect 
the profitability of those transactions.
The Group takes a responsible and transparent approach to the
management and control of its tax affairs and related tax risk.
•
tax risks are assessed as part of the Group’s formal governance
processes and are reviewed by the Executive Committee, Group
Finance Director and the Board Risk Committee;
•
the tax charge is also reviewed by the Board Audit Committee.
•
the tax risks of proposed transactions or new areas of business are
fully considered before proceeding;
•
the Group takes appropriate advice from reputable professional
firms;
•
the Group employs high-quality tax professionals and provides
ongoing technical training;
•
the tax professionals understand and work closely with the different
areas of the business;
•
the Group uses effective, well-documented and controlled processes
to ensure compliance with tax disclosure and filing obligations.
•
where disputes arise with tax authorities with regard to the
interpretation and application of tax law, the Group is committed to
addressing the matter promptly and resolving the matter with the
tax authority in an open and constructive manner. Barclays PLC

Risk management
Insurance risk management
Insurance risk is the risk that the Group will have to make higher than
anticipated payments to settle claims arising from its long-term and
short-term insurance businesses.
Long-term insurance business
For long-term insurance contracts where death is the insured risk, the
most significant factors that could detrimentally affect the frequency
and severity of claims are the incidence of disease, such as AIDS, or
general changes in lifestyle, such as in eating, exercise and smoking.
Where survival is the insured risk, advances in medical care and social
conditions are the key factors that increase longevity. The Group
manages its exposure to risk by operating in part as a unit linked
business, prudent product design, applying strict underwriting criteria,
transferring risk to reinsurers, managing claims and establishing
prudent reserves.
Short-term insurance business
For payment protection contracts where inability to make payments
under a loan contract is the insured risk, the most significant factors are
the health of the policyholder and the possibility of unemployment
which depends upon, among other things, long-term and short-term
economic factors. The Group manages its exposure to such risks
through prudent product design, efficient claims management, prudent
reserving methodologies and bases, regular product, economic and
market reviews and regular adequacy tests on the size of the reserves.
Absa insures property and motor vehicles, for which the most
significant factors that could affect the frequency and severity of claims
are climatic change and crime. Absa manages its exposure to risk by
diversifying insurance risks accepted and transferring risk to reinsurers.
See page 236 for further information.
Reinsurer credit risk
For the long-term business, reinsurance programmes are in place to
restrict the amount of cover to any single life. The reinsurance cover is
spread across highly rated companies to diversify the risk of reinsurer
solvency. Net of insurance reserves include a margin to reflect reinsurer
credit risk.
For the short-term business a quota-share programme is in place for
selected in-force policies. The structure of the treaty ensures that the
underlying assets are bankruptcy remote in the event of credit problems
with the reinsurer.
Disclosures about certain trading activities (including
non-exchange traded commodity contracts)
The Group delivers a fully integrated service to clients for base metals,
precious metals, oil and oil-related products, power, natural gas and
other related commodities.
The Group’s commodity business continues to expand, as market
conditions allow, through the addition of new products and markets,
with the 2006 expansion of business being driven by both organic
growth and acquisitions of portfolios.
The Group offers both over the counter (OTC) and exchange traded
derivatives in these commodities. The Group’s base metals business
also enters into outright metal purchases and sale transactions, while
the power and gas business trades both physical forwards and
derivative contracts. The Group does not maintain any physical
exposures in oil or oil related products. The Group continues to develop
and offer a range of commodity-related structured products.
The Group’s principal commodity related derivative contracts are swaps,
options, forwards and futures, which are all similar in nature to such
non-commodity related contracts. Commodity derivative contracts
include commodity specification and delivery location as well as
forward date and notional value.
The fair values of commodity physical and derivative positions are
determined through a combination of recognised market observable
prices, exchange prices, and established inter-commodity relationships.
The fair value of OTC commodity derivative contracts is determined
primarily by using valuation models which are based on assumptions
supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same
instrument or are based on available observable market data. 
Where a valuation model is used, the fair value is determined based on
the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract,
discounted back to present value. The expected cash flows for each
contract are either determined using market parameters such as
commodity price curves, commodity volatilities, commodity
correlations, interest rate yield curves and foreign exchange rates, 
or other market prices.
Where possible, fair values generated by models are independently
validated with reference to market price quotes or price sharing with
other institutions. Where all significant model inputs can be validated to
observable market data at the inception of the contract the valuation of
the contract is based on the model value output.
However, where no observable market parameter is available then the
contract is valued at transaction price at inception. Following initial
recognition, the process of calculating fair value from a valuation model
may require estimation of certain pricing parameters, assumptions or
model characteristics. These estimates are calibrated against industry
standards, economic models and observed transaction prices. The
valuation model used for a particular instrument, the quality and
liquidity of market data used for pricing, other fair value adjustments
not specifically captured by the model, market data and any
assumptions or estimates are all subject to internal review and approval
procedures and consistent application between accounting periods.

Credit risk exposures are actively managed by the Group. Refer to page 76 for more information on the Group’s approach to credit risk management.
At 31st December 2006, 87% of all commodities credit exposure was to counterparties with cross asset class netting agreements which allow
exposure on commodities products to be reduced by amounts owed to the same counterparties in other asset classes. 69% of commodities credit
exposure to counterparties with BBB+ and below equivalent ratings was to counterparties with cross asset class netting agreements.
Additionally, collateral agreements are held with a majority of these same counterparties that allow collateral to be called against commodity
exposures. All non-collateralised exposures are subject to credit limits, and credit or Risk Tendency reserves are created against these exposures 
if appropriate.
Note
(a) Barclays assesses the credit quality and assigns an internal risk rating to all counterparties. Each internal rating corresponds to the statistical probability of a
counterparty in that rating class defaulting within the next 12-month period. The counterparty ratings shown in the table above are based on the approximate S&P
equivalent of the Barclays internal rating. Barclays PLC

Derivatives
Derivatives
The use of derivatives and their sale to customers as risk management
products are an integral part of the Group’s trading activities. These
instruments are also used to manage the Group’s own exposure to
fluctuations in interest, exchange rates and commodity and equity
prices as part of its asset and liability management activities. 
Barclays Capital manages the trading derivatives book as part of the
market risk book. This includes foreign exchange, interest rate, equity,
commodity and credit derivatives. The policies regarding market risk
management are outlined in the market risk management section on
pages 86 to 88.
The policies for derivatives that are used to manage the Group’s own
exposure to interest and exchange rate fluctuations are outlined in the
asset and liability market risk section on page 88.
Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one 
or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the
contract. They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options
and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Group’s
net interest income, net trading income, net fee and commission
income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the
contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
The Group participates both in exchange traded and over the counter
derivatives markets.
Exchange traded derivatives
The Group buys and sells financial instruments that are traded or
cleared on an exchange, including interest rate swaps, futures and
options on futures. Holders of exchange traded instruments provide
margin daily with cash or other security at the exchange, to which the
holders look for ultimate settlement.
Over the counter traded derivatives
The Group also buys and sells financial instruments that are traded over
the counter, rather than on a recognised exchange. 
These instruments range from commoditised transactions in derivative
markets, to trades where the specific terms are tailored to the
requirements of the Group’s customers. In many cases, industry
standard documentation is used, most commonly in the form of 
a master agreement, with individual transaction confirmations. 
The existence of a signed master agreement is intended to give the
Group protection in situations where a counterparty is in default.
Foreign exchange derivatives
The Group’s principal exchange rate related contracts are forward
foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell a
specified quantity of foreign currency, usually on a specified future date
at an agreed rate. A currency swap generally involves the exchange, or
notional exchange, of equivalent amounts of two currencies and a
commitment to exchange interest periodically until the principal
amounts are re-exchanged on a future date.
Currency options provide the buyer with the right, but not the
obligation, either to purchase or sell a fixed amount of a currency at 
a specified exchange rate on or before a future date. As compensation
for assuming the option risk, the option writer generally receives a
premium at the start of the option period.
Interest rate derivatives
The Group’s principal interest rate related contracts are interest rate
swaps, forward rate agreements, basis swaps, caps, floors and
swaptions. Included in this product category are transactions that
include combinations of these features.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange
fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments
based upon a notional principal amount and the interest rates defined 
in the contract. Certain agreements combine interest rate and foreign
currency swap transactions, which may or may not include the
exchange of principal amounts. A basis swap is a form of interest rate
swap, in which both parties exchange interest payments based on
floating rates, where the floating rates are based upon different
underlying reference indices. In a forward rate agreement, two parties
agree a future settlement of the difference between an agreed rate 
and a future interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount. 
The settlement, which generally occurs at the start of the contract
period, is the discounted present value of the payment that would
otherwise be made at the end of that period.
Credit derivatives
The Group’s principal credit derivative-related contracts include credit
default swaps and total return swaps. A credit derivative is an
arrangement whereby the credit risk of an asset (the reference asset) 
is transferred from the buyer to the seller of protection. 
A credit default swap is a contract where the protection seller receives
premium or interest-related payments in return for contracting to make
payments to the protection buyer upon a defined credit event. Credit
events normally include bankruptcy, payment default on a reference
asset or assets, or downgrades by a rating agency.
A total return swap is an instrument whereby the seller of protection
receives the full return of the asset, including both the income and
change in the capital value of the asset. The buyer in return receives 
a predetermined amount.
Equity derivatives
The Group’s principal equity-related contracts are equity and stock
index swaps and options (including warrants, which are equity options
listed on an exchange). An equity swap is an agreement between two
parties to exchange periodic payments, based upon a notional principal
amount, with one side paying fixed or floating interest and the other
side paying based on the actual return of the stock or stock index. 
An equity option provides the buyer with the right, but not the
obligation, either to purchase or sell a specified stock, basket of stocks
or stock index at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.
Commodity derivatives
The Group’s principal commodity-related derivative contracts are
swaps, options, forwards and futures. The main commodities
transacted are base metals, precious metals, oil and oil-related
products, power and natural gas. Barclays PLC

a major corporation is classified by the industry in which the subsidiary operates, even though the parent’s predominant business may be in 
a different industry.

Annual Report 2006 108
The Group’s accounting policies are set out on pages 151 to 160. 
Certain of these policies, as well as estimates made by management, are
considered to be important to an understanding of the Group’s financial
condition since they require management to make difficult, complex or
subjective judgements and estimates, some of which may relate to
matters that are inherently uncertain. The following accounting policies
include estimates which are particularly sensitive in terms of judgements
and the extent to which estimates are used. Other accounting policies
involve significant amounts of judgements and estimates, but the total
amounts involved are not significant to the financial statements.
Management has discussed the accounting policies and critical
accounting estimates with the Board Accounts Committee. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
Some of the Bank’s financial instruments are carried at fair value
through profit or loss, including derivatives held for trading or risk
management purposes. The fair value of a financial instrument is the
amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation
sale. Financial instruments entered into as trading transactions,
together with any associated hedging, are measured at fair value and
the resultant profits and losses are included in net trading income, along
with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and
funding costs relating to trading activities. Assets and liabilities resulting
from gains and losses on financial instruments held for trading are
reported gross in trading portfolio assets and liabilities or derivative
financial instruments, reduced by the effects of netting agreements
where there is an intention to settle net with counterparties. 
Financial instruments are either priced with reference to a quoted
market price for that instrument or by using a valuation model. Where
the fair value is calculated using financial markets pricing models, the
methodology is to calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of
each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present
value. These models use as their basis independently sourced market
parameters including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities
and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates. Most
market parameters are either directly observable or are implied from
instrument prices. However, profits or losses are recognised upon initial
recognition only when such profits can be measured solely by reference
to observable current market transactions or valuation techniques
based solely on observable market inputs. 
The calculation of fair value for any financial instrument may also
require adjustment of the quoted price or model value to reflect the cost
of credit risk (where not embedded in underlying models or prices
used), or to reflect hedging costs not captured in pricing models (to the
extent they would be taken into account by a market participant in
determining a price). The process of calculating fair value on illiquid
instruments or from a valuation model may require estimation of certain
pricing parameters, assumptions or model characteristics. These
estimates are calibrated against industry standards, economic models
and observed transaction prices. 
The effect of changing these assumptions for those financial
instruments for which the fair values were measured using valuation
techniques that are determined in full or in part on assumptions that are
not supported by observable market prices to a range of reasonably
possible alternative assumptions, would be to provide a range of £123m
(2005: £87m) lower to £139m (2005: £121m) higher than the fair
values recognised in the financial statements. The fair value of financial
instruments is provided in Note 58 to the accounts. 
Allowances for loan impairment 
Allowances for loan impairment represent management’s estimate 
of the losses incurred in the loan portfolios as at the balance sheet 
date. Changes to the allowances for loan impairment and changes 
to the provisions for undrawn contractually committed facilities and
guarantees provided are reported in the consolidated income statement
as part of the impairment charge. 
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large
numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics
where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical
techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio
basis, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence
periods. These statistical analyses use as primary inputs the extent to
which accounts in the portfolio are in arrears and historical information
on the eventual losses encountered from such delinquent portfolios.
There are many such models in use, each tailored to a product, line of
business or customer category. The models are updated from time to
time. However, experience suggests that the models are reliable and
stable, stemming from the very large numbers of accounts from which
the model building information is drawn. Judgement and knowledge is
needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are
developed or revised. The impairment allowance reflected in the
financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be
reasonable and supportable. The impairment charge reflected in the
income statement for these portfolios is £1,809m (2005: £1,254m) and
amounts to 87% (2005: 80%) of the total impairment charge in 2006. 
For larger accounts, impairment allowances are calculated on an
individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on
the expected future cash flows are taken into account, for example, the
business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral,
the Group’s position relative to other claimants, the reliability of
customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out
process. The level of the impairment allowance is the difference
between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows
(discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate), and its carrying
amount. Subjective judgements are made in this process. Furthermore,
judgements change with time as new information becomes available or
as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the
impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken, case by case.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances
and have a direct impact on the impairment charge. The impairment
charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to larger
accounts is £265m (2005: £320m) or 13% (2005: 20%) of the total
impairment charge in 2006. Further information on impairment
allowances is set out on pages 83 to 85. 
Critical accounting estimates Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 109
Operating review
1
Goodwill
Management have to consider at least annually whether the current
carrying value of goodwill is impaired. The first step of the impairment
review process requires the identification of independent operating units,
by dividing the Group business into as many largely independent income
streams as is reasonably practicable. The goodwill is then allocated to
these independent operating units. The first element of this allocation is
based on the areas of the business expected to benefit from the
synergies derived from the acquisition. The second element reflects the
allocation of the net assets acquired and the difference between 
the consideration paid for those net assets and their fair value. This
allocation is reviewed following business reorganisation. The carrying
value of the operating unit, including the allocated goodwill, is compared
to its fair value to determine whether any impairment exists. If the fair
value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill will be
impaired. Detailed calculations may need to be carried out taking into
consideration changes in the market in which a business operates (e.g.
competitive activity , regulatory change). In the absence of readily
available market price data this calculation is based upon discounting
expected pre-tax cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate appropriate 
to the operating unit, the determination of both of which requires the
exercise of judgement. The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive
to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to
assumptions regarding the long-term sustainable cash flows. While
forecasts are compared with actual performance and external economic
data, expected cash flows naturally reflect management’s view of future
performance. The most significant amounts of goodwill relate to the
Absa and Woolwich acquisitions. The goodwill impairment testing
performed in 2006 indicated that none of the goodwill was impaired. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets that derive their value from contractual customer
relationships or that can be separated and sold and have a finite useful
life are amortised over their estimated useful life. Determining the
estimated useful life of these finite life intangible assets requires an
analysis of circumstances, and judgement by the Bank’s management.
At each balance sheet date, or more frequently when events or changes
in circumstances dictate, intangible assets are assessed for indications
of impairment. If indications are present, these assets are subject to an
impairment review. The impairment review comprises a comparison of
the carrying amount of the asset with its recoverable amount: the
higher of the assets’ or the cash-generating unit’s net selling price and
its value in use. Net selling price is calculated by reference to the amount
at which the asset could be disposed of in a binding sale agreement in
an arms-length transaction evidenced by an active market or recent
transactions for similar assets. Value in use is calculated by discounting
the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the asset’s
continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at 
a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis. The most significant
amounts of intangible assets relate to the Absa acquisition.
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group provides pension plans for employees in most parts of the
world. Arrangements for staff retirement benefits vary from country to
country and are made in accordance with local regulations and
customs. For defined contribution schemes, the pension cost
recognised in the profit and loss account represents the contributions
payable to the scheme. For defined benefit schemes, actuarial valuation
of each of the scheme’s obligations using the projected unit credit
method and the fair valuation of each of the scheme’s assets are
performed annually in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19. 
The actuarial valuation is dependent upon a series of assumptions, the
key ones being interest rates, mortality, investment returns and expense
inflation. Mortality estimates are based on standard industry and
national mortality tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect the
Group’s own experience. The returns on fixed interest investments are
set to market yields at the valuation date (less an allowance for risk) to
ensure consistency with the asset valuation. The returns on UK and
overseas equities are set relative to fixed interest returns by considering
the long-term expected equity risk premium. The expense inflation
assumption reflects long-term expectations of both earnings and retail
price inflation. 
The difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date,
adjusted for any historic unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past
service cost, is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet. An asset
arising, for example, as a result of past over-funding or the performance
of the plan investments, is recognised to the extent that it does not
exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of
contributions. To the extent that any unrecognised gains or losses at the
start of the measurement year in relation to any individual defined
benefit scheme exceed 10% of the greater of the fair value of the
scheme assets and the defined benefit obligation for that scheme, a
proportion of the excess is recognised in the income statement. 
The Group’s IAS 19 pension deficit across all pension and post-
retirement schemes as at 31st December 2006 was £817m (2005:
£2,879m). This comprises net recognised liabilities of £1,719m (2005:
£1,737m) and unrecognised actuarial gains of £902m (2005: losses of
£1,142m). The net recognised liabilities comprises retirement benefit
liabilities of £1,807m (2005: £1,823m) relating to schemes that are in
deficit, and assets of £88m (2005: £86m) relating to schemes that are in
surplus. The Group’s IAS 19 pension deficit in respect of the main UK
scheme as at 31st December 2006 was £0.5bn (2005: £2.5bn). The
estimated actuarial funding position of the main UK pension scheme as
at 31st December 2006, estimated from the triennial valuation in 2004,
was a surplus of £1.3bn (2005: £0.9bn). Cash contributions to the main
UK scheme were £351m (2005: £354m). 
Further information on retirement benefit obligations, including
assumptions is set out in Note 35 to the accounts. Barclays PLC

Dividends
The final dividends for the year ended 31st December 2006 of 20.5p per
ordinary share of 25p each and 10p per staff share of £1 each have been
agreed by the Directors. The final dividends will be paid on 27th April

the total distribution for 2006 is 31p (2005: 26.6p) per ordinary share
and 20p (2005: 20p) per staff share. The dividends for the year absorb 
a total of £1,973m (2005: £1,687m).
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Ordinary shareholders may have their dividends reinvested in Barclays
PLC ordinary shares by participating in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
The plan is available to all ordinary shareholders provided that they 
do not live in, and are not subject to the jurisdiction of, any country
where their participation in the plan would require Barclays or The Plan
Administrator to take action to comply with local government or
regulatory procedures or any similar formalities. Any shareholder
wishing to obtain details of the plan and a mandate form should contact
The Plan Administrator to Barclays at The Causeway, Worthing, BN99
6DA. Those wishing to participate for the first time in the plan should
send their completed mandate form to The Plan Administrator so as to
be received by 4th April 2007 for it to be applicable to the payment of
the final dividend on 27th April 2007. Existing participants should take
no action unless they wish to alter their current mandate instructions, 
in which case they should contact The Plan Administrator.
Share Capital
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the year. As at 
27th February 2007 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this
report), the Company had an unexpired authority to repurchase shares
up to a maximum of 968.6 million ordinary shares. 
The issued ordinary share capital was increased by 45.1million ordinary
shares during the year as a result of the exercise of options under the

2006 the issued ordinary share capital totalled 6,534,698,021 shares.

appointed by the Board since the last AGM. The retiring Directors are
eligible to stand for re-election. In addition, under the UK Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (the Code), every Director should seek
re-election by shareholders at least every three years. 
The Directors retiring by rotation at the 2007 AGM and offering
themselves for re-election are Stephen Russell, Leigh Clifford, Sir Andrew
Likierman and John Varley . Sir Nigel Rudd retires annually in accordance

Directors’ Emoluments
Information on emoluments of Directors of Barclays PLC, in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and the Listing Rules of the United
Kingdom Listing Authority, is given in the Remuneration report on pages
125 to 140 and in Note 46 to the accounts.
Directors’ Indemnities
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Group to attract
and retain the services of the most able and experienced Directors by
offering competitive terms of engagement, including the granting of
indemnities on terms consistent with the applicable statutory
provisions. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as defined by
section 309B of the Companies Act 1985) were accordingly in force
during the course of the financial year ended 31st December 2006 for
the benefit of the then Directors and, at the date of this report, are in
force for the benefit of the Directors in relation to certain losses and
liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) in connection with
their duties, powers or office.
Activities
Barclays PLC Group is a major global financial services provider engaged
in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking,
wealth management and investment management services. The Group
operates through branches, offices and subsidiaries in the UK and
overseas.
Community Involvement
The total commitment for 2006 was £46.5m (2005: £39.1m).
The Group committed £39.6m in support of the community in the UK
(2005: £35.3m) and £6.9m was committed in international support
(2005: £3.8m). The UK commitment includes £35.2m of charitable
donations (2005: £16.7m).
Barclays is a member of the Percent Club – a group of companies that
have undertaken to ensure that donations to the community over time
amount to at least 1% of their UK pre-tax profit.
Barclays has an extensive community programme covering many
countries around the world. The Group provides funding and support 
to over 8,279 charities and voluntary organisations, ranging from small,
local charities, like Passage (UK), to international organisations like
Unicef. We also have a very successful employee programme which in
2006 saw more than 33,000 employees and pensioners worldwide
taking part in Barclays supported volunteering, giving and fundraising
activities. Further information on our community involvement is given
on pages 143 and 146.
Political Donations
The Group did not give any money for political purposes in the UK nor
did it make any donations to EU political organisations or incur any EU
political expenditure during the year. Absa Group Limited, in which the
Group acquired a majority stake in 2005, made donations totalling
£212,729 in 2006 (2005: £224,400) in accordance with its policy of
making political donations to the major South African political parties 
to support the development of democracy in South Africa. The Group
made no other political donations in 2006.
At the AGM in 2006, shareholders gave a limited authority for Barclays
PLC and Barclays Bank PLC to make political donations and incur
political expenditure, within an agreed limit, as a precautionary measure
in light of the wide definitions in The Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000. This was a renewal of an authority given by
shareholders in 2002. These authorities, which have not been used,
expire on 26th April 2007. The risk of inadvertently breaching The
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 remains and the
Directors consider it prudent to seek a renewal of the authority given by
shareholders for Barclays Bank PLC. A resolution to authorise Barclays
Bank PLC to make political donations and incur political expenditure up
to a maximum aggregate sum of £125,000 is therefore being proposed
at the Barclays PLC 2007 AGM.
Employee Involvement
Barclays is committed to ensuring that employees share in the success
of the Group. Staff are encouraged to participate in share option and
share purchase schemes and have a substantial sum invested in
Barclays shares.
Employees are kept informed of matters of concern to them in a variety
of ways, including the corporate news magazines, intranets, briefings
and mobile phone SMS messaging. These communications help
achieve a common awareness among employees of the financial and
economic factors affecting the performance of Barclays.
Barclays is also committed to providing employees with opportunities 
to share their views and provide feedback on issues that are important
to them. An annual (bi-annual in the case of BGI) Employee Opinion
Survey is undertaken with results being reported to the Board HR and
Remuneration Committee and all employees. Roadshows and employee
forums also take place. 
In addition, Barclays undertakes regular and formal Group, business unit
and project specific consultations with Amicus, our recognised union in
the UK.
Equality and Diversity
The diversity agenda at Barclays seeks to include customers, colleagues
and suppliers. Our objective is to recruit and retain the best people,
regardless of (but not limited to) race, religion, age, gender, sexual
orientation or disability. We strive to ensure our workforce reflects the
communities in which we operate, and the international nature of the
organisation. We recognise that diversity is a key part of responsible
business strategy in support of our increasingly global business.
Barclays is committed to providing additional support to employees
with disabilities and making it easier for them to inform us of their
specific requirements including the introduction of a dedicated intranet
site. Through our Reasonable Adjustments Scheme, appropriate
assistance can be given, including both physical workplace
adjustments, and relevant training and access to trained mentors is 
also provided for disabled employees. A wide range of recruitment
initiatives have been taken to increase the number of people with
disabilities working in Barclays.
Health and Safety
Barclays is committed to ensuring the health, safety and welfare of our
employees and, so far as is reasonably practicable, to providing and
maintaining safe working conditions. Barclays regards legislative
compliance as a minimum and where appropriate we seek to
implement higher standards. Barclays also recognises its responsibilities
towards all persons on Barclays premises, such as contractors, visitors
and members of the public, and ensures, so far as is reasonably
practicable, that they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.
In 2006 Barclays reviewed its Statement of Commitment which applies
in all business areas in which Barclays has operational control. In this
statement, Barclays commits to:
•
demonstrate personal leadership that is consistent 
with this vision;
• 
provide the appropriate resources to fulfil this commitment;
• 
carry out risk assessments and take appropriate actions 
to mitigate risk;
• 
consult our employees on matters affecting their Health 
and Safety;
• 
ensure that appropriate information, instruction, training 
and supervision are provided;
• 
appoint competent persons to provide specialist advice; and
• 
review Barclays Health and Safety Group Process, and the Statement
of Commitment, at regular intervals. Barclays monitors its health and safety performance using a variety of
measurements on a monthly basis and the Board HR and Remuneration
Committee receives annual reports on health and safety performance
from the Human Resources Director. As part of its Partnership
Agreement with trade union Amicus in the UK, Barclays funds seven
full time Health and Safety Representatives.
Creditors’ Payment Policy
Barclays values its suppliers and acknowledges the importance of
paying invoices, especially those of small businesses, promptly. 
Normal policy is to pay all small business purchases within 30 days. 
It is the Group’s practice to agree terms with suppliers when entering
into contracts. We negotiate with suppliers on an individual basis and
meet our obligations accordingly. The Group does not follow any
specific published code or standard on payment practice.
Paragraph 12(3) of Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1985 requires
disclosure of trade creditor payment days. Disclosure is required by 
the Company, rather than the Group. The Group’s principal trading
subsidiary in the UK is Barclays Bank PLC, the accounts for which are
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards. The components for the trade creditor calculation are not
easily identified. However, by identifying as closely as possible the
components that would be required if Schedule 4 of the Companies Act
applied, the trade creditor payment days for Barclays Bank PLC for 2006
were 28 days (2005: 35 days). This is an arithmetical calculation and
does not necessarily reflect our practice, which is described above, nor
the experience of any individual creditor.
Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies,
including the policy for hedging each major type of forecasted
transaction for which hedge accounting is used, and the exposure to
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk are set out in pages 67 to 94
under the headings, ‘Barclays approach to risk management’, ‘Credit
Risk Management’, ‘Market risk management’, ‘Capital and liquidity risk
management’ and ‘Derivatives’ and in Note 14 and Notes 52 to 57 to 
the accounts.
Events after the Balance Sheet Date
On 19th January 2007 Barclays announced that it entered into an
agreement to purchase EquiFirst Corporation, the non-prime 
mortgage origination business of Regions Financial Corporation, for 
a consideration of approximately US$225m. Completion, which is
subject to receipt of the required licences and applicable regulatory
approval, as well as a post-closing adjustment based on EquiFirst’s
balance sheet at the actual completion date, is expected in the first half
of 2007.
On 8th February 2007 Barclays completed the acquisition of
Indexchange Investment AG from Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank 
for a consideration of approximately ¤240m. 
The Auditors
The Board Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the external
auditors, as well as their relationship with the Group, including monitoring
the Group’s use of the auditors for non-audit services and the balance 
of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditors. More details on this can
be found on pages 121 and 122 and Note 9 to the accounts. Having
reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external auditors,
the Committee has recommended to the Board that the existing auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , be reappointed. PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP have signified their willingness to continue in office and ordinary
resolutions reappointing them as auditors and authorising the Directors
to set their remuneration will be proposed at the 2007 AGM. 
So far as each of the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each of the
Directors has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a
Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of
that information. For these purposes, ‘relevant audit information’ means
information needed by the Company’s auditors in connection with
preparing their report.
The Annual General Meeting
The Barclays PLC AGM will be held at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference
Centre on Thursday 26th April 2007. The Notice of Meeting is included in
a separate document sent to shareholders with this report. A summary

Chairman’s Introduction
I am pleased to present my first Corporate Governance report as
Chairman of Barclays. We report to you below, as we are required to do,
on how we have complied with the UK Combined Code on Corporate
Governance in 2006. Good corporate governance is, however, more
than a mere statement of compliance. It should aim to set the highest
standards which should permeate the entire organisation and
everything it does. Barclays has a strong ethos of corporate governance,
endorsed and upheld by the Board. I see it as a key part of my role as
Chairman to maintain the highest standards of corporate governance
and to ensure that we seek compliance with best practice provisions
wherever possible. I am indebted to my predecessor as Chairman,
Matthew Barrett, for the strong legacy I have inherited. Our corporate
governance framework, published in ‘Corporate Governance in
Barclays’, is a comprehensive statement of our values and how we put
them into practice at Barclays. We review this statement annually to
ensure it remains relevant and current and you can find a copy on our
website at www.investorrelations.barclays.com.
Marcus Agius
Chairman
8th March 2007
Statement from Barclays PLC Board of Directors
For the year ended 31st December 2006, we have complied with the
provisions set out in section 1 of the UK Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code) and applied the principles of the Code as
described below. The Code was revised with effect from 1st November
2006 and the revised Code applies to Barclays with effect from 
1st January 2007. 
Board Structure and Composition
At the date of this report, the Board is comprised of the Chairman, five
executive Directors and nine non-executive Directors. The roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and each has clearly defined
responsibilities. The Chairman’s main role is to lead and manage the
work of the Board to ensure that it operates effectively, provides
appropriate challenge and support for the executive management and
fully discharges its legal and regulatory responsibilities. The Group Chief
Executive is responsible for the day to day management of the Group,
for leading the executive Directors, for recommending strategy to the
Board and for making and implementing operational decisions. The
Chairman’s role is described fully in our ‘Charter of Expectations’, which
sets out the role profile for each of the main positions on the Board,
including the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Senior Independent Director
and Committee Chairmen. The Charter of Expectations can be found at
www.investorrelations.barclays.com.
Our aim is to have a Board that has an appropriate balance of skills and
experience to support our strategy. In line with the recommendations 
of the Code, at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, are
independent non-executive Directors. The current balance between
executive and non-executive Directors is illustrated in the chart. Further
details of the Board’s assessment of the independence of non-executive
Directors can be found on page 119.
Sir Richard Broadbent continued as Senior Independent Director 
during the year. The role of Senior Independent Director is important 
in providing an additional contact for major shareholders and in
monitoring the performance of the Chairman. We have set out what 
we expect of the role in our Charter of Expectations. During 2006, 
Sir Richard met with a number of institutional shareholders and
shareholder bodies to discuss their views on the Group. He also led the
Chairman’s performance evaluation process, consulting with the other
non-executive Directors.
We made a number of changes to the Board during the year. Frits
Seegers joined the Board in July 2006 to head our Global Retail and
Commercial Banking businesses. As part of this realignment of our
operations, we announced that David Roberts would leave the Board 
in late 2006 and that Gary Hoffman had been appointed as Vice-
Chairman. One of Gary’s key responsibilities is leading our corporate
responsibility agenda. In September 2006, we announced that 
Matthew Barrett would retire as Chairman at the end of 2006 and that
Marcus Agius would succeed him as Chairman. Marcus joined the
Board on 1st September 2006 as a non-executive Director. He became
Chairman on 1st January 2007 and was independent on appointment.

Attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings 
All Directors are expected to attend each Board meeting and each
meeting of Board Committees of which they are members, unless 
there are exceptional circumstances that prevent them from doing so.
Meeting dates are generally set well in advance to enable Directors to
manage their other commitments. On the few occasions where a
Director is unable to attend a particular meeting, he or she will usually
discuss the matters to be considered with the Chairman of the meeting
to ensure their views are taken into account. 
All Directors invested the time required in 2006 to discharge their
responsibilities to the Board and, in the case of non-executive Directors,
they each met the time commitment expected of them as set out in our
Charter of Expectations. All Directors, including the Chairman, must
report any material change in their circumstances to the Board for
consideration. Executive Directors are permitted to serve on one other
listed company board in addition to their duties at Barclays and such
appointments must be submitted to the Board for prior approval. 
The significant other commitments of Directors are reported in their
biographies on pages 112 and 113.

Eight full Board meetings took place in 2006 and the table sets out each
Director’s attendance record. The meetings included a full day offsite
meeting, devoted to review and approval of Group strategy. The
Chairman usually meets privately with all the non-executive Directors
prior to each Board meeting to brief them on the business to be
considered and to hear any concerns they may have. Eight such
meetings took place in 2006. In addition to the eight full meetings held
in 2006, two additional Board meetings were held, involving the
Chairman, Group Chief Executive and non-executive Directors only, to
consider the respective appointments of Frits Seegers and Marcus
Agius to the Board. The additional meeting to consider the appointment
of Marcus Agius was chaired by Sir Nigel Rudd.
Fulvio Conti, Chief Executive of Enel SpA, the Italian energy company,
joined the Board in April 2006 and brings to the Board both international
experience and financial expertise; Fulvio was previously Chief Financial
Officer of Enel SpA. Sir David Arculus retired as a non-executive Director
in April 2006, having served for nine years, and Robert Steel resigned
from the Board in October 2006 in order to take up a senior position in
the US Treasury. 
We review the balance and composition of our Board and its principal
Committees regularly to ensure that we have an appropriate balance
and a good mix of skills and experience. We also consider the need to
refresh the Board and Committees. 
Role of the Board 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for creating and sustaining
shareholder value through the management of the Group’s businesses. 
It is also responsible for ensuring that management maintain a system 
of internal control that provides assurance of effective and efficient
operations, internal financial controls and compliance with law and
regulation. The Board is the decision-making body for all matters deemed
material to the Group in strategic, financial and reputational terms. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision,
including the approval of interim and final financial statements,
significant changes in accounting policy and practice, the appointment
or removal of Directors or the Company Secretary, changes to the
Group’s capital structure and major acquisitions, mergers, disposals and
capital expenditure. Further details of the matters reserved to the Board
can be found in the document, ‘Corporate Governance in Barclays’.
Specific responsibilities have been delegated to Board Committees,
which have access to independent expert advice at the Group’s expense.
The terms of reference of our principal Board Committees are available at
www.investorrelations.barclays.com. The principal Board Committees
and their activities during 2006 are described on pages 120 to 123. 
Responsibility for the day to day management of the Group is delegated
to the Group Chief Executive, who is supported by the Group Executive
Committee, which he chairs. The Committee meets weekly to develop
strategies and policies for recommendation to the Board and to

Regular items for Board meetings include the Finance Director’s Report,
the Group Chief Executive’s Report on the key issues affecting the 
Group and operational performance, strategy updates from the main
businesses or functions and reports from each of the principal Board
Committees. Strategy execution updates presented in 2006 included UK
Retail Banking, International Retail and Commercial Banking, Barclays
Capital, Barclaycard, Barclays Global Investors and UK Business Banking.
The Board also received strategy updates from the Chief Information
Officer and a report on the integration of Absa. Updates are also provided
on the Group’s strategy and business in key global regions. The chart sets
out how the Board allocated its time at its meetings during 2006.
It is part of the Chairman’s role to ensure that Directors receive accurate,
timely and clear information about the Group’s performance, to enable
the Board to take sound decisions, to monitor effectively and to provide
advice to promote the success of the Group. The Chairman works
closely with the Company Secretary to ensure that information flows to
Directors promptly. Supporting papers for Board and Board Committee
meetings are generally distributed at least one week in advance of each
meeting. During the year, a Directors’ Intranet was launched, which
enables all Directors to access electronic copies of Board papers,
reports, minutes and other key documents quickly and securely via a
dedicated private network. In addition, all Directors have access to the
services of the Company Secretary and his team, who, amongst other
things, facilitate information requests and meetings for non-executive
Directors with senior management. Independent professional advice is
also available, on request, to all Directors at the Company’s expense. 
Board Effectiveness
We conduct an annual review of the Board’s performance, which covers
the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and individual
Directors. Following the 2005 Board Effectiveness Review, the Board
concluded that it was operating effectively. An action plan was put
together to address those areas where the Board felt that some
improvements could be made. The actions were primarily focused on
ensuring that the Board gained a deeper understanding of the Group’s
competitive position and the health of the customer franchise. As a
result, improvements were made to the competitor monitoring and
customer franchise health reports received by the Board. The Board
Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee monitored the
progress of the action plan during 2006. 
For our 2006 Board Effectiveness Review, we again asked Egon Zehnder
International independently to facilitate the evaluation process. This
took the form of a detailed questionnaire completed by each Director
and supplementary individual interviews, including peer evaluation of
fellow Directors. The results of the evaluation were presented to the
Board in December 2006 and the Board concluded that it continues to
operate effectively. Areas to be covered in the action plan for 2007
include the provision of additional training on risk issues, including risk
management and measurement, and continued work on agenda
management to ensure there is sufficient time for rigorous debate and
exchange of ideas.

Appointment of Directors
The Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee is
responsible for overseeing the process for appointing new Directors 
to the Board and it reports on its activities during 2006 on page 120. 
The process for nominating Directors for appointment is set out in
‘Corporate Governance in Barclays’.
Induction and Training
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction, tailored to their
individual requirements, when they join the Board or a Board
Committee. The induction is arranged by the Company Secretary and
includes training on Directors’ duties and responsibilities in addition 
to meetings with the heads of all the major businesses and functions.
Training is normally delivered over the initial six-month period following
the Director’s appointment. On an ongoing basis, the Company
Secretary facilitates additional training and updates for Directors on
particular issues, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel II. A two-year
programme of business training for non-executive Directors began in
2006, with non-executive Directors attending sessions hosted by
International Retail and Commercial Banking and UK Business Banking.
Further sessions are planned for 2007. 
We also aim to hold some of our Board meetings away from our global
headquarters to allow Directors the opportunity to meet our frontline
staff and to see our operations at first hand. During 2006, a Board
meeting was held at our Barclaycard headquarters in Northampton and
further offsite visits will be made in 2007. In addition, non-executive
Directors are encouraged to make site visits individually or to liaise with
senior management on particular areas of interest.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are required to seek re-election at least every three years 
in accordance with the recommendations of the Code. Sir Nigel Rudd,
who has served on the Board since 1996, seeks re-election annually as
recommended by the Code. Details of Directors proposed for re-election
at the 2007 Annual General Meeting (AGM) are given in the Directors’
Report on page 114 and in the Notice of Meeting, which is included
separately with the Annual Report.
Independence of non-executive Directors
The Code set outs circumstances which may appear relevant to the
Board’s determination of whether a non-executive Director is
independent. The Board has also concluded that the following behaviours
are essential for the Board to consider a Director to be independent and
assesses each non-executive Director against these criteria:
•
Provides objective challenge to management. 
•
Is prepared to challenge others’ assumptions, beliefs or viewpoints
as necessary for the good of the organisation. 
•
Questions intelligently, debates constructively, challenges rigorously
and decides dispassionately. 
•
Is willing to stand up to defend their own beliefs and viewpoints in
order to support the ultimate good of the organisation. 
•
Has a good understanding of the organisation’s businesses and
affairs to enable them to properly evaluate the information and
responses provided by management. 
The Board considers the issue of independence on an annual basis. 
The Board reviewed the independence of non-executive Directors in
February 2007 and concluded that each of them continues to
demonstrate the behaviours it considers to be essential indicators of
independence. In the case of Sir Nigel Rudd, the Board considered the
length of his tenure on the Board when assessing his independence.
However , the Board concluded that he continued to demonstrate the
independent behaviours set out above and that his length of tenure was
actually an aid to his independence, given his knowledge and experience
of the Group. In the case of Dr Danie Cronjé, the Board gave particular
consideration to his position as Chairman of Absa when assessing his independence, but has determined that, as Dr Cronjé demonstrates the
above behaviours, he should be regarded as independent. 
Board Committees
The Board has four principal Board Committees, each of which reports
on its activities below. Board Committee members are appointed by the
Board on the recommendation of the Board Corporate Governance and
Nominations Committee, which reviews the composition of each
Committee regularly. Committee members are expected to attend each
Committee meeting, unless there are exceptional circumstances that
prevent them from doing so. The Company Secretary, Lawrence
Dickinson, is secretary to the Board Audit Committee, Board Corporate
Governance and Nominations Committee and Board Risk Committee
and the Deputy Secretary, Patrick Gonsalves, is Secretary to the Board
HR and Remuneration Committee.

Sir Nigel Rudd during 2006, who stepped down from the Committee 
on 31st December 2006. Sir Richard Broadbent became Chairman on 
1st January 2007. Marcus Agius joined the Committee on 1st January
2007, following the revisions made to the Code to permit the Chairman
of the Board to be a member of the Committee, provided he or she is
independent on appointment. 
The chart shows how the Committee allocated its time at its meetings in
2006. The Committee’s role and its activities during 2006 are described
more fully in the Remuneration report, which can be found on pages 
125 to 140. 
In late 2006, the Committee carried out a review of its effectiveness as
part of the overall Board Effectiveness Review. The review concluded
that the Committee is operating effectively.

The Committee met five times in 2006, including two meetings to deal
exclusively with the appointment of the new Chairman. The table sets
out Committee members’ attendance at meetings in 2006. The
Committee consists of the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman, the Senior
Independent Director and the Chairmen of the main Board Committees.
Other Directors may be appointed by the Board to the Committee,
provided it always has a majority of independent non-executive
Directors, and Sir John Sunderland was appointed to the Committee in
September. The Chairman of the Board chairs the Committee, except
when the Committee is considering the Chairman’s succession, in
which case the Deputy Chairman takes the chair. The Group Chief
Executive, while not a member of the Committee, attends meetings at
the request of the Chairman. Matthew Barrett chaired the Committee
during 2006 until his retirement on 31st December 2006. Marcus Agius
was appointed to the Committee from 1st January 2007 and as
Chairman of the Committee from the same date.
The Committee’s role is set out in its terms of reference, which are
available at www.investorrelations.barclays.com. 
The chart sets out how the Committee allocated its time during 2006.
During 2006, the Committee regularly reviewed Board Committee
composition to ensure that the Committees continued to have strong
and balanced representation. It recommended the appointment of
Fulvio Conti to the Board Audit Committee in order to bring additional
financial expertise to that Committee. It also recommended the
appointment of Sir Richard Broadbent as Chairman of the Board HR and
Remuneration Committee in succession to Sir Nigel Rudd and, following
changes to the Code, recommended the appointment of Marcus Agius
to that Committee. The Committee received regular reports on the
progress of the action plan arising from the 2005 Board Effectiveness
Review and monitored the completion of the actions on behalf of the
Board. It also received updates on changes in corporate governance
best practice and developments in company law, particularly the new
statement of Directors’ Duties contained in the Companies Act 2006.

The main area of focus for the Committee in 2006 was the process of
identifying and appointing a successor to Matthew Barrett as Chairman.
Sir Nigel Rudd led the Committee during this process and he reports on
it separately below. The Committee also received a report from the
Group Chief Executive on executive succession planning. 
In late 2006, the Committee carried out a review of its effectiveness as
part of the overall Board Effectiveness Review. The review concluded
that the Committee continues to operate effectively.

Chairman’s Succession
During 2006, I was tasked with leading the Committee in the process
of selecting and recommending a successor to Matthew Barrett as
Chairman. On behalf of the Committee, I engaged a firm of external
recruitment consultants to identify potential candidates against the
specification for the role set out in the Chairman’s role profile and the
criteria we had established. We particularly wanted candidates with
a good understanding of the financial services industry and proven
ability as Chairman of a large publicly quoted company, whether in
the UK or globally.
The Committee reviewed a short-list of internal and external
candidates. Marcus Agius emerged as the candidate with the
experience and capability to succeed Matthew Barrett as Chairman.
I facilitated a series of meetings between Marcus, the Group Chief
Executive and members of the Committee before the Committee
recommended to the Board that we proceed with his appointment.
Marcus then met with other Directors and I am delighted that the
Board accepted the Committee’s recommendation to appoint him
as Chairman. 
I would like to record my thanks to Matthew Barrett for his
assistance in ensuring a smooth transition to the new leadership
team. In Marcus Agius I believe we have found a worthy successor 
as Chairman. He has a proven track record in financial services and
as Chairman of a major public company and I look forward to
working with him and supporting him in 2007.
Sir Nigel Rudd, DL
Deputy Chairman
8th March 2007
The Committee met eight times in 2006 and the table sets out
Committee members’ attendance. Fulvio Conti was appointed to the
Committee in September and Robert Steel left the Committee on
resigning from the Board in October. Sir Andrew Likierman continued 
in his role as the designated ‘financial expert’ as defined by the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and has ‘recent and relevant financial
experience’ as recommended by the Code. The Board’s assessment 
is based on Sir Andrew’s accounting background and his career with 
HM Treasury, further details of which can be found in his biography 
on page 112. Fulvio Conti, who has held a number of Chief Financial
Officer positions during his career, brings additional, relevant financial
experience to the Committee.
The chart sets out how the Committee allocated its time at its meetings
during 2006.
A typical meeting of the Committee includes a report on control issues
of Group level significance, along with an in-depth review of the control
environment at one of the Group’s major businesses and progress
reports on any particular aspects of the Group’s control environment
that may have been requested by the Committee. It also includes a
report on the non-audit services provided by the auditor, an update on
regulatory compliance issues and any whistleblowing incidents and a
report from the Barclays Director of Internal Audit, including a private
session held without management present. 
Stephen Russell, the Chairman of the Committee, reports on the
Committee’s activities in more detail below.
Board Audit Committee Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report to you on the Committee’s activities in 2006.
We met eight times in 2006. We also met privately with the external
and internal auditors after five of our meetings. 
Our responsibilities as your Board Audit Committee are set out 
in the Committee’s terms of reference, which are available at
www.investorrelations.barclays.com. I have set out below some 
of the key activities of the Committee in 2006.
External Auditors
Our responsibilities include approving and reviewing the appointment
and retirement of the external auditors and overseeing their
relationship with the Group. In late 2006, we carried out our annual
evaluation of the effectiveness of the external auditors, using an
evaluation questionnaire, which was completed by senior members 
of the Finance function. The results of the effectiveness review were
considered at our meeting in February 2007.

13% We also continued to monitor the independence of the external
auditors. We have in place a policy on the provision of non-audit
services by the external auditors and we received regular reports
throughout the year on the nature and amount of the non-audit
services provided. Under the policy, we have agreed which services
the external auditors are allowed to carry out on behalf of the Group
and which ones they are prohibited from doing. Prohibited services
include bookkeeping or other services related to the Group’s
accounting records or financial statements, financial information
systems design and implementation, internal audit outsourcing,
management functions or other secondments, human resource
functions, legal and expert services and tax services that involve
advocacy. Any allowable non-audit services require the pre-approval
of the Committee or a member of the Committee before they can be
carried out. For these allowable services, the Committee has pre-
approved all assignments where the expected fee does not exceed
£100,000, or £10,000 in the case of certain taxation services,
although such assignments must be reported to the next meeting of
the Committee. Any assignment where the expected fee is above the
relevant threshold requires specific approval from the Committee.
Where any service requires approval from the Committee,
management must give details of the other potential providers that
were considered. A breakdown of the fees paid to the external
auditors during the year is set out on page 171. 
For the year ended 31st December 2006, we concluded that the
external auditors remain independent and are effective. We have
therefore recommended to the Board that it proposes the
reappointment of the external auditors to shareholders at the 
2007 AGM. 
Relationship with internal audit and monitoring control issues
As part of our task of monitoring the effectiveness of the internal
audit function, the Director of Internal Audit, who has a functional
reporting line to the Committee, attended six Committee meetings in
2006. I received a monthly report from the Director of Internal Audit,
which covered key performance indicators and a trend analysis of
internal audit findings. At four Committee meetings in 2006, we
reviewed the progress of the internal audit plan and in December we
held a separate meeting to consider and agree the internal audit plan
for 2007. 
Throughout the year, we regularly reviewed the level of resources
allocated to the internal audit function to ensure that the internal
audit plan could be delivered as part of our overall monitoring of the
effectiveness of the internal audit function.
During the year, we reviewed regular reports on control issues of
Group level significance, including details of any remediation action
being taken. We also received a number of in-depth reports from
some of the Group’s main business areas and functions on their
control environment, with presentations from Absa, UK Retail
Banking, Barclaycard, Barclays Wealth and the Chief Information
Office. Our aim is to review in detail the control environment at each
of the Group’s main businesses and operations over a rolling two-year
period. In addition, in 2006 we undertook a wider overall review of the
Group’s Control Environment, including consideration of key trends
over the past three years.
Financial Reporting
We reviewed the Group’s annual and interim financial statements
and trading updates, including reviewing the effectiveness of the
Group’s disclosure controls and procedures and systems of internal
control as appropriate.

The Committee met four times in 2006 and the table sets out

The role of the Committee is to review and to recommend to the Board
the Group’s overall risk appetite, setting limits for individual types of risk,
including credit and market risk. The Committee also considers material
changes to risk appetite and monitors the Group’s risk profile, including
risk trends and concentrations, loan impairment experience against
budget and key performance indicators for risk. The Committee also
seeks assurance that the principal risks facing the Group have been
properly identified and are being appropriately managed. In order to
assess the effectiveness of the Group’s risk control framework, the
Committee regularly reviews the Group’s risk measurement systems
and receives reports from management confirming that they have
reviewed the Group’s risk control standards. The Committee is also
We also monitored throughout the year the Group’s preparations for
reporting under s404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, under
which the external auditors need to attest to the effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of internal controls over financial reporting. 
We received a progress report at each of our meetings on the status
of the Group’s preparations for s404.
For the disclosures made in the 2006 Annual Report, we reviewed
the report of the Disclosure Committee and the Turnbull attestations
made by all Business Heads, and have concluded and reported to 
the Board for its approval that the Group has maintained effective
disclosure controls and procedures and that management has
continued to operate an effective system of internal control. 
Regulatory Compliance and Whistleblowing Procedures
We reviewed the arrangements established by management for
compliance with the requirements of the Group’s regulators,
receiving a semi-annual report on compliance issues. In particular
this year we have spent time reviewing the Group’s controls over
fraud and financial crime and are responsible for reviewing the 
fraud risk control framework annually. We also reviewed the 
Group’s sanctions compliance arrangements during the year.
We received regular reports on the effectiveness of the Group’s
whistleblowing arrangements, as well as reports on any specific
instances of whistleblowing. We are responsible for reviewing the
Group’s whistleblowing process annually.
Committee Effectiveness
In late 2006, we carried out a review of our effectiveness as part of
the overall Board Effectiveness Review. The review concluded that
the Committee continues to operate effectively.

During 2006, the Committee reviewed the Group’s preparations for
Basel II, receiving a report on progress at each meeting. It also reviewed
key risk issues, including an in-depth review of the Group’s personal
lending impairment experience and received presentations on tax risk
and the credit control environment in our UK Business Banking
operations. The Committee also reviewed the comparative risk stance
taken by the Group in particular risk areas, such as mortgage

Statement on US Corporate Governance standards
As a non-US company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange (NYSE),
we are exempt from most of the NYSE’s Corporate Governance rules
(the NYSE Rules), which domestic US companies must follow. However,
we are subject to the NYSE rules requiring us to have a Board Audit
Committee that meets the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the US
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and we must provide an Annual
Written Affirmation to the NYSE of our compliance with the applicable
NYSE Rules. Furthermore, under NYSE Rule 303.A.11, we are required 
to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance
practices differ from those followed by domestic US companies listed 
on the NYSE. 
As our main listing is on the London Stock Exchange, we follow the UK’s
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) adopted by the
Financial Reporting Council. Key differences between the NYSE Rules
and the Code are set out below: 
Director independence
Under the NYSE Rules the majority of the Board should be independent.
Under the Code, at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) is
required to be independent. The NYSE Rules contain detailed tests for
determining Director independence, whereas the Code requires the
Board to determine whether each Director is independent in character
and judgement and sets out criteria that may be relevant to that
determination. We follow the Code’s recommendations as well as
developing best practices among other UK public companies. Our Board
annually reviews the independence of our non-executive Directors,
taking into account the guidance in the Code and the criteria we have
established for determining independence, which are described on 
page 119.

Board Committees
We have a Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee
and a Board HR and Remuneration (rather than Compensation)
Committee, both of which are broadly comparable in purpose and
constitution to those required by the NYSE Rules and whose terms of
reference comply with the Code’s requirements. Beyond the fact that
the Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee is
chaired by the Chairman of the Board and that, from 1st January 2007,
the Chairman is a member of the Board HR and Remuneration
Committee, both of which are permitted by the revised Code, both
Committees are composed solely of non-executive Directors whom 
the Board has determined to be independent. We follow the Code
recommendation that a majority of the Nominations Committee should
be independent non-executive Directors, whereas the NYSE Rules state
that the Committee must be composed entirely of independent
Directors. We comply with the NYSE Rules regarding the obligation to
have a Board Audit Committee that meets the requirements of Rule
10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act, including the requirements
relating to the independence of Committee members. In April 2006, 
we made an Annual Written Affirmation of our compliance with these
requirements to the NYSE. The Code also requires us to have a Board
Audit Committee comprised solely of independent non-executive
Directors. We follow the Code recommendations, rather than the 
NYSE Rules, however, regarding the responsibilities of the Board Audit
Committee, although both are broadly comparable. We also have a
Board Risk Committee, comprised of independent non-executive
Directors, which considers and discusses policies with respect to risk
assessment and risk management. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The NYSE Rules require domestic US companies to adopt and 
disclose corporate governance guidelines. There is no equivalent
recommendation in the Code. The Board Corporate Governance 
and Nominations Committee has, however, developed corporate
governance guidelines, entitled ‘Corporate Governance in Barclays’,
which have been approved and adopted by the Board. 
Code of Ethics
The NYSE Rules require that domestic US companies adopt and disclose
a code of business conduct and ethics for Directors, officers and
employees. Rather than a single consolidated code as envisaged in the
NYSE Rules, we have a number of ‘values based’ business conduct and
ethics policies, which apply to all employees. In addition, we have
adopted a Code of Ethics for the Group Chief Executive and senior
financial officers as required by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
Shareholder approval of equity-compensation plans
The NYSE listing standards require that shareholders must be given the
opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material
revisions to those plans. We comply with UK requirements, which are
similar to the NYSE standards. The Board, however, does not explicitly
take into consideration the NYSE’s detailed definition of what are
considered ‘material revisions’. 
Relations with Shareholders
We take a proactive approach to communicating with our 750,000
institutional and private shareholders. Senior executives hold meetings
with our key institutional shareholders to discuss strategy, financial
performance and investment activities in the UK, throughout Europe
and in the US. The Chairman meets regularly with investor bodies and
investors to discuss our approach to corporate governance issues. 
In November 2006, we held a corporate governance event for key
institutional investors, the second such event, whose purpose is to
update our major shareholders on our corporate governance practices Corporate governance
Corporate governance report
and to discuss any issues that may have arisen. In addition, investor
bodies and major investors are given the opportunity to meet with new
non-executive Directors on their appointment. Sir Richard Broadbent,
the Senior Independent Director, is available to meet with investors if
they are unable to resolve issues through the normal channels of the
Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
To ensure that all Directors, and in particular, non-executive Directors,
have a full understanding of the opinions of our major shareholders, an
external consultant conducts an annual audit of investor opinion, the
results of which are presented to the Board. Non-executive Directors
also receive copies of analysts’ reports on the Group and are invited to
attend results presentations to analysts.
We aim to provide a first-class service to private shareholders to help
them in the effective and efficient management of their shareholding.
The main methods of communicating with private shareholders are the
Annual Report, the Annual Review, the dividend mailings and the AGM.
We have continued to encourage shareholders to hold their shares in
Barclays Sharestore, where their shares are held electronically in a cost
effective environment. Our e-view service enables shareholders to
receive their documents electronically. It also gives shareholders
immediate access to information relating to their personal shareholding
and dividend history. Participants can also change their details and
dividend mandates online and receive dividend tax vouchers
electronically. 
Annual General Meeting
All Directors are encouraged to attend the AGM and be available to
answer shareholders’ questions. All Directors attended the 2006 AGM.
It has been our practice for a number of years that all resolutions are
voted on a poll to ensure that the views of all shareholders are reflected
proportionately. Each of the resolutions considered at the 2006 AGM
was decided on a poll and a copy of the poll results is available at
www.investorrelations.barclays.com. The resolutions to be considered
at our 2007 AGM will also be decided on a poll and the results will be
made available on our website on 27th April 2007.

Remuneration report
Statement from the Chairman of the Board HR and
Remuneration Committee (the Committee) 
The Committee provides governance and strategic oversight of Barclays
Human Resource activities with particular emphasis on remuneration
and senior management development.
The Committee meets a minimum of four times a year. Sir David Arculus
left the Committee during 2006 and Sir Nigel Rudd stepped down as
Chairman at the end of 2006 when I was appointed Chairman. Marcus
Agius became a member of the Committee from 1st January 2007. All
other Committee members are independent non-executive Directors.
In addition to its regular business the Committee also focused on:
•
developing a compensation strategy for Global Retail and
Commercial Banking in addition to keeping under review the
existing compensation strategies for Barclays Capital, BGI and
Barclays Wealth;
•
reviewing and developing policies to manage the governance of
Barclays pension plans;
•
in-depth monitoring of the development of senior talent in all
businesses; and
•
strengthening the linkage of performance and remuneration across
the businesses, particularly in respect of annual bonuses.
As part of its regular business, the Committee considers share-based
plans. This includes, since its approval at the 2000 AGM, the Barclays
Global Investors Equity Ownership Plan (BGI EOP). The BGI EOP and its
operation have been disclosed in our financial statements since that
time. This year, we have expanded our reporting further by including an
overview of the BGI EOP’s operation.
The Committee takes seriously its commitment to clear and
comprehensive disclosure. The majority of this report details the
remuneration of the individual Directors who served Barclays in 2006.
Important context to this report and the disclosures that follow is
provided below:
•
Barclays performed very strongly in 2006 with profit before tax
(PBT) up 35% and economic profit (EP) up 54%. This performance
has been recognised in the remuneration decisions at all levels
coupled with strong performance differentiation.
•
The performance of Barclays Capital, BGI and Barclays Wealth was
particularly strong, enabling the double benefit of delivering
competitive bonus levels and providing an increased share of profit
to shareholders, evidenced by compensation ratios reducing
relative to 2005 and in line with the lower end of the market range.
•
In the course of 2006, the Committee approved significant 
numbers of strategic hires, including at Board level, ensuring their
remuneration was in line with the appropriate marketplace. It did
this alongside its active oversight of Barclays talent agenda.
Barclays Remuneration Policy remains unchanged, including the
commitment to transparency and to policies and programmes that
serve well the interests of shareholders.
The Committee unanimously recommends that you vote to approve the
report at the 2007 AGM.
Signed on behalf of the Board
Sir Richard Broadbent
Chairman, Board HR and Remuneration Committee
8th March 2007 •
promote attention to maximising personal contribution,
contribution to the business in which the individual works and
contribution to the Group overall; and
•
ensure, both internally and externally, that remuneration policies
and programmes are transparent, well communicated, easily
understood and aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The graph below shows the value, at 31st December 2006, of £100
invested in Barclays on 31st December 2001 compared with the value 
of £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index. The other points plotted are 
the values at intervening financial year ends. The FTSE 100 Index is the
index of the 100 largest UK quoted companies by market capitalisation.
It is a widely recognised performance comparison for large UK
companies such as Barclays and this is why it has been chosen as a
comparator to illustrate Barclays TSR growth. The graph shows that, 
at the end of 2006, a hypothetical £100 invested in Barclays on 
31st December 2001 would have generated a total return of £58,
compared with a gain of £41 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index. Barclays,
therefore, outperformed the FTSE 100 Index for this period.
Source: Datastream
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 requires that the graph shows TSR for
the five years ending with the relevant financial year.
Reward for executive Directors
Reward for the executive Directors and other senior executives
comprises:
• 
base salary;
• 
annual bonus including mandatory deferral into Barclays shares
through the Executive Share Award Scheme (ESAS);
• 
long-term incentives through the Performance Share Plan (PSP);
and
• 
pension and other benefits.
The Committee reviews the elements of reward relative to the policies
above and to the practice of other comparable organisations. Reward is
benchmarked against the markets in which we compete for talent. This
includes benchmarking against other leading international banks and
financial services organisations, and other companies of similar size to
Barclays in the FTSE 100 Index.
The component parts for each executive Director are detailed in the
tables accompanying this report.
All the executive Directors meet the Committee’s guideline that, as a
minimum, they should hold the equivalent of 1x their base salary in
Barclays shares, including shares held under award through ESAS.

Board HR and Remuneration Committee Members
The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive
Directors during 2006:
Sir Nigel Rudd (Chairman until 31st December 2006)
Sir Richard Broadbent (Chairman from 1st January 2007)
Leigh Clifford
Sir John Sunderland
Sir David Arculus (resigned 27th April 2006)
The Committee members were considered by the Board to be
independent of management and free from any business or other
relationship that could materially affect the exercise of their independent
judgement. The constitution and operation of the Committee complies
with the Provisions on the Design of Performance Related Remuneration
in the Combined Code adopted by the Financial Reporting Council.
Marcus Agius was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect
from 1st January 2007.
The Chairman of the Committee presents a report of each meeting to
the full Board.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has access to independent consultants to ensure that it
receives independent advice. Advisers are appointed by the Committee
for specific work, as necessary, and are required to disclose to the
Committee any potential conflict of interest. 
In 2006, Kepler Associates
(a)
were reappointed by the Committee to
provide independent advice to Committee members on remuneration
matters. Kepler Associates also supplied supporting valuation data for
Barclays share-based payments processes.
The Chairman of the Board (from 1st January 2007 a member of the
Committee itself), the Group Chief Executive, the Human Resources
Director and, as necessary, members of the Executive Committee, 
also advise the Committee, supported by their teams. They are not
permitted to participate in discussions or decisions relating to their 
own remuneration. The Human Resources Director is responsible for
providing professional support to line management in HR policy and
operations and for monitoring compliance with prescribed policy and
programmes across Barclays. The Human Resources Director is not a
Board Director and is not appointed by the Committee.
Remuneration Policy
Barclays policy is to use reward to drive a high-performance culture.
Executive Directors can expect outstanding reward if performance is
outstanding and below median reward for below median performance.
This philosophy applies to reward policies and practices for all
employees in the Group. The Committee considers reward levels across
the Group when determining remuneration for executive Directors.
The aims of Barclays remuneration policy are to:
•
incentivise excellence in and balance between both short-term 
(one year) and longer-term (three years plus) performance such
that Group financial goals and the goal of achieving top quartile
total shareholder return (TSR) are met and sustained;
•
enable the Group to attract and retain people of proven ability,
experience and skills in the pools in which we compete for talent;
•
encourage behaviour consistent with Barclays Guiding Principles
(b)
which leads to excellence and the appropriate balance in financial
performance, governance, controls, risk management, customer
service, people management, brand and reputation management;

Each element of reward is important and has a specific role in achieving the aims of the remuneration policy. The combined potential remuneration
from bonus and PSP outweighs the other elements, and is subject to performance conditions, thereby placing the majority of total reward at risk.

Changes to Chairman and executive Directors
Matthew Barrett retired as Chairman on 31st December 2006. 
Matthew Barrett was succeeded by Marcus Agius, who was appointed
as a non-executive Director with effect from 1st September 2006 and
Chairman with effect from 1st January 2007.
As a non-executive Director, Marcus Agius received an annual fee of
£65,000 (pro rata) with effect from 1st September 2006. From 
1st January 2007, on becoming Chairman, Marcus Agius receives a fee
of £750,000 (inclusive of director’s fees). He is also eligible for private
health insurance. The minimum time commitment is equivalent to 60%
of a full time role. Marcus Agius is not eligible to participate in Barclays
bonus and share incentive plans, nor will he participate in Barclays
pension plans or receive any pension contributions. The service contract
provides for a notice period of 12 months from the Group or six months
from Marcus Agius.
Frits Seegers was appointed as an executive Director with effect from
10th July 2006. The key terms of the executive Directors’ service
contracts are set out on pages 130 and 131.
David Roberts ceased to be an executive Director on 31st December
2006. Payments to David Roberts in respect of the termination of his
service contract are shown in note (i) on page 133.
Naguib Kheraj will cease to be an executive Director on 31st March
2007. Naguib Kheraj will be succeeded by Chris Lucas, who has been
appointed to the position of Group Finance Director with effect from 
1st April 2007.
From 1st April 2007, on becoming an executive Director, Chris Lucas’
base salary will be £600,000 per annum. The Committee will, in line with
usual practice, determine the size of any annual performance bonus,
dependent on both business and individual performance. For 2007, a
guaranteed performance bonus has been agreed, comprising a cash
bonus of £450,000 and a recommended ESAS award over shares with 
a value of £150,000, in total £600,000. This will be recommended in
March 2008. The Committee will, in line with usual practice, determine
the size of awards of performance shares to be made each year under
PSP . The 2007 PSP award will be recommended to be made as soon as
practicable after Chris Lucas’ start date for an initial allocation of
£600,000. In addition, an ESAS award over shares with a value of
£500,000 will be recommended as soon as practicable after Chris
Lucas’ start date. This ESAS award would normally vest 50% after one
year and the remainder after two years (bonus shares are not applicable
to this award). This award is in recognition of forfeited remuneration.
Chris Lucas will be eligible to participate in the following benefits: life
cover, use of company car or cash equivalent, medical insurance and 
the ill-health income plan. In addition, Chris Lucas will receive a cash
allowance of 25% of his annual base salary in lieu of pension
contributions.
The service contract provides for a notice period of 12 months from the
Group or six months from Chris Lucas. On termination, the service
contract provides for a pro-rated phased payment of his notice
entitlement and Chris Lucas has an explicit duty to mitigate his loss.
Base Salary
The annual base salaries for the current executive Directors are shown
in the table below:
Date of 
As at As at previous
31st Dec 2006 1st April 2007 increase
John Varley £900,000 £1,000,000 1st Apr 2006

Gary Hoffman £625,000 £625,000 1st Apr 2006
Naguib Kheraj £700,000 £700,000 1st Apr 2006
Frits Seegers £700,000 £700,000 n/a
In respect of John Varley, having regard to levels of salary and total
compensation in comparable organisations, the Committee approved
an increase to his base salary effective 1st April 2007.
Annual Bonus and ESAS
75% of the annual bonus is delivered as cash. The remaining 25% is
recommended as a provisional allocation of shares under ESAS. The
maximum bonus opportunity is tailored to the relevant market; this is
typically 250% of base salary.
The annual bonus is based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment
of performance (including EP and PBT results) with the quantitative
assessment comprising the majority. EP and PBT are considered to be
good measures of value creation to shareholders.
ESAS is a deferred share award plan in which awards are initially granted
in the form of a provisional allocation that does not give rise to any
entitlement to the shares. The value of mandatory bonus deferrals
under ESAS is subject to the same Group and individual performance
criteria as the annual cash bonus. A mandatory ESAS award comprises
shares with a value of 25% of the annual bonus plus an additional
element for bonus shares which is approximately equal to 30% of the
25% of the bonus that has been deferred. Normally, the trustees of ESAS
will permit the executive to call for the shares from the end of the third
year from grant of an award by granting a right to acquire shares (a nil
cost option) exercisable for two years. As this nil cost option is part of
the structure of an ESAS award and as ESAS is a deferred share award
plan, it would not be appropriate to attach a performance condition to
the exercise of these options. If the right is not exercised, the trustees of
ESAS will normally, at the end of the fifth year, release all of the shares,
including bonus shares equal to 30% of the basic award. If the right is
exercised, an executive may lose the opportunity of receiving one-third
of the bonus shares. If an executive ceases to be employed he may
forfeit his award depending on why he leaves. An award under ESAS
may be forfeited if the executive resigns and commences employment
with a competitor business.
In addition, eligible executives may request that all or part of the cash
bonus to which they would otherwise become entitled be granted as 
an additional award under ESAS called Voluntary ESAS. An award under
Voluntary ESAS will be granted as a right to acquire shares which will
become fully exercisable after five years. The number of shares under
any award will reflect the value of the amount waived together with a
number of bonus shares representing 30% of the amount waived.
PSP
PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM. PSP replaced the
Incentive Share Option Plan (ISOP) in 2005 as the principal long-term
incentive plan. Performance shares are an award of ‘free’ Barclays shares
in the form of a provisional allocation for which no exercise price is
payable and which qualify for dividend shares. Performance share
awards are communicated to participants as an initial allocation. This
initial allocation is the ‘expected value’ of the award and is up to the
higher of 150% of base salary or 75% of base salary and target annual
bonus. Barclays performance over a three-year period determines the
final number of shares that may be released to participants. After three
Corporate governance
Remuneration report years the trustee considers the release of performance shares based on
the outcome of two performance conditions, EP and TSR. Note that:
•
Before any shares are released, Barclays cumulative EP over the
performance period must normally be greater than the total for the
previous three-year period. 
•
For PSP awards made in 2005, the award depends on Barclays TSR
relative to a peer group of 11 other international banks.
•
For PSP awards made in 2006, 50% of each award depends on
Barclays EP and 50% of each award depends on Barclays TSR relative
to a peer group of 11 other international banks. 
•
For the TSR element of the award, there is no vesting unless Barclays 
is ranked above median on relative TSR.
•
The performance conditions for PSP awards made in 2006 will be
measured over the three-year performance period (2006 to 2008).
•
Relative TSR and EP are both considered to be good measures of
value creation to shareholders. 
The peer group for the 2006 award, as for the 2005 award, is:

ISOP
ISOP has not been used for awards to executive Directors since 2004.
Details of ISOP can be found on page 139. Awards in 2003 and 2004
under ISOP include financial metrics or thresholds. These were adjusted
where necessary to neutralise the effect of the introduction of IFRS.
The main performance condition is TSR relative to a peer group of 
11 other major international banks, combined with an EP threshold.
The peer group for the 2003 and 2004 ISOP was: Abbey National, ABN
Amro, BBV A, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HBOS, HSBC,
Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered.
Retained Incentive Opportunity
Robert E Diamond Jr retains an opportunity to be considered for an 
award in February 2008 up to a maximum value of £14.85m, subject 
to performance criteria based on the delivery of EP at Barclays Capital 
over the period 2005 to 2007. EP was chosen as this is an appropriate
measure to align the interests of the participant with those of
shareholders and is a good measure of value creation for shareholders.
Details of the award are provided on page 137.
Sharesave
All eligible employees including executive Directors may participate in
Sharesave. Sharesave is an HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs)
approved all-employee share option plan. HMRC does not permit
performance conditions to be attached to the exercise of Sharesave
options. Under Sharesave, participants are granted options over
Barclays shares. Each participant may save up to £250 per month to
purchase Barclays shares at a discount. For the 2006 grant, the discount
was 20% of the market value of a share at the time the option was
granted. Sharesave is also offered to employees in Spain and Ireland.
Following the 2006 invitation, a total of 41,371 employees in the UK,
Spain and Ireland were participants in Sharesave with 79 million shares
under option.
Sharepurchase
Sharepurchase was introduced in January 2002. It is an HMRC 
approved all-employee share plan. Sharepurchase is open to all eligible
employees including executive Directors. Under Sharepurchase,
participants are able to purchase up to £1,500 worth of Barclays shares
each year, which, if kept in trust for five years, can be withdrawn 
from Sharepurchase tax-free. Any shares in Sharepurchase will earn
dividends in the form of additional shares, which must normally be held
by the trustee on behalf of the participant for no less than three years.

To encourage employee ownership of Barclays shares, Barclays
matches, share for share, up to the first £600 each employee invests in
Sharepurchase in each tax year. Matching shares must normally be held
by the trustee on behalf of the participant for no less than three years.
At 31st December 2006, 19,619 employees were participants in
Sharepurchase, with a total of 9.7 million shares held on their behalf by
the Sharepurchase trustee.
Dilution Limits
The outstanding awards under ISOP and Sharesave are intended to be
satisfied by the issue of new Barclays shares or through treasury shares
within the limits agreed by shareholders when these plans were
approved. These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers’
guidelines restricting dilution from employee share plans. The overall
limits under the guidelines are that no more than 10% of a company’s
issued share capital may be used in any ten-year period. Up to 5% may
be used for executive share plans. Shares in Barclays Global Investors 
UK Holdings Limited issued as a result of option exercises under the
BGI EOP also count towards these limits. As at 31st December 2006,
Barclays headroom under these limits, i.e. the amount remaining
available for issue, was 3.3% and 1.2% respectively.
Employees’ Benefit Trusts (EBTs)
The trustees of the Barclays EBTs grant awards under ESAS and PSP 
over existing Barclays shares which they have purchased in the market.
The trustees of the Barclays EBTs have informed the Bank that their
normal policy is to abstain from voting in respect of the Barclays shares
held in trust.
Pensions
All Group pension arrangements are managed in accordance with 
the Global Retirement Fund Governance Framework to ensure best
practice in respect of regulatory compliance, governance, investment
and administration. The framework is overseen by the Committee.
Pension benefits for executive Directors are provided through defined
benefit plans, defined contribution plans, unfunded unapproved
retirement benefit arrangements or a combination of these. The
pension benefit applicable will depend on the date an executive Director
was appointed and their individual situation. Annual performance
related bonuses are not included in pensionable salary. 
The Group’s closed UK defined benefit pension arrangement, of which
John Varley, Gary Hoffman and David Roberts are members, is a non-
contributory scheme. Benefits are provided on leaving service at normal
pension age (60) by reference to the executive Director’s length of
service, normally by reference to 1/60th of pensionable salary for each
year of pensionable service (John Varley’s pension accrual is provided
through the scheme in accordance with his service contract as set out 
in the notes to the pensions table on page 134).
The Group’s closed UK defined benefit pension arrangement also
provides that, in the event of death before retirement, a cash lump sum
of up to four times salary is paid together with a dependant’s pension 
of 50% of the pension that would have been payable had the member
remained in active service until their normal pension age. For death in
retirement, a dependant’s pension is payable of approximately 50% 
of the member’s pension at the date of death, not taking into account
commutation of any cash lump sum at the time of the member’s
retirement. If a member is granted a deferred pension that has not yet
come into payment, the widow/widower receives a pension of 50% of
the deferred pension payable. Where applicable, children’s pensions are
payable, usually up to the age of 18. Enhanced benefits may be payable
if it is determined that a member is unable to work as a result of serious
ill-health.
The Group’s US non-contributory defined benefit arrangement, of
which Robert E Diamond Jr is a member, provides a benefit at age 65 
of 1/60th of final average pensionable pay plus 0.3% of final average
pensionable pay in excess of the US Internal Revenue Service’s covered
compensation limit for each year of pensionable service (up to a
maximum of 30 years). In line with current market practice, final
average pay in the US includes an element of bonus subject to overall
plan limits. In the event of a member’s death before retirement, a
spouse’s pension of approximately 50% of the member’s pension had
the member taken early retirement on the date of death, is payable. 
On death after retirement, a spouse’s pension of 50% of the pension in
payment is payable. In addition, enhanced benefits are payable if the
member qualifies for disability benefits. 
The US Restoration Plan, of which Robert E Diamond Jr is also a member,
is an unfunded unapproved arrangement which restores reductions in
the benefits provided through the approved US plan resulting from the
application of relevant compensation and benefit limitations under the
US Internal Revenue Code. Robert E Diamond Jr participates in this plan
on similar terms to other Barclays senior executives participating in US
benefit plans. 
Robert E Diamond Jr also participates in the Barclays Bank PLC 401K
Thrift Savings Plan and Thrift Restoration Plan on similar terms to other
Barclays senior executives in the US. 
Where appropriate, cash allowances are provided to executive Directors
in lieu of being able to join a Group pension arrangement. Both Naguib
Kheraj and Frits Seegers receive such cash allowances.
In the event that an executive Director builds up pension benefits close
to, or in excess of, the HMRC Lifetime Allowance, the executive Director
is eligible to opt for a cash allowance instead of continued pension
accrual. The allowance given is no more than the cost of funding the
existing pension benefit. 
Service Contracts
The Group has service contracts with its Chairman and executive
Directors. The effective dates of the contracts for the Chairman and
executive Directors who served during 2006 are shown in the table
on page 131. The service contracts do not have a fixed term but provide
for a notice period from the Group of one year and normally 
for retirement at age 65, except for David Roberts and Naguib Kheraj
who are leaving the Group. The Committee’s policy is that executive
Directors’ contracts should allow for termination with contractual
notice from the Group, except in circumstances of gross misconduct
when notice is not given.
The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event 
of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances
including the reason for termination, contractual obligations and share
and pension plan rules.
Payments in the event of termination are also subject to mitigation if
alternative employment is found during any period of pay in lieu of notice.

Barclays Capital, BGI and Barclays Wealth
The Committee has established frameworks for the governance 
of remuneration in these businesses. Ranges have been set for 
key financial and compensation ratios such as operating margin,
operating costs to net revenue, compensation to pre-compensation
profit before tax and bonus expenditure as a percentage of pre-bonus
profits. The Committee approves aggregate bonus and long-term
incentive expenditure, and strategic investment for new hires. The
Committee also approves individual compensation for the members of
the management teams, and any employee with total compensation in
excess of £750,000.
The BGI EOP
BGI is Barclays asset management business headquartered in San
Francisco. The BGI EOP was approved by shareholders at Barclays 2000
AGM to provide the employee share incentive arrangements required to
recruit and retain the quality of senior management and investment
talent appropriate for building a global investment management
business. The BGI EOP was designed to provide participants with a long-
term equity interest in BGI to meet the expectations of, in particular , 
BGI’s key investment talent in the United States, who could expect to
participate in the equity of their employer . Under the terms of the BGI
EOP , options are granted at fair value to key BGI employees over shares in
Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited (BGI Holdings) within an
overall cap of 20% of the issued ordinary share capital of BGI Holdings.
All grants of options are approved by the Committee. The Committee is
also advised of option exercises and share sales by employees. Directors
of Barclays PLC are not eligible to receive options under the BGI EOP .
In summary the BGI EOP operates as follows:
•
Certain key BGI employees are granted options over shares in 
BGI Holdings.
•
The option exercise price is based on the fair value of a BGI Holdings
share at the date of grant determined by an independent appraiser.
•
The options generally vest evenly over a three-year period and can
be exercised in two annual exercise windows.
•
Option holders are required to fund the exercise without any
financial support from any member of the Barclays Group.
Once employees become shareholders, they are subject to the Articles
of BGI Holdings under which:
•
Shareholders are required to hold the shares for a minimum of 355
days. As shareholders, employees derive the full risks and rewards of
ownership, including voting rights and entitlement to any ordinary
dividends paid by BGI Holdings.
•
On expiry of the minimum holding period, shareholders may, but are
not obliged to, offer their shares for sale during two annual sales
windows.
•
Barclays Bank PLC, at its discretion, has a right to purchase shares so
offered, but is not obliged to do so.
The table below contains information of the number of shares in BGI
Holdings over which options were granted, outstanding and exercised
in 2005 and 2006:
Number Number
granted outstanding Number
during year at year end exercised
Year (000s) (000s) (000s)
2005 2,360 5,442 4,368
2006 3,973 6,929 2,188
In 2006 BGI employees exercised options over 2.2m (2005: 4.4m)
shares for consideration of £44m (2005: £49m); Barclays Bank PLC
purchased 4.9m (2005: 3.4m) shares offered for sale by shareholders 
for consideration of £410m (2005: £160m). As at 31st December 2006,
employees own 9.4% of BGI Holdings (2005: 12.1%).
BGI EOP – Accounting and disclosure
The BGI EOP is accounted for as an equity settled share-based payment
in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. The fair value of the
services received from the employees is measured by reference to the
fair value of the share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost
of the employee services received in respect of the share options
granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that the
services are received. The cost for 2006 of £37.4m (2005: £14.9m,
2004: £10.5m) is included in staff costs in Note 8 to the accounts. In
accordance with IFRS 2, details of share options granted and exercised,
together with weighted average fair values at grant date and weighted
average exercise prices are set out in Note 51 to the accounts. In
accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’, unexercised options are
taken into account in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as 
set out in Note 11 to the accounts.
For Group reporting, the exercise of options by employees is treated as 
a deemed disposal of interests in a subsidiary , as its holding in the
subsidiary has been reduced for the consideration represented by the
exercise price. Any subsequent purchase of shares offered for sale by
employees is treated as a purchase of an additional investment in a
subsidiary entity . The cash flows relating to these capital transactions are
included in the Consolidated cash flow statement and disclosed, along
with other disposals and acquisitions, in Notes 43 and 44 to the accounts
respectively and related movements in goodwill and minority interests
are included in Notes 23 and 38 to the accounts respectively .
Notes
(a) Details of executive Directors standing for re-election at the 2007 AGM are set out on page 116.
(b) Matthew W Barrett retired on 31st December 2006, David Roberts ceased to be a Director on 31st December 2006 and Frits Seegers was appointed as an executive
Director on 10th July 2006.
(c) There was no formal retirement date under Matthew W Barrett’s contract. However, his pension may not commence later than 20th September 2019 (age 75).
(d) One year’s contractual remuneration is calculated as follows: 12 months’ base salary, bonus, if eligible (being the average of the previous three years’ bonus awards, in
some cases (Gary Hoffman, Naguib Kheraj and David Roberts) capped at 100% of base salary), medical benefit (while an employee) and continuation of pension
benefits. Payments in the event of termination are subject to mitigation if alternative employment is found during any period of pay in lieu of notice. Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 132
Non-executive Directors
The Board determines the fees of non-executive Directors and the fees
are reviewed annually. The fee structure as at 31st December 2006 is
shown below.
Base fee £65,000
Plus:
Chairman of Board Audit Committee £50,000
Chairman of the Board HR and Remuneration Committee £40,000
Chairman of Board Risk Committee £30,000
Members of the Board Audit Committee £20,000
Members of the following Board Committees: 
Risk, HR and Remuneration and
Corporate Governance and Nominations £15,000
As Deputy Chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd receives £200,000. He did not
receive an additional fee for chairing the Board HR and Remuneration
Committee in 2006. Similarly, as Chairman, Matthew Barrett received 
a salary of £650,000, without any additional fee for chairing the Board
Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee. Sir Richard
Broadbent receives an additional £30,000 in respect of his role as Senior
Independent Director. Until his appointment as Chairman became
effective, Marcus Agius received the base fee of £65,000 (pro rata) as 
a non-executive Director.
The Board’s policy is that fees should reflect individual responsibilities
and membership of Board Committees. Barclays encourages its non-
executive Directors to build up a holding in Barclays shares. £20,000 
of each Director’s base fee of £65,000 is used to buy Barclays shares.
These shares, together with reinvested dividends, are retained on behalf
of the non-executive Directors until they retire from the Board. They are
included in the table of Directors’ interests in Barclays shares on page
140. Non-executive Directors do not receive awards in share plans for
employees, nor do they accrue pension benefits from Barclays for their
non-executive services. 
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but each has 
a letter of appointment. For each non-executive Director who served
during 2006, the effective date of their appointment, notice period and
the Group’s liability in the event of early termination are shown in the
following table.

Remuneration report
Notes 
(a) Pension accrued during the year represents the change in accrued pension (including inflation at the prescribed rate of 3.6%) which occurred during the entire year.
The pensions paid from the final salary section of the applicable pension fund are reviewed annually. Pensions increase by a minimum of the increase in the retail
prices index (up to a maximum of 5%), subject to the scheme rules. 
(b) The transfer values have been calculated in a manner consistent with the Retirement Benefit Scheme – Transfer Values (GN11) published by the Institute of Actuaries
and the Faculty of Actuaries.
(c) With the exception of Matthew W Barrett and the benefits provided through the US Restoration Plan for Robert E Diamond Jr, the pension benefits for all Directors
shown above are provided for on a funded basis.
(d) During the year and up until his retirement on 31st December 2006, Matthew W Barrett was not a member of any of the Group’s registered pension arrangements.
Instead a notional fund was accrued on his behalf through an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. No contributions were made to this arrangement in
2006 or since becoming Chairman. In addition, had Mr Barrett died during the year, before leaving employment, a capital lump sum of up to 4 times his base salary
would have been payable.
(e) John Varley is a member of the Group’s closed UK defined benefit pension arrangement. This non-contributory pension scheme has a normal pension age of 60 and in
accordance with his service contract, the scheme provides him with a pension benefit of 66.67% of his Pensionable Salary at normal pension age. Should John Varley
retire at age 55, the scheme provides for an unreduced pension of 60% of Pensionable Salary.
(f) In addition to the transfer value of accrued pension at 31st December 2006, John Varley and Gary Hoffman also have defined contribution benefits. John Varley’s
benefit is in respect of a transfer from a previous pension arrangement while Gary Hoffman’s benefit is in respect of Special Company Contributions (Bonus Sacrifice).
During 2006, Special Company Contributions (Bonus Sacrifice) of £225,000 were paid in respect of Gary Hoffman. The fund value of these arrangements as at 
31st December 2006 for John Varley and Gary Hoffman were £662,554 and £623,104 respectively. 
(g) The benefits shown above in respect of Robert E Diamond Jr’s participation in the Group’s US non-contributory defined benefit arrangement and the US Restoration
Plan have been converted to Pounds Sterling using the 2006 year-end exchange rate of US$1.96 (2005: US$1.72).
(h) Robert E Diamond Jr is also a member of the Barclays Bank PLC 401K Thrift Savings Plan and Thrift Restoration Plan. These are US defined contribution plans.
Company contributions into these plans in 2006 amounted to £11,414 (US$21,000).
(i) Naguib Kheraj and Frits Seegers do not participate in any of the Group’s pension arrangements. Instead they receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions
of 23% and 25% of their respective base salaries. Naguib Kheraj’s cash allowance in 2006 amounted to £149,500, while Frits Seegers’ cash allowance in 2006 was
£84,028.
(j) In addition to the cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions, Naguib Kheraj has defined contribution benefits in respect of a previous period of participation in the
Retirement Investment Scheme. The fund value of this deferred benefit as at 31st December 2006 was £108,963. Barclays PLC

Notes
(a) The number of shares shown in the table includes the maximum potential 30% bonus share element where applicable.
(b) An award was granted to Frits Seegers in August 2006 following his appointment as an executive Director on 10th July 2006 in recognition of forfeited share awards
and benefits from his previous employment. Bonus shares are not applicable to the award. Frits Seegers also received a cash payment in July 2006 in recognition of
forfeited share awards and benefits from his previous employment, as referred to in footnote (j) on page 133.
(c) The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated dividends (net of withholding) in respect of shares under award. During 2006,
the trustees released the following accumulated dividend shares – 4,486 to John Varley, 197,517 to Robert E Diamond Jr, 26,512 to Gary Hoffman, 23,309 to Naguib
Kheraj and 25,443 to David Roberts. These are not awarded as part of the original award and consequently are not included in the Released column.
(d) The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated dividends (net of withholding) in respect of shares under award. During 2006,
the trustees released 8,223 accumulated dividend shares to Matthew W Barrett. These are not awarded as part of the original award and are consequently not
included in the Exercised column. 
(e) The number shown in the column headed ‘Number at 1st January 2006’ includes shares held by Robert E Diamond Jr which reflect interests built up over the course 
of successive years’ service with Barclays. The awards were related to Robert E Diamond Jr’s contribution to the performance of Barclays Capital, BGI and the Barclays
Group. 
(f) The shares under option shown in this column are already included in the numbers shown at 1st January 2006 and relate to provisional allocations made in 2002 and
2003 except that the figures do not include accumulated dividend shares under option as follows: 6,484 shares for John Varley, 4,484 shares for Gary Hoffman, 57,765
shares for Naguib Kheraj and 4,272 shares for David Roberts. Under ESAS, a participant pays £1 to exercise an option, irrespective of the number of shares involved.

Notes
(a) The shares granted during 2005 and 2006 are scheduled for release in June 2008 and March 2009 (August 2009 for Frits Seegers) respectively, to the extent that the
applicable performance conditions are achieved. Dividend shares may also be released in respect of the vested shares.
(b) In respect of John Varley, Robert E Diamond Jr, Gary Hoffman, Naguib Kheraj and David Roberts, the price used to convert the present fair value of the award to a
number of shares was £6.50. This was an average over the period 21st February 2006 to 10th March 2006. In respect of Frits Seegers, the price used to convert the
present fair value of the award to a number of shares was £6.34, which was the price at which shares were purchased in the market to fund the award.
(c) The price shown is the mid-market closing price on the date of the award.
(d) The details of the performance conditions for PSP are included on page 129.
(e) Nothing was paid by the participants on the grant of awards.
(f) This Retained Incentive Opportunity is specific to Robert E Diamond Jr, under which he retains an opportunity broadly equivalent to a prior opportunity to participate 
in a Barclays Capital long-term incentive arrangement. It is intended to maintain close alignment of reward with Robert E Diamond Jr’s continued contribution to 
the performance of Barclays Capital. The performance measure is the cumulative EP performance of Barclays Capital during the period 1st January 2005 to 
31st December 2007. To achieve the maximum potential value shown above, Barclays Capital would need to generate cumulative EP of £2bn over the performance
period. If EP for the performance period is less than £500m, Robert E Diamond Jr will not be eligible for any award. If the minimum performance requirement of 
£500m EP is met, the potential value of the award would be in a range of £0.65m to £1.08m. The potential value of the Retained Incentive Opportunity between
£500m cumulative EP and £2bn cumulative EP is subject to a performance curve graduated to deliver higher proportionate value at higher levels of cumulative EP . 
Robert E Diamond Jr must normally be in the employment of the Barclays Group on the vesting date, to remain eligible. In determining the potential value of the
Retained Incentive Opportunity, the Committee will take into account Robert E Diamond Jr’s individual contribution during the performance period, and the underlying
financial health of the Barclays Group. The amount and basis for determining any entitlement under the Retained Incentive Opportunity will not be altered to the
advantage of Robert E Diamond Jr without prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
(g) Under the Retained Incentive Opportunity, 50% of any potential award would be payable in cash on the vesting date. A recommendation would be made to the trustee
of ESAS for an award of Barclays shares, in the form of a provisional allocation, in respect of the remaining 50%. Any shares under the ESAS award would be releasable
after 12 months from the award date. The Retained Incentive Opportunity is not pensionable. Barclays PLC

Notes
(a) Under ESOS, options granted (at market value) to executives were exercisable only if the growth in Barclays earnings per share over the three-year period was at least
equal to the percentage increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 6% over the same period. The performance condition for the 1999 ESOS grant was met.
(b) Under ISOP , executives were awarded options (at market value) over Barclays shares which are normally exercisable after three years. The number of shares over
which options can be exercised depends upon performance against specific performance conditions. For ISOP awards granted in 2000 to 2003, the first 40,000 target
shares under option for each award was subject to an EP performance condition, tested over a period of three years. Any amount above 40,000 target shares was
subject to a relative TSR performance condition, to be tested initially over three years. Because the TSR performance condition was not met over three years in relation
to the awards in 2003, the TSR condition was tested over a period of four years from the original start date. Awards in 2004 were subject to a relative TSR performance
condition. For the 2003 and 2004 grants under ISOP , which become exercisable in 2007, Barclays was ranked sixth in the peer group under the TSR performance
condition. This was sufficient for only 25% of the maximum number of shares under the TSR condition to vest. The remaining 75% will lapse. 
(c) Robert E Diamond Jr received a grant under the BGI EOP in March 2004. He was not a Director of Barclays PLC at that time. The BGI EOP is an option plan, approved by
shareholders in 2000 and offered predominantly to participants in the US. Under the BGI EOP , participants receive an option to purchase shares in Barclays Global
Investors UK Holdings Limited. The exercise price is based on the fair value at the time of grant. The option normally vests in three equal tranches on the first, second,
and third anniversary of the date of grant. Participants must, in accordance with the Articles of Association of Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited, keep their
shares for 355 days after the date of exercise, before they may be offered for sale. In line with market practice, the options were not subject to performance conditions.
Robert E Diamond Jr is not eligible to receive further awards under the BGI EOP . The shares shown in respect of the BGI EOP in the above table are shares in Barclays
Global Investors UK Holdings Limited.
(d) The number of shares shown for ISOP options represents the target award shares under option, or the actual number of shares under option if the award had vested
as at 31st December 2006. The target number of shares takes account of the stretch in the performance condition and the probability of vesting.
(e) The independent trustee of the Barclays Group (PSP) Employees’ Benefit Trust granted Matthew W Barrett a share award in 1999 comprising an option on similar
terms to options granted under ESOS. For convenience these are described as granted under ESOS in the above table.
(f) Frits Seegers was appointed as an executive Director on 10th July 2006 and therefore no participation in the above plans has been offered to him.

Going concern
The Directors confirm they are satisfied that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in business for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the ‘going
concern’ basis for preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that management
maintain an effective system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. Throughout the year ended 31st December 2006,
and to date, the Group has operated a system of internal control which
provides reasonable assurance of effective and efficient operations
covering all controls, including financial and operational controls and
compliance with laws and regulations. Processes are in place for
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks facing the
Group in accordance with the guidance ‘Internal Control: Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code’ published by the Financial Reporting
Council. The Board regularly reviews these processes through the 
Board Committees. 
The Directors review the effectiveness of the system of internal control
semi-annually. An internal control compliance certification process is
conducted throughout the Group in support of this review. The
effectiveness of controls is periodically reviewed within the business
areas. Regular reports are made to the Board Audit Committee by
management, Internal Audit and the compliance and legal functions
covering particularly financial controls, compliance and operational
controls. The Board Audit Committee monitors resolution of any
identified control issues of Group level significance through to a
satisfactory conclusion.
The key document for the Group’s internal control processes is the
Group Internal Control and Assurance Framework (GICAF) which
describes the Group’s approach to internal control and details Group
policies and processes. The GICAF is reviewed and approved on behalf
of the Group Chief Executive by the Group Governance and Control
Committee.
Quarterly risk reports are made to the Board covering risks of Group
significance including credit risk, market risk and operational risk,
including legal and compliance risk. Reports covering risk measurement
standards and risk appetite are made to the Board Risk Committee.
Further details of risk management procedures are given in the Risk
management section on pages 68 to 107.
Management’s report on internal control over 
financial reporting
The management of Barclays PLC is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Barclays
PLC’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
under the supervision of Barclays PLC’s principal executive and principal
financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and for the purposes of preparation of reconciliations
to Generally Accepted Accounting Practices in the United States
(US GAAP).
Barclays PLC’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies
and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and
dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with IFRSs and of reconciliations under US GAAP , and
that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorisations of management and the Directors of Barclays PLC; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of Barclays PLC’s assets
that could have a material effect on Barclays PLC’s financial statements. 
Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of Barclays PLC’s internal
control over financial reporting as of 31st December 2006. In making 
its assessment, management has utilised the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Management concluded
that based on its assessment, Barclays PLC’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of 31st December 2006.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for accounts
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with 
the Auditors’ report set out on page 149, is made with a view to
distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the
Directors and of the auditors in relation to the accounts.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare
accounts for each financial year and, with regards to Group accounts, 
in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The Directors have
prepared individual accounts in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. The accounts are required by law and IFRS to present
fairly the financial position of the Company and the Group and the
performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides, in
relation to such accounts, that references in the relevant part of the law
to accounts giving a true and fair view are references, to their achieving
fair presentation.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts on pages 151
to 274, and the additional information contained on pages 275 to 301,
the Group has used appropriate accounting policies, supported by
reasonable judgements and estimates, and that all accounting
standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and 
the Group keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy the financial position of the Company and the Group and
which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the
Companies Act 1985.

Disclosure controls and procedures
The Group Chief Executive, John Varley, and the Group Finance Director,
Naguib Kheraj, conducted with Group Management an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group’s disclosure
controls and procedures as at 31st December 2006, which are defined

concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. The Group Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director also concluded that no significant changes were made
in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect
these controls subsequent to their evaluation.

Corporate responsibility
Responsible banking
The past year has seen another marked increase in the profile of
corporate responsibility as a topic of global strategic significance. Two
issues have dominated debate – the emergence of climate change and
its consequences as the most pressing challenge facing the world and
the evolution of thought on social, ethical and environmental issues
under the overarching concept of ‘sustainability’.
For Barclays, corporate responsibility is embodied in the concept of
‘responsible banking’ – reflecting its place at the heart of our strategy as
an integral part of the way in which we do business. Firmly based on the
clear values enshrined in our Guiding Principles, responsible banking
means making informed, reasoned and ethical decisions in our business
dealings with customers, clients, employees and our other stakeholders.
Our Guiding Principles of Winning Together, Customer Focus, The Best
People, Pioneering and Trusted describe how we expect our employees
to behave with external stakeholders and each other. Responsible
banking is the approach by which we aim to progress towards
sustainability – recognising that we will succeed in our strategic and
financial goals only if we have a strong commitment and focus on
achieving sustainable outcomes for all stakeholders.
We make our greatest contribution to society by being good at what we
do and by doing so responsibly – by helping our customers meet their
financial goals through providing competitive products and services
that contribute to economic growth, and in contributing to healthy
financial systems around the world.
Our corporate responsibility priorities are informed by regular dialogue
with a wide range of organisations and in 2006 we undertook a much
broader programme of formal and informal dialogue with investors,
non-governmental organisations, customers, our employees and
politicians. Our approach is focused on the following areas:
•
Our customers
•
Financial inclusion
•
Responsible lending
•
Environment and climate change
•
Supply chain management
•
Our employees
•
Community investment
This is underpinned by a strong governance framework.
Governance
The Group Chief Executive, supported by the Group Executive
Committee, has primary responsibility for embedding ‘responsible
banking’ throughout Barclays. This includes setting strategy and the
identification, review and reporting of all business issues (whether 
risks or commercial opportunities) which have an important social,
environmental or ethical dimension.
The Brand and Reputation Committee, a sub-committee of Group
Executive Committee, is chaired by Sir Nigel Rudd, Deputy Chairman
and a non-executive Director on the Board. The Committee’s role is to
identify and manage issues of reputational significance to the Barclays
Group. The Committee met three times during the year.
The Community Partnerships Committee sets the policy and provides
governance for our global community investment, and the
Environmental Steering Group provides direction and governance to
support our environmental and climate change strategies.
Corporate responsibility is firmly established as one of the Board
Governance Standards, providing for internal control and governance
and establishing ‘responsible banking’ as a key area of profile and
measurement within our risk management processes.
Ethical indices
Barclays is a long-standing member of the Dow Jones Sustainability
and FTSE4Good ethical indices. Our ranking in the Business in the
Community Corporate Responsibility Index rose to 3rd position out of
131 companies. In the Carbon Disclosure Project, we were ranked in the
top 50 of the global FT 500 companies.
Our customers
An unswerving focus on our customers lies at the heart of our Guiding
Principles. We are committed to providing them with excellent products
and services and doing so in accordance with our ten established
principles for treating customers fairly, with openness and with
transparency. Our aim is to improve the information we give to
customers so that they can make better informed decisions in line with
their own circumstances and needs.
We have made a large investment in improving our customer service,
most notably in our UK Retail Business. We are, therefore, encouraged 
to see that the progress we reported last year has been maintained in the
areas of customer satisfaction and advocacy , as we have implemented
steps to improve products and to rectify challenges in key areas such as
mortgage processing, where we have made major changes.
Across our other businesses – UK Business Banking, Barclays Capital,
Barclays Global Investors, Barclays Wealth and in our African and
European retail operations, strong levels of customer satisfaction and
advocacy have been sustained.
During the year, we announced our intention to merge our network of
Woolwich branches in the UK into Barclays, at the same time investing 
in our branch network and in the Woolwich as our mortgage brand. 
This will give Woolwich customers access to all Barclays branches and
ATMs and vice versa. The branches we are bringing together are near
neighbours – 300 metres or less apart and there will be no change in 
our community footprint as a result.
Financial inclusion
With 2.7 billion people across the world living on less than US$2 
per day and some 2.8 million UK adults without access to a bank
account, increasing financial inclusion is both a social imperative and
a commercial opportunity. Our focus in this area has been on our
businesses in the UK and in Africa and specifically on improving both
access to banking and to affordable credit and savings.
In South Africa, Absa’s Customer Education Programme is making
banking more accessible to customers at the lower end of the mass
market through a range of audio visual channels, whilst in the UK we
continued to support agencies such as the Money Advice Trust, Citizens
Advice and Business Debtline.
We increased the number of our Cash Card (basic bank) Accounts,
designed for low income and vulnerable people in the UK, by 85,000 to
464,000 and held a ‘roundtable’ discussion with three consumer groups
– Citizens Advice, the National Consumer Council and SAFE (Services
Against Financial Exclusion), an initiative of Toynbee Hall – to inform
improvements and increase access to this account. New functions have
been added to the account and, based on the feedback, we are giving
more profile to the savings needs of these customers. In the UK, our
personal current account customers can continue to make cash
withdrawals free of charge through the Post Office network. Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 144
Corporate responsibility
Absa has been addressing access in South Africa through various
means. Portable branches are bringing banking to deprived areas,
enabling a full range of transactions to be handled efficiently. 13 were
opened in 2006. 1.5 million more South Africans were brought into
banking via the Mzansi account, of which Absa continues to be the
leading bank provider. The bank has also implemented its AllPay and
Sekulula services, enabling 2.3 million social grant beneficiaries to
access their payments in four provinces.
We remain the leading private sector supporter of credit unions in 
the UK, whilst our pilot of microbanking in Ghana through the
traditional Susu system proved very successful, reaching over 80,000
disadvantaged market traders and supporting the UN Millennium
Development Goals. Work is now under way to develop microfinance
programmes for implementation in other African countries.
Responsible lending
The consumer lending market in the UK has continued to be both
intensely competitive and challenging. Our commitment is to provide
clear and straightforward information to our customers so that they 
can readily see the terms and conditions and then make an informed
personal decision. We have further developed the use of summary
information on credit card and personal loan application forms and
statements, to help customers understand our terms and pricing and
also, for example, the implications of making only the minimum
payment on their credit card outstandings.
We are working closely with other banks and finance providers to share
information about how people manage their accounts, in the belief 
that this has a key role to play in helping banks assist their customers
through responsible lending practices and customer care. Another
development is to encourage responsible borrowing through the
introduction of our Flexi-Rate™ card, which offers a lower interest rate 
to those customers who repay more of their outstanding credit card
balance each month.
Environment and climate change
The effects of climate change constitute the most pressing challenge 
to global sustainability and we continue to reflect this in our policies 
and actions. As a bank, our impacts are both direct – through our own
operations – and indirect – through our lending and other business
activities with customers and clients.
One of our key initiatives has been to make our UK operations carbon-
neutral. We have achieved this through significant investment in energy
efficiency and through the purchase of renewable energy – 50% of our
UK operations are now being supplied from renewable sources. Part of
our remaining offset of over 200,000 tonnes of CO2 is provided through
the purchase of carbon credits in the market, together with a strong
contribution from community-based sustainable energy schemes such
as solar and wind power in Africa and India.
US and Asia 12%
UK 48%
Africa 37%
Europe 3%
Barclays CO2 emissions from energy and travel
We are also helping to combat climate change through the
development of carbon-related products and services, such as our
launch of the first carbon-neutral debit card in the UK. Barclays Capital
continued to support the vital carbon trading market, where it remains
the most active trader. Our Natural Resources Team has provided long-
term finance for over 2,600MW of renewable generating capacity,
including onshore windfarms, landfill gas extraction plants and bio-
diesel conversion plants.
We have committed strongly to the efficient management of our
resources, reducing waste and increasing recycling. We extended our
ISO14001 certified Environmental Management System, with our
operations in France and Absa in South Africa becoming the first major
banks in those countries to achieve such accreditation.
As a result of this activity, we improved our score in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index, retaining our 1st position amongst global 
banks for environmental reporting and joint 1st in environmental
performance. In the UK, we achieved 2nd position in the Business 
in the Environment Index.
As a co-founder of the Equator Principles, which require banks to
undertake detailed social and environmental impact assessments when
financing projects such as dams and mines, we contributed to the
revision and strengthening of the Principles. The threshold amount 
has been reduced from US$50m to US$10m and criteria tightened, such
that they now include more robust procedures for public consultation
and a greater focus on social impacts.

During the year, we updated our internal environmental and social risk
guidance, extending it to over 50 different industry sectors. This
guidance, which was developed with input from environmental NGOs,
now reflects more explicit information on social and other human
rights-related impacts. This review also benefited from our work as the
only bank participating in the Business Leaders’ Initiative on Human
Rights. The guidance has been shared with the United Nations
Environment Programme – Finance Initiative and has been made
available to their 167 members around the world. Barclays PLC

Supply chain management
Responsible sourcing principles are an important component in our
commitment to sustainability whilst, at the same time, enabling us to
manage business risk. A key achievement in 2006 was the circulation 
of our new Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire to our suppliers
operating in sectors of higher or medium level environmental or social
risk. So far, we have reviewed some 60 suppliers, accounting for
approximately £1.5bn of our total annual spend.
The information gathered through our questionnaire is helping to
ensure that the social and environmental policies of our suppliers are in
line with Barclays own standards. In those cases where suppliers have
performed relatively poorly, we intend to work with them to help them
improve performance.
In 2006, Absa in South Africa spent over 55% of their annual 
sourcing total with businesses qualifying under the Black Economic
Empowerment guidelines. These support the South African
Government’s objective to ensure that its citizens have the opportunity 
to participate in the economic progress of the country.
In the UK, we worked with our cleaning contractors to secure new terms
and conditions for some 2,400 cleaning staff in our 2,000 UK branches.
This groundbreaking initiative means that the cleaners will now benefit
from improved pay and opportunities for training, as well as access to a
pension, sick pay, increased holiday entitlements and annual leave.
Our employees
The commitment, motivation and talent of our employees lies at the
heart of our approach to sustainability. During 2006, we continued our
pioneering partnership agreement with Amicus, our UK trade union,
and signed a joint Equality Charter that commits us to advancing
equality for our employees.
Our annual independent Employee Opinion Survey showed further
improvements. 87% of our colleagues participated in the survey and
84% expressed pride in working for Barclays, with Employee
Engagement standing at 76% (72% in 2005). Employee perceptions of
Barclays as a responsible company showed further strong progress.

Diversity amongst our employees is both a long-term commitment and
a business imperative. 21% of our senior employees are female and this
is a start, but we accept that there is more to do. We boosted our intake
of disabled graduates to our summer internship programme with good
progress across our businesses and we benefited from a proactive
partnership with Spain’s Fundación Once.
6% of our UK senior managers are now from an ethnic minority
background whilst, over the past five years, the number of our ethnic
minority employees in the UK has risen from 7% to 13%. In South Africa,
Absa continued to make strong progress with its commitments under
the Financial Sector Charter to increase the number of black managers
at all levels and, as a sub-set, black female managers.

Occupational health is an important concern for us and we maintain a
comprehensive HIV/AIDS programme across all our African businesses.
This provides counselling, testing and treatment, including free anti-
retroviral drugs, for our employees and their dependants. We also have
extensive schemes to support business customers and our wider
communities and have been active in supporting malaria programmes
in various African countries.
Community investment
2006 was an important year for our community investment
programme. After extensive research and consultation with
stakeholders both inside and outside Barclays, we are now
implementing a global programme that unites all our businesses 
across the world and which complements our business strategy. 
Our investment is now being directed towards three key themes:
•
Banking on brighter futures
•
Looking after local communities
•
Charity begins at work Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 146
Corporate responsibility
Banking on brighter futures focuses on the provision of money advice,
tackling financial exclusion, helping disadvantaged people into work
and supporting their broader education. An example of our initiatives is
Barclaycard Horizons – a three-year, £3m community programme with
four national partners, which aims to support 50,000 disadvantaged
single parents in working their way out of debt and poverty.
Looking after local communities is about investing in the many
neighbourhoods around the world where we have a presence. By far our
biggest community project in the UK is Barclays Spaces for Sports, now
in its third and final year. To date, over 120 community sports facilities
have been completed and 3,600 coaching kits provided to local groups,
benefiting some 320,000 people in disadvantaged areas.
Charity begins at work is dedicated to, and driven by, our employees. 
In 2006, 33,000 Barclays employees and pensioners around the world
received support for fundraising or volunteering. One focus of our
volunteering is Make a Difference Day, now covering 25 countries
worldwide. Last year, 11,000 employees contributed their business
skills, with international participation up 63% compared to the 
previous year.
We are a member of the PerCent Club – a group of companies that has
undertaken to ensure that investment in the community over time
amounts to at least 1% of UK pre-tax profit.

Presentation of information Independent Auditors’ report
UK Audit Report of the Independent Registered Auditors’
to the members of Barclays PLC 
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements
(the ‘financial statements’) of Barclays PLC for the year ended 
31st December 2006 which comprise the Income Statements, Balance
Sheets, Cash Flow Statements, Statements of Recognised Income and
Expense and the related notes on pages 162 to 250. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out on pages 151 to 160. We have also audited the information in the
Remuneration report that is described as having been audited (‘the
auditable part’) on pages 133 to 139.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’
responsibilities on page 141. The Directors are also responsible for
preparing the Remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration report have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as with regards to the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors' report is consistent with the financial statements. In addition,
we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the
Company’s and Group’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s or Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Chairman’s statement, Group chief
executive’s review, Financial review, Risk management, Directors’
report, Corporate governance report, the unaudited part of the
Remuneration report, Accountability and audit and Presentation of
information. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration report are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Remuneration report.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31st December 2006 and of
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s profit and cash flows for the
year then ended;
•
the financial statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as with regards to the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
•
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Notes
(a) The maintenance and integrity of the Barclays PLC website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration 
of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially
presented on the website.
(b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Barclays PLC
We have completed an integrated audit of Barclays PLC (the ‘Company’)
and its subsidiary undertakings 31st December 2006 consolidated
financial statements on pages 151 to 274 and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of 31st December 2006 and an audit of its 2005
and 2004 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. 
Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements,
Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Cash Flow Statements and
the Consolidated Statements of Recognised Income and Expense
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barclays
PLC and its subsidiary undertakings at 31st December 2006 and 2005
and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended 31st December 2006, in conformity with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards 
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statements presentation. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union vary in certain significant
respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America. Information relating to the nature and 
effect of such differences is presented in Note 60 to the consolidated
financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting 
Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying ‘Management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting’ as set out in the Accountability and audit section on page
141, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of 31st December 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
31st December 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
– Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control,
and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in 
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinions. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
standards and principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting standards and principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Significant Accounting Policies
1. Reporting entity
These financial statements are prepared for the Barclays PLC Group
(‘Barclays’ or ‘the Group’) under Section 227(2) of the Companies Act
1985. The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged 
in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking,
wealth management and investment management services. In addition,
individual financial statements have been prepared for the holding
company, Barclays PLC (‘the Company’), under Section 226(2)(b) of the
Companies Act 1985. 
Barclays PLC is a public limited company, incorporated in England and
Wales and having a registered office in England and Wales. 
2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of the Barclays PLC Group, and
the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union.
They are also in accordance with IFRSs as published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued by IFRIC.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied.
3. Basis of preparation
The consolidated and individual financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the
fair valuation of certain financial instruments and contracts to buy or
sell non-financial items and trading inventories to the extent required 
or permitted under accounting standards and as set out in the relevant
accounting polices. They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling (£m),
the currency of the country in which Barclays PLC is incorporated.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the
accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements set out areas
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial
statements such as fair value of financial instruments (Note 58),
allowance for loan impairment (Note 17), goodwill (Note 23), intangible
assets (Note 24), and retirement benefit obligations (Note 35).
4. Consolidation 
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial
statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries, including certain
special purpose entities where appropriate, made up to 31st December.
Entities qualify as subsidiaries where the Group has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits
from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than
one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in
assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Details of the
principal subsidiaries are given in Note 47. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date
that control ceases. 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the
purchase of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed, plus any costs directly related to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair
value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
See accounting policy 14 for the accounting policy for goodwill. 
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation
and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for
the purposes of the consolidation.
As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where a
Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption
of Regulation 7 of the Partnerships and Unlimited Companies
(Accounts) Regulations 1993 with regard to the preparation and filing
of individual partnership financial statements.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence,
but not control, over the operating and financial management policy
decisions. This is generally demonstrated by the Group holding in
excess of 20%, but no more than 50%, of the voting rights.
A joint venture exists where the Group has a contractual arrangement
with one or more parties to undertake activities typically, though not
necessarily, through entities which are subject to joint control. 
Unless designated as at fair value through profit and loss as set out in
policy 7, the Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures are
initially recorded at cost and increased (or decreased) each year by the
Group’s share of the post-acquisition net income (or loss), or other
movements reflected directly in the equity of the associated or jointly
controlled entity. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate 
or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment
(net of any accumulated impairment loss). When the Group’s share of
losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds the recorded
interest, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does 
not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the entity.
The Group’s share of the results of associates and joint ventures is based
on financial statements made up to a date not earlier than three months
before the balance sheet date, adjusted to conform with the accounting
polices of the Group. Unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated to
the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment
in the asset transferred.
In the individual financial statements, investments in subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment, if any. 
5. Foreign currency translation
The consolidated and individual financial statements are presented in
Sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities
are measured using their functional currency, being the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of
the transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rate prevailing at the period end. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the retranslation and settlement of these
items are recognised in the income statement except for qualifying cash
flow hedges or hedges of net investments. See policy 12 for the policies
on hedge accounting.
Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated
using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Exchange differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held
at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value
gain or loss. Translation differences on equities classified as available 
for sale financial assets and non-monetary items are included directly 
in equity. For the purposes of translation into the presentational currency, assets,
liabilities and equity of foreign operations are translated at the closing
rate, and items of income and expense are translated into Sterling at 
the rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions, or average rates 
of exchange where these approximate to actual rates. 
The exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign
operation are included in cumulative translation reserves within
shareholders’ equity and included in the profit or loss on disposal 
or partial disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign
subsidiaries are maintained in the functional currency of the foreign
operation, translated at the closing rate and are included in hedges 
of net investments where appropriate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group brought forward a nil opening balance
on the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment arising from
the retranslation of foreign operations, which is shown as a separate
item in shareholders’ equity.
6. Interest, fees and commissions
Interest
Interest is recognised in interest income and interest expense in the
income statement for all interest bearing financial instruments classified
as held to maturity, available for sale or other loans and receivables
using the effective interest method. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised
cost of a financial asset or liability (or group of assets and liabilities) and
of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the
expected future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of
the financial instrument, or when appropriate, a shorter period, to the
net carrying amount of the instrument. The application of the method
has the effect of recognising income (and expense) receivable 
(or payable) on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount
outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment. 
In calculating effective interest, the Group estimates cash flows (using
projections based on its experience of customers’ behaviour)
considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but
excluding future credit losses. Fees, including those for early
redemption, are included in the calculation to the extent that they can
be measured and are considered to be an integral part of the effective
interest rate. Cash flows arising from the direct and incremental costs 
of issuing financial instruments are also taken into account in the
calculation. Where it is not possible to otherwise estimate reliably the
cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument, effective
interest is calculated by reference to the payments or receipts specified
in the contract, and the full contractual term.
Fees and commissions 
Unless included in the effective interest calculation, fees and
commissions are recognised on an accruals basis as the service is
provided. Fees and commissions not integral to effective interest arising
from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of a transaction
from a third party, such as the acquisition of loans, shares or other
securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, are recognised on
completion of the underlying transaction. Portfolio and other
management advisory and service fees are recognised based on the
applicable service contracts. Asset management fees related to
investment funds are recognised over the period the service is provided.
The same principle is applied to the recognition of income from wealth
management, financial planning and custody services that are
continuously provided over an extended period of time.
Commitment fees, together with related direct costs, for loan facilities
where draw down is probable are deferred and recognised as an
adjustment to the effective interest on the loan once drawn.
Commitment fees in relation to facilities where draw down is not
probable are recognised over the term of the commitment. 
Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums are recognised in the period earned.
Net trading income
Income arises from the margins which are achieved through market-
making and customer business and from changes in market value
caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices 
and other market variables. Trading positions are held at fair value and
the resulting gains and losses are included in the Income statement,
together with interest and dividends arising from long and short
positions and funding costs relating to trading activities. 
Dividends from subsidiaries
In the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, dividends from
subsidiaries are accounted for on the basis of dividends received in the
accounting period.
Prior to 1st January 2005
Interest
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues,
with the exception of interest on non-performing loans as set out in
accounting policy 8.
Fees and commissions
Fee income relating to loans and advances is recognised in the income
statement to match the cost of providing a continuing service, together
with a reasonable profit margin. Where a fee is charged in lieu of
interest, it is recognised in the income statement as interest receivable
on a level yield basis over the life of the advance. Fees and commissions
receivable in respect of all other services provided are recognised in the
income statement when the related services are performed and when
considered recoverable.
Mortgage indemnity premiums
Premiums are deferred and included in accruals and deferred income in
the Group balance sheet. Following regular reviews of the amount of
income required to cover anticipated losses in respect of this lending,
deferred income is released to the income statement on an annual basis.
Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums are recognised in the period earned.
Lending related fees and commissions payable and incentives
Fees and commissions payable to introducers in respect of obtaining
certain lending business, where this is the primary form of distribution,
are charged to the income statement as fees and commissions payable,
over the anticipated life of the loans. 
The costs of mortgage incentives, which comprise cashbacks and
interest discounts, are charged to the income statement as a reduction
to interest receivable as incurred.
7. Financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss; loans and
receivables; held to maturity investments and available for sale financial
assets. Management determines the classification of financial assets
and liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments are classified in this category if they are held for
trading, or if they are designated by management under the fair value
option. Instruments are classified as held for trading if they are:
(i) acquired principally for the purposes of selling or repurchasing in
the near term;
Consolidated accounts Barclays PLC
Accounting policies
Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 152 Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 153
Financial statements

(ii) part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are
managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
(iii) a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee
contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.
Financial instruments cannot be transferred into or out of this category
after inception. Financial instruments included in this category are
recognised initially at fair value and transaction costs are taken directly
to the Income statement. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value are included directly in the Income statement. The instruments
are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired 
or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments held for
trading or designated under the fair value option are recognised on
trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase 
or sell the asset.
The fair value option is used in the following circumstances:
(i) financial assets backing insurance contracts and financial assets
backing investment contracts are designated at fair value through
profit or loss because the related liabilities have cash flows that are
contractually based on the performance of the assets or the related
liabilities are insurance contracts whose measurement incorporates
current information. Fair valuing the assets through profit and loss
significantly reduces the recognition inconsistencies that would
arise if the financial assets were classified as available for sale;
(ii) financial assets, loans to customers, financial liabilities, financial
guarantees and structured notes may be designated at fair value
through profit or loss if they contain substantive embedded
derivatives;
(iii) financial assets, loans to customers, financial liabilities, financial
guarantees and structured notes may be designated at fair value
through profit or loss where doing so significantly reduces
measurement inconsistencies that would arise if the related
derivatives were treated as held for trading and the underlying
financial instruments were carried at amortised cost; and
(iv)certain private equity and other investments that are managed, and
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented
risk management or investment strategy and reported to key
management personnel on that basis.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and
which are not classified as available for sale. Loans and receivables are
initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental
transaction costs. They are subsequently valued at amortised cost,
using the effective interest method (see accounting policy 6 on page
152). They are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have
expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership.
Regular way purchases and sales of loans and receivables are
recognised on contractual settlement.
Held to maturity
Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments that the Group’s management has the
intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are initially recognised at
fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs. They are
subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest
method (see accounting policy 6). They are derecognised when the
rights to receive cash flows have expired.
Purchases of held to maturity financial assets are recognised on trade
date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase the asset.
Available for sale
Available for sale assets are non-derivative financial assets that are
designated as available for sale and are not categorised into any of the
other categories described above. They are initially recognised at fair
value including direct and incremental transaction costs. They are
subsequently held at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes 
in fair value are included as a separate component of equity until sale
when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income
statement. Interest determined using the effective interest method 
(see accounting policy 6), impairment losses and translation differences
on monetary items are recognised in the income statement. The assets
are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired 
or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership.
Regular way purchases and sales of available for sale financial
instruments are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading
liabilities and liabilities designated at fair value, which are held at fair
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are derecognised when
extinguished.
Determining fair value
Where the classification of a financial instrument requires it to be stated
at fair value, this is determined by reference to the quoted bid price or
asking price (as appropriate) in an active market wherever possible.
Where no such active market exists for the particular asset or liability,
the Group uses a valuation technique to arrive at the fair value, 
including the use of prices obtained in recent arms-length transactions,
discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other
valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Profits or losses are only recognised on initial recognition when such
profits can be measured solely by reference to observable current
market transactions or valuation techniques based solely on observable
market inputs.
Prior to 1st January 2005, financial assets were accounted for as follows:
Loans and advances
Loans and advances, other than those held in a dealing portfolio, are
recorded in the balance sheet at cost, less interest in suspense debited
to the customer’s account, specific and general provisions. Advances
held in a dealing portfolio for the purpose of trading on a secondary
market are valued at the lower of cost and market value. 
Investment securities
Investment securities are debt securities and equity shares intended 
for use on a continuing basis by the Group and identified as such.
Investment securities are stated at cost less any provision for
impairment. The cost of dated investment securities is adjusted for the
amortisation of premiums or discounts on purchase over the period to
redemption. The amortisation of premiums and discounts is included 
in interest receivable.
Other debt securities and equity shares are stated at market value and
profits and losses arising from this revaluation are taken directly to the
income statement through dealing profits. Listed securities are valued
based on market prices, with long positions at bid and short positions 
at offer price. Unlisted securities are valued based on the Directors’
estimate, which takes into consideration discounted cash flows, price
earnings ratios and other valuation techniques.  In the case of private equity investments, listed and unlisted investments
are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. 
8. Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is
objective evidence that a financial asset or a portfolio of financial assets
carried at amortised cost is impaired. A financial asset or portfolio of
financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and
only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or
more loss events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
and prior to the balance sheet date (‘a loss event’) and that loss event 
or events has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the
financial asset or the portfolio that can be reliably estimated. Objective
evidence that a financial asset or a portfolio is impaired includes
observable data that comes to the attention of the Group about the
following loss events:
a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor; 
b) a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or
principal payments;
c) the lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s
financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a concession that the
lender would not otherwise consider;
d) it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or
other financial reorganisation;
e) the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset
because of financial difficulties; or
f ) observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in
the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of financial assets
since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease
cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the
portfolio, including:
(i) adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the
portfolio;
(ii) national or local economic conditions that correlate with
defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment
exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant,
and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not
individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective
evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial
asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of
financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively
assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed 
for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be
recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
For loans and receivables and assets held to maturity, the amount of
impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The amount of
the loss is recognised using an allowance account and recognised in 
the income statement.
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows
of a collateralised financial asset reflect the cash flows that may result
from foreclosure costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether
or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial
assets are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics, taking into
account asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-
due status and other relevant factors. These characteristics are relevant
to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being
indicative of the counterparty’s ability to pay all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Future cash flows in a group of financial assets that are collectively
evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of the contractual
cash flows of the assets in the group and historical loss experience for
assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group.
Historical loss experience is adjusted based on current observable data
to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period
on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the
effects of conditions in the historical period that do not currently exist.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash
flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss
estimates and actual loss experience.
Following impairment, interest income is recognised using the original
effective rate of interest which was used to discount the future cash
flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related
provision for loan impairment. Such loans are written off after all the
necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss
has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off are credited to the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment
loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account. The amount of the
reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Equity securities acquired in exchange for loans and advances in order
to achieve an orderly realisation are accounted for as a disposal of the
loan and an acquisition of equity securities. Where control is obtained
over an entity as a result of the transaction, the entity is consolidated.
Any further impairment of the assets or business acquired is treated as
an impairment of the relevant asset or business and not as an
impairment of the original instrument.
In the case of equity instruments classified as available for sale, a
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below 
its cost is considered in determining whether impairment exists. Where
such evidence exists, the cumulative net loss that has been previously
recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in
the income statement. In the case of debt instruments classified as
available for sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as all
other financial assets. Reversals of impairment of debt instruments are
recognised in the income statement. Reversals of impairment of equity
shares are not recognised in the income statement, increases in the fair
value of equity shares after impairment are recognised directly in equity .
Prior to 1st January 2005
Specific provisions are raised when the Group considers that the
creditworthiness of a borrower has deteriorated such that the recovery
of the whole or part of an outstanding advance is in serious doubt.
Typically, this is done on an individual basis, although scope exists
within the retail businesses, where the portfolio comprises
homogeneous assets and where statistical techniques are appropriate,
to raise specific provisions on a portfolio basis. 
General provisions are raised to cover losses which are judged to be
present in loans and advances at the balance sheet date, but which have
not been specifically identified as such. These provisions are adjusted at
least half yearly by an appropriate charge or release of general provision
based on a statistical analysis. The accuracy of this analysis is
periodically assessed against actual losses. Gradings are used to rate the
credit quality of borrowers. Each grade corresponds to an Expected
Default Frequency and is calculated by using manual or computer
driven score-sheets validated by an analysis of the Group’s own
Consolidated accounts Barclays PLC
Accounting policies

historical data. This grade can be derived from different sources
depending upon the borrower (e.g. internal model, credit rating
agency). The general provision also takes into account the economic
climate in the market in which the Group operates and the level of
security held in relation to each category of counterparty. The general
provision includes a specifically identified element to cover country
transfer risk calculated on a basis consistent with the overall general
provision calculation. General provisions are created with respect to 
the recoverability of assets arising from off-balance sheet exposures 
in a manner consistent with the general provisioning methodology. 
The aggregate specific and general provisions which are made during
the year, less amounts released and recoveries of bad debts previously
written off, are charged against operating profit and are deducted from
loans and advances. Impaired lendings are written off against the
balance sheet asset and provision in part, or in whole, when the extent
of the loss incurred has been confirmed. 
If the collection of interest is doubtful, it is credited to a suspense
account and excluded from interest income in the income statement.
Although it continues to be charged to the customers’ accounts, the
suspense account in the balance sheet is netted against the relevant
loan. If the collection of interest is considered to be remote, interest is 
no longer applied and suspended interest is written off. Loans on which
interest is suspended are not reclassified as accruing interest until
interest and principal payments are up to date and future payments are
reasonably assured. 
Assets acquired in exchange for advances in order to achieve an orderly
realisation continue to be reported as advances. The asset acquired is
recorded at the carrying value of the original advance updated as at the
date of the exchange. Any subsequent impairment is accounted for as 
a specific provision.
9. Sale and repurchase agreements (including stock borrowing
and lending)
Securities may be lent or sold subject to a commitment to repurchase
them (a ‘repo’). Such securities are retained on the balance sheet when
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the
Group, and the counterparty liability is included separately on the
balance sheet as appropriate.
Similarly, where the Group borrows or purchases securities subject to 
a commitment to resell them (a ‘reverse repo’) but does not acquire 
the risks and rewards of ownership, the transactions are treated as
collateralised loans, and the securities are not included in the 
balance sheet.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is accrued over the life
of the agreements using the effective interest method. Securities lent to
counterparties are also retained in the financial statements. Securities
borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these
are sold to third parties, at which point the obligation to repurchase 
the securities is recorded as a trading liability at fair value and any
subsequent gain or loss included in net trading income.
Prior to 1st January 2005
The cash legs of repos and reverse repos are included within loans and
advances to banks, loans and advances to customer, deposits by banks
and customer accounts. The Group aims to earn net interest income
and net trading income from these activities, as well as funding its own
holdings of securities. The difference between sale and repurchase and
purchase and resale prices for such transactions, including dividends
received where appropriate, is charged or credited to the income
statement over the life of the relevant transactions.
10. Securitisation transactions
Certain Group undertakings have issued debt securities or have entered
into funding arrangements with lenders in order to finance specific
loans and advances to customers. 
All financial assets continue to be held on the Group balance sheet, and
a liability recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction, unless:
(i) substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the financial
instruments have been transferred, in which case, the assets are
derecognised in full; or
(ii) if a significant portion, but not all, of the risks and rewards have
been transferred, the asset is derecognised entirely if the transferee
has the ability to sell the financial asset, otherwise the asset
continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s
continuing involvement. 
Where (i) or (ii) above applies to a fully proportionate share of all or
specifically identified cash flows, the relevant accounting treatment 
is applied to that proportion of the asset. 
11. Collateral and netting
The Group enters into master agreements with counterparties
whenever possible and, when appropriate, obtains collateral. Master
agreements provide that, if an event of default occurs, all outstanding
transactions with the counterparty will fall due and all amounts
outstanding will be settled on a net basis. 
Collateral
The Group obtains collateral in respect of customer liabilities where this
is considered appropriate. The collateral normally takes the form of a
lien over the customer’s assets and gives the Group a claim on these
assets for both existing and future liabilities.
The Group also receives collateral in the form of cash or securities in
respect of other credit instruments, such as stock borrowing contracts,
and derivative contracts in order to reduce credit risk. Collateral received
in the form of securities is not recorded on the balance sheet. Collateral
received in the form of cash is recorded on the balance sheet with a
corresponding liability. These items are assigned to deposits received
from bank or other counterparties. Any interest payable or receivable
arising is recorded as interest expense or interest income respectively
except for funding costs relating to trading activities which are recorded
in net trading income.
Netting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported 
in the balance sheet if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to
set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a
net basis, or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
In many cases, even though master netting agreements are in place, 
the lack of an intention to settle on a net basis results in the related
assets and liabilities being presented gross in the balance sheet.
12. Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity,
and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house
price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
In addition, the use of derivatives and their sale to customers as risk
management products is an integral part of the Group’s trading
activities. Derivatives entered into for hedging purposes and for trading
purposes include foreign exchange, interest rate, credit, equity and
commodity derivatives mainly in the form of swaps, forwards, options
and combinations of these instrument types.
Derivatives
Derivatives are measured initially at fair value and subsequently
remeasured to fair value. Fair values are obtained from quoted prices
prevailing in active markets, including recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and
option pricing models as appropriate. All derivatives are included in
assets when their fair value is positive, and liabilities when their fair 
value is negative, unless there is the legal ability and intention to settle
net (as per accounting policy 11).
Embedded derivatives
Some hybrid contracts contain both a derivative and a non-derivative
component. In such cases, the derivative component is termed an
embedded derivative. Where the economic characteristics and risks of
the embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host
contract, and the host contract itself is not carried at fair value through
profit or loss, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and reported at fair
value with gains and losses being recognised in the income statement. 
Profits or losses cannot be recognised on the initial recognition of
embedded derivatives unless the host contract is also carried at fair
value.
Hedge accounting
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when
transactions meet the criteria specified in IAS 39, the Group applies 
fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging 
of a net investment in a foreign operation as appropriate to the risks
being hedged.
When a financial instrument is designated as a hedge, the Group
formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument
and hedged item as well as its risk management objectives and its
strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions. The Group
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an
ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or
cash flows of hedged items. 
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
(i) It is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly
effective as a hedge; 
(ii) the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; 
(iii) the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or 
(iv)a forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable. 
In certain circumstances, the Group may decide to cease hedge
accounting even though the hedge relationship continues to be highly
effective by no longer designating the financial instrument as a hedging
instrument. To the extent that the changes in the fair value of the
hedging derivative differ from changes in the fair value of the hedged
risk in the hedged item; or the cumulative change in the fair value of the
hedging derivative differs from the cumulative change in the fair value 
of expected future cash flows of the hedged item, the hedge is deemed
ineffective. The amount of ineffectiveness, provided it is not so great as
to disqualify the entire hedge for hedge accounting, is recorded in the
income statement.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as
fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are
attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk,
the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income
statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated
hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value
adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated
with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially 
in shareholders’ equity, and recycled to the income statement in the
periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in
the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately
transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations, including monetary
items that are accounted for as part of the net investment, are
accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges; the effective portion of the
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity
and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity
is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal
of the foreign operation.
Hedges of net investments may include non-derivative liabilities as well
as derivative financial instruments although for a non-derivative liability
only the foreign exchange risk is designated as a hedge.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Derivative contracts entered into as economic hedges that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are held at fair value through profit or loss. 
Prior to 1st January 2005
Derivatives entered into as trading transactions, together with any
associated hedging, are measured at fair value and the resultant profits
and losses are included in net trading income, along with interest and
dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs
relating to trading activities. Assets and liabilities resulting from gains or
losses on derivative and foreign exchange contracts are reported gross
and reduced by the effects of qualifying netting agreements with
counterparties. 
The fair value of derivatives is determined by calculating the expected
cash flows under the terms of each specific contract, discounted back
to a present value. The expected cash flows for each contract are
determined either directly by reference to actual cash flows implicit in
observable market prices or through modelling cash flows using
appropriate financial-markets pricing models. 
The effect of discounting expected cash flows back to present value is
achieved by constructing discount curves derived from the market price
of the most appropriate observable interest rate products such as
deposits, interest rate futures and swaps. The calculation of fair value 
for any financial instrument may also require adjustment of the quoted
price or model value to reflect the cost of credit risk (where not
embedded in underlying models or prices used), or to reflect hedging
costs not captured in pricing models (to the extent they would be taken
into account by a market participant in determining a price).
Derivatives used for hedging purposes are measured on an accruals
basis consistent with the assets, liabilities, positions or future cash flows
being hedged. The gains and losses on these instruments (arising from
changes in fair value) are not recognised in the income statement
immediately as they arise. Such gains are either not recognised in the
balance sheet or are recognised and carried forward. When the hedged
transaction occurs, the gain or loss is recognised in the income

statement at the same time as the hedged item. The criteria required for
a derivative instrument to be classified as a designated hedge are that:
(i) the transaction must be reasonably expected to match or eliminate
a significant proportion of the risk inherent in the assets, liabilities,
other positions or cash flows being hedged and which results from
potential movements in market rates and credit risk; and 
(ii) adequate evidence of the intention to hedge and linkage with the
underlying risk inherent in the assets, liabilities, other positions or
cash flows being hedged, must be established at the outset of the
transaction. 
Designated hedges are reviewed for effectiveness by regular tests to
determine that the hedge is closely negatively correlated to the
designated hedged position in each and every identified time band in
the maturity profile.
Profits and losses on interest rate swaps and options entered into for
hedging purposes are measured on an accrual accounting basis,
included in the related category of income and expense and reported as
part of the yield on the hedged transaction. Amounts paid or received
over the life of futures contracts are deferred until the contract is closed;
accumulated deferred amounts on futures contracts and settlement
amounts paid or received on forward contracts are accounted for as
elements of the carrying value of the associated instrument, affecting
the resulting yield.
A premium paid or received in respect of a credit derivative hedging an
asset or liability is amortised over the life of the protection purchased or
sold against either interest payable or interest receivable. Where a credit
event occurs which triggers a recovery under the credit derivative, then
the recovery will be offset against the profit and loss charge on the
underlying asset or liability.
Foreign exchange contracts which qualify as hedges of foreign currency
exposures, including positions relating to investments the Group makes
outside the UK, are retranslated at the closing rate with any forward
premium or discount recognised over the life of the contract in net
interest income.
Profits and losses related to qualifying hedges, including foreign
exchange contracts, of firm commitments and probable anticipated
transactions are deferred and recognised in income or as adjustments
to carrying amounts when the hedged transactions occur.
Hedging transactions that are superseded or cease to be effective 
are measured at fair value. Any profit or loss on these transactions,
together with any profit or loss arising on hedging transactions that 
are terminated prior to the end of the life of the asset, are deferred and
amortised into interest income or expense over the remaining life of 
the item previously being hedged. When the underlying asset, liability
position or cash flow is terminated prior to the hedging transaction, 
or an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedging
transaction is measured on the fair value accounting basis, as described
in the section on derivatives used for trading purposes below, prior to
being transferred to the trading portfolio. The profit or loss arising from
the fair value measurement prior to the transfer to the trading portfolio
is included in the category of income or expense relating to the
previously hedged transaction.
13. Property, plant and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and provisions for impairment, if any. Additions and subsequent
expenditures are capitalised only to the extent that they enhance the
future economic benefits expected to be derived from the assets.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property
and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
economic lives. The depreciable amount is the gross carrying amount,
less the estimated residual value at the end of its useful economic life. 
The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation:
Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property
(more than 50 years to run) 2-3.3%
Leasehold property Over the remaining
(less than 50 years to run) life of the lease
Costs of adaptation of freehold and 
leasehold property
(a)
7-10%
Equipment installed in freehold and
leasehold property
(a)
7-10%
Computers and similar equipment 20-33%
Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 10-20%
Note
(a) Where leasehold property has a remaining useful life of less than 15 years,
costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the
remaining life of the lease.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the
calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment
are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances. 
When deciding on depreciation rates and methods, the principal factors
the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological
developments and expected market requirements for, and the expected
pattern of usage of, the assets. When reviewing residual values, the
Group estimates the amount that it would currently obtain for the
disposal of the asset after deducting the estimated cost of disposal if the
asset were already of the age and condition expected at the end of its
useful economic life. 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land, although, in common 
with all long-lived assets, it is subject to impairment testing, if deemed
appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income
statement.
14. Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated entities
and joint ventures, and represents the excess of the fair value of the
purchase consideration and direct costs of making the acquisition, 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the assets acquired, and 
the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of 
the acquisition.
For the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to
market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present
value. This discounting is either performed using market rates or by
using risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows.
Goodwill is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment, or more
frequently when there are indications that impairment may have
occurred. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose
of impairment testing. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint
ventures is included in the amount of the investment. Gains and losses
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of the goodwill
relating to the entity sold.
The carrying amount of goodwill in the UK GAAP balance sheet as at
31st December 2003 has been brought forward without adjustment on
transition to IFRSs.
Computer software
Computer software is stated at cost, less amortisation and provisions
for impairment, if any. 
The identifiable and directly associated external and internal costs of
acquiring and developing software are capitalised where the software is controlled by the Group, and where it is probable that future economic
benefits that exceed its cost will flow from its use over more than one
year. Costs associated with maintaining software are recognised as an
expense when incurred.
Capitalised computer software is amortised over three to five years.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets consist of brands, customer lists, licences and
other contracts, core deposit intangibles, mortgage servicing rights and
customer relationships. Other intangible assets are initially recognised
when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights,
the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets
not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future
economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use. The
value of intangible assets which are acquired in a business combination
is generally determined using income approach methodologies such as
the discounted cash flow method and the relief from royalty method
that estimate net cash flows attributable to an asset over its economic
life and discount to present value using an appropriate rate of return
based on the cost of equity adjusted for risk.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation and
provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful
lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to
future cash flows, generally over 4-25 years. 
15. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, or more frequently where events or changes
in circumstances dictate, property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, are assessed for indications of impairment. If indications are
present, these assets are subject to an impairment review. Goodwill is
subject to an impairment review as at the balance sheet date each year.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount
of the asset with its recoverable amount: the higher of the asset’s or the
cash-generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use. Net selling
price is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could
be disposed of in a binding sale agreement in an arms-length
transaction evidenced by an active market or recent transactions for
similar assets. Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected
future cash flows obtainable as a result of the asset’s continued use,
including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based
discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by 
the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the income
statement in the period in which it occurs. A previously recognised
impairment loss relating to a fixed asset may be reversed in part or in full
when a change in circumstances leads to a change in the estimates used
to determine the fixed asset’s recoverable amount. The carrying amount
of the fixed asset will only be increased up to the amount that it would
have been had the original impairment not been recognised. Impairment
losses on goodwill are not reversed. For the purpose of conducting
impairment reviews, cash-generating units are the lowest level at which
management monitors the return on investment on assets.
16. Financial guarantees
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to
make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs
because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in
accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and
other bodies on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and
other banking facilities (‘facility guarantees’), and to other parties in
connection with the performance of customers under obligations
related to contracts, advance payments made by other parties, tenders,
retentions and the payment of import duties.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements
at fair value on the date that the guarantee was given. Other than where
the fair value option is applied, subsequent to initial recognition, the
bank’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of
the initial measurement, less amortisation calculated to recognise in the
income statement the fee income earned over the period, and the best
estimate of the expenditure required to settle any financial obligation
arising as a result of the guarantees at the balance sheet date. 
Any increase in the liability relating to guarantees is taken to the income
statement in Provisions for undrawn contractually committed facilities
and guarantees provided. Any liability remaining is recognised in the
income statement when the guarantee is discharged, cancelled or
expires.
17. Issued debt and equity securities
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as
liabilities where the contractual arrangement results in the Group
having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial
asset to the holder, to exchange financial instruments on terms that are
potentially unfavourable or to satisfy the obligation otherwise than by
the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a
fixed number of equity shares. Issued financial instruments, or their
components, are classified as equity where they meet the definition of
equity and confer on the holder a residual interest in the assets of the
Company. The components of issued financial instruments that contain
both liability and equity elements are accounted for separately with the
equity component being assigned the residual amount after deducting
from the instrument as a whole the amount separately determined as
the fair value of the liability component.
Financial liabilities, other than trading liabilities and financial liabilities
designated at fair value, are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method as set out in policy 6. Derivatives embedded in financial
liabilities that are not designated at fair value are accounted for as set
out in policy 12. Equity instruments, including share capital, are initially
recognised at net proceeds, after deducting transaction costs and any
related income tax. Dividend and other payments to equity holders are
deducted from equity, net of any related tax.
Prior to 1st January 2005
Debt securities in issue and similar securities are stated at the net issue
proceeds adjusted for amortisation of premiums, discounts and
expenses related to their issue where the liability is a fixed amount.
Where the liability fluctuates, based on, for example, the performance of
an index then the debt security reflects the current value of the liability.
Loan capital in issue is stated at the net issue proceeds adjusted for
amortisation of premiums, discounts and expenses related to their
issue. Amortisation is calculated in order to achieve a constant yield
across the life of the instrument.
18. Share capital
Share issue costs
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or
options including those issued on the acquisition of a business are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period 
in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by the Barclays PLC (the
Company) shareholders.
Treasury shares
Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the
Company’s share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from
shareholders’ equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where
such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration
received is included in shareholders’ equity.

19. Insurance contracts and investment contracts
The Group offers wealth management, term assurance, annuity,
property and payment protection insurance products to customers 
that take the form of long- and short-term insurance contracts.
The Group classifies its wealth management and other products as
insurance contracts where these transfer significant insurance risk,
generally where the benefits payable on the occurrence of an insured
event are at least 5% more than the benefits that would be payable if 
the insured event does not occur. 
Barclays Wealth contracts that do not contain significant insurance 
risk or discretionary participation features are classified as investment
contracts. Financial assets and liabilities relating to investment
contracts, and assets backing insurance contracts are classified and
measured as appropriate under IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’.
Long-term insurance contracts 
These contracts, insure events associated with human life (for example,
death or survival) over a long duration. Premiums are recognised as
revenue when they become payable by the contract holder. Claims and
surrenders are accounted for when notified. Maturities on the policy
maturity date and regular withdrawals are accounted for when due. 
A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in 
the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised, based on the
expected discounted value of the benefit payments and directly related
administration costs, less the expected discounted value of the future
premiums that would be required to meet the benefits and other
expenses. The calculation of the liability contains assumptions
regarding mortality, maintenance expenses and investment income. 
Liabilities under unit-linked life insurance contracts (such as
endowment policies) in addition reflect the value of assets held within
unitised investment pools. 
Short-term insurance contracts
Under its payment protection insurance products the Group is
committed to paying benefits to the policyholder rather than forgiving
interest or principal on the occurrence of an insured event, such as
unemployment, sickness, or injury. Property insurance contracts mainly
compensate the policyholders for damage to their property or for the
value of property lost.
Premiums are recognised as revenue proportionally over the period of
the coverage. Claims and claims handling costs are charged to income
as incurred, based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to
policyholders arising from events that have occurred up to the balance
sheet date even if they have not yet been reported to the Group, based
on assessments of individual cases reported to the Group and statistical
analyses for the claims incurred but not reported.
Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
Commissions and other costs that are related to securing new
insurance and investment contracts are capitalised and amortised over
the estimated lives of the relevant contracts. 
Deferred income liability
Fees that are designed to recover commissions and other costs related
to either securing new insurance and investment contracts or renewing
existing investment contracts are included as a liability and amortised
over the estimated life of the contract. 
Value of business acquired
On acquisition of a portfolio of contracts, such as through the acquisition
of a subsidiary , the Group recognises an intangible asset representing the
value of business acquired (VOBA), representing the future profits
embedded in acquired insurance contracts and investment contracts
with a discretionary participation feature. The asset is amortised over the
remaining terms of the acquired contracts. 
Liability adequacy test
Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to
ensure the adequacy of contract liabilities net of DAC and VOBA assets.
Current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling
and administration costs, and investment returns from the assets
backing the liabilities are taken into account in the tests. Where a
deficiency is highlighted by the test, DAC and VOBA assets are written
off first, and insurance liabilities increased when these are written off in
full. Any deficiency is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Reinsurance
Short- and long-term insurance business is ceded to reinsurers under
contracts to transfer part or all of one or more of the following risks:
mortality, investment and expenses. All such contracts are dealt with as
insurance contracts. The benefits to which the Group is entitled under
its reinsurance contracts are recognised as reinsurance assets. The
Group assesses reinsurance assets at each balance sheet date. If there 
is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of the
reinsurance asset is reduced accordingly resulting in a charge to the
income statement.
Prior to 1st January 2005
The Group treated all products taking the legal form of an insurance
contract as insurance contracts.
From 1st January 2004 the Group has chosen to change its accounting
policy in relation to insurance contracts to use Modified Statutory
Solvency Basis rather than an Embedded Value basis to account 
for insurance policies in the UK. This change resulted in insurance
contracts and investment contracts being accounted for on a similar
basis and represents the most appropriate accounting policy in the
circumstances. This change in policy reduced other operating income
by £47m in 2004 and reduced retained earnings by £592m as at 
1st January 2004. The impact on earnings per share was immaterial. 
20. Leases
Lessor
Assets leased to customers under agreements, which transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, with or without
ultimate legal title, are classified as finance leases. When assets are held
subject to a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments,
discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease, is recognised as 
a receivable. The difference between the total payments receivable
under the lease and the present value of the receivable is recognised as
unearned finance income, which is allocated to accounting periods
under the pre-tax net investment method to reflect a constant periodic
rate of return.
Assets leased to customers under agreements which do not transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
operating leases. The leased assets are included within property, plant
and equipment on the Group’s balance sheet and depreciation is
provided on the depreciable amount of these assets on a systematic
basis over their estimated useful lives. Lease income is recognised on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic
basis is more appropriate. 
Lessee
The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless
another systematic basis is more appropriate.
21. Employee benefits
The Group provides employees worldwide with post-retirement benefits
mainly in the form of pensions. The Group operates a number of
pension schemes which may be funded or unfunded and of a defined
contribution or defined benefit nature. In addition, the Group
contributes, according to local law in the various countries in which it operates, to Governmental and other plans which have the
characteristics of defined contribution plans. 
For defined benefit schemes, actuarial valuation of each of the scheme’s
obligations using the projected unit credit method and the fair valuation
of each of the scheme’s assets are performed annually, using the
assumptions set out in Note 35. The difference between the fair value of
the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at
the balance sheet date, adjusted for any historic unrecognised actuarial
gains or losses and past service cost, is recognised as a liability in the
balance sheet. An asset, arising for example, as a result of past over
funding or the performance of the plan investments, is recognised to
the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future
contribution holidays or refunds of contributions. 
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of
the assets or 10% of the obligations of the plan are recognised in the
income statement over the remaining average service lives of the
employees of the related plan, on a straight-line basis.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group recognises contributions
due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement. Any
contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
The Group also provides health care to certain retired employees, which
are accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period of
employment, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit
pensions plans. 
Short-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, and
other benefits, are accounted for on an accruals basis over the period
which employees have provided services in the year. Bonuses are
recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its
employees that can be measured reliably.
All expenses related to employee benefits are recognised in the income
statement in staff costs, which is included within operating expenses.
22. Share-based payments to employees
The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions
in respect of services received from certain of its employees. The fair
value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value
of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost
of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share
options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period
that the services are received, which is the vesting period. The fair value
of the options granted is determined using option pricing models,
which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current
share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share
price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Except for
those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting
conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account
in estimating fair value. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into
account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in
the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately,
the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the number of
vested shares or share options. Where vesting conditions are related to
market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised
regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met,
provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met. 
23. Provisions
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as
consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a
transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation,
and it can be reliably estimated.
When a leasehold property ceases to be used in the business or a
demonstrable commitment has been made to cease to use a property
where the costs exceed the benefits of the property, provision is made,
where the unavoidable costs of the future obligations relating to the
lease are expected to exceed anticipated rental income and other
benefits. The net costs are discounted using market rates of interest 
to reflect the long-term nature of the cash flows. 
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including
redundancy costs when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when
the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and
has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring 
by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features. 
The provision raised is normally utilised within nine months.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be
confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where
the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably
measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed
unless they are remote.
24. Taxes, including deferred taxes
Income tax payable on taxable profits (‘current tax’), is recognised 
as an expense in the period in which the profits arise. Income tax
recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as an asset only to 
the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against current 
or future taxable profits.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
temporary timing differences arising from the differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantially enacted by the
balance sheet date and is expected to apply when the deferred tax asset
is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred and current 
tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax
reporting group and where there is both the legal right and the intention
to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
25. Segment reporting
Business segments are distinguishable components of the Group that
provide products or services that are subject to risks and rewards that are
different to those of other business segments. Geographical segments
provide products or services within a particular economic environment
that is subject to risks and rewards that are different to those of
components operating in other economic environments. Business
segments are the primary reporting segments. Group costs are allocated
to segments on a reasonable and consistent basis. Transactions between
segments are generally accounted for in accordance with Group policies
as if the segment were a stand-alone business with intra-segment
revenue and costs being eliminated in Head office.
The analyses by geographical segment is based on the location of 
the customer.
26. Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash comprises cash on
hand and demand deposits, and cash equivalents comprise highly liquid
investments that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of
changes in value with original maturities of less than three months.
Trading balances, repos and reverse repos are not considered to be part
of cash equivalents.
27. Trust activities
The Group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities
that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals,
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and
income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as
they are not assets of the Group.

Changes in Accounting Presentation
In order to provide more relevance to users and to enhance the
comparability of its financial statement presentation, the Group has
reformatted the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of
cash flows and certain notes to the accounts, including the presentation
of discrete notes that contain information regarding securitisations and
leasing disclosed elsewhere in the accounts for 2005. Where appropriate,
comparative figures have been re-presented to conform with the current
year presentation. Previously reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity ,
profits and changes in cash and cash equivalents have not been affected
by the changes.
Changes in presentation affecting cash flows in 2005 and 2004 have
been disclosed in Note 42.
Future Accounting Developments
IFRS 7 (‘Financial Instruments Disclosures’) and an amendment to IAS 1
(‘Presentation of Financial Statements’) on capital disclosures were
issued by the IASB in August 2005 for application in accounting periods
beginning on or after 1st January 2007 and have been adopted by the
European Commission. The new or revised disclosures will be adopted
by the Group for reporting in 2007. 
The following International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) interpretations issued during 2005 and 2006 which first apply to
accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2007 are not
expected to result in any changes to the Group’s accounting policies:
•
Interpretation 7 – Applying the Restatement Approach under 
IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies
•
Interpretation 8 – Scope of IFRS 2
•
Interpretation 9 – Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
•
Interpretation 10 – Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment
Consideration will be given during 2007 to the implications, if any , of the
following IFRIC interpretations issued during 2006 which would first
apply to the Group accounting period beginning on 1st January 2008:
•
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions
• 
IFRIC 12 – Service Concession Arrangements
IFRS 8 Operating Segments was issued in November 2006 and would
first be required to be applied to the Group accounting period beginning
on 1st January 2009. The standard replaces IAS 14 Segmental Reporting
and would align operating segmental reporting with segments reported
to senior management as well as requiring amendments and additions
to the existing segmental reporting disclosures. The Group is
considering the advantages that permitted early adoption in 2007 
may make to the transparency of the segmental disclosures.
US GAAP
Significant differences exist between accounting principles generally
accepted under IFRS and those generally accepted in the US. The effect
of US GAAP on profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and
shareholders’ equity excluding minority interest for Barclays PLC Group

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the number of basic weighted
average number of shares excluding own shares held in employee benefits trusts, currently not vested, and shares held for trading.
When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the conversion of outstanding
options into shares within Absa Group Limited and Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited. The weighted average number of ordinary shares
excluding own shares held in employee benefit trusts, currently not vested, and shares held for trading, is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares, totalling 150 million (2005: 149 million, 2004: 124 million).
Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31st December 2006, 5 million were anti-dilutive (2005: nil, 2004: 51 million).
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group continued to make on-market purchases of treasury shares under its various employee share
schemes. No adjustment has been made to earnings per share in respect of these purchases. Notes to the accounts

A portion of the Group’s fund management business takes the legal form of insurance policies, under which legal title to the underlying investment 
is held by the Group, but the inherent risks and rewards in the investments are borne by the customer. In the normal course of business, the Group’s
financial interest in such investments is restricted to fees for investment management services.
Due to the nature of these contracts, the carrying value of the assets is always the same as the value of the liabilities and any change in the value of
the assets results in an equal but opposite change in the value of the amounts due to the policyholders.
In the balance sheet, the assets are included as ‘Financial assets designated at fair value – held in respect of linked liabilities to customers under
investment contracts’. Cash balances within the portfolio have been included in the Group’s cash balances. The associated obligation to deliver the
value of the investments to customers at their fair value on balance sheet date is included as ‘Liabilities to customers under investment contracts’. 
The increase/decrease in the value arising from the return on the investments and the corresponding increase/decrease in linked liabilities to
customers is included in the Other income note in Note 6. Notes to the accounts

14 Derivative financial instruments 
Financial instruments
The Group’s objectives and policies on managing the risks that arise in connection with derivatives, including the policies for hedging, are included in
Note 52 to Note 56 under the headings, ‘Financial Risk’, ‘Interest Rate Risk’, ‘Credit Risk’, ‘Currency Risk’ and ‘Liquidity Risk’.
The notional amounts of certain types of financial instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet 
but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate
the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) as a result of
fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms. The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on
hand, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and, thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities
can fluctuate significantly.
The fair value of a derivative contract represents the amount at which that contract could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction, calculated at
market rates current at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values and notional amounts of derivative instruments held for trading are set out in the following table:

2006 2005
£m £m
At beginning of year 3,450 2,637
Acquisitions and disposals (23) 555
Unwind of discount (98) (76)

Recoveries 259 222
Amounts charged against profit 2,074 1,574
At end of year 3,335 3,450
Allowances for loan impairment represent management’s estimate of the losses incurred in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. For the
retail and small business portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics, statistical
techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis. These models contain judgemental inputs. The impairment charge 
in relation to retail and small business portfolios is £1,809m or 87% (2005: £1,254m or 80%) of the total impairment charge in 2006. For larger
accounts, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis using discounted expected future cash flows. Subjective judgements are
made in this process. Changes in these estimates could result in a change in allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge in relation to larger accounts is £265m or 13% (2005: £320m or 20%) of the total impairment charge in 2006.

Reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed are accounted for as collateralised loans. It is the Group’s policy to seek
collateral at the outset equal to 100% to 105% of the loan amount. The level of collateral held is monitored daily and further collateral calls made to
bring the level of cash held and the market value of collateral in line with the loan balance. 
Under certain transactions, including reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing transactions, the Group is allowed to sell or repledge the
collateral held. The fair value at the balance sheet date of collateral accepted and repledged to others was as follows:

21 Current and deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off and the balances relate to income tax levied by
the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within the same tax group where there is the intention and
ability to settle on a net basis or realise the assets and liabilities simultaneously.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is £1,046m (2005: £982m).
The amount of deferred tax asset expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is £1,582m (2005: £1,686m).
The deferred tax assets balance includes £106m (2005: £27m) which is the excess deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities in entities which
have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year. This is based on management assessment that it is probable that the relevant entities will have
taxable profits against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The deferred tax charge/(credit) in the income statement comprises the following temporary differences:

The following tax losses expire: £3m in 2007 and £4m in 2009. The other tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences do not expire under
current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will
be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax
liabilities have not been recognised is £3,387m (2005: £2,126m). Notes to the accounts

Goodwill is allocated to business operations. The recoverable amount of each operation’s goodwill is based on value-in-use calculations using an
appropriate pre-tax cost of equity for the market and associated risk. The principal goodwill relating to UK Banking and International Retail and
Commercial Banking are Woolwich and Absa respectively.
Woolwich and Absa future cash flows are based on approved budgets and plans. Woolwich has applied a growth factor of 3% (proxy for inflation) to
cash flows for the period 2010 to 2020. Absa has applied a growth rate of 8% to cash flows for the four years from 2010 to 2013 and a rate of 4% for
the years from 2014 to 2020.
Both businesses justify the use of longer cash flow projections due to the long-term nature of these businesses within the Barclays Group. Barclays PLC

Operating leased assets represent assets such as plant and equipment leased to customers under operating leases. 
Certain of the Group’s equipment is held on finance leases. See Note 41.
Impairment of £14m follows a review of the future use of an existing office building in our UK property portfolio. In 2007 the freehold of the building
will be disposed of by either a short- or long-term leaseback, depending on the conclusions of the review. Consequently the value has been written
down to fair value, less cost of sale.
The carrying value of property on transition to IFRS was the deemed cost. The following table shows the historical cost of property:

Assumptions used to measure insurance liabilities
The assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised above, and the processes used to determine them
were as follows:
Long-term business – linked and non-linked
Mortality – mortality estimates are based on standard industry and national mortality tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect the Group’s own
experience. A margin is added to ensure prudence – for example, future mortality improvements for annuity business.
Renewal expenses level and inflation – expense reserves are a small part of overall insurance liabilities, however, increases in expenses caused by
unanticipated inflation or other unforeseen factors could lead to expense reserve increases. Expenses are therefore set using prudent assumptions.
Initial renewal expense levels are set by considering expense forecasts for the business and, where appropriate, building in a margin to allow for the
increasing burden of fixed costs on the UK closed life book of business. The inflation assumption is set by adding a margin to the market rate of
inflation implied by index-linked gilt yields.
Short-term business
Short-term business – for single premium policies the proportion of unearned premiums is calculated based on estimates of the frequency and
severity of incidents.
Changes in assumptions
Sensitivity analysis regarding changes in these assumptions are described under the heading ‘Sensitivity Analysis’ on page 206. There have been no
changes in assumptions in 2006 that have had a material effect on the financial statements.
Notes to the accounts
For the year ended 31st December 2006
Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 194 31 Insurance assets and liabilities (continued)
Uncertainties associated with cash flows related to insurance contracts and risk management activities
Long-term insurance contracts (linked and non-linked)
For long-term insurance contracts where death is the insured risk, the most significant factors that could detrimentally affect the frequency and
severity of claims are the incidence of disease, such as AIDS, or general changes in lifestyle, such as in eating, exercise and smoking. Where survival 
is the insured risk, advances in medical care and social conditions are the key factors that increase longevity.
The Group manages its exposure to risk by operating in part as a unit-linked business, prudent product design, applying strict underwriting criteria,
transferring risk to reinsurers, managing claims and establishing prudent reserves.
Short-term insurance contracts
For payment protection contracts where inability to make payments under a loan contract is the insured risk, the most significant factors are the
health of the policyholder and the possibility of unemployment which depends upon, among other things, long-term and short-term economic
factors. The Group manages its exposure to such risks through prudent product design, efficient claims management, prudent reserving
methodologies and bases, regular product, economic and market reviews and regular adequacy tests on the size of the reserves.
Absa insures property and motor vehicles, for which the most significant factors that could effect the frequency and severity of claims are climatic
change and crime. Absa manages its exposure to risk by diversifying insurance risks accepted and transferring risk to reinsurers.
Sensitivity analysis
The following table presents the sensitivity of the level of insurance contract liabilities disclosed in this note to movements in the actuarial
assumptions used to calculate them. The percentage change in variable is applied to a range of existing actuarial modelling assumptions to derive
the possible impact on net profit after tax. The disclosure is not intended to explain the impact of a percentage change in the insurance assets and
liabilities disclosed above.
2006 2005
Net profit Net profit
Change in after tax Change in after tax
variable impact variable impact
%£m %£m
Long-term insurance contracts:
Improving mortality (annuitants only) 10 23 10 19
Worsening of mortality (assured lives only) 10 25 10 28
Worsening of base renewal expense level 20 23 20 20
Worsening of expense inflation rate 10 9 10 5
Short-term insurance contracts:
Worsening of claim expense assumptions 10 9 10 13
Any change in net profit after tax would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in shareholders’ equity.
The above analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur.
Options and guarantees
The Group’s contracts do not contain options or guarantees that could confer material risk.

The Bank is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its Undated Notes and Loans excluding the 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the
preceding six months, a dividend has not been declared or paid on any class of shares of Barclays PLC or, in certain cases, any class of preference
shares of the Bank. The Bank is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the immediately
preceding 12 months interest period, a dividend has not been paid on any class of its share capital. Interest not so paid becomes payable in each case
if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. During the year, the Bank declared and paid dividends on its ordinary shares
and on all classes of preference shares.
No payment of principal or any interest may be made unless the Bank satisfies a specified solvency test.
The Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the RCIs ((b) and (c) above). Any such deferred payment of interest must be paid on the
earlier of (i) the date of redemption of the RCIs, and (ii) the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the tenth anniversary of the date of deferral
of such payment. Whilst such deferral is continuing, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions,
on any of its ordinary shares or Preference Shares.
The Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in
non-compliance with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the FSA. Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a
redemption of the TONs. Until such time as the Bank next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may 
(a) declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or Preference Shares, or make payments 
of interest in respect of the Bank’s Reserve Capital Instruments and (b) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their
respective share capital and certain other securities also apply. Barclays PLC

of dated loan capital by the Bank, Barclays Spain, BBG, BBB, Barclays Zambia and Absa, which were made in non-US markets, have not been so
registered. With respect to the 7.4% Notes, the Bank is not obliged to make (i) a payment of interest on any interest payment date unless a dividend 
is paid on any class of share capital and (ii) a payment of principal until six months after the respective maturity date with respect to such Notes.
Repayment terms
Unless otherwise indicated, the Group’s dated loan capital outstanding at 31st December 2006 is redeemable only on maturity, subject in particular
cases, to provisions allowing an early redemption in the event of certain changes in tax law or, in the case of BBB and Barclays Zambia to certain
changes in legislation or regulations.
Any repayments prior to maturity require in the case of the Bank, the prior approval of the FSA, in the case of BBB, the prior approval of the Bank of
Botswana, in the case of Barclays Zambia, the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia, and in the case of Absa, the prior approval of the South African
Registrar of Banks.

Provisions expected to be recovered or settled within no more than 12 months after 31st December 2006 were £388m (2005: £360m).
Sundry provisions are made with respect to commission clawbacks, warranties and litigation claims.
The Group has a restructuring programme, largely focused on activities within the UK, which involves the reshaping of the Group’s operations
through the centralisation of core processes, application of new technologies, and reduction of workforce. It is anticipated that the majority of the
remaining provision related to this programme will be utilised in 2007.
Redundancy and restructuring provisions are reported within operating expenses in the income statements. 34 Securitisations
During the year, the Group has engaged in securitisation transactions involving Barclays residential mortgage loans, business loans and credit card
balances. In addition, the Group acts as a conduit for commercial paper, whereby it acquires static pools of residential mortgage loans from other
lending institutions for securitisation transactions.
In these transactions, the assets, or interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special
purpose entity, or to a trust which then transfers its beneficial interests to a special purpose entity, which then issues floating rate debt securities to
third-party investors. 
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement: result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the
debt securities issued in the transaction; partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in those
assets; or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the
transfer. Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets and
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk. 
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets, stated at the amount of the Group’s continuing involvement where appropriate,
together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset in the balance sheet:

Retained interests in residential mortgage loans include interest only strips which represent a continuing exposure to the prepayment and credit risk
in the underlying securitised assets, the total amount of which was £15,063m (2005: £6,291m). These are initially recorded as an allocation of the
original carrying amount based on the relative fair values of the portion derecognised and the portion retained.

35 Retirement benefit obligations
Pension schemes
The UK Retirement Fund (UKRF), which is the main scheme of the Group, amounting to 91% of all the Group’s schemes in terms of benefit
obligations, comprises five sections.
The 1964 Pension Scheme
Most employees recruited before July 1997 are members of this non-contributory defined benefit scheme. Pensions are calculated by reference to
service and pensionable salary and are normally subject to a deduction from State pension age.
The Retirement Investment Scheme (RIS)
A defined contribution plan for most joiners between July 1997 and 1st October 2003. This was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2003 and the
large majority of existing members of the RIS transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit accrual with effect from 1st January 2004. There are
now no longer any active members of the RIS.
The Pension Investment Plan (PIP)
A defined contribution plan created from 1st July 2001 to provide benefits for certain employees of Barclays Capital. 
afterwork
Combines a contributory cash balance element with a voluntary defined contribution element. New employees since 1st October 2003 are eligible 
to join afterwork. In addition, the large majority of active members of the RIS (now closed) were transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit
accrual after 1st January 2004.
Career Average Section
The Career Average Section was established in the UKRF with effect from 1st May 2004 following the transfer of members from the Woolwich
Pension Fund. The Career Average Section is a non-contributory career average scheme and was closed to new entrants on 1st December 2006.
In addition, the costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits are generally borne by the UKRF for each of the five sections.
Governance
The assets of the UKRF are held separately from the assets of the Group and are administered by trustees.
Barclays Pension Fund Trustees Ltd (BPFTL) acts as corporate trustee for the UKRF. BPFTL is a private limited company, incorporated on 
20th December 1990, and is a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
As the corporate trustee for the UKRF, BPFTL is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF and BPFTL holds these assets in trust for the beneficiaries 
of the scheme.
BPFTL comprises nine Directors, of which six are Employer Directors selected by the Bank and three are Employee Directors nominated by the
Pension Fund Advisory Committee (PFAC). Employee Directors are selected from those eligible active employees and pensioner members who apply
to be considered for the role.
Employee Director vacancies are advertised to all eligible active and pensioner members. This enables any eligible member with an interest in
becoming an Employee Director to express that interest and be considered for the role. The PFAC provides the mechanism through which Employee
Directors are selected. The PFAC will accept nominations from eligible members and select from amongst all properly nominated candidates. 
There are also three Alternate Employer Directors and three Alternate Employee Directors. The selection process for these appointments are as
detailed above. The role of alternate directors is to provide cover for individual directors, should they not be available for meetings.
Currently, the Bank decides the funding rate after consulting with the trustees. Under the Pensions Act 2004, which has practical impact for the UKRF
from its next triennial valuation due in September 2007, the Bank and the trustee must agree the funding rate (including a recovery plan to fund any
deficit against the scheme specific statutory funding objective).
In addition to the UKRF, there are other defined benefit and defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas. The same approach to pensions
governance applies to the other schemes in the UK but different legislation covers schemes outside of the UK where in most cases the Bank has the
power to determine the funding rate. Notes to the accounts

The UKRF deficit measured using the IAS 19 assumptions has decreased over the year from £2.5bn at 31st December 2005 to £0.5bn at 
31st December 2006. Among the reasons for this change were greater than expected returns on assets and an increase in AA long-term corporate
bond yields which resulted in a higher discount rate of 5.12% (31st December 2005: 4.83%), partially offset by an increase in the inflation
assumption to 3.08% (31st December 2005: 2.75%). A number of additional changes were made to the assumptions used in valuing the liabilities,
including a decrease in the assumed rate of real salary increases to 1% (31st December 2005: 1.55%), a change in the assumption regarding pension
increases to recognise the caps and floors which apply to guaranteed pension increases, and the introduction of an explicit allowance for early
retirement and commutation. Mortality assumptions remain unchanged from those in force at 31st December 2005.
The Group operates a number of schemes that are insured with third-party insurers. Reimbursement rights of £60m in relation to these schemes
have been included within Other assets. The present value of the benefits payable under these schemes is £60m and has been included within the
net pension liability recognised on the balance sheet. 
The IAS 19 pension surplus of the Absa Group Pension Fund as at 31st December 2006 was £60m (2005: £90m). A net IAS 19 liability of £nil 
(2005: £nil) has been recognised on the balance sheet (consisting of £286m defined benefit obligation (2005: £335m) and £286m fair value of plan
assets (2005: £335m)). These balances are not recognised in the financial statements of the Absa Group Limited in accordance with South African
legislative requirements. Notes to the accounts

Assumptions
Obligations arising under defined benefit schemes are actuarially valued using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, where a defined
benefit scheme is closed to new members, such as in the case of the 1964 Pension Scheme, the current service cost expressed as a percentage of
salary is expected to increase in the future, although this higher rate will be applied to a decreasing payroll. The latest actuarial IAS valuations were
carried out as at 31st December using the following assumptions:
UK schemes Overseas schemes
2006 2005 2006 2005
% p.a. % p.a. % p.a. % p.a.
Discount rate 5.12 4.83 6.94 7.42
Rate of increase in salaries 4.08 4.30 5.66 5.93
Inflation rate 3.08 2.75 3.94 4.11

Rate of increase for pensions in deferment 3.08 2.75 2.24 2.97
Initial health care inflation 8.93 10.00 9.93 10.87
Long-term health care inflation 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.03
Expected return on plan assets 6.32 6.30 7.89 8.58
The expected return on plan assets assumption is weighted on the basis of the fair value of these assets. Health care inflation assumptions are
weighted on the basis of the health care cost for the period. All other assumptions are weighted on the basis of the defined benefit obligation at the
end of the period.
The UK Schemes discount rate assumption is based on the yield on the iBoxx (over 15 year) AA corporate bond index.
The overseas health care inflation assumptions relate to the US and Mauritius.
Mortality assumptions
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UKRF were based on the standard tables P A92 as published by the
Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. These tables are considered to be most relevant to the population of the UKRF based on their mortality history . These
were then adjusted in line with both current industry experience and the actual experience of the UKRF’s own pensioners relative to the standard table.
An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the medium cohort projections published by the CMIB. On this basis the
post-retirement mortality assumptions for the UKRF are as follows:
2006 2005 2004 2003
Longevity at 60 for current pensioners (years)
– Males 25.8 25.8 25.7 23.3
– Females 29.5 29.5 29.4 26.4
Longevity at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 (years)
– Males 27.1 27.1 27.0 24.9
– Females 30.7 30.6 30.6 27.9

Assets
A long-term strategy has been set for the asset allocation of the UKRF which comprises a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate
assets. This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile 
than others. 
The long-term strategy ensures that investments are adequately diversified. Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset
allocation from the long-term strategy within control ranges agreed with the trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely 
to liabilities.
The value of the assets of the schemes, their percentage in relation to total scheme assets, and their expected rate of return at 31st December 2006

The UKRF plan assets include £27m relating to UK private equity investments (2005: £53m) and £447m relating to overseas private equity
investments (2005: £280m). These are disclosed within UK equities and Other equities respectively. 
Amounts included in the fair value of plan assets include £7m (2005: £4m) relating to shares in Barclays Group, £10m (2005: £1m) relating to bonds
issued by the Barclays Group, £1m (2005: £nil) relating to other investments in the Barclays Group, and £8m (2005: £5m) relating to property
occupied by Group companies.
The expected return on assets is determined by calculating a total return estimate based on weighted average estimated returns for each asset class.
Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as inflation, credit spreads and equity 
risk premiums.
The actual return on plan assets was £1,447m (2005: £2,499m).

Funding
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the UK Retirement Fund was performed in September 2004 and forms the basis of the Group’s
commitment that the fund has sufficient assets to make payments to members in respect of their accrued benefits as and when they fall due. 
This funding valuation uses a discount rate that reflects the assumed future return from the actual asset allocation at that date, and takes into
account projected future salary increases when assessing liabilities arising from accrued service. The funding valuation is updated annually on 
the basis of interim assumptions. The UK Retirement Fund recorded a funding surplus of £1.3bn as at 31st December 2006 (2005: £0.9bn).
The Group has agreed funding contributions which, in aggregate, are no less than those which are sufficient to meet the Group’s share of the cost 
of benefits accruing over each year. The Group has, in the recent past, chosen to make funding contributions in excess of this, more consistent with
the IAS service cost. 
Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:
£m
Contributions paid
2004 255
2005 354
2006 351
In 2007 the Group will follow the same funding approach, and expects to make a contribution to the UKRF of no less than £263m as per the schedule
of contributions agreed with the Trustee. The next triennial valuation will be performed in September 2007. To comply with the requirements of the
Pensions Act 2004, the Group and trustees plan to agree a scheme-specific funding target, statement of funding principles, and a schedule of
contributions which in 2008 will supersede those in place under the current actuarial funding valuation. 
Excluding the UKRF, the Group is expected to pay contributions of approximately £7m to UK schemes and £44m to overseas schemes in 2007. 
The Pensions Protection Fund (PPF) solvency ratio

for the main UK scheme as at 31st December 2006 was estimated to be 121%

Shares under option
The Group has four schemes that give employees rights to subscribe for shares in Barclays PLC. A summary of the key terms of each scheme are
included in Note 51.
At 31st December 2006, 78.9 million (2005: 85.7 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the Sharesave Share Option Scheme
(Sharesave), 1.7 million (2005: 2.6 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), 0.7 million
(2005: 1.3 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the Woolwich Executive Share Option Plan (Woolwich ESOP) and 77.5 million 
(2005: 105.1 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the Incentive Share Option Plan (ISOP), enabling certain Directors and members
of staff to subscribe for ordinary shares between 2006 and 2015 at prices ranging from 176p to 562p. 
In addition to the above, the independent trustee of the Barclays Group (ESAS) Employees’ Benefit Trust (ESAS Trust), established by Barclays Bank
PLC in 1996, operates the Executive Share Award Scheme (ESAS). ESAS is a deferred share bonus plan for employees of the Group. The key terms of
the ESAS are described in Note 51. The independent trustees of the ESAS Trust make awards of Barclays shares and grant options over Barclays
shares to beneficiaries of the ESAS Trust. Beneficiaries of the ESAS Trust include employees and former employees of the Barclays Group.
The independent trustee of the Barclays Group (PSP and ESOS) Employees’ Benefit Trust (PSP Trust), established by Barclays Bank PLC in 1996,
operates the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and may satisfy awards under the ESOS. No awards have been made under this trust since 1999. 
All awards are in the form of options over Barclays shares.
The Sharepurchase scheme which was established in 2002 is open to all eligible UK employees, including executive Directors. The key terms of the
Sharepurchase scheme are described in Note 51.
The total number of Barclays shares held in Group employee benefit trusts at 31st December 2006 was 168 million (2005: 148 million). Dividend
rights have been waived on nil (2005: nil) of these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year-end share price of 
£7.30 (2005: £6.11) was £1,227m (2005: £904m). As at 31st December 2006, options over 9.6 million (2005: 9.5 million) of the total shares held in
the trusts were exercisable.
Note
(a) The nominal value for share options issued during 2006 for the Executive Share Option Scheme and Woolwich ESOP was less than £500,000 in each case. Notes to the accounts

The Treasury shares primarily relate to shares held by employee benefit trusts, to the extent that they have not yet been expensed.
The Group operates in a number of countries subject to regulations under which a local subsidiary has to maintain a minimum level of capital. The
current policy of the Group is that local capital requirements are met, as far as possible, by the retention of profit. Certain countries operate exchange
control regulations which limit the amount of dividends that can be remitted to non-resident shareholders. It is not possible to determine the
amount of profit retained and other reserves that are restricted by these regulations, but the net profit retained of overseas subsidiaries, associates
and joint ventures at 31st December 2006 totalled £5,667m (2005: £3,980m). If such overseas reserves were to be remitted, other tax liabilities,
which have not been provided for in the accounts, might arise.

39 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Contingent liabilities and commitments
In common with other banks, the Group conducts business involving acceptances, performance bonds and indemnities. The majority of these
facilities are offset by corresponding obligations of third parties.
Nature of instruments
An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on a customer. The Group expects most acceptances to be presented, but
reimbursement by the customer is normally immediate. Endorsements are residual liabilities of the Group in respect of bills of exchange, which have
been paid and subsequently rediscounted.
Guarantees and letters of credit are given as security to support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Group will only be required to
meet these obligations in the event of the customer’s default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably below
their nominal amounts.
Other contingent liabilities include transaction related customs and performance bonds and are, generally, short-term commitments to third parties
which are not directly dependent on the customer’s creditworthiness.
Commitments to lend are agreements to lend to a customer in the future, subject to certain conditions. Such commitments are either made for a
fixed period, or have no specific maturity but are cancellable by the lender subject to notice requirements.
Documentary credits commit the Group to make payments to third parties, on production of documents, which are usually reimbursed immediately
by customers. Barclays PLC

40 Legal proceedings
Barclays has for some time been party to proceedings, including a class action, in the United States against a number of defendants following the
collapse of Enron; the class action claim is commonly known as the Newby litigation. On 20th July 2006 Barclays received an Order from the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division (the 'Court') which dismissed the claims against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank
PLC and Barclays Capital Inc. in the Newby litigation. On 4th December 2006, in response to the plaintiffs’ procedural objections, the Court stayed
Barclays dismissal from the proceedings and allowed the plaintiffs to file a supplemental complaint. The Court will consider the plaintiffs’
supplemental complaint in connection with consideration of a summary judgment motion filed by Barclays.
Barclays considers that the Enron related claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously. It is not possible to estimate Barclays
possible loss in relation to these matters, nor the effect that they might have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Barclays has been in negotiations with the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a settlement of the Commission’s
investigations of transactions between Barclays and Enron. Barclays does not expect that the amount of any settlement with the Commission would
have a significant adverse effect on its financial position or operating results.
On 3rd November 2006 Barclays announced that it had reached a settlement in principle with Enron in the Enron bankruptcy proceedings. 
A settlement agreement was signed on 30th November 2006 and became effective on 3rd January 2007. The settlement has had no negative impact
on Barclays earnings as an adequate provision had already been made for the likely cost in prior periods. In reaching the settlement Barclays has
denied any wrongdoing or liability. 
Barclays is engaged in various other litigation proceedings both in the United Kingdom and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the United
States, involving claims by and against it which arise in the ordinary course of business. Barclays does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the
proceedings to which Barclays is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the Group and Barclays has not disclosed the
contingent liabilities associated with these claims either because they cannot reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be
prejudicial to the conduct of the claims. Notes to the accounts

classifications within the cash flow statement in 2006. 
These changes have increased net cash from operating activities by £14,147m in 2005 (2004: £4,287m) with a corresponding decrease in net 
cash used in investing activities of £111m (2004: £12m increase) and decrease in net cash from financing activities of £14,036m (2004: £4,299m).
The amounts of cash and cash equivalents in 2005 and 2004 have not been affected by the changes.
Interest received in 2006 was £38,544m (2005: £32,124m, 2004: £20,301m) and interest paid in 2006 was £29,372m (2005: £23,319m,

48 Other entities
There are a number of entities that do not qualify as subsidiaries under UK Law but which are consolidated under IAS 27 (SIC-12) when the
substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity (usually a Special Purpose Entity (SPE)) indicates that the entity is controlled by the
Group. Such entities are deemed to be controlled by the Group when relationships with such entities gives rise to benefits that are in substance no
different from those that would arise were the entity a subsidiary.
The consolidation of such entities may be appropriate in a number of situations, but primarily when:
•
the operating and financial polices of the entity are closely defined from the outset (i.e. it operates on an ‘autopilot’ basis) with such policies
being largely determined by the Group;
•
the Group has rights to obtain the majority of the benefits of the entity and/or retains the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to
the entity; or
•
the activities of the entity are being conducted largely on behalf of the Group according to its specific business objectives.
Such entities are created for a variety of purposes including securitisation, structuring, asset realisation, intermediation and management.
Entities may have a different reporting date from that of the parent of 31st December. Dates may differ for a variety of reasons including local
reporting regulations or tax laws. In accordance with our accounting policies, for the purpose of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements 
of Barclays PLC, entities with different reporting dates are made up until 31st December.
Entities may have restrictions placed on their ability to transfer funds, including payment of dividends and repayment of loans, to their parent entity.
Reasons for the restrictions include:
•
Central bank restrictions relating to local exchange control laws.
•
Central bank capital adequacy requirements.
•
Company law restrictions relating to treatment of the entities as going concerns.
Although the Group’s interest in the equity voting rights in certain entities exceeds 50%, these entities are excluded from consolidation because the
Group either does not direct the financial and operating policies of these entities, or on the ground that another group has a superior economic
interest in such entities. Consequently, these entities are not deemed to be controlled by Barclays under IAS 27 (SIC-12).

51 Share-based payments
The Group operates share schemes for employees throughout the world. The main current schemes are:
Sharesave
Eligible employees in the UK, Spain and Ireland may participate in the Barclays Sharesave scheme. Under this scheme, employees may enter into
contracts to save up to £250 per month and, at the expiry of a fixed term of three, five or seven years, have the option to use these savings to acquire
shares in the Company at a discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the scheme. The discount is currently 20% of the market price at the
date the options are granted. Participants in the scheme have six months from the date of vest in which the option can be exercised.
Sharepurchase
Sharepurchase was introduced in January 2002. It is an HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee share plan. The plan is open to all eligible UK
employees, including executive Directors. Under the plan, participants are able to purchase up to £1,500 worth of Barclays PLC ordinary shares per
tax year, which, if kept in trust for five years, can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free. Matching shares were introduced to the scheme during 2005
where the purchase of Barclays shares by the participant are matched equally by the Company up to a value of £600 per tax year. Any shares in the
plan will earn dividends in the form of additional shares, which must normally be held by the trustee for three years before being eligible for release.
Executive Share Award Scheme (ESAS) 
For certain employees of the Group an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC
shares under ESAS. The total value of the bonus made to the employee of which ESAS is an element is dependent upon the business unit, Group and
individual employee performance. The ESAS element of the annual bonus must normally be held for at least three years. Additional bonus shares are
subsequently awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and vest upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of
award. ESAS awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeit if the individual resigns
and commences work with a competitor business.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM to replace the ISOP scheme. Performance shares are ‘free’
Barclays shares for which no exercise price is payable and which qualify for dividends. Performance share awards are communicated to participants
as an initial allocation. Barclays performance over a three-year period determines the final number of shares that may be released to participants.
Options granted under the following schemes are over subsidiaries of Barclays PLC:
Barclays Global Investors Equity Ownership Plan (BGI EOP)
The Equity Ownership Plan extends to key employees of BGI. The exercise price of the options is determined by the Remuneration Committee of
Barclays PLC based on the fair value of BGI as determined by an independent appraiser. The options are granted over shares in Barclays Global
Investors UK Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. Options are normally not exercisable until vesting, with a third of the options held
generally becoming exercisable at each anniversary of grant. The shareholder has the right to offer to sell the shares to Barclays Bank PLC 355 days
following the exercise of the option. Barclays Bank PLC may accept the offer and purchase the shares at the most recent agreed valuation but is 
under no obligation to do so. Options lapse ten years after grant. The most recently agreed valuation at 30th June 2006 was £91.43. Notes to the accounts

Absa Group Limited Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Transaction
On 25th June 2004, Absa shareholders approved the allocation of 73,152,300, redeemable cumulative option-holding Absa preference shares to
Batho Bonke Capital Limited. Each redeemable preference share carries the option to acquire one Absa ordinary share. The shares carry the same
rights as ordinary shares including voting rights, and receive dividends which are payable semi-annually. Options vest after three years and lapse
after five years from the date of issue. Exercise may occur in lots of 100 only and within a price range varying from ZAR48 to ZAR69 (£3.50-£5.03)
dependent on the 30-day volume weighted trading price on the JSE Limited. Options are redeemed by Absa on the final exercise date.
Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust (AGLSIT)
In terms of the rules of Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust the maximum number of shares which may be issued or transferred and/or 
in respect of which options may be granted to the participants shall be limited to shares representing 10% of the total number of issued shares. 
Options are allocated to Absa employees according to the normal Human Resources talent management process. The options issued up to August
2005 had no performance criteria linked to them and vested in equal tranches after three, four and five years respectively. No dividends accrue to the
option holder over the period. The options expire after a period of ten years from the issuing date. Options issued since August 2005 have vesting
performance criteria associated with them, which require headline earnings per share to exceed an agreed benchmark over a three-year period from
July 2005 for the options to vest.
Absa Group Limited Share Ownership Trust (AGLSOT)
The Absa Group Limited Share Ownership Trust (AGLSOT) enabled all Absa employees to participate in a one-off offer to purchase 200 redeemable
cumulative option-holding preference shares. Each redeemable preference share carries the option to acquire one Absa ordinary share. Options 
vest after three years and lapse after five years from the date of issue. Exercise may occur in lots of 100 only and within a price range varying from 
ZAR48 to ZAR69 (£3.50-£5.03) dependent on the 30-day volume weighted trading price on the JSE Limited. Options are redeemed by Absa on the
final exercise date.
Absa Group Limited Executive Share Award Scheme (AGLESAS)
For certain employees of Absa an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Absa Group Limited
shares under Absa ESAS. The total value of the bonus made to the employee of which ESAS is an element is dependent upon the business unit and
individual employee performance. The ESAS element of the annual bonus must be held for at least three years. Additional bonus shares are
subsequently awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and vest upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date 
of award. All awards are subject to potential forfeit if the individual resigns.
In addition, options remain outstanding under the following closed schemes:
Incentive Share Option Plan (ISOP)
The ISOP was open by invitation to the employees and Directors of Barclays PLC. Options were granted at the market price at the date of grant
calculated in accordance with the rules of the plan, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date. The final number 
of shares over which the option may be exercised is determined by reference to set performance criteria. The number of shares under option
represents the maximum possible number that may be exercised. No awards were made under ISOP during 2006.
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
The ESOS is a long-term incentive scheme and was available by invitation to certain senior executives of the Group with grants usually made
annually. Options were issued with an exercise price equivalent to the market price at the date of the grant without any discount, calculated in
accordance with the rules of the scheme, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date. No further awards are made
under ESOS.
Woolwich Executive Share Option Plan (Woolwich ESOP)
Options originally granted over Woolwich PLC shares at market value were exercised in 2001 or exchanged, in accordance with the proposals made
under the offer to acquire the Woolwich, for options over Barclays PLC shares. Under the rules of ESOP , the performance conditions attached to the
exercise of options were disapplied on acquisition of Woolwich PLC by Barclays. Options lapse ten years after grant.
At the balance sheet date, nil options remained outstanding or exercisable in respect of the following closed scheme:
Woolwich Save as You Earn (Woolwich SAYE)
Under this scheme, employees entered into contracts to save up to £250 per month and, at the expiry of a fixed term of three, five, or seven years,
have the option to use these savings to acquire the shares in the Company at a discount calculated in accordance with the rules of the scheme. 
The discount was 20% of the market price at the date the options were granted.
Several cash-settled schemes also operate within the Group. 
Barclays Africa Share Plan
The Barclays Africa Share Plan grants a number of notional shares and settles in a cash award linked to the Barclays PLC share price. The exercise
price of options is equal to the increment of the market price of Barclays shares over the original price on the date of grant. The final number of
notional shares over which the option may by exercised is determined by reference to set performance criteria. Awards will vest three years from
grant and expire four years from that date. Barclays PLC

Absa Group Phantom Performance Share Plan (Absa Phantom PSP)
The Absa Phantom PSP was implemented during the year to replace the Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust (AGLSIT) scheme. Shares are
awarded at no cost to participants and the cash paid is equal to the market value of ordinary shares of Absa Group Limited. The performance of Absa
over a three-year period determines the final number of notional shares that any cash payment would be based on. Awards vest after three years to
the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.
The weighted average fair value per option granted during the year is as follows:
2006 2005
£ £
Sharesave 1.88 1.29
Sharepurchase 6.55 5.57
ESAS 6.73 5.03
PSP 7.53 3.99
BGI EOP 21.18 10.41
AGLSIT 2.70 2.42
AGLESAS 8.42 –
ISOP – 2.78
Fair values for Sharesave, PSP , BGI EOP , AGLSIT and ISOP are calculated at the date of grant using either a Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo
simulation. Sharepurchase, ESAS and AGLESAS are nil cost awards on which the performance conditions are substantially completed at the date 
of grant. Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value at that date.
As described above, the terms of the ESAS scheme require shares to be held for a set number of years from the date of vest. The calculation of the
vest date fair value of such awards includes a reduction for this post-vesting restriction. This discount is determined by calculating how much a
willing market participant would rationally pay to remove the restriction using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The total discount required in
2006 is £62m (2005: £36m, 2004: £25m).
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2006 are as follows:
2006
Sharesave PSP BGI EOP AGLSIT
Weighted average share price 6.20 6.74 81.12 8.92
Weighted average exercise price 5.11 – 81.12 6.57
Expected volatility 25% 25% 24% 29%
Expected option life 4 years 3 years 4 years 5 years
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2005 are as follows:

Weighted average share price 5.71 5.33 39.09 8.25 5.73
Weighted average exercise price 4.44 n/a 39.09 8.41 5.66
Expected volatility 24% 20% 25% n/a 34%
Option life 4 years 3 years 4 years 5-8 years 5 years
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2004 are as follows:
Sharesave BGI EOP ISOP
Weighted average share price 5.28 20.11 4.77
Weighted average exercise price 3.59 20.11 4.18
Expected volatility 25% 25% 34%
Option life 5 years 5 years 5 years
Expected volatility and dividend yield on the date of grant have been used as inputs into the respective valuation models for Sharesave and PSP .
Expected volatility has been determined using historical volatility of its peers over the expected life of the options for BGI EOP and AGLSIT applies 
a five-year rolling period.
The yield on UK government bonds with a commensurate life has been used to determine the risk-free discount rate of 5% for all schemes other than
AGLSIT. Option life is estimated based upon historical data for the holding period of options between grant and exercise dates. The risk-free rate on
the AGLSIT scheme represents the yield, recorded on date of option grant, on South African government zero coupon bond of a term commensurate
to the expected life of the option. Notes to the accounts

For the purposes of determining the expected life and number of options to vest, historical exercise patterns have been used, together with an
assumption that a certain percentage of options will lapse due to leavers. 
The assumed dividend yield for Barclays PLC is the average annual dividend yield on the date of grant of 4%. The expected dividends for BGI UK
Holdings Limited are assumed to grow in line with the expected increases in share prices for the industry sector until exercise giving a yield of 2%.
Dividend yield for AGLSIT of 3.5% was based on the average 12-month trailing yield over the year to grant date.

52 Financial risks 
The main sources of financial risk that the Group faces are those arising from financial instruments – credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and
insurance risk. The Group devotes considerable resources to maintaining effective controls to manage, measure and mitigate each of these risks and
regularly reviews its risk management procedures and systems to ensure that these are the best available.
Financial instruments are fundamental to the Group’s business and constitute the core element of its operations. The risks associated with financial
instruments are a significant component of the risks faced by the Group. Financial instruments create, modify or reduce the liquidity, credit and
market risks of the Group’s balance sheet. These risks and the Group’s policies and objectives for managing such risks are outlined below.
Credit risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss from any of the Group’s customers, clients or market counterparties failing to fulfil their contractual
obligations to the Group. Credit risk mainly arises from loans and advances, but may also arise where the downgrading of an entity’s credit rating
causes the fair value the Group’s investment in that entity’s financial instruments to fall.
Credit risk is the Group’s most significant risk and it deploys considerable resources to controlling it. Nearly two-thirds of risk-based economic capital
is allocated to businesses for credit risks.
Each business has an embedded risk management team reporting to a Business Risk Director who reports to the Group Risk Director, who leads the
Group Risk function, including credit, which is charged with devising and implementing Group risk policy, such as ensuring: 
•
maximum exposure guidelines are in place relating to the exposures to any individual customer or counterparty;
•
country risk policy specifies risk appetite by country and avoids excessive concentrations of credit in individual countries; and
•
policies are in place that limit lending to certain industries, for example, commercial real estate.
A Credit Committee of Directors and experienced senior managers formulates overall Group credit policy and resolves all significant credit 
policy issues. 
Credit risk measurement
The Group’s credit rating systems use statistical modelling techniques throughout its business which assist the Group in front line credit decisions,
such as managing its existing portfolios and making new commitments. 
The Group assesses the credit quality and assigns an internal risk rating to all borrowers and other counterparties, including retail customers. 
Each internal rating corresponds to the statistical probability of a customer in that rating class defaulting within the next 12-month period. 
The probability of default, the exposure at default and the loss given default are calculated for all loan portfolios. This allows the Group to monitor 
its exposures, enabling it to derive measures such as Risk Tendency. Risk Tendency is a statistical estimate of the average loss for each loan portfolio
for a 12-month period, taking into account the size of the portfolio and its risk characteristics under current economic conditions, and is used to
track the change in risk as the portfolio of loans changes over time. 
The Group monitors its financial exposure to individual counterparties, to industries and countries to ensure that no undue concentrations of 
credit arise.
Credit risk mitigation
The Group uses a wide variety of techniques to reduce credit risk on its lending. The most basic of these is performing an assessment of the ability 
of a borrower to service the proposed level of borrowing without distress. In addition, the Group commonly obtains security for the funds advanced,
such as in the case of a retail or commercial mortgage, a reverse repurchase agreement, or a commercial loan with a floating charge over book debts
and inventories. The Group also uses various forms of specialised legal agreements to reduce risk, including netting agreements which permit it to
offset positive and negative balances with customers in certain circumstances to minimise the exposure at default, financial guarantees, and the use
of covenants in commercial lending agreements. Other techniques include the use of credit derivatives and other forms of credit collateral.
In addition, the Group actively manages its exposures to clients, countries and industries through diversification, minimising individual
concentrations.  Notes to the accounts

Market Risk Management
Market risk is the risk that Barclays earnings or capital, or its ability to meet business objectives, will be adversely affected by changes in the level or
volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, credit spreads, commodity prices, equity prices and foreign exchange rates.
The main market risks arise from trading activities. Barclays is also exposed to non-trading market risks to asset and liability management and to the
Pension Fund.
To facilitate the management, control, measurement and reporting of market risk, Barclays has grouped market risk into three broad categories:
•
Trading market risk. These risks arise in trading transactions where Barclays acts as principal with clients or with the market. Barclays policy is
that market risks arising from trading activities are concentrated in Barclays Capital.
•
Asset and liability risk. These risks arise from banking activities, including those incurred on non-trading positions such as customer assets and
liabilities and capital balances.
•
Other market risks. Barclays also incurs market risks that are assessed under a slightly different framework. The principal risks of this type are
defined benefit pension scheme risk and asset management structural market risk.
The Board approves the market risk appetite for all types of market risk. The Market Risk Director is responsible for the market risk control framework
and, under delegated authority from the Risk Director, sets a limit framework within the context of the approved market risk appetite. A daily market
risk report summarises Barclays market risk exposures against agreed limits. This daily report is sent to the Risk Director, the Market Risk Director, the
Finance Director and the appropriate Business Risk Directors.
In Barclays Capital, the Head of Market Risk is responsible for implementing the market risk control framework. Day to day responsibility for market
risk lies with the senior management of Barclays Capital, supported by the Market Risk Management team that operates independently of the
trading areas. Daily market risk reports are produced for the main Barclays Capital business areas covering the six main types of trading market risk:
interest rate, inflation, credit spread, commodity, equity and foreign exchange. A more detailed trading market risk presentation is produced
fortnightly and discussed at Barclays Capital’s Traded Products Risk Review meeting. The attendees at this meeting include the senior managers
from Barclays Capital and the central market risk team.
Market risk measurement
The measurement techniques used to measure and control market risk include:
•
Daily Value at Risk;
•
Stress Tests;
•
Annual Earnings at Risk;
•
Economic capital.
Daily Value at Risk (DVaR)
DVaR is an estimate of the potential loss which might arise from unfavourable market movements, if the current positions were to be held
unchanged for one business day, measured to a confidence level of 98%. Daily losses exceeding the DVaR figure are likely to occur, on average, twice
in every 100 business days.
Stress Tests
Stress tests provide an indication of the potential size of losses that could arise in extreme conditions. The stress tests carried out by Barclays Capital
include risk factor stress testing, where stress movements are applied to each of the six risk categories namely interest rate, inflation, credit spread,
commodity, equity and foreign exchange rate; emerging market stress testing where emerging market portfolios are subject to stress movements;
and ad hoc stress testing, which includes applying stress scenarios to the trading risk book.
If potential stressed losses exceed the trigger limit, the positions captured by the stress test are reviewed and discussed by Barclays Capital Market
Risk and the respective senior management.
Outside Barclays Capital, stress testing is carried out by the business centres and is reviewed by the senior management and business-level asset and
liability committees. The stress testing is tailored to the business and is typically scenario analysis and historical stress movements applied to
respective portfolios.
Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR)
AEaR measures the sensitivity of annual earnings to shocks in market rates at the 99th percentile for change over a one-year period. This shock is
consistent with the standardised interest rate shock recommended by the Basel II framework for assessing banking book interest rate risk.
AEaR is used to measure structural interest rate market risk and structural asset management risk.
Economic capital
The total average economic capital required by the Group is determined by risk assessment models and after considering the Group’s estimated
portfolio effects. Methodologies are used for both operational and business risks to calculate risk sensitive capital allocations. The Group regularly
enhances its economic capital methodologies and benchmarks outputs to external reference points. Economic capital is allocated on a consistent
basis across all of the Group’s businesses and risk activities, and these allocations reflect varying levels of risk.
Trading Market Risk
Group policy is to concentrate trading activities in Barclays Capital. This includes transactions where Barclays Capital acts as principal with clients or
with the market. For maximum efficiency, client and market activities are managed together.  Barclays PLC

In anticipation of future customer demand, Barclays maintains access to market liquidity by quoting bid and offer prices with other market makers
and carries an inventory of capital market and treasury instruments, including a broad range of cash, securities and derivatives. Trading positions and
any offsetting hedges are established as appropriate to accommodate customer or Barclays requirements.

The graph below shows the history of total DVaR on a daily basis for 2005 and 2006.
DVaR Back-testing 
Barclays recognises the importance of assessing the effectiveness of its DVaR model. The main approach employed is the technique known as back-
testing, which counts the number of days when trading losses are bigger than the estimated DVaR figure. The regulatory standard for backtesting is
to measure DVaR assuming a one-day holding period with a 99% level of confidence. For Barclays Capital’s regulatory trading book, there were no
instances in 2006 or 2005, of a daily trading revenue loss exceeding the corresponding back-testing DVaR.
Asset and Liability Market Risk 
Interest rate exposures arise from mismatches of fixed rate assets and liabilities in UK banking operations and are passed to Treasury where these
positions are aggregated and the net position passed to the market via Barclays Capital. Due mainly to timing considerations, market risk can arise
when some of the net position stays with Treasury. Similarly, market risk can arise due to the impact of interest rates on customer behaviour. The
latter risk is managed and measured by the Retail Market Risk team using behavioural models. The positions are converted into wholesale swap or
option exposures, passed to Treasury and managed by the process outlined above.
Structural interest rate risk arises from the variability of income from non-interest bearing products, managed variable rate products and the 
Group’s equity. Structural foreign currency risk results from holding non-Sterling investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates or joint ventures.
These structural risks are managed by Treasury.
Interest rate exposures, structural interest rate risk and other market risks may be managed through the use of derivatives. Where this is the case,
hedge accounting is obtained where possible so that the benefits of Risk management are reflected in the financial statements. 
Liquidity Risk Management 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due or to replace funds when they are withdrawn.
The Group has several core liquidity management strategies. The first is to project future cash flows and make plans to address normal operating
requirements, as well as variable scenarios and contingencies. The second is to manage day to day funding, by controlling intraday liquidity in real

time and by forecasting future cash flows to ensure that requirements can be met. The third is maintaining a diverse and stable funding base. 
Finally, the Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable assets that can easily be liquidated as protection against any unforeseen interruption to
cash flows.
The Group’s funding base comprises a mixture of different funding sources, including retail and corporate customer deposits, and short- and long-
term debt issuances. Although current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Group’s broad base of
customers – numerically and by depositor type – helps to protect against unexpected fluctuations. Such accounts form a stable funding base for the
Group’s operations and liquidity needs. Important factors in assuring liquidity are competitive rates and the maintenance of depositors’ confidence.
Such confidence is based on a number of factors including the Group’s reputation, the strength of earnings and the Group’s financial position.
The ability to raise funds is in part dependent on maintaining the Bank’s credit rating. The funding impact of a credit downgrade is regularly
estimated. Whilst the impact of a single downgrade may affect the price at which funding is available, the effect on liquidity is not considered material
in Group terms.
Liquidity Risk Measurement
Based on principles agreed by the FSA, monitoring and reporting of liquidity risk involves the measurement of cash flows and projections for the next
day, week and month.
In addition to cash flow management, Treasury also monitors unmatched medium-term assets and the level and type of undrawn lending
commitments, the usage of overdraft facilities and the impact of contingent liabilities such as standby letters of credit and guarantees.
Treasury develops and implements the process for submitting the Group’s projected cash flows to stress scenarios. The output of stress testing
informs the Group’s contingency funding plan. This is maintained by Treasury and is aligned with the Group and country business resumption plans
to encompass decision-making authorities, internal and external communication and, in the event of a systems failure, the restoration of liquidity
management and payment systems.
Sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed to maintain a wide diversification by currency, geography, provider, product and term. An important source
of structural liquidity is provided by our core retail deposits in the UK, Europe and Africa, comprising mainly current accounts and savings accounts.
To avoid reliance on a particular group of customers or market sectors, the distribution of sources and the maturity profile of deposits are also
carefully managed.
An analysis of the Group’s liquidity position is presented at Note 56.
Insurance Risk Management
Insurance risk is the risk that the Group will have to make higher than anticipated payments to settle claims arising from its long-term and short-term
insurance businesses. 
Long-term insurance business
For long-term insurance contracts where death is the insured risk, the most significant factors that could detrimentally affect the frequency and
severity of claims are the incidence of disease, such as AIDS, or general changes in lifestyle, such as in eating, exercise and smoking. Where survival 
is the insured risk, advances in medical care and social conditions are the key factors that increase longevity. 
The Group manages its exposure to risk by operating in part as a unit-linked business, prudent product design, applying strict underwriting criteria,
transferring risk to reinsurers, managing claims and establishing prudent reserves.
Short-term insurance business
For payment protection contracts where inability to make payments under a loan contract is the insured risk, the most significant factors are the
health of the policyholder and the possibility of unemployment which depends upon, among other things, long-term and short-term economic
factors. The Group manages its exposure to such risks through prudent product design, efficient claims management, prudent reserving
methodologies and bases, regular product, economic and market reviews and regular adequacy tests on the size of the reserves. 
Absa insures property and motor vehicles, for which the most significant factors that could affect the frequency and severity of claims are climatic
change and crime. Absa manages its exposure to risk by diversifying insurance risks accepted and transferring risk to reinsurers.
Derivatives held for risk management
The Group uses both cash flow hedging and fair value hedging techniques to achieve hedge accounting for interest rate portions. For example, 
cash flow hedge relationships have been established between interest rate swaps receive fixed with pay variable legs and cash flows generated by
customer assets on which we receive a variable interest rate (including forecast customer assets which are expected to be originated in the future).
The cash flows on the variable leg of the swap and the interest flows on the assets are both based on the same benchmark rate (e.g. LIBOR or
EURIBOR). Fair value hedge relationships are also established between interest rate swaps with receive fixed/pay variable legs and fixed rate liabilities
(e.g. issued loan stock). 
Various techniques are used to ensure that the hedge relationship results in an effective reduction in the risks intended to be hedged. For cash flow
hedging a hypothetical interest rate swap is created which would completely offset the risks which are being hedged. The ratio of movements (due to
changes in the risk being hedged) in the fair value of this instrument (or the hedged item for fair value hedges) and the movement in the fair value of
the actual interest rate swaps used as hedges is calculated to determine how close the actual interest rate swap is to a perfect hedging instrument. 
In some circumstances these ratios are calculated for various scenarios and regression analysis is used to assess the level of effectiveness.  Barclays PLC

54 Credit risk
The Group’s objectives and policies in managing the credit risks that arise in connection with the use of financial instruments and other credit
exposures are set out in Note 52 under the heading ‘Credit Risk Management’.
Concentrations of credit risk
A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The concentrations of
credit exposure described below are not proportionally related to credit loss. Some segments of the Group’s portfolio have and are expected to have
proportionally higher credit charges in relation to the exposure than others. Moreover, the volatility of credit loss is different in different parts of the
portfolio. Thus comparatively large credit charges could arise in parts of the portfolio not mentioned below.
The single biggest geographical concentration of credit risk is in the UK. Gross credit exposure to borrowers in the UK (based on the location of the
customer) was £170.5bn at 31st December 2006 (2005: £163.8bn). In the UK, the Group’s collateral policy differs by line of business and product but
is broadly consistent with UK market practice. Netting agreements are made with wholesale counterparties whenever practical and to the extent that
such agreements are legally enforceable. Outside the UK, the Group’s geographical spread ensures a wide variety of counterparties in the main areas
of operation in Europe, the United States and other areas of the world.
Barclays also has significant concentrations of exposures to home loans and banks. All these concentrations may spread across one or more of the
line items described below.
Maximum exposure to credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of assets held on the balance sheet. The actual exposure to credit risk is less
than this in most cases.
Cash and demand balances at central banks – By their nature, the Group expects that these balances will have close to nil credit risk attached 
to them.
Items in the course of collection from other banks/loans and advances to banks – The Group maintains relationships with a wide range of banking
counterparties. While banking counterparties are generally of high quality, the Group also monitors its exposure to individual banks to ensure that
the credit risk is diversified. The Group is also exposed to credit risk with banks on other financial assets including derivatives and also on letters of
credit and guarantees. The Group may require collateral before entering into a credit commitment with another bank, depending on the type of the
financial product and the counterparty involved. Netting agreements are secured whenever possible and to the extent that such agreements are
legally enforceable.
Trading portfolio assets/financial assets designated at fair value/available for sale financial investments – The Group’s practice is to take into
account credit risk when valuing these assets. The Group therefore expects little additional credit risk on these instruments, other than the credit risk
component of trading market risk on these instruments. The trading market risk is monitored through the Daily Value at Risk (DVaR) methodology. 
In addition, many of the trading portfolio and available for sale assets held are of very high quality, including treasury bills and government bonds. 
An analysis of trading portfolio assets by instrument type is included in Note 12 and a similar analysis for available for sale assets is included in Note 18.
Derivative financial instruments – In addition to including the credit risk on these instruments in the DVaR methodology, the Group also uses a
number of other techniques to reduce its exposure to credit risk on these instruments. These techniques include master netting agreements, which
do not qualify for offset under IAS 32 but which give a legally enforceable right to net receivables and payables with the same counterparty, and the
obtaining of cash collateral from counterparties who have a net exposure to the Group through Collateral Service Agreements. 
Loans and advances to customers – A significant portion of the Group’s loans and advances to customers comprises lending in respect of home
loans. Home loan lending totalled £98.2bn at 31st December 2006 (2005: £89.5bn), which represents 34% (2005: 33%) of loans to customers. 
As collateral, Barclays requires a first mortgage over the residential property for the acquisition of which the loan is made. For other lending to
customers, the Group may require various forms of credit protection, including the use of netting agreements and covenants and the obtaining of
security such as mortgages or charges. Finally, the Group actively seeks to manage credit risk by ensuring diversification of its lending across clients,
regions and industries. An analysis of loans to customers according to geographic region and industry sector is set out in Note 16.
Reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed – By their nature these balances have a low credit risk, as they are
largely secured by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The Group’s policy is to seek collateral at the outset equal to 100% to 105% of the loan
amount, with further collateral calls made as required.
Barclays manages its credit exposure by counterparty exposure which may be spread across one or more of the line items described above. Notes to the accounts

55 Currency risk
Foreign currency exposures comprise structural foreign currency exposures, which arise from investments in the Group’s overseas operations and
other investments; and those originating in trading activities.
The Group holds foreign currency net investments and is exposed to fluctuations in the Group’s share of their net assets measured in their functional
currencies caused by movements in exchange rates between these currencies and Sterling, the Group’s reporting currency. 
The carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency net investments and the foreign currency borrowings and derivatives used to hedge them were 
as follows:

In addition to the above, the Group has US Dollar and Euro Preference Shares and reserve capital instruments in issue that are treated as equity 
under IFRS. 
In accordance with Group policy, as at 31st December 2006 and 31st December 2005, there were no material net currency exposures in the non-
trading book relating to transactional (or non-structural) positions that would give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and
loss account.
The Daily Value at Risk (DVaR) methodology is used by the Group to estimate potential losses arising from exposure to market risk, including
currency risk, on trading positions. The tables shown on page 235 show an analysis of DVaR for the market risk exposures in Barclays Capital. Barclays PLC

Expected maturity dates do not differ significantly from the contract dates, except for:
•
Trading Portfolio Assets and Liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which may not be held to maturity as part of the Group’s trading
strategies. For these instruments, which are mostly held by Barclays Capital, liquidity and repricing risk is managed through the Daily Value at Risk
(DVaR) methodology.
•
Retail deposits which are repayable on demand or at short notice. These instruments form a stable base for the Group’s operations and liquidity
needs because of the broad base of customers – both numerically and by depositor type.
•
Financial assets designated at fair value held in respect of linked liabilities, which are managed with the associated liabilities. Barclays PLC

57 Insurance risk
The Group’s objectives and policies in managing the insurance risks that arise in connection with the use of financial instruments are set out in 
Note 52 under the heading ‘Insurance Risk Management’.
Concentration of insurance risk
The Group considers that the concentration of insurance risk that is most relevant to the Group financial statements is according to the type of cover
offered and the location of insured risk. The following table shows the maximum amounts payable under all of the Group’s insurance products. It
ignores the probability of insured events occurring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies. The table shows the broad
product types and the location of the insured risk, before and after the impact of reinsurance that represents the risk that is passed to other insurers.

Reinsurer credit risk
For the long-term business, reinsurance programmes are in place to restrict the amount of cover to any single life. The reinsurance cover is spread
across highly rated companies to diversify the risk of reinsurer solvency. Net insurance reserves include a margin to reflect reinsurer credit risk. Notes to the accounts

58 Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, in an arms-length transaction
between knowledgeable willing parties.

Subordinated liabilities (f) 13,786 13,976 12,463 13,610
Notes
(a) Fair value approximates carrying value due to the minimal credit losses and short-term nature of the financial assets and liabilities.
(b) Financial instruments at fair value (including those held for trading, designated at fair value, derivatives and available for sale) are either priced
with reference to a quoted market price for that instrument or by using a valuation model. Where the fair value is calculated using a valuation
model, the methodology is to calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back
to a present value. The expected cash flows for each contract are determined either directly by reference to actual cash flows implicit in
observable market prices or through modelling cash flows using appropriate financial markets pricing models. Wherever possible these models
use as their basis observable market prices and rates including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option
volatilities and currency rates.
The process of calculating fair value on illiquid instruments or from a valuation model may require estimation of certain pricing parameters,
assumptions or model characteristics. These estimates are calibrated against industry standards, economic models and observed transaction
prices. Changes to assumptions or estimated levels can potentially impact the fair value of an instrument as reported. The effect of changing
these assumptions, for those financial instruments for which the fair values were measured using valuation techniques that are determined in
full or in part on assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices, to a range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions,
would be to increase the fair value by up to £139m (2005: £121m) or to decrease the fair value by up to £123m (2005: £87m). The decrease in
fair value was arrived at by imposing more conservative assumptions in the estimation of valuation model inputs. The increase in fair value was
arrived at by taking less conservative assumptions in the estimation of valuation model inputs and less conservative assumptions over the
uncertainty of valuation models. These variations in the assumptions have been estimated on a product by product basis and form part of the
Bank’s internal control processes over the determination of fair value.
The valuation model used for a particular instrument, the quality and liquidity of market data used for pricing, other fair value adjustments not
specifically captured by the model, market data and assumptions or estimates in these are all subject to internal review and approval
procedures and consistent application between accounting periods.
The net asset fair value position of those financial instruments where the fair values were estimated using valuation techniques which are 
based in full or in part on assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices decreased to £2,814m for the year ended 
31st December 2006 (31st December 2005: £2,877m). In many cases these changes in fair values were offset by changes in fair values of other
financial instruments, which were priced in active markets or valued by using a valuation technique which is supported by observable market
prices or rates, or by transactions which have been realised. Barclays PLC

58 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)
(c) The fair value for loans and advances, and other lending (including reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed)
is estimated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates where practicable or, where the counterparty is a bank, rates currently
offered by other financial institutions for placings with similar characteristics. In many cases the fair value approximates carrying value because
the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently. 
(d) Fair values of deposit liabilities payable on demand (interest free, interest bearing and savings deposits) approximate to their carrying value. 
The fair value of all other deposits and other borrowings (including repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent) is estimated
using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates, where practicable, or rates currently offered by the Group for deposits of similar
remaining maturities.
(e) Fair values of short-term debt securities in issue are approximately equal to their carrying amount. Fair values of other debt securities in issue
are based on quoted prices where available, or where these are unavailable, are estimated using other valuation techniques.
(f ) The estimated fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital were based upon quoted market rates for the
issue concerned or equivalent issues with similar terms and conditions.
(g) The fair value of liabilities to customers under investment contracts approximates carrying value.
The Group considers that, given the lack of an established market, the diversity of fee structures and the difficulty of separating the value of the
instruments from the value of the overall transaction, it is not meaningful to provide an estimate of the fair value of financial commitments and
contingent liabilities. Notes to the accounts

59 Segmental reporting
Business segments
The Group reports the results of its operations through eight business segments: UK Banking, Barclaycard, International Retail and Commercial
Banking, Barclays Capital, Barclays Global Investors, Barclays Wealth, Barclays Wealth – Closed Life Assurance Business and Head Office and other
operations.
UK Banking provides banking solutions to Barclays UK retail and business banking customers. Barclaycard provides credit card services across
Europe and the United States. International Retail and Commercial Banking provides banking services to personal and corporate customers in
Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Barclays Capital conducts the Group’s investment banking business providing corporate, institutional and
government clients with financing and risk management products. Barclays Global Investors provides investment management products and
services to international institutional clients. Barclays Wealth provides banking and asset management services to affluent and high net worth
clients. Head Office functions and other operations comprise all the Group’s central function costs and other central items including businesses 
in transition.
During 2006 Barclays realigned a number of reportable business segments to better reflect the type of client served, the nature of the products
offered and the associated risks and rewards. The changes have no impact on the Group Income Statement or Balance Sheet, and are summarised 
as follows:
The majority of Absa Corporate and Merchant Banking, previously reported in International Retail and Commercial Banking, has been relaunched as
Absa Capital and is being managed and reported in Barclays Capital. A number of financial institution, large corporate and property clients previously
reported within UK Banking are now managed by and reported in Barclays Capital. Certain portfolios previously reported in UK Banking have been
reclassified as businesses in transition and are now centrally managed and reported in Head Office functions and other operations.
The structure remains unchanged for Barclays Global Investors, Barclays Wealth, Barclays Wealth – closed life assurance activities 
and Barclaycard.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis. Internal charges and transfer pricing adjustments are reflected
in the performance of each business. Head office functions and other operations contains a centralised treasury function, which deals with the
Group’s funding requirements. The funding requirements of each business segment reflects funding at market rates and not internally generated
transfer prices and is therefore not separately disclosed within inter-segment net income.

60 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles
The Group has applied IFRS from 1st January 2004, with the exception of the standards relating to financial instruments and insurance contracts
which are applied only from 1st January 2005. Therefore the impacts of adopting IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 are not included in the IFRS 2004
comparatives and financial instruments and insurance contracts are accounted for under UK GAAP .
Significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP that are applicable to Barclays are summarised below.
IFRS US GAAP
Goodwill
From 1st January 2004, goodwill recognised in the IFRS balance sheet is
not amortised but tested annually for impairment. 
Goodwill previously written off to reserves in accordance with UK GAAP
has not been reinstated on the balance sheet. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill
For acquisitions arising after 1st January 2004, intangible assets are
recognised as an asset apart from goodwill in accordance with IFRS 3. 
Pensions 
For defined benefit schemes, an actuarial measurement of the scheme
obligation and the fair value of the plan assets is made at the end of each
year and the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet
date, together with adjustments for any unrecognised actuarial gains
and losses and past service cost, is recognised as a liability in the 
balance sheet.
Pension assets and liabilities existing at 1st January 2004 were
recognised in full.
Post-retirement benefits 
Post-retirement benefits are assessed actuarially on a similar basis to
pension liabilities under IAS 19. From 1st January 2004 these benefits 
are accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period 
of employment. 
Leasing
The Group has entered into leasing contracts whereby the unavoidable
costs in meeting the obligations under the lease exceed the economic
benefits expected to be received. Under IFRS a provision for the costs 
is recognised when the leasehold property ceases to be used in the
business or a commitment is made to vacate the property.
For a sale and operating leaseback transaction established at fair value,
profit or loss is recognised immediately.
Other compensation arrangements 
Non-share-based compensation arrangements awarded to 
employees where no performance criteria, other than continued 
service, are required to be met are accrued fully on the date 
of the grant.
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock-based compensation are
recognised over the vesting period.
From 1st January 2002, US GAAP required goodwill not to be amortised
but tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill previously written off to reserves in accordance with UK GAAP
is recorded on the balance sheet.
From 1st January 2002, intangible assets are recognised as an asset
apart from goodwill in accordance with SFAS 141.
As the amortisation of intangible assets is a deductible expense for
income tax purposes, US GAAP requires the recognition of a tax
amortisation benefit. The tax amortisation benefit is taken to income
over an appropriate life.
For defined benefit schemes, the same actuarial approach used under
IFRS is used under SFAS 87. Differences arise in certain assumptions and
in the measurement and adoption dates used for calculation purposes.
Under SFAS 158 any unrecognised actuarial losses and past service
costs are recognised on the balance sheet through an adjustment to
other comprehensive income.
Under SFAS 106, there are certain differences in the assumptions,
measurement and the adoption dates used for calculation purposes.
Under SFAS 158 any unrecognised actuarial losses and past service
costs are recognised on the balance sheet through an adjustment to
other comprehensive income.
Under US GAAP a provision is only recognised at the time the leasehold
property is actually vacated.
Regardless of whether a finance or operating leaseback has occurred, 
if the seller retains more than minor but less than substantially all of the
use of the asset, profit in excess of the present value of minimum lease
payments is recognised immediately. The remainder is deferred and
amortised in proportion to the related gross rentals over the lease term.
Non-share-based compensation arrangements awarded to employees
where no performance criteria, other than continued service, are
required to be met are accrued evenly over the period of the grant to
date of payout.
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock-based compensation are
recognised on exercise date. 60 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles (continued)
IFRS US GAAP
Insurance
Life assurance products that are not classified as insurance contracts are
accounted for under IAS 39. Products with sufficient insurance risk to be
classified as insurance contracts are accounted for under the Modified
Statutory Solvency Basis or similar bases.
Reinsurance contracts that transfer sufficient insurance risk are
accounted for as insurance contracts, otherwise they are accounted 
for under IAS 39. Gains and losses recognised on entering reinsurance
contracts are recognised in income.
Revaluation of property
The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment included in the
UK GAAP balance at 31st December 2003 has been carried forward into
the IFRS balance sheet at 1st January 2004 without adjustment as
deemed cost. This results in property being carried either at original cost
or at a subsequent valuation less related depreciation, calculated on the
revalued amount where applicable.
Hedging 
As at 1st January 2005, all derivatives were recognised at fair value and
adjustments were made to hedged items where appropriate to comply
with the IFRS First-time adoption rules for hedge accounting. Where
hedges have been designated and documented in compliance with IFRS,
hedge accounting has been subsequently applied from that date.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities may be designated at fair value
through profit or loss (the ‘fair value option’) where they contain
substantive embedded derivatives, where doing so significantly reduces
measurement inconsistencies, or where they are managed and
evaluated on a fair value basis with a documented risk management
or investment strategy and reported to Key Management Personnel 
on that basis. 
Under US GAAP , life assurance products are accounted for under SFAS
60, SFAS 97 and SOP 03-01, depending on the nature of the underlying
product and the level of insurance risk. This gives rise to measurement
and classification differences.
Similar to IFRS, reinsurance contracts that transfer sufficient insurance
risk are classified as insurance contracts. Where reinsurance contacts
are further classified as Prospective Reinsurance, any gains and losses
recognised from the transaction are deferred and amortised over the
remaining contact period in proportion to the amount of insurance
protection provided.
Revaluations of property are not permitted under US GAAP . 
IFRS first-time adoption hedging derivatives adjustments made on the
transition to IFRS have been reversed.
In certain instances, positions which achieve hedge accounting under
IFRS do not meet hedge accounting conditions under US GAAP , and vice
versa. In particular, qualifying IFRS hedge accounting relationships that
do not meet the criteria under US GAAP include:
•
IFRS hedge accounting relationships that are a fair value hedge of
the interest rate risk exposure of a portfolio of loans for which the
hedged item is designated in terms of an amount of currency rather
than as individual loans. US GAAP does not permit this hedge
accounting methodology.
•
IFRS hedge accounting relationships for which no equivalent 
US GAAP hedge has been designated or that were designated at 
a later date for US GAAP purposes.
US GAAP only permits the ‘fair value option’ for financial assets and
liabilities that contain embedded derivatives that otherwise are required
to be separated from their host contract. Financial instruments that
qualify for the ‘fair value option’ under IFRS but which are not measured
at fair value through profit or loss under US GAAP are as follows:
•
In accordance with SOP 01-6, originated loans are reported at
outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance
for loans losses and any deferred origination fees or costs. 
•
Debt, including deposits, is recorded at face value less any discount
or plus any premium.
•
Structured financial liabilities that are not required to be separated into 
a host contract and a derivative are measured on an amortised cost basis.
•
In accordance with SFAS 115, available for sale debt securities are
measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in equity.
•
Mortgage loans held-for-sale are accounted for at the lower of cost
or market value in accordance with SFAS 65.
•
Contracts that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in
accordance with SFAS 133.10(d) are initially measured at fair value
and subsequently amortised over the life of the guarantee in
accordance with the provisions of FIN 45.
Certain entities have been deemed to be investment companies or
broker/dealers in accordance with the specific industry guidance
applicable to those entities under US GAAP . The specific industry
guidance requires certain financial instruments held within these
entities to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 252 60 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles (continued)
IFRS US GAAP
Foreign exchange on available for sale securities 
Changes in the fair value of available for sale debt securities resulting
from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are reflected in the
income statement as exchange differences.
Fee and cost recognition
IAS 39 does not consider certain internal costs to be incremental costs
directly attributable to the origination of financial instruments and are
excluded from effective interest calculations and are taken as an expense
to income.
Redemption fees are deferred and amortised on the balance sheet using
the effective yield method.
Specific accounting guidance for leveraged leases does not exist under
IFRS. Income is recognised on an effective yield basis.
Consolidation
Under SIC-12 an SPE is consolidated by the entity that is deemed to
control it. Indicators of control include the SPE conducting activities 
on behalf of the entity or the entity holding the majority of the risks and
rewards of the SPE.
The disposal of shares from the Group to a minority shareholder is
recorded in the income statement.
Securitisations 
Group undertakings have issued debt securities or have entered into
funding arrangements with lenders in order to finance specific loans and
advances to customers. All such loans and advances continue to be held
on the Group balance sheet, and a liability recognised for the proceeds 
of the funding transaction, unless certain conditions are met.
IFRS allows for the partial derecognition of transferred financial assets
where the Group has a continuing involvement in them.
Guarantees
All financial guarantees (other than credit derivatives) are initially
recognised in the financial statements at fair value on the date that the
guarantee was given. 
Classification of debt and equity
From 1st January 2005, certain subordinated instruments issued by the
Group are treated as equity under IFRS where they contain no present
obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to a holder. If these
are held in foreign currency, the instrument is translated into the
reporting currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of issuance.
Under EITF 96-15, as amended by SFAS 133, changes in the value of
available for sale debt instruments due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rate are carried in shareholders’ equity and transferred to
income on sale of the instrument.
SFAS 91 requires loan origination fees and direct costs (including certain
internal costs) to be deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as
an adjustment of yield.
Redemption fees are recorded in income as received.
Leveraged leases require income to be recognised only during the
period that the net investment in the lease is positive.
In accordance with FIN 46-R Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are
consolidated by the interest holder that remains exposed to the majority
of the entity’s expected losses or residual returns, that is, the primary
beneficiary. Where an SPE is deemed a ‘Qualifying Special Purpose
Entity’ (QSPE), it is not consolidated.
The disposal of shares from the Group to a minority shareholder is
recorded directly in equity.
Transfers of financial assets through securitisation are derecognised
if the securitisation entity’s activities comply with certain rigorous
accounting requirements to be considered a QSPE. If the securitisation
entity’s activities are sufficiently restricted to be considered a QSPE, the
entity is not consolidated by the seller of the transferred assets.
Where appropriate, upon derecognition a servicing asset/liability and
retained interest in the transferred assets is recognised. Any recognised
servicing asset/liability is amortised over the period in which the
benefits are expected to be received.
US GAAP does not permit the application of ‘continuing involvement’
principles to achieve partial derecognition of transferred financial assets.
Under FIN 45, only guarantees issued or modified from 1st January 2003
are recognised at inception at fair value as a liability on the balance sheet.
These instruments are treated as debt instruments under US GAAP and
are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.

60 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles (continued)
IFRS US GAAP
Loans held for sale
Financial instruments are measured as required by IAS 39 and are
outside the scope of the measurement provisions of IFRS 5.
Non-financial instruments
Purchased financial guarantees may be carried at fair value with changes
in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Disposal of foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
Under IAS 21 the exchange differences arising on the translation of a
foreign operation are included in cumulative translation reserves within
shareholders’ equity and recycled to the income statement on disposal
or partial disposal of the operation. Under the transition rules contained
within IFRS 1 the requirement applies to translation currency gains and
losses arising after 1st January 2004.
Taxation
Profit before tax and the tax charge includes tax at the effective tax rate
on certain transactions.
Under IFRS the deferred tax asset on share-based compensation
schemes is calculated using the intrinsic value of outstanding share
awards at the balance sheet date. The associated income tax credit is
capped by the fair value of the award multiplied by the statutory tax rate,
any excess is recorded in reserves.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is net income divided by the weighted
average shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the effect
that potential ordinary shares in the form of existing options would have
on the basic EPS if they were to be exercised, by increasing the number 
of ordinary shares and adjusting income where appropriate.
Acceptances
Acceptances are bills of exchange that the drawee has agreed
responsibility for payment. They are not recognised on the balance sheet.
Non-cash collateral
Where a transferee sells collateral pledged to it, IFRS requires recognition
of the proceeds from the sale and a liability measured at fair value for its
obligation to return the collateral.
Netting 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported net in the balance
sheet if, and only if, there is currently a legally enforceable right to set off
the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis,
or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Under SOP 06-1 once a decision has been made to sell loans not
previously classified as held for sale, such loans are transferred into the
held-for-sale classification and carried at the lower of cost or fair value.
At the time of the transfer into the held-for-sale classification, any
amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a
valuation allowance.
All purchased financial guarantees not meeting the definition of 
a derivative are measured on an accrual basis.
The requirements outlined in SFAS 52 in relation to translation gains 
and losses of a foreign operation are the same as IAS 21. However, the
requirements apply to all gains and losses arising from acquisition of 
the foreign operation.
Income before tax and the tax charge do not include such tax
adjustments.
The deferred tax asset on share compensation schemes is calculated 
on the fair value of share awards on the date of issue, with adjustments
made for the number of options expected to exercise. Deferred tax
excesses or shortfalls are only taken to reserves upon exercise of 
an award.
The basic and diluted US GAAP EPS differs from IFRS EPS to the 
extent that net income under US GAAP differs and the windfall tax
benefit/deficiency to be recognised in additional paid in capital 
is included in the assumed proceeds used to determine the number 
of potential ordinary shares.
Acceptances and the related customer liabilities are recognised on the
balance sheet.
Where a transferee receives collateral that it has a right to on sell 
or on pledge, a liability is recognised when the collateral is received.
US GAAP permits netting in relation to long and short positions in
securities and derivative assets and liabilities subject to a master 
netting agreement between two counterparties. Barclays PLC

60 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles (continued)
For those standards that were not adopted until 1st January 2005, UK GAAP continued to be applied throughout 2004 in accordance with IFRS
transition rules. Therefore, for 31st December 2004, the differences relating to Derivatives, Fair value of securities, Loan origination and
Extinguishment of liabilities are the same as those previously reported and have been provided on page 258.
IFRS (2004 only) US GAAP (2004 only)
Derivatives
Derivatives used for hedging purposes are measured on an accruals
basis consistent with the assets, liabilities, positions or future cash flows
being hedged. The gains and losses on these instruments (arising from
changes in fair value) are not recognised in the profit and loss account
immediately as they arise. Such gains are either not recognised in the
balance sheet or are recognised and carried forward. When the hedged
transaction occurs, the gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss
account at the same time as the hedged item.
Derivatives entered into as trading transactions, together with any
associated hedging, are measured at fair value, and the resultant profits
and losses are included in dealing profits.
Products which contain embedded derivatives are valued with reference
to the total product inclusive of the derivative element.
Fair value of securities
Positions in investment debt securities and investment equity shares 
are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. The cost of dated
investment securities is adjusted for the amortisation of premiums 
or discount on purchase over the period to redemption. Investment
securities are those intended for use on a continuing basis by the Group.
Loan origination
Fee income relating to the origination of loans is recognised in the profit
and loss account to match the cost over the period in which the service 
is provided, together with a reasonable profit margin.
The cost of mortgage incentives, which comprise cashbacks and interest
discounts, are charged to the profit and loss account as a reduction to
interest receivable as incurred.
Extinguishment of liabilities
Under FRS 5, a liability is extinguished if an entity’s obligation to 
transfer economic benefits is satisfied, removed or is no longer likely 
to occur. Satisfaction would encompass an ‘in-substance’ defeasance
transaction where liabilities are satisfied from the cash flows arising from
essentially risk free assets transferred by the debtor to an irrevocable
defeasance trust.
SFAS 133 requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value as adjusted
by the requirements of EITF 02-03. If certain conditions are met then the
derivative may be designated as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or
hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign
subsidiary. The change in value of the fair value hedge is recorded in
income along with the change in fair value of the hedged asset or
liability. The change in value of a cash flow hedge is recorded in other
comprehensive income and reclassified to income as the hedged cash
flows affect earnings. The change in the value of a net investment hedge
is recorded in the currency translation reserve and only released to
income when the underlying investment is sold. With a limited number
of exceptions, Barclays has chosen not to update the documentation of
derivative hedges to comply fully with the requirements of SFAS 133.
Certain terms and conditions of hybrid contracts which themselves
would be standalone derivatives are bifurcated from the underlying
hybrid contract and fair valued if they are not clearly and closely related
to the contract in which they are contained. These are referred to as
embedded derivatives.
Under SFAS 115, debt and marketable equity securities are classified 
as one of three types. Trading securities are carried at fair value with
changes in fair value taken through profit and loss; held to maturity debt
securities are carried at amortised cost where there is the ability and
intent to hold to maturity; available for sale securities that are held for
continuing use in the business are carried at fair value with movements
in fair value recorded in shareholders’ equity. Declines in fair value below
cost that are deemed other-than-temporary impairment are recognised
on the held to maturity and available for sale categories and are
reflected in the profit and loss account.
Non-marketable securities held by investment companies are carried at
fair value with movements in fair value recorded in net income.
SFAS 91 requires loan origination fees and incremental direct costs of
loan origination to be deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as
an adjustment to interest income.
Under SFAS 140, a debtor may derecognise a liability if and only if 
either (a) the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation 
for the liability, or (b) the debtor is legally released from being the
primary obligor under the liability either financially or by the creditor.
SFAS 140 does not allow for the derecognition of a liability by means 
of an ‘in-substance’ defeasance transaction or if it is no longer believed
likely that the liability will be settled.
Any adjustments included in the reconciliations of IFRS to US GAAP provided on pages 258 to 274 and pages 288 and 289 that are not described
above have arisen from refinements of methodology arising from the Group’s conversion to IFRS. Notes to the accounts

SFAS 155: Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments
In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155 (SFAS 155), an amendment to SFAS 140 and SFAS 133.
SFAS 155 permits entities to elect to measure at fair value through earnings any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative
that would otherwise require bifurcation. This fair value election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irreversible. It is available for 
all hybrid instruments that exist as of the date of adoption of the standard as well as new instruments issued or acquired after the date of adoption.
SFAS 155 eliminates a prior restriction on certain passive types of derivatives that a qualifying special purpose entity is expected to hold.
As permitted by SFAS 155, the Group has adopted the fair value election from 1st January 2006. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 155 is a credit 
to retained earnings of £251m (£176m net of tax) comprising gross losses of £267m and gross gains of £518m, determined on an instrument 
by instrument basis. 
For additional information on SFAS 155, see Note (k) on page 268.
SFAS 123-R: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (R) (SFAS 123-R) was issued on 16th December 2004. SFAS 123-R requires that entities
recognise an expense for employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the options.
The statement applies as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period starting after 15th June 2005. Barclays has adopted SFAS 123-R
using Modified Prospective Application where SFAS 123-R applies to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after 
1st January 2006. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Group’s results of operations or financial condition as determined under US GAAP
for the year ended 31st December 2006. 
SFAS 154: Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 (SFAS 154) issued in May 2005 replaces APB 20 and SFAS 3 and changes the requirements 
for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and
requires the retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of such changes.
SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortisation or depletion method for long-lived non-financial assets be accounted for as a
change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 carries forward without change the guidance in Opinion 20
for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements. 
The statement is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after 15th December 2005, although it has
not been applicable to Barclays.
SFAS 158: Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans
The standard requires the recognition in the statement of financial performance of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post-
retirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses and prior period service costs and credits are recognised as a component of other comprehensive income and taken to
income under the recognition and amortisation provisions of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106. Defined benefit plan assets and defined benefit plan obligations
are required to be measured at the date of the statement of financial position. Additional information is required to be disclosed on certain effects on
net periodic benefit cost that arise from delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits.
The requirement to recognise the funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan and the related disclosure requirements is effective for
fiscal years ending after 15th December 2006. Retrospective application is not required.
The Group has adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS 158 as at 31st December 2006. The impact of adoption for the Group’s defined benefit
pension schemes is an increase in other liabilities of £860m, a decrease in other assets of £25m and a decrease in other comprehensive income of
£885m. Associated deferred tax assets have increased by £258m and deferred tax liabilities have decreased by £8m.
The adoption of the recognition provisions for the Groups post-retirement benefit schemes has resulted in an increase in other liabilities of £66m 
and a decrease in other comprehensive income of £66m. Associated deferred tax assets have increased by £20m. 
For a public entity that measures plan assets and benefit obligations as of a date other than the date of its statement of position, the requirement 
to change that date to year-end reporting date is applied for fiscal years ending after 15th December 2008 and shall not be applied retrospectively.
Earlier application is encouraged. Barclays is considering applying the change in measurement date from 30th September to 31st December for the
UKRF and certain post-retirement benefit schemes in 2007. 
The expected impact of adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 for the Group’s pension schemes as at 1st January 2007 is a decrease
in retained earnings of approximately £35m, a decrease in other liabilities of approximately £350m and an increase in other comprehensive income
of approximately £390m as at 1st January 2007.
The impact of adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 on the Group’s post retirement benefit schemes is not expected to be significant
as at 1st January 2007.

SFAS 156: Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156 (SFAS 156) was issued in March 2006. SFAS 156 amends SFAS 140 to require that all separately
recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. SFAS 156 permits an entity to choose the
subsequent measurement of separately recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities either using amortisation method or fair value method.
SFAS 156 also permits, at its initial adoption, a one-time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognised
servicing rights, without impacting the treatment of other available for sale securities under SFAS 115, provided that the available for sale securities
are identified in some manner as offsetting the entity’s exposure to changes in fair value of servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects
to subsequently measure at fair value.
The statement is effective as of the beginning of its first fiscal year beginning after 15th September 2006. The impact of SFAS 156 on the Group’s 
US GAAP position is expected to be immaterial.
FIN 48: Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) was issued in June 2006. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In recognising a tax position, the
enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that is recognised is
then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realised upon ultimate settlement. 
This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15th December 2006. The impact of the interpretation on the Group’s US GAAP
position is expected to be immaterial.
SFAS 157: Fair Value Measurements
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. While this SFAS 157 does not require any new
fair value measurements, it is possible that the application of SFAS 157 will change current practice and introduce new differences between IFRS and
US GAAP. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 15th November 2007. Barclays is assessing the impact
of the standard on the Group’s US GAAP position.
SFAS 159: The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS 159) was issued on 15th February 2006 and provides companies with an option to
report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
SFAS 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different
measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The standard also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and
liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The new statement does not eliminate disclosure
requirements included in other accounting standards, including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in SFAS 157
and SFAS 107.
The statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after 15th November 2007. Barclays is assessing the impact of
the standard on the Group’s US GAAP position. Notes to the accounts

Segmental analysis of the Group is provided in Note 59, Segmental analysis. The significant differences for each segment under US GAAP are in
respect of netting adjustments as disclosed in Note 60 (p), consolidation adjustments as disclosed in Note 60 (m) and the securitisation adjustment
as disclosed in Note 60 (n). The impact of these adjustments is to decrease the total assets of Barclays Capital by £86,558m (2005: decrease by
£89,042m), increase the total assets of Barclays Global Investors by £13,448m (2005: increase by £9,669m), decrease the total assets of Barclaycard
by £5,455m (2005: decrease by £6,390m). Notes to the accounts

(a) Goodwill
The Group annually reviews the carrying value of its goodwill for impairment based on expected future earnings. In 2006 and 2005, there was no
impairment to goodwill under US GAAP . 
In 2004, goodwill recorded by the Group under US GAAP included amounts related to interests acquired following the restructuring of businesses 
to which the Group had previously advanced funds. The Group identified an excess in the carrying value of the reporting units over their implied fair
value and recorded an impairment charge of £56m. The impairment was based on revised cash flow projections which were lower than forecasted
due to going concern issues within these businesses. Further, a partial write-down of £12m was recorded in 2004 in relation to a Group entity
acquired prior to 1st January 1998 in respect of which the goodwill had been previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP . The impairment was
due to achieved cash flows being lower than those required to support the carrying value of goodwill.
The current carrying value of goodwill for US GAAP purposes has been allocated to the reportable business clusters of the Group:

2010 and £49m in 2011.
(c) Pensions and post-retirement benefits
The US GAAP pension disclosures below reflect the following Group pension schemes; the UK Retirement Fund (UKRF), Barclays Capital Staff
Pension Plan and Barclays Capital Pension Restoration Plan (Barclays Capital schemes). Together these schemes make up approximately 93% of all
the Group’s schemes in terms of assets and actuarial liabilities. The UKRF is composed of the 1964 Pension Scheme, Retirement Investment Scheme,
Pension Investment Plan, afterwork and the Career Average Section.
The provisions of US GAAP have been applied to the UKRF and certain post-retirement benefit schemes based on a measurement date of 
30th September, and to the remaining schemes based on a measurement date of 31st December. The impact of the £350m contribution made to 
the UKRF in the fourth quarter of 2006 (£350m in the fourth quarter 2005) on the funded status of the Group’s pension schemes is shown below. 
The components of the pension and post-retirements expense (where an actuarial basis is appropriate) which arise under US GAAP are as follows:

A long-term strategy has been set for the pension plan asset allocation which comprises a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate
assets. This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns, and some asset classes will be more volatile than
others. One of the factors in the choice of a long-term strategy is to ensure that the investments are adequately diversified. The managers are 
permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long-term strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The table below shows the percentage of the fair value of each major category as at the measurement date.

The expected return on assets is determined by calculating a total return estimate based on a weighted average of estimated returns for each 
asset class. Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as inflation, credit spreads and equity
risk premiums.
The Group is expected to make contributions of £351m to the UKRF scheme in 2007 and £20m to the Barclays Capital schemes in 2007.

Inflation 2.80 2.80 3.00 2.70 2.70 2.75
A number of additional changes have been made to the assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UKRF, including a decrease in the assumed 
rate of real salary increases to 1% (30th September 2005: 1.55%), a change in the assumption regarding pension increases to recognise the caps 
and floors which apply to guaranteed pension increases, and the introduction of an explicit allowance for early retirement and commutation. 
Mortality assumptions remain unchanged from those in force at 30th September 2005.
For measurement purposes, the calculations assume a 10% and 5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits and 
dental benefits respectively for pensioners in the US at the end of the 2006 year (11% and 5% at the end of 2005). The rate for 2007 is assumed 
to be 10% and to decrease to 5% over five years to 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. For pensioners in the UK the calculation assumes a 
9% increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits is adopted for the 2006 year end (10% annual rate as at the end of 2005). The rate for
2007 is assumed to be 8% and to decrease to 5% by 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.
Details of the post-retirement health care expense under IFRS are given in Note 35 to the accounts.
The accounting for the post-retirement benefits charge assumed a discount rate of 5.5% (2005: 5.75%) for US benefits and 5.1% (2005: 5.6%) 
for UK benefits on a weighted average basis.
(d) Share-based payments
The total equity settled share-based payment cost recognised for US GAAP for 2006 is £640m (2005: £338m, 2004: £204m). 
The related tax benefit was £193m (2005: £80m, 2004: £nil).
The tax benefit from share options exercised during the year was £161m (2005: £56m).
(e) Deferred tax

The main components of the tax charge attributable to continuing operations are shown in Note 21 to the accounts on pages 184 and 185. 
Included in the tax effect on net income of IFRS/US GAAP reconciling items for 2006 is a credit amount of £12m relating to deferred tax 
(2005: credit of £215m).
The valuation allowance relates to the Group’s capital losses and unrelieved overseas tax losses. These assets will be recognised in the future 
when it becomes more likely than not that they will be utilised.

Upon adoption of IFRS, the Group amended the methodology for the calculation of potential shares and the dilutive impact of convertible options.
Had this change been reflected in the US GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2004, the impact would have been a 0.4p decrease.
(g) Securities
Unlisted investment equity securities are outside the scope of SFAS 115 ‘ Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities’. Where the
securities are held by an investment company within the Group, the securities are carried at fair value. 
All investment securities are classified as being ‘available for sale’ unless the Group has a clear intention and ability to hold them to maturity. 
Other securities are classified as trading securities.
The following table shows the gross unrealised losses and fair value for available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, aggregated by investment
category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealised loss position at 31st December 2006.

Total 16,596 (93) 5,309 (133) 21,095 (226)
The Group performs a review of each individual available for sale and held-to-maturity security on a regular basis to determine whether any evidence
of other-than-temporary impairment exists. This review considers factors such as the duration and amount at which fair value is below cost, the
credit standing and prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Group to hold the security for such sufficient time to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value. 
Under US GAAP, 540 (2005: 177) available for sale and held-to-maturity debt securities had unrealised losses as at 31st December 2006. Based on a
review performed at 31st December 2006, management believes that the unrealised losses are temporary in nature. The unrealised losses are due to
market movements in interest rates. The credit quality of the bond issuers remains strong with 100% rated as investment grade or higher and the
Group has the ability and intent to hold these positions until recovery. Barclays PLC

loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market value, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Smaller balance
homogeneous consumer loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are outside the scope of SFAS 114, as are debt securities and leases. 
At 31st December 2006, the element of impaired loans outside the scope of SFAS 114 amounted to £3,583m (2005: £3,336m).
In accordance with SFAS 114, the Group’s total impaired loans being non-performing, less impaired loans outside the scope of SFAS 114, amount 
to £1,459m at 31st December 2006 (2005: £1,874m). Credit risk provisions of £674m, estimated in accordance with SFAS 114, were held against
these loans (2005: £935m). The average level of such impaired lendings in 2006 was £1,706m (2005: £1,661m).
Where cash received represents the realisation of security, or there is doubt regarding the recovery of a loan, such receipts are treated as repayments
of the loan principal. Otherwise, cash received in respect of impaired loans is recognised as interest income. Estimated interest income which was
recognised in 2006 on impaired loans within the scope of SFAS 114 was £52m (2005: £13m, 2004: £24m).
SFAS 114 modifies the accounting for in-substance foreclosure, in that collateralised debts where the Group takes physical possession of the
collateral, regardless of formal insolvency procedures, would be reclassified as if the collateral had been acquired for cash. At 31st December 2006,
under US GAAP , the amount of collateral recorded at the lower of the book value of the debt or the fair value of the collateral that would 
be reclassified as ‘property, plant and equipment’ was £12m (2005: £nil) and as debt and equity instruments was £nil (2005: £57m).
Mortgage loans of £10,856m (2005: £nil) are included within loans and advances to customers which are held with the intention of resale. During
the year £9,483m (2005: £nil) of loans were sold generating a net profit of £74m (2005: £nil, 2004: £31m).
(i) Business combination
In 2002, Barclays and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce completed the combination of their retail, corporate and offshore banking operations
and created FirstCaribbean International Bank. Until disposal on 22nd December 2006, under both IFRS and US GAAP , Barclays accounted for the
resulting interest as an associate. At the time of the combination, a gain of £206m was generated under both UK and US GAAP , the gain being
recorded in equity for UK GAAP but in the income statement under US GAAP (APB 29 and EITF 01-02). The net assets of the business transferred 
by Barclays to the new entity were not materially different under US GAAP .
In 2004, an adjustment of £13m was made to the gain of £206m, which was also recorded in the income statement under US GAAP . Notes to the accounts

(j) Foreign exchange differences on available for sale (AFS) debt securities
Under IFRS the translation of foreign currency denominated AFS debt securities into the functional currency of the legal entity in which they are held
is recognised directly in the income statement. For US GAAP these movements are reported in shareholders’ equity. 
The pre-tax credit of £349m (2005: £185m, 2004: £428m) represents the reclassification of this amount from the income statement into
shareholders’ equity for US GAAP .
(k) Hybrid Financial Instruments 
In 2006 a fair value loss of £953m is recorded in the income statement in regards to using the option in SFAS 155 to record hybrid financial
instruments at fair value under US GAAP .
(l) Hedging
The US GAAP hedging adjustment results in a decrease in income of £76m (2005: £208m, 2004: n/a). Of this, £85m (2005: £69m, 2004: n/a)
relates to the reversal of IFRS transition adjustments and the inclusion of SFAS 133 transition adjustments and £(9)m (2005: £139m, 2004: n/a)
relates to ongoing hedging differences.
(m) Consolidation 
Differences in the consolidation criteria betwen US GAAP and IFRS result in an increase in total assets of £12,217m (2005: increase of £4,268m). 
Under US GAAP , the Group consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. This is determined by initially evaluating whether the
entity is a voting interest entity, a VIE, or a QSPE.
Certain mortgage loan securitisation entities are consolidated under IFRS and US GAAP . The financial assets of these entities are fully recognised
under US GAAP whereas under IFRS they are only recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. This derecognition difference
results in greater total assets under US GAAP . 
Entities that qualify as qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) under SFAS 140 and therefore are outside the scope of FIN 46(R) are not
consolidated. This exemption from consolidation is not permitted under IFRS and as a consequence the entities are consolidated under IAS 27 
and SIC-12.
Barclays consolidates certain investment entities under IFRS that are not consolidated under US GAAP . Consolidation is appropriate under IFRS due
to Barclays’ control over the operating and financial policies of the entity. These entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) under FIN 46(R) and are
not consolidated as Barclays is not exposed to the majority of the entities’ expected losses and residual returns.
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable each entity to finance itself independently and
provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the rights to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the
entity’s activities. Voting interest entities are consolidated in accordance with ARB 51 which states that the usual condition for a controlling financial
interest in an entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.
Variable interest entities
As defined in FIN 46-R, an entity is considered a VIE subject to consolidation if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity 
to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or if the equity investors lack one of three characteristics of a controlling
financial interest described above. First, the equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting rights or
similar rights. Second, they do not bear the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur. Lastly, they do not claim the right 
to receive expected returns of the entity if they occur, which are the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses.
VIEs are consolidated by the interest holder that remains exposed to the majority of the entity’s expected losses or residual returns, that is, the
primary beneficiary.
The business activities within the Barclays Group where VIEs are used include multi-seller conduit programmes, asset securitisations, client
intermediation, credit structuring, asset realisations and fund management.
Multi-seller conduit programmes
Barclays creates, administers and provides liquidity and credit enhancements to several commercial paper conduit programmes, primarily in the
United States. These conduits provide clients access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing them to sell consumer or trade
receivables to the conduit, which then issues commercial paper to investors to fund the purchase. The conduits have sufficient collateral, credit
enhancements and liquidity support to maintain an investment grade rating for the commercial paper.
Asset securitisations
The Group assists companies with the formation of asset securitisations. These entities have minimal equity and rely upon funding in the form 
of notes to purchase the assets for securitisation. The Group provides both senior and/or junior lending and derivative contracts to the entities,
where junior notes are provided and in certain circumstances where derivative contracts are provided, the Group may be the primary beneficiary 
of the entity. Barclays PLC

(m) Consolidation (continued)
Client intermediation
As a financial intermediary, the Group is involved in structuring transactions to meet investor and client needs. These transactions may involve
entities that fall within the scope of FIN 46-R structured by either Barclays or the client and that are used to modify cash flows of third-party assets to
create investments with specific risk or return profiles, or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks. These transactions may include
derivative instruments, and often contain contractual clauses to enable Barclays to terminate the transaction under certain circumstances, for
example, if the legal or accounting basis on which the transaction was completed changes. In addition, Barclays invests as a limited partner in lessor
partnerships and as a parent in wholly owned subsidiaries specifically to acquire assets for leasing. In a portion of these leasing transactions, there
may be risk mitigants in place which result in a third-party consolidating the entities as the primary beneficiary. 
Credit structuring
The Group structures investments to provide specific risk profiles to investors. This may involve the sale of credit exposures, often by way of credit
derivatives, to an entity which subsequently funds the credit exposures by issuing securities. These securities may initially be held by Barclays prior 
to sale outside of the Group.
Asset realisations
The Group establishes SPEs to facilitate the recovery of loans in circumstances where the borrower has suffered financial loss.
Fund management
The Group provides asset management services to a large number of investment entities on an arms-length basis and at market terms and prices.
The majority of these entities are investment funds that are owned by a large and diversified number of investors. In addition, there are various
partnerships, funds and open-ended investment companies that are used by a limited number of independent third parties to facilitate their tailored
private debt, debt securities or hedge fund investment strategies.

Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs)
In accordance with SFAS 140 and FIN 46-R, the Group does not consolidate QSPEs. QSPEs are passive entities used by the Group to hold financial
assets transferred to them by the Group and are commonly used in mortgage and other securitisation transactions as described in Note 60 (n)
below.
Note
(a) The maximum exposure to loss represents a ‘worst case’ scenario in the event that all such entities simultaneously fail. It does not provide an indication of ongoing
exposure which is managed within the Group’s risk management framework. Where a maximum exposure to loss is quoted, this represents the Group’s total
exposure and includes both drawn and undrawn lending facilities. The Group’s exposure is determined by changes in the value of the variable interests it holds within
these entities, which primarily comprise liquidity, credit enhancements, derivative transactions and financing arrangements. Notes to the accounts

(n) Securitisations
Credit card securitisations
The Group transfers beneficial interests in portfolios of Barclaycard branded credit card receivable assets to Gracechurch Receivables Trustee
Limited, which in turn issues investor certificates to Barclaycard Funding PLC, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. By purchasing the investor
certificates, Barclaycard Funding PLC obtains an equitable beneficial interest in the cash flows arising from the securitised assets and then issues
Medium Term Loan Notes to the Gracechurch Card Funding vehicles which are Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (‘QSPEs’). 
QSPEs sell Loan Notes to investors, who are then entitled to receive specified cash flows during the life of the security. The QSPEs use the proceeds
from the sale of the investor Loan Notes to purchase the Medium Term Loan Notes from Barclaycard Funding PLC. The proceeds of the issuance of
the investor certificates by Gracechurch Receivables Trustee Limited are then distributed to the Group as consideration for the beneficial interests in
the credit card receivables transferred. 
Following a securitisation, the Group receives fees for servicing the receivables and providing cash management services and payment of deferred
consideration for the sale of the beneficial interest in the excess income over and above the interest paid and payable to the noteholder and other
expenses. The Group maintains an interest in the pool of receivables that are available for securitisation, referred to as the seller’s interest.
Investors have no recourse against the Group if cash flows generated from the securitised assets are not sufficient to service the obligations of 
the QSPEs. 
The Group has no right or obligation to repurchase the benefit of any securitised balance, except if certain representations and warranties given by
the Group at the time of transfer are breached.
The Group has entered into interest rate currency swaps with the QSPEs. These swaps convert a proportion of the Sterling variable interest flows
arising from the Loan Note Certificates to US Dollar variable and fixed rate interest flows to match the interest payable on the Medium Term 
Notes issued.
The transfer of receivables is accounted for as a sale under US GAAP where control of the receivables has been relinquished. A gain or loss is
recognised on securitisation of the receivables which is calculated based on the previous carrying amount of the loans involved in the transfer
(allocated between the receivables sold and the seller’s interest based on their relative fair values at the date of sale).
The Group estimates the fair value of the retained interests by determining the present value of future expected cash flows using valuation models
that incorporate management’s best estimates of key assumptions, which include:
(a) the expected prepayment rate of the receivables each year;
(b) the anticipated credit losses from the receivables; and
(c) a discount rate to calculate future income flows.
The retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk such that the Group may not recover substantially all of its investment are recorded 
at fair value with subsequent adjustments reflected in net income.
The servicing liability represents the shortfall of future servicing income from the Group’s obligation to service the transferred assets compared 
to the adequate compensation of servicing those assets. The servicing liability is amortised over the expected life of the receivables.
Credit card securitisation activity during the year
During 2006, the Group securitised credit card receivables with a book value of £112m (2005: £3,497m) recognising a resultant pre-tax gain 
on sale under US GAAP of £7m (2005: £174m, 2004: £38m). The Group has recognised an interest only strip asset and a servicing liability in
connection with the transfer.
The derecognition of the securitised assets results in a reduction in net loans and advances to customers of £5,511m (2005: £6,648m).
Mortgage loans securitisation
In 2004, Barclays acquired and then securitised 10 static pools of residential mortgage loans which were originated by unaffiliated mortgage
companies. Certain of these securitisations were affected through the sale of mortgage loans to QSPEs. During 2005, Barclays acquired and then
securitised an additional 10 pools of residential mortgage loans; however, these securitisations did not qualify for sale accounting and are treated 
as financing transactions.
To fund the acquisition of these mortgage loans, the trust issued Floating Rate Notes (FRNs). The FRNs were underwritten by Barclays and sold to
third-party investors. The offering circulars for the issues of FRNs stated that they are the obligations of the respective trust only and are not
guaranteed by, or the responsibility of, any other party. A call right is held by the originator with the right to liquidate the trust if the principal balance
of the mortgage shares has fallen below 10% of their initial amount, provided all obligations under the bonds can be satisfied in full.
Mortgage loan securitisation activity during the year
During 2006, 17 whole loans and 4 commercial mortgage loan pools were acquired and securitised. Of these, 9 whole loans and 4 commercial
mortgage loan transactions qualified for sale accounting, and therefore non-returnable proceeds of these securitisations totalled £7,887m (2005:
£nil). There was a gain of £41m (2005: £nil, 2004: £25m) arising from the sale of 4 commercial mortgage loan pools.
The retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk such that the Group may not recover substantially all of its investment are recorded at fair
value with subsequent adjustments reflected in net income. The remaining eight securitisations did not qualify for sale accounting and are treated 
as financing transactions. Barclays PLC

At 31st December 2006, key economic assumptions and a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the fair value of those interests of
two unfavourable variations from the expected levels for each key assumption are as follows:

Mortgage Credit card

Impact of 20% adverse change (11) (1)
The sensitivity analysis illustrates the potential magnitude of significant adverse changes in key assumptions used in valuing the interest only strip.
However, changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in
assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Furthermore, the sensitivities for each key variable are calculated independently of changes
in the other key variables.

(o) Guarantees
An element of Barclays normal banking business is to issue guarantees on behalf of its customers. In almost all cases, Barclays will hold collateral
against the exposure, have a right of recourse to the customer or both. In addition, Barclays issues guarantees on its own behalf. The major
categories of these guarantees are:
Financial guarantees
These are given to banks and financial institutions on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities. These are
commonly called facility guarantees.
Included within this category are stock borrowing indemnities. These relate to funds managed by Barclays on behalf of clients, which participate 
in stock lending programmes. Barclays indemnifies the clients against any losses incurred by the clients resulting from borrower default. Collateral,
principally cash, is maintained against all stock borrowing transactions ranging from 102% to 105% of the securities loaned with adjustments to
collateral made daily. It is possible that the exposure could exceed the collateral provided should the value of the security rise concurrently with the
default of the borrowers.
Standby letters of credit
These are irrevocable commitments to pay a third party, on behalf of our customers, the value of which on demand is subject to certain criteria being
complied with. Any amounts paid are debited to the customers’ accounts. These contracts are used when required in substitution of guarantees due
to a greater acceptability in the beneficiary country.
Other guarantees
This category includes the following types of contracts:
Performance guarantees – a guarantee given by the Bank on behalf of a customer, undertaking to pay a certain sum if our customer has failed to
carry out the terms or certain terms of the contract.
Advance payment guarantees – enables the beneficiary to demand repayment of an advance in funds in certain circumstances.
T ender guarantees – provided during a tender process to lend support to a customer’s commitment to a tender process.
Customs and Excise – guarantees provided to HM Revenue and Customs to cover a customer’s liability, most commonly for import duties.
Retention guarantees – similar to advance payments but are used to secure early release of retained contract payments.
The following table provides the maturity analysis of guarantees issued by the Group. The amounts disclosed represent the maximum potential
amount of future payments (undiscounted) the Group could be required to make under the guarantee, before any recovery through recourse or
collaterisation provisions.

Credit card guarantees
Under the Consumer Credit Act of 1974, Barclays may be liable to customers to refund payments made for unsatisfactory goods or services or
unfulfilled contracts where payment was made using a credit card. The maximum liability that Barclays could have is the total credit limits 
marked to customers of £58,695m (2005: £54,479m).
Warranties and indemnities given as part of acquisition and disposal activity
Warranties and indemnities are routinely provided to counterparties as part of the terms and conditions required in a business acquisition, disposal
or investing in joint ventures. Most commonly, these relate to indemnification against tax liabilities arising from pre-transaction activities. Usually the
total aggregate liability, in respect of warranties and indemnities for a transaction is capped and the maximum exposure under these is £1,368m
(2005: £2,139m). No collateral or recourse to third parties is generally available.
Certain derivative contracts
In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which the Group is a counterparty that meet the characteristics
of a guarantee under FIN 45. These derivatives are recorded in the Group’s balance sheet at fair value under US GAAP .  Notes to the accounts

The 2005 comparative amounts for derivatives reflect changes to the netting process made in 2006.
(q) Segmental reporting
Barclaycard management include the results of Absa Card within internally reported segment information. On this basis, Absa Card would be
reported within Barclaycard under SFAS 131. Barclaycard’s profit before tax would increase by £68m (2005: £26m, 2004: £nil) on an IFRS basis with 
IRCB – Absa profit before tax decreasing by the same amount.
(r) Income statement
There are include differences in the presentation of the income statement between IFRS and US GAAP . Under US GAAP , net interest expense 
(2006: £605m, 2005: £126m, 2004: £219m) relating to trading activities would be shown within net interest income, rather than included in net
trading income.
61 Regulatory capital requirements
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) and European Community directives, as implemented by the FSA for supervisory
purposes. The FSA regards the risk asset ratio calculation, originally developed by the Basel Committee, as a key supervisory tool and sets individual
minimum ratio requirements for banks in the UK at or above the minimum of 8%. The concept of risk weighting and the basis for calculating eligible
capital resources are described under capital ratios on page 59.
The following tables summarises capital resources and capital ratios, as defined for supervisory purposes:

In addition to the regulatory capital requirements arising from the Group’s banking businesses, the Group has a capital resource requirement of
£225m (2005: £189m) arising from its life assurance businesses. The equity of the life businesses on the same date was £726m (2005: £417m) and
the capital resources available to the Group as a whole amounted to £41,176m (2005: £36,893m). Barclays PLC

Sterling £1 Preference Shares
1,000 Sterling cumulative callable preference shares of £1 each (the ‘£1 Preference Shares’) were issued on 31st December 2004 at nil premium.
The £1 Preference Shares entitle the holders thereof to receive sterling cumulative cash dividends out of distributable profits of Barclays Bank PLC,
semi-annually at a rate reset semi-annually equal to the sterling interbank offered rate for six-month sterling deposits.
Barclays Bank PLC shall be obliged to pay such dividends if (1) it has profits available for the purpose of distribution under the Companies Act 1985 
as at each dividend payment date and (2) it is solvent on the relevant dividend payment date, provided that a capital regulations condition is satisfied
on such dividend payment date. The dividends shall not be due and payable on the relevant dividend payment date except to the extent that Barclays
Bank PLC could make such payment and still be solvent immediately thereafter. Barclays Bank PLC shall be considered solvent on any date if (1) it is
able to pay its debts to senior creditors as they fall due and (2) its auditors have reported within the previous six months that its assets exceed its
liabilities.
If Barclays Bank PLC shall not pay, or shall pay only in part, a dividend for a period of seven days or more after the due date for payment, the holders of
the £1 Preference Shares may institute proceedings for the winding-up of Barclays Bank PLC. No remedy against Barclays Bank PLC shall be available
to the holder of any £1 Preference Shares for the recovery of amounts owing in respect of £1 Preference Shares other than the institution of
proceedings for the winding-up of Barclays Bank PLC and/or proving in such winding-up.
On a winding-up or other return of capital (other than a redemption or purchase by Barclays Bank PLC of any of its issued shares, or a reduction of
share capital, permitted by the Articles of Barclays Bank PLC and under applicable law), the assets of Barclays Bank PLC available to shareholders shall

classes of shares of Barclays Bank PLC ranking in priority to the preference shares are in issue at the time of such winding-up, in which event the

distributions to shareholders, liquidating distributions in the amount of ¤10,000 per 4.875% Preference Share, ¤10,000 per 4.75% Preference Share,
£10,000 per 6.0% Preference Share, US$10,000 per 6.278% Preference Share and US$25 per 6.625% Preference Share plus, in each case, an amount
equal to the accrued dividend for the then current dividend period to the date of the commencement of the winding-up or other such return of
capital. If a dividend is not paid in full on any preference shares on any dividend payment date, then a dividend restriction shall apply.
This dividend restriction will mean that neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may (a) declare or pay a dividend (other than payment by
Barclays PLC of a final dividend declared by its shareholders prior to the relevant dividend payment date, or a dividend paid by Barclays Bank PLC 
to Barclays PLC or to a wholly owned subsidiary) on any of their respective ordinary shares, other preference shares or other share capital or (b)
redeem, purchase, reduce or otherwise acquire any of their respective share capital, other than shares of Barclays Bank PLC held by Barclays PLC or 
a wholly owned subsidiary, until the earlier of (1) the date on which Barclays Bank PLC next declares and pays in full a preference dividend and (2) the
date on or by which all the preference shares are redeemed in full or purchased by Barclays Bank PLC.
Holders of the preference shares are not entitled to receive notice of, or to attend, or vote at, any general meeting of Barclays Bank PLC. Barclays 
Bank PLC is not permitted to create a class of shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of Barclays Bank PLC in priority to the
preference shares, save with the sanction of a special resolution of a separate general meeting of the holders of the preference shares (requiring a
majority of not less than three-fourths of the holders of the preference shares voting at the separate general meeting), or with the consent in writing
of the holders of three-fourths of the preference shares.
Except as described above, the holders of the preference shares have no right to participate in the surplus assets of Barclays Bank PLC.

Trading market for ordinary shares of Barclays PLC
The nominal capital of Barclays PLC is divided into 9,996,000,000 ordinary shares of 25p each (ordinary shares) and 1,000,000 staff shares of £1
each (staff shares). At the close of business on 31st December 2006, 6,534,698,021 25p ordinary shares and 875,000 staff shares were outstanding.
The principal trading market for Barclays PLC ordinary shares is the London Stock Exchange. Ordinary share listings were also obtained on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange with effect from 1st August 1986 and the New Y ork Stock Exchange (NYSE) with effect from 9th September 1986.
Trading on the NYSE is in the form of ADSs under the symbol ‘BCS’. Each ADS represents four 25p ordinary shares and is evidenced by an American
Depositary Receipt (ADR). The ADR depositary is The Bank of New Y ork. Details of trading activity are published in the stock tables of leading daily
newspapers in the US.
There were 146 ADR holders and 1,371 recorded holders of ordinary shares with US addresses at 31st December 2006, whose shareholdings
represented approximately 3.51% of total outstanding ordinary shares on that date. Since certain of the ordinary shares and ADRs were held by
brokers or other nominees, the number of recorded holders in the US may not be representative of the number of beneficial holders or of their
country of residence. Barclays PLC

Shareholder information
Memorandum and Articles of Association
The Company was incorporated in England and Wales on 20th July 1896
under the Companies Acts 1862 to 1890 as a company limited by shares
and was reregistered in 1982 as a public limited company under the
Companies Acts 1948 to 1980. The Company is registered under
company number 48839. The Company was reregistered as Barclays
PLC on 1st January 1985.
The objects of the Company are set out in full in clause 4 of its
Memorandum of Association which provides, among other things, that
the Company’s objects are to carry on business as an investment and
holding company in all its aspects.
Directors
A Director may not vote or count towards the quorum on any resolution
concerning any proposal in which he (or any person connected with
him) has a material interest (other than by virtue of his interest in
securities of the Company) or if he has a duty which conflicts or may
conflict with the interests of the Company, unless the resolution relates
to any proposal:
(i) to indemnify a Director in respect of any obligation incurred for the
benefit of the Company (or any other member of the Group);
(ii) to indemnify a third party in respect of any obligation for which the
Director has personally assumed responsibility;
(iii) to indemnify a Director for any liability which he may incur in the
performance of his duties or to obtain insurance against such a liability;
(iv) involving the acquisition by a Director of any securities of the
Company pursuant to an offer to existing holders of securities or to 
the public;
(v) that the Director underwrite any issue of securities of the Company
(or any of its subsidiaries);
(vi) concerning any other company in which the Director is interested 
as an officer or creditor or shareholder, but only if he owns less than 
1% of either the issued equity share capital or of the voting rights of 
that company;
(vii) concerning any superannuation fund or retirement, death or disability
benefits scheme or employees’ share scheme, so long as any such fund or
scheme does not give additional advantages to the Directors which are
not granted to the employees who are in the fund or scheme; and
(viii) concerning any other arrangement for the benefit of employees 
of the Company or any other member of the Group under which the
Director benefits in a similar manner to the employees concerned and
which does not give the Director any advantage which the employees 
to whom the arrangement relates would not receive. 
A Director may not vote or be counted in the quorum on any resolution
which concerns his own employment with the Company or any other
company in which the Company is interested.
The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow
money.
A Director must retire from office at the conclusion of the first Annual
General Meeting (AGM) after he reaches the age of 70 although he is
eligible to stand for re-election at that meeting. The new Articles of
Association proposed to be adopted at the 2007 AGM will remove this
restriction.
A Director is required to hold an interest in ordinary shares having a
nominal value of at least £500. A Director may act before acquiring
those shares but must acquire the qualification shares within two
months from his or her appointment.
At each AGM one-third of the Directors for the time being (rounded
down if necessary) are required to retire from office.
Classes of share
The Company has two classes of shares, ordinary shares and staff
shares, to which the provisions set out below apply.
(a) Dividends
Under English law, dividends are payable on the Company’s ordinary
shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK 
and by the Companies Act 1985. The Company in general meeting may
declare dividends by ordinary resolution, but such dividend may not
exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. The Directors may
pay interim or final dividends if it appears they are justified by the
Company’s financial position.
The profits which are resolved to be distributed in respect of any
financial period are applied first in payment of a fixed dividend of 
20% per annum on the staff shares and then in payment of dividends 
on the ordinary shares.
If a dividend is not claimed after 12 years of it becoming payable, 
it is forfeited and reverts to the Company.
The Directors may, with the approval of an ordinary resolution of the
Company, offer shareholders the right to choose to receive an allotment
of new ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of cash in respect 
of all or part of any dividend.
(b) Voting
Every member who is present in person or represented at any general
meeting of the Company and who is entitled to vote has one vote on a
show of hands. On a poll, every member who is present or represented
has one vote for every share held.
If any sum remains unpaid in relation to a member’s shareholding, that
member is not entitled to vote that share unless the Board otherwise
determines.
If any member, or any other person appearing to be interested in any
shares in the Company, is served with a notice under Section 212 of 
the Companies Act 1985 and does not supply the Company with the
information required in the notice, then the Board, in its absolute
discretion, may direct that that member shall not be entitled to attend 
or vote at any meeting of the Company.
(c) Liquidation
In the event of any return of capital on liquidation the ordinary shares
and the staff shares rank equally in proportion to the amounts paid up
or credited as paid up on the shares of each class, except that in the
event of a winding up of the Company the holders of the staff shares 
are only entitled to participate in the surplus assets available for
distribution up to the amount paid up on the staff shares plus 10%. 
(d) Redemption provisions
Subject to the Companies Act 1985, any share may be issued on terms
that it is, at the option of the Company or the holder of such share,
redeemable. The Company has no redeemable shares in issue.
(e) Calls on capital
The Directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any
monies unpaid on their shares. A person upon whom a call is made
remains liable even if the shares in respect of which the call is made 
have been transferred.
(f) Variation of rights
The rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the
sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting 
of the holders of the shares of that class. and ADRs for shares, will not be subject to US federal income tax or 
to UK tax, other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax, as described
below.
Taxation of UK holders
Taxation of dividends 
In accordance with UK law, Barclays PLC and the Bank pay dividends 
on ordinary shares and preference shares without any deduction or
withholding tax in respect of any taxes imposed by the UK government
or any UK taxing authority.
If the shareholder is a UK resident individual liable to income tax only at
the basic rate or the lower rate, then there will be no further tax liability
in respect of the dividend received. If, however, the individual
shareholder is subject to income tax at the higher rate (currently 40%),
there will be a further liability to tax. Higher rate taxpayers are taxable on
dividend income at a special rate of (currently 32.5%) against which can
be offset a tax credit of one-ninth of the dividend paid. Tax credits are no
longer repayable to shareholders with no tax liability.
Taxation of shares under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Where a shareholder elects to purchase shares using their cash
dividend, the individual will be liable for income tax on dividends
reinvested in the Plan on the same basis as if they had received the 
cash and arranged the investment themselves. They should accordingly
include the dividend received in their annual tax return in the normal
way. The tax consequences for a UK individual are the same as
described in ‘Taxation of dividends’ above.
Taxation of capital gains
Where shares are disposed of by open market sale, a capital gain may
result if the disposal proceeds exceed the sum of the base cost of the
shares sold and any other allowable deductions such as share dealing
costs, indexation relief (up to 5th April 1998) and taper relief (generally
on shares held at 16th March 1998 and subsequent acquisitions). To
arrive at the total base cost of any Barclays PLC shares held, the amount
subscribed for rights taken up in 1985 and 1988 must be added to the
cost of all other shares held. For this purpose, current legislation permits
the market valuation at 31st March 1982 to be substituted for the
original cost of shares purchased before that date.
The calculations required to compute chargeable capital gains,
particularly taper and indexation reliefs, may be complex. Capital gains
may also arise from the gifting of shares to connected parties such as
relatives (although not spouses) and family trusts. Shareholders are
advised to consult their personal financial adviser if further information
regarding a possible tax liability in respect of their holdings of Barclays
PLC shares is required.
Stamp duty
On the purchase of shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax at the
rate of 0.5% is normally payable on the purchase price of the shares.
Inheritance tax
An individual may be liable to inheritance tax on the transfer of ordinary
shares or preference shares. Where an individual is liable, inheritance tax
may be charged on the amount by which the value of his or her estate is
reduced as a result of any transfer by way of gift or other gratuitous
transaction made by them or treated as made by them.
Barclays PLC
Annual Report 2006 299
Annual and extraordinary general meetings
The Company is required to hold a general meeting each year as its
AGM in addition to other meetings (called extraordinary general
meetings) as the Directors think fit. The type of the meeting will be
specified in the notice calling it. Not more than 15 months may elapse
between the date of one AGM and the next.
In the case of an AGM or a meeting for the passing of a special
resolution (requiring the consent of a 75% majority) 21 clear days’
notice is required. In other cases 14 clear days’ notice is required. 
The notice must specify the place, the day and the hour of the meeting,
and the general nature of the business to be transacted. 
Subject as noted in (b) above, all shareholders are entitled to attend 
and vote at general meetings. The Articles of Association do, however,
provide that arrangements may be made for simultaneous attendance
at a general meeting at a place other than that specified in the notice of
meeting, in which case some shareholders may be excluded from the
specified place.
Limitations on foreign shareholders
There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Company’s
Memorandum or Articles of Association on the right of non-residents 
or foreign persons to hold or vote the Company’s ordinary shares other
than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the Company’s
shareholders.
Taxation
The following is a summary of the principal tax consequences for
holders of ordinary shares of Barclays PLC, preference shares of the
Bank, or ADSs representing such ordinary shares or preference shares,
and who are citizens or residents of the UK or US, or otherwise who are
subject to UK tax or US federal income tax on a net income basis in
respect of such securities, that own the shares or ADSs as capital assets
for tax purposes. It is not, however, a comprehensive analysis of all the
potential tax consequences for such holders, and it does not discuss the
tax consequences of members of special classes of holders subject to
special rules or holders that, directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of
Barclays voting stock. Investors are advised to consult their tax advisers
regarding the tax implications of their particular holdings, including the
consequences under applicable state and local law, and in particular
whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, as defined below.
A US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is for US federal
income tax purposes (i) a citizen or resident of the US, (ii) a US domestic
corporation, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to US federal income
tax regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if a US court can exercise
primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more US
persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
Unless otherwise noted, the statements of tax laws set out below are
based on the tax laws of the UK in force as at 28th February 2006 and
are subject to any subsequent changes in UK law, in particular any
announcements made in the Chancellor’s UK Budget in March 2006.
This section is also based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations,
published rulings and court decisions (the Code), and on the Double
Taxation Convention between the UK and the US as entered into force 
in March 2003 (the Treaty), all of which are subject to change, possibly
on a retroactive basis.
This section is based in part upon the representations of the ADR
Depositary and the assumption that each obligation of the Deposit
Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance
with its terms.
For purposes of the Treaty, the Estate and Gift Tax Convention and for
the purposes of the Code, the holders of ADRs evidencing ADSs will 
be treated as owners of the underlying ordinary shares or preference
shares, as the case may be. Generally, exchanges of shares for ADRs,

Taxation of US holders
Taxation of dividends
A US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross
amount of any dividend paid by Barclays PLC or the Bank, as applicable,
out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined
for US federal income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a non-corporate
US holder in taxable years beginning before 1st January 2011 that
constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to the holder at 
a maximum tax rate of 15%, provided that the holder has a holding
period of the shares or ADSs of more than 60 days during the 121-day
period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (or, in the case of
preference shares or ADSs relating thereto, if the dividend is attributable
to a period or periods aggregating over 366 days, provided that the
holder holds the shares or ADSs for more than 90 days during the
181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date) and
meets certain other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by
Barclays or the Bank, as applicable, with respect to the ordinary or
preference shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend income. 
A US holder will not be subject to UK withholding tax. The US holder will
include in gross income for US federal income tax purposes the amount
of the dividend actually received from Barclays or the Bank.
Dividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the 
case of shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or
constructively receives the dividend, and will not be eligible for the
dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in
respect of dividends received from other US corporations. Dividends will
be income from sources outside the US, but dividends paid in taxable
years beginning before 1st January 2007 will generally be ‘passive
income’ or ‘financial services income,’ and dividends paid in taxable
years beginning after 31st December 2006 will, depending on the
holder’s circumstances, be ‘passive’ or ‘general’ income which, in either
case, is treated separately from other types of income for the purposes
of computing any allowable foreign tax credit.
The amount of the dividend distribution includable in income will be 
the US Dollar value of the pound Sterling payments made, determined
at the spot Pound Sterling/US Dollar rate on the date the dividend
distribution is includable in income, regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into US Dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting
from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date
the dividend payment is includable in income to the date the payment 
is converted into US Dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss 
and, for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, from sources within the
US and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified
dividend income.
Distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits,
as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a
return of capital to the extent of the US holder’s basis in the shares or
ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. 
Taxation of capital gains
Generally, US holders will not be subject to UK tax, but will be subject 
to US tax on capital gains realised on the sale or other disposition of
ordinary shares, preference shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-
corporate US holder that is recognised before 1st January 2011 is
generally taxed at a maximum rate of 15% where the holder has a
holding period of greater than one year. The gain or loss will generally 
be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax
credit limitation purposes.
Taxation of premium on redemption or purchase of shares
No refund of tax will be available under the Treaty in respect of any
premium paid on a redemption of preference shares by the Bank or on 
a purchase by Barclays PLC of its own shares. For US tax purposes,
redemption premium generally will be treated as an additional amount
realised in the calculation of gain or loss.
Stamp duty
No UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer of an ADS, provided that
the separate instrument of transfer is not executed in, and remains at all
times outside, the UK.
Estate and gift tax
Under the Estate and Gift Tax Convention between the United Kingdom
and the United States, a US holder generally is not subject to UK
inheritance tax.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting
security holders
Other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time
to time, there are currently no UK laws, decrees or regulations which
would affect the transfer of capital or remittance of dividends, interest
and other payments to holders of Barclays securities who are not
residents of the UK. There are also no restrictions under the Articles of
Association of either Barclays PLC or the Bank, or (subject to the effect
of any such economic sanctions) under current UK laws, which relate
only to non-residents of the UK, and which limit the right of such non-
residents to hold Barclays securities or, when entitled to vote, to do so.

‘ Absa’ refers to the results for Absa Group Limited as consolidated into the

results that is reported by Barclays within the International Retail and Commercial
Banking business.

Group reporting changes
Barclays announced on 16th June 2006 the impact of certain changes in Group
structure and reporting on the 2005 and 2004 results. 
Barclays realigned a number of reportable business segments based on the
reorganisation of certain portfolios better to reflect the type of client served, the
nature of the products offered and the associated risks and rewards. The Group's
policy for the internal cost of funding and the segmental disclosure of risk weighted
assets was also revised with effect from 1st January 2006. The reclassifications had 
no impact on the Group Income Statement or Balance sheet.
We are committed to building a leading
universal bank and we’re already one of
the largest financial services companies in
the world by market capitalisation.
Operating in over 50 countries and
employing 123,000 people, we move, lend,
invest and protect money for over 27 million
customers and clients the world over . 9907087

Registered in England. Registered No: 48839 arclays had an excellent 2006. 
Proﬁt before tax rose by 35%,
with outstanding performances
from Barclays Capital and
Barclays Global Investors. Of
particular note is the continued
turnaround in UK Retail Banking, which this
year delivered very strong growth along
with UK Business Banking. We also saw a
very strong performance from Absa, in its
ﬁrst full year contribution and are ahead 
of plan in delivering the income and cost
synergies from the acquisition.
Proﬁt before tax at Barclaycard
decreased as good income growth was
offset by higher impairment charges 
and increased costs from the continued
development of the international
businesses. We started to see in the second
half of 2006 the beneﬁt of the actions taken
to address the deterioration in the UK
consumer credit environment.
The Group declared a ﬁnal dividend 
for the year of 20.5p per share, making 
a total payment for the year of 31p, 
an increase of 17%. We delivered a 
total shareholder return (share price
appreciation plus reinvested dividend
payments) of 25% for the year.
The strong performance for the year 
is a tribute to the immense contribution
made by my predecessor, Matthew Barrett,
initially as Chief Executive and
subsequently as Chairman. Proﬁt before 
tax increased from £2.5bn to £7.1bn during
his time with the Group and Barclays would
not be in the strong position it is today
without his contribution. I look forward to
working with the Board and the executive
team to build on this platform and continue
to take Barclays forward.
Corporate governance
As Chairman, it is my responsibility to
ensure that the highest standards of
corporate governance are in place and I am
committed to maintaining Barclays strong
reputation in this area.
2006 saw a number of Board changes.
On the executive side, Frits Seegers joined
Barclays as a Director and Chief Executive 
of Global Retail and Commercial Banking 
in July. Gary Hoffman, who was Chairman 
of UK Banking and of Barclaycard, was
appointed as Group Vice Chairman. 
He is accountable for a range of issues,
including corporate responsibility, public
policy and equality and diversity. David
Roberts, previously Chief Executive of
International Retail and Commercial
Banking, left Barclays at the end of the year.
I would like to thank David for his signiﬁcant
contribution to the Group.
On the non-executive side, Fulvio Conti
joined the Board as previously reported.
Fulvio is Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of Enel SpA,
the Italian energy group. Sir David Arculus
retired from the Board after serving for 
nine years. Bob Steel resigned as a 
Director, following his appointment as
Under Secretary of the Treasury of the
United States of America.
Finally, Chris Lucas will be joining the
Group and the Board on 1st April 2007 
as Group Finance Director. Chris was
previously with PricewaterhouseCoopers
and has worked across ﬁnancial services 
for most of his career. He will succeed
Naguib Kheraj who will be leaving the Board
on 31st March 2007. Naguib has made an
outstanding contribution to Barclays, for
which we are most grateful. We wish him
well for the future.
Responsible banking
A key objective of the Board is for Barclays
to be a leader in the area of corporate
responsibility. 2006 saw signiﬁcant
progress towards this objective. 
We continued to give high priority to
ﬁnancial inclusion and improving access 
to banking services and affordable credit.
The number of UK Cash Card accounts
designed for low income and vulnerable
people increased by 22% to 464,000, 
while Absa remains the leading bank
provider of Mzansi basic bank accounts 
and launched an innovative new service 
to help beneﬁciaries of social grants.
In terms of environmental management,
Barclays UK operations are now carbon
neutral. Our involvement in the Business
Leaders’ Initiative on Human Rights
continues and we retain membership 
of the Dow Jones Sustainability and
FTSE4Good ethical indices. We achieved
third position in the Business in the
Community Corporate Responsibility Index.
Full details are contained in our eighth
Corporate Responsibility report, and at

This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A
of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to certain of the Group’s
plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future ﬁnancial condition
and performance. These forward-looking statements can be identiﬁed by the fact that
they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements
sometimes use words such as ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘ expect’, ‘ estimate’, ‘intend’,
‘plan’, ‘ goal’, ‘believe’, or other words of similar meaning. Examples of forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements regarding the Group’s future ﬁnancial
position, income growth, impairment charges, business strategy , projected levels of
growth in the banking and ﬁnancial markets, projected costs, estimates of capital
expenditures, and plans and objectives for future operations. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because
they relate to future events and circumstances, including, but not limited to, the further
development of standards and interpretations under IFRS applicable to past, current
and future periods, evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application
of standards under IFRS, as well as UK domestic and global economic and business
conditions, market related risks such as changes in interest rates and exchange rates,
the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in
legislation, progress in the integration of Absa into the Group’s business and the
achievement of synergy targets related to Absa, the outcome of pending and future
litigation, and the impact of competition – a number of which factors are beyond the
Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s actual future results may differ materially from
the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the Group’s forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Barclays speak only as of the
date they are made. Barclays does not undertake to update forward-looking
statements to reflect any changes in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any
changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
The reader should, however , consult any additional disclosures that Barclays has made
or may make in documents it has ﬁled or may ﬁle with the SEC.

start this review by thanking the
123,000 employees of the Barclays
Group, whose dedication and creativity
helped us achieve record results in
2006. Our strategy of ‘earn, invest and
grow’ continued to deliver very strong
growth in proﬁts. Our ambition is to
become one of the handful of universal
banks leading the global ﬁnancial services
industry. I believe the universal banking
model is helping us drive the higher growth
for shareholders that I set out to achieve
three years ago, by providing us with new
options in products, services and markets.
In our business, strategy simply 
stated is anticipation followed by service:
we anticipate the needs of customers and
clients. We then serve them, by helping
them achieve their goals. 
The needs of customers and clients are
changing. The drivers of change include:
the privatisation of welfare; wealth
generation and wealth transfer; explosive
growth in demand for banking products in
emerging markets; the securitisation of
assets and cash flows; the use of
derivatives in risk management; the
signiﬁcant growth in the use of credit cards
for payment and borrowing; and the
opportunity for capital markets and private
equity to fund infrastructure development
around the world. 
T o capitalise on these sources
of growth, I have put a new
structure in place by creating
Global Retail and Commercial
Banking (GRCB) under the
leadership of Frits Seegers, who joined
Barclays in July 2006. GRCB brings
together: UK Banking, International Retail
and Commercial Banking and Barclaycard.
GRCB gives Barclays a single point of
strategic direction and control to these
businesses, thereby increasing our
capability to drive growth and synergies
globally and to enter new markets. 
We believe this will enable us to 
replicate success from one part of the
world in another. This GRCB structure
mirrors the organisation of Investment
Banking and Investment Management
under Bob Diamond, which includes
Barclays Capital, Barclays Global Investors
and Barclays Wealth, and also gives a single
point of strategic direction and control to a
group of global businesses which enjoy
substantial synergies.
Group performance
We made substantial progress on our
strategic priorities and delivered record
ﬁnancial results. Proﬁt before tax increased
35% to £7,136m. Earnings per share rose
32% to 71.9p, and economic proﬁt was up
54% to £2,704m. We increased the total
dividend payout to 31p, a rise of 17%. 
Income grew 25% to £21,595m, well
ahead of expense growth of 20%. The
growth was broadly based by business and
geography, reflecting momentum in each
business. Approximately half our proﬁts
came from outside the UK, up from about
30% in 2003.
Operating expenses increased 20% to
£12,674m. The Group cost:income ratio
improved two percentage points to 59%.
Impairment charges rose 37% to
£2,154m. The increase was mostly
attributable to the challenging credit
environment in UK unsecured retail
lending which was partly due to the
continued rise in the level of
personal insolvencies. In the second
half of 2006, as a result of a number
of management actions, flows into
delinquency decreased and arrears balances
declined across the UK cards and unsecured
loans portfolios. We therefore believe that
we passed the worst in Barclaycard UK
impairment in the second half of 2006. 
When I look at these results, I am pleased
to see increased productivity in our use of
capital, risk and costs. Return on average
shareholders’ funds improved four
percentage points to 25%; proﬁts grew
much faster than Daily Value at Risk and

Outlook
We enter 2007 with strong income
momentum in Barclays, driven by high
levels of customer activity and good risk
control. The global economic outlook
continues to be positive and we are well
positioned to capture further growth in 
the years ahead.

UK Retail Banking
Building the best retail bank in the UK
Deanna Oppenheimer Chief Executive UK Retail Banking
ur UK Retail Banking
business provides a wide
range of products and
services to personal and
smaller (local) business
customers, including
current accounts, savings and investment
products, Woolwich branded mortgages
and general insurance. More affluent
customers are provided with investment
products and advice through Premier
banking. 33,000 people are employed in
this business providing customer service
and developing products. We have
registered higher levels of employee
satisfaction, and strengthened our
management team in the year.
Our strategy in the UK is simple: to
become the best retail bank in the country .
We will aim to do this by putting customers
at the heart of our business, improving 
our operations and levels of service, and
developing new products that meet our
customers’ needs in a changing world. 
We are also extending our online and
telephone banking, so that customers can
bank with us in the way that best suits 
them – we already service around 480,000
online customers every day . Achieving our
ultimate goal will take time, but we have
accelerated the rate of investment in the last
year, and the business has made excellent
progress during that time. 
O
We have taken full advantage of 
favourable market conditions this year
growing our market share across a 
number of product areas.
The year in review
We believe that the UK Retail Banking
transformation is well under way. Proﬁt
before tax increased 17%, and a 7% rise in
total income to £3,828m reflects growth in
deposits, mortgage and loan balances as
well as current accounts which increased
by 375,000 during the year. Costs
remained steady at £2,408m with gains
from the sale and leaseback of property
being substantially reinvested in the
business to improve customer service.
One of our key priorities in 2006 was
improving the performance of our mortgage
business. In February 2006 we took back
control of the servicing of our mortgage
book, and since then we have made
signiﬁcant improvements in our processes;
for example, the average time taken to get a
mortgage offer out to a customer has been
cut considerably . We have also put a
renewed effort behind marketing our
mortgages and developed new products –
see ‘making more of mortgages’. The result
has been a signiﬁcant rise in new lending,
and a greater share of net lending in the
mortgage market.
Our average savings book has also
grown this year, up 8% on 2005. Here too
we have introduced new products, and
attracted an extra 180,000 savings
accounts during the year. The number of
household insurance policies increased by
34% to 825,000. 
UK Retail Banking has also worked hard at
building links with other parts of the Group,
both to develop new business opportunities,
and to ensure that customers with wider
needs get the best possible service from us. 
For example, we now have a new
process for referring Premier banking
customers to Barclays Wealth, which can
offer more complex ﬁnancial planning and
investment advice.
The ongoing programme to enhance 
the branch network continued in 2006. 
200 branches were refurbished during the
year, and there are now award-winning 
self-service terminals in over 400 branches.
More mortgages
2006 was a year of real success for our
mortgage business. We invested more in
marketing and advertising our range of
products, as well as launching pioneering
new ones like the Woolwich’s new 10-year
ﬁxed rate and Lifetime Tracker mortgages. 
It was great to see our products
featuring so regularly in the Best Buy
tables in the national newspapers – in May
we were included in ten different tables in
the same weekend.
The Woolwich also won the Your Money
magazine award for Best Mortgage
Provider , and the Your Mortgage award for
Best First Time Buyer Mortgage Lender .

A part of this programme is the full
integration of the Woolwich network into
Barclays-branded branches, which will 
take place during 2007. The aim behind
this is to give both sets of customers a
better service, with more modern branches
in the most convenient locations. As the
programme gets under way we are
ensuring that we communicate fully to all
customers affected by the changes.

we increased our foreign exchange

We continue to hold a strong position 
in asset ﬁnance, and Business Moneyfacts
voted us ‘Best Leasing and Asset Finance
Provider’ for the sixth year running. Iveco

business we bought in 2005, helped
cement this position by performing well

other parts of the Barclays Group, notably
Barclays Capital, enable customers to
beneﬁt from our international and capital

Our ambition is to be the number one
commercial bank in the UK. We will do this
by putting the customer ﬁrst in all that we
do: ensuring that our operations, industry
knowledge, service levels and product
range are wholly relevant to meeting
customers’ needs.
The year in review
Leveraging good market conditions, UK
Business Banking had another year of
strong growth in 2006. Proﬁt before tax
increased by 18% to £1,365m, and income
rose 11% on the back of good balance
sheet growth. Costs increased 4% –
reflecting higher volumes and the
recruitment of front line staff – with
approximately half the gains from sale and
leaseback of property being reinvested in
the business to improve customer service. 
We maintained our market share of
primary customer relationships, improved
our cost:income ratio by two percentage
points to 36% and made a 19%
contribution to Group proﬁt. 
Strong afﬁliation with customers remains
the bedrock of our approach. We worked
hard throughout the year to strengthen our
capability to serve by investing in talent at all
levels of the business. 
Consequently, during 2006 our larger
business customers have consistently
ranked Barclays as number one in the
market for Relationship Director and
Relationship Support Manager satisfaction
and industry knowledge. We increased the
number of customers we serve from
144,000 in 2005 to 150,000 in 2006. 
Building closer links with Barclays 
Capital enabled us to offer larger and
Operationally, we have continued to
develop our technology platform, with
2006 investment increasing substantially
compared to 2005. Testament to this, 
our Gadbrook Park service centre – which
provides support for Electronic Banking,
Payments, and Cash Management
solutions to all UK Business Banking
customers – was awarded ‘Employer of the
Y ear’ in the 2006 National Business Awards. 
To continue to improve customer service
and efﬁciency, we are in the process of
consolidating our medium business
servicing and operations sites to a smaller
number of centres of excellence.
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest
signiﬁcantly in operations, technology and
talent to ensure that our offering remains
relevant to customers. 
We will drive sustainable ﬁnancial
performance by expanding into new markets
and increasing our share of those where we
believe we have a competitive advantage.

We now have more than 17.3 million

The year in review

ur Barclaycard business is a

O
higher impairment charges and increased
costs from the continued development 
of the international businesses. Income grew
8% to £2,937m broadly reflecting increased
consumer lending and growth internationally .
Impairment charges increased 36% to
£1,493m. The increase was driven by a rise in
delinquent balances and increased numbers
of bankruptcies and Individual V oluntary
Arrangements. As a result of management
action to tighten lending criteria and improve
collections, the flows of new delinquencies
have reduced, levels of arrears balances have
declined and credit performance is
improving. Costs increased 8% to £1,054m
largely as a result of continued investment in
Barclaycard US and the development of UK
partnerships. 
Our international markets are at the heart
of our growth strategy . We now have cards
in issue in over 16 countries around the
world. Three out of every four new cards we
issue are now outside the UK. The number
of Barclaycard customers in these markets
grew by 53% last year. But each of these
markets is different, and the key to our
success has been to adapt our strategy 
to local conditions. In the US, we have
launched partnerships with US Airways,
Travelocity , Jo-Ann Stores and Barnes and
Noble, the world’ s largest bookseller. 
By contrast, our approach in many
continental European countries has been to
collaborate with partner banks to develop
new opportunities: one of our most
successful deals has been ‘Entercard’, the
Scandinavian joint venture we launched
with Swedbank in 2005. Entercard launched
its ﬁrst new product in 2006, backed by an
extensive television, internet, and billboard
advertising campaign in Sweden. In 2006 we
also established a new card deal with Caja
Asturias, the Spanish savings bank.
As the consumer lending market in the 
UK changes, Barclaycard is repositioning its
business to achieve sustainable, proﬁtable
growth. Higher borrowing by UK consumers,
lower disposable household incomes and a
tougher regulatory environment have seen
Barclaycard take a number of actions. The
business focused on tighter lending criteria
and improved collections throughout 2006
and, as a consequence, we believe we
passed the worst in Barclaycard UK
impairment in the second half of 2006.
There has also been a review of some
partnerships businesses and lending to
higher risk customers. An operational review
is also under way , to improve efﬁciency and
enhance Barclaycard’ s ability to provide the
best service to customers, wherever they 
are in the world.
We published our own report, ‘Exercising
Responsibility in Lending’ and improved 
the quantity and clarity of our product
information, so that customers can make
better and more informed decisions about

An important task this year was the
integration of Absa, with its 8.3m customers
and 34,000 employees, into the Barclays

with the integration programme and the
realisation of synergy beneﬁts, which are
well ahead of plan. In 2006, 753m Rand of
synergies have been delivered, 453m Rand
in excess of the 300m Rand target originally
communicated for the period. International

The year in review
Proﬁt before tax increased £637m to
£1,270m reflecting the inclusion of a full
year’ s contribution from International 
Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa of
£698m and a gain on the disposal of the
interest in FirstCaribbean International Bank
of £247m.
Excluding Absa and the disposal gain,
proﬁt before tax was £325m (2005:
£335m). This reflected good growth in
continental Europe offset by a decline 
in proﬁts in Africa caused by higher
impairment, and increased costs reflecting 
a step change in the rate of organic
investment in the business.
Income grew to £3,337m and costs
increased to £2,196m both largely due to a
full year’ s contribution from International
Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa.
performed strongly, driven by the
continued realisation of beneﬁts from
Banco Zaragozano, together with good
growth in mortgages and assets under
management. Collaboration with Barclays
Capital enables us to offer our corporate
customers in Spain a range of products 
and advisory services at every stage of their
development. Another notable Spanish
success has been a range of new mortgage
products designed specially for non-
residents buying holiday properties. 
In Italy the Banca Woolwich mortgage
business had a very good year, we opened
ten new branches and are about to expand
our network further with 35 new branches
set to open by the end of 2007. We are also
expanding our network in Portugal where
over 30 new branches opened in 2006. 
At the same time we have developed a
number of special products and services 
for small and medium sized businesses.
In France we have successfully completed
the integration of ING Ferri acquired in 2005.
Emerging Markets
We see signiﬁcant potential in emerging
markets, which for us include Africa
(excluding Absa), the Middle East, India
and Indian Ocean. We have established
Dubai as a regional headquarters for this
growing business. 
Our long history and experience in Africa
is opening up important new opportunities
for us across the continent, and in many
cases we will be able to draw on Absa’ s 
local expertise in commercial, retail and
investment banking. For example, we are
launching a number of new and innovative
products in our other African markets,
including mortgages in Ghana and
Botswana, a student account in Uganda,
and the ‘La Riba’ Islamic current account 
in Kenya. We also opened 16 new branches
during the year.
We are already one of the fastest
growing and most proﬁtable banks in Egypt
and we will soon be offering commercial
banking in Qatar which will be our most
signiﬁcant expansion in the Middle East 
for 30 years. We are also expanding across
Asia with plans to open new branches in
India in 2007 , and have launched a new
structured deposit account in Mauritius. second-largest convertible bond issue to
the South African market.
We also expect growth across our 
key markets with additional great
opportunities outside the world’ s
largest economies, reaping the
beneﬁt of our investments in
Mexico, China, India and the 
Middle East. We also expect to 
see growth across our key asset
classes as we build on our
reputation for innovating and
ﬁnding new opportunities in 
the market. 
We will continue to do more
business with our clients,
reflecting the nature of our
trusted partnerships and the
increase in their activities.

Blake Grossman Chief Executive Barclays Global Investors
arclays Global Investors (BGI) 
is now one of the largest
institutional asset managers in
the world. In the past six years it
has grown client assets under
management by over US$1.0trn,
and now manages funds for some 
2,900 clients in 52 countries, employing
2,700 people.
Our success to date has been built on an
in-depth understanding of the three pillars
of fund performance – risk, return and cost
– but we have also gained a reputation for
the skilled application of meticulous
quantitative investment analysis. 
One of our real strengths has always
been in structured investing, where we
apply our experience and expertise to
develop new products, or create tailor-
made investments for particular clients’
needs. Our services in this area include
guidance on asset allocation and a
framework for using hedge funds, as well
as standard investment services such as
securities lending and cash management.
Through the iShares™ brand we are the
market leader in exchange-traded funds, 
a market that is predicted to reach US$2trn 
by 2011.
Looking ahead, we are continuing to
focus our resources on areas where we
already have a competitive advantage,
notably exchange-traded funds and active
product management, which currently
account for around 39% of our assets, 
but over 70% of our proﬁts. 
We are also investing aggressively in
businesses and initiatives that we expect to
be high-growth in the future, which include
alternative investments and ﬁxed income.
Looking more broadly at the market in
which we operate, we see a continued
trend towards greater consolidation as
breadth and scale become increasingly
important. At the same time, the exchange-
traded funds market is also becoming more
competitive, and attracting new players.
The year in review
2006 was another very good year for BGI.
Proﬁt before tax increased 32% to £714m
reflecting strong income growth and higher
operating margins. Assets under
management are now more than US$1.8trn.
Income growth of 26% reflects increases 
in management fees and revenue from
securities lending offset by lower incentive
fees. Costs rose 22%, due to continued
investment in people, new products and
technology as well as a result of higher
performance-related pay. 
During 2006, we launched a number of
new exchange-traded products, including
S&P global sector funds, iPath exchange-
traded notes, Dow Jones sub-sector funds
and various commodity products such 
as gold, silver and oil. In October we
announced the acquisition of Indexchange
Investment AG, Germany’ s leading provider
of exchange-traded funds.

The iPath
SM
to success
BGI was one of the ﬁrst movers in the
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) market.
ETFs are index funds which are bought
and sold through stock exchanges. 
Their flexibility enables investors to buy
and sell shares through any brokerage 
ﬁrm or ﬁnancial adviser . The market has
grown from US$5bn to over US$500bn 
in the last ten years, and we still manage
more funds than anyone else – a total of
US$287bn at the end of 2006. In June, 
BGI and Barclays Capital teamed up to
create and sell iPath exchange-traded
notes, providing access to difﬁcult to 
reach markets. 
In the six months since launch, iPath
has over US$1.1bn in assets, including the
largest multi-commodity exchange-
traded product on the market: iPath Dow
Jones – AIG Commodity Index Total Return
ETN with US$835m in assets.
Our Fixed Income division launched several
new products during the year, including a
synthetic collateralised debt obligation
platform. We also set up a new Strategic
Solutions Group, which will focus on more
effective construction and delivery of multi-
product solutions to address a broad range
of client needs.

arclays Wealth is the UK’ s leading
wealth manager in terms of
assets under management and
the largest retail multi-manager.
In Barclays Stockbrokers we 
lead the UK market for
execution-only retail brokerage with 
over 400,000 accounts. 
We craft solutions to meet the needs 
of our affluent, high net worth and
intermediary clients. Core service offerings
include private banking, ﬁnancial planning,
asset management, stockbroking, offshore
banking and wealth structuring.
Our 7,800 people are based in 81
locations spread across 18 countries and
our mission is: ‘To be the premier European
Wealth Manager, attracting clients through
world-class products, innovative solutions
and outstanding service’. We are investing
to develop Barclays Wealth into a truly
global and client-centric business
committed to the delivery of excellence. 
We are doing this by the application of
simple principles: developing outstanding
products, hiring the best people and
leveraging the strong synergies that exist
with Barclays Capital, Barclays Global
Investors and UK Retail Banking.
Demographic and economic factors
continue to make the global market for
wealth management particularly attractive.
The industry is extraordinarily fragmented
with no one organisation having more 
than a 4% market share. With the beneﬁt 
of the ﬁnancial strength and global
reputation of the Barclays name, together
with the solid foundations laid down in
2006, there is an enormous opportunity 
for Barclays Wealth to make a signiﬁcant
impact in 2007.
The year in review
Proﬁt before tax grew strongly to £213m,
representing an increase of 28% on 2005.
Total client assets rose to £93bn on the
back of excellent new net asset flows and
strong market growth. Income increased 
by 12% to £1,036m and once again 
our cost:income ratio improved by 
three percentage points.
A particular highlight in 2006 was the
rapid growth seen in our Barclays Multi-
Manager portfolio service with assets
under management increasing by over
68% to £10.1bn. By leveraging Barclays 
scale and expertise, we can access the
world’ s leading investment managers to
create portfolios flexible enough to meet
each individual client’ s investment needs. 
We were placed top of the influential
Private Asset Managers’ 2006 league table,
ranking Barclays Wealth as the UK’ s leading
wealth manager for the second year in
succession. In addition, Barclays
Stockbrokers was voted Broker of the Y ear
in 2006 by both Investors Chronicle and
Shares magazine, and the UK private bank
was acclaimed Euromoney’ s ‘Best private
bank for entrepreneurs’.
A key differentiator is our ability to
collaborate with other areas of the Barclays
Group. We have unique access to the
B
Barclays Global Investors product suite, 
and our relationship with Barclays Capital
enables us to provide clients with
institutional-quality products and capital
market solutions. We launched over 300
such products in 2006, giving clients
access to equities, currencies, commodities
and interest rates, hedge funds and mutual
funds in a bespoke and risk controlled way.
2006 also saw the launch of Investment
Notes – tradable structured products listed
on the London Stock Exchange. These are
designed for retail investors who want
exposure to more volatile markets, while
retaining an element of capital protection at
maturity. Eight Investment Notes have been
introduced to date, with regular launches
planned throughout 2007 and beyond.
As part of a wider investment in the business, 2006 saw the launch
of a new corporate identity for Barclays Wealth. This brought four
distinct business areas under the same integrated, corporate
identity – private banking, investment services, ﬁnancial planning
and brokerage.
As the business undergoes rapid transformation, it is vital that
Barclays Wealth builds a clearer market positioning demonstrating
our commitment to delivering world-class products and services
to our clients. This distinct new visual identity builds on the value
of core pillars of our brand – the ﬁnancial strength and global
reputation of Barclays name and the innovative thinking and
product of Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors.
At the heart of Barclays Wealth is an ability to understand our
clients' needs in relation to their wealth, and this is exempliﬁed in
our advertising. By posing the question: ‘Wealth. What’s it to you?’
the campaign builds on the simple but key insight that everyone
has a unique attitude towards wealth – personal dreams, goals 
and ambitions. This was further supported by the launch of the
Barclays Wealth Insights, the ﬁrst in a series of quarterly reports
developed in conjunction with the Economist Intelligence Unit 
that aim to provide a deﬁnitive picture of what being wealthy
means in the 21st century .

sustaining healthy ﬁnancial systems around 
the world.
Our priorities have been informed by broad
dialogue with investors, non-governmental
organisations, customers, our employees and
politicians. We focus on the following areas:
• Our customers
• Financial inclusion
• Responsible lending
• Environment and climate change
• Supply chain management
• Our employees
• Community investment
Governance
The Group Chief Executive has primary
responsibility for embedding ‘responsible
banking’. The Brand and Reputation Committee,
chaired by the Deputy Chairman, manages
issues of reputational signiﬁcance to the Group.
Financing
renewable
energy
Barclays UK operations are now carbon
neutral, with over 50% of our requirements
being supplied from renewable energy
sources – reducing our carbon emissions by
80,000 tonnes in 2007. Over the next ﬁve
years we plan to increase UK energy 
efﬁciency by another 20%, through
investment in energy-efﬁcient technology .
Visit www.barclays.com/climatechange
for more information. 
Providing project ﬁnance for renewable
energy complements Barclays Climate
Change strategy . Barclays provided £60m of
secured debt ﬁnance and hedging facilities to
the 65 megawatt Scout Moor wind farm in
Lancashire, the largest project-ﬁnanced
onshore wind deal in the UK and Ireland
signed during 2006. 
Overall, Barclays Natural Resources Team
has provided long-term ﬁnance for over 2,600
megawatts of renewable generating capacity ,
including onshore wind farms, landﬁll gas
extraction plants, small-scale hydroelectric
projects, biomass plants and bio-diesel
conversion plants. 
Corporate responsibility is integrated in our 
risk framework through a speciﬁc Board
Governance Standard.
Ethical Indices
We are a member of the Dow Jones
Sustainability and FTSE4Good ethical 
indices, and were ranked in 3rd position in 
the Business in the Community Corporate
Responsibility Index. In the Carbon Disclosure
Project, we were ranked in the top 50 of global
FT500 companies.
Our customers
We are committed to providing excellent
products and services in accordance with our
ten established principles for treating customers
fairly. The year saw continued progress in
improving the level of customer service in 
UK Retail Banking. Across our other businesses,
strong levels of customer and client satisfaction
have been sustained.
Financial inclusion
Our focus is on improving access to banking
and affordable credit in the UK and in Africa. 
We increased the number of our Cash Card
accounts in the UK by 85,000 to 464,000 and
remain the largest private sector supporter of
UK credit unions.
In South Africa, Absa opened another 
13 portable branches, which bring banking
services to disadvantaged areas. The Mzansi
basic bank account showed strong growth and 
Absa’ s AllPay and Sekulula services are enabling
2.3 million social grant beneﬁciaries to access
their payments. In Ghana, working with the
traditional Susu banking system, we are
supporting 80,000 market traders.
Responsible lending
We extended the use of summary information
on credit card and personal loan applications
and statements to help our customers make
informed personal decisions, worked to increase
data sharing with other banks and introduced
our Flexi-rate card, offering lower rates to
customers repaying more of their balance.
Environment and climate change
Our UK operations are now carbon-neutral and
we are offsetting part of our residual emissions
through community-based sustainable energy
schemes in Africa and India. Our businesses in
South Africa and France achieved ISO14001
accreditation for their environmental
management systems.
Barclays Capital remained the most active
trader of carbon in the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme and our Natural Resources Team
ﬁnanced over 2,600 megawatts of renewable
generation capacity.
We contributed to the revision of the Equator
Principles, which require banks to undertake
detailed environmental and social assessments
in international project ﬁnancing, and updated
our internal guidance to cover over 50 different
industry sectors. Barclays remains the only bank
participating in the Business Leader’ s Initiative
on Human Rights.
Supply chain management
In 2006, we introduced our Corporate
Responsibility Supplier Questionnaire and have,
to date, reviewed some 60 of our higher risk
suppliers, accounting for approximately £1.5bn
of our supply chain spend.
Our employees
Our annual Employee Opinion Survey showed
further improvements. 87% of employees
participated, with employee engagement
improving from 72% to 76%. 
We signed an Equality Charter with Amicus in
the UK. 21% of our senior managers are female
and 6% are from an ethnic minority background.
Good progress was recorded by Absa, with the
number of black managers increasing.
Community investment
A new global approach has been launched
under the theme of ‘Banking on brighter
futures’, focusing on ﬁnancial inclusion 
and complementing our business strategy. 
An example of the programme is Barclaycard
Horizons, a three year, £3m investment with
four national partners, aiming to support 
50,000 disadvantaged single parents.

Combined Code on Corporate
Governance
For the year ended 31st December 2006, we
have complied with the provisions set out in
section 1 of the UK Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (the Code). Some of 
the ways we have applied the principles of the
Code in 2006 are described below. Y ou can ﬁnd
our full Corporate Governance Report for 2006 
in our 2006 Annual Report, which is available
online at www.investorrelations.barclays.com,
along with all of the documents we 
mention below.
What does good corporate governance
mean to Barclays?
Good corporate governance is more than just a
statement of compliance. We aim to set the
highest standards throughout our organisation
and in everything we do. It is a key part of my
role as Chairman to maintain the highest
standards of corporate governance and I
inherited a strong legacy from my predecessor
as Chairman, Matthew Barrett. 
Our corporate governance framework,
‘Corporate Governance in Barclays’, is a
comprehensive statement of our values and
how we put them into practice at Barclays. 
We review this framework annually to make
sure it remains relevant. 
How do you decide who becomes 
a Director? 
Our Board Corporate Governance and
Nominations Committee reviews the balance
and composition of our Board and its main
Committees regularly. This is to make sure we
have the right balance of Directors and a good
mix of skills and experience to support our
strategy. It also looks at whether we need to
refresh the Board and Committees by
appointing new members. Y ou can ﬁnd details
of who is on the Board on pages 14 to 15, 
along with details of the Board Committees the
Directors are members of. The chart opposite
shows the current balance of Directors on 
the Board. 
We review the independence of our non-
executive Directors each year and consider all of
our non-executive Directors to be independent.
Y ou can ﬁnd more details of our review of
independence in the 2006 Annual Report.
What is the Board’s role?
The Board is responsible to shareholders for
creating and sustaining shareholder value
through the management of the Group’ s
businesses. To do this, we meet regularly
throughout the year and have a formal 
schedule of matters that only the Board can 
deal with. 
We have delegated responsibility for the day
to day management of the Group to the Group
Chief Executive, who is supported by the
Executive Committee. 
We have a ‘Charter of Expectations’ which
sets out the role proﬁles for each of the main
positions on the Board. This includes my role 
as Chairman, plus the roles of the Deputy
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director,
Committee Chairmen and non-executive
Our committees
Board Audit Committee
Reviews accounting policies and the
contents of ﬁnancial reports. Monitors
disclosure controls and procedures and our
internal control environment. Considers the
adequacy and scope of the external and
internal audit. Oversees the relationship with
our external auditors. 
Board HR and Remuneration Committee 
Sets the policy for executive Directors’ and
senior executives’ remuneration. Approves
individual remuneration awards. Agrees
changes to senior executive incentive and
beneﬁts plans. Governs employee share
schemes. Looks at strategic HR issues.
Board Corporate Governance and
Nominations Committee 
Reviews the composition of Board.
Recommends appointment of new Directors.
Considers succession plans for Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive positions. Monitors
corporate governance issues. Oversees the

to take (risk appetite). Sets limits for
individual types of risk, e.g. credit risk, 
market risk. Monitors our risk proﬁle. 
Obtains assurance that principal risks have
been properly identiﬁed and are being
appropriately managed.

Directors. We also set out what we expect of
executive Directors in their role as Directors,
rather than in their role as managers 
of the business.
What did the Board and Committees 
do in 2006?
The Board and each of its main Committees
have an annual programme of business. This 
is agreed at the start of each year. The chart
opposite shows how the Board spent its time
during 2006. Some speciﬁc responsibilities 
have been delegated to Board Committees.
Each Board Committee has Terms of Reference,
which set out what they are responsible for. 
A short description of what each Committee
does is set out opposite.
How do you make sure that Directors
have all the information they need to
carry out their role?
It is part of my role as Chairman to make sure
that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear
information. This is to help the Board take sound
decisions, monitor effectively and provide 
advice to promote the success of the Group. 
As Chairman I work closely with the Company
Secretary to make sure that information flows 
to Directors at the right time. During 2006, we
launched a Directors’ Intranet, which allows
Directors to access electronic copies of Board
papers, reports, minutes and other key
documents quickly and securely via a dedicated
private network. All Directors can also make use
of the services of the Company Secretary and his
team. Independent professional advice is also
available, on request, at the Company’ s expense.
All new Directors go through a
comprehensive induction programme when
they join the Board or a Board Committee. 
This programme is discussed with the Director
in advance so that it suits their individual needs.
Extra training and updates for Directors are also
arranged on an ongoing basis. We started a
two-year programme of business training for
non-executive Directors in 2006 and some
further sessions are planned for 2007. 
We also aim to hold some of our Board
meetings away from our global headquarters.
This allows Directors to meet our front line 
staff and see our operations at ﬁrst hand.
Non-executive Directors also make site 
visits individually and can contact senior
management directly on particular areas 
of interest.
How do you assess the performance of
the Board?
W e carry out an annual review of the Board’ s
effectiveness. This covers the performance of the
Board, Board Committees and individual Directors.
For 2006, we asked an independent third party to
help with the review. It involved each Director
ﬁlling in a detailed questionnaire, which was
followed up by an interview to go through their
views in more detail. W e discussed the results of
the review at our Board meeting in December
2006 and decided that we are continuing to
operate effectively . W e agreed on some areas for
improvement in 2007, including arranging some
additional training on risk issues and making sure
there is enough time at Board meetings for a
thorough discussion and exchange of ideas. 
W e have put together an action plan to deliver
these improvements in 2007.

Summary remuneration report
Remuneration report
This is our Summary remuneration report for
2006, presented by Sir Richard Broadbent,
Chairman of the Board HR and Remuneration
Committee. Y ou can ﬁnd our full Remuneration
report in our 2006 Annual Report, available
online at www.investorrelations.barclays.com
Shareholders will be asked to approve the 
full Remuneration report at the 2007 AGM.
Important context to the report and the
disclosures that follow is provided below.
• Barclays performed very strongly in 2006 
with proﬁt before tax up 35% and economic
proﬁt up 54%. This performance has been
recognised in the remuneration decisions at
all levels coupled with strong performance
differentiation.
• The performance of Barclays Capital, BGI 
and Barclays Wealth was particularly strong,
enabling the double beneﬁt of delivering
competitive bonus levels and providing an
increased share of proﬁt to shareholders,
evidenced by compensation ratios reducing
relative to 2005 and in line with the lower end
of the market range.
• In the course of 2006, the Committee
approved signiﬁcant numbers of strategic
hires, including at Board level, ensuring 
their remuneration was in line with the
appropriate marketplace. It did this alongside
its active oversight of Barclays talent agenda.
Barclays Remuneration Policy remains
unchanged, including the commitment to
transparency and to policies and programmes
that serve well the interests of shareholders.
What is your remuneration policy?
Barclays policy is to use reward to drive a high-
performance culture. Outstanding performance
will therefore attract outstanding reward. This
applies to all reward policies and practices for all
employees in the Group, including executive
Directors. The aims of the Barclays policy are to:
• incentivise excellence in and balance between
both short-term (one year) and longer-term
(three years plus) performance such that 
the Group ﬁnancial goals and the goal of
achieving top quartile total shareholder
return (TSR) are met and sustained;
• enable the Group to attract and retain people
of proven ability, experience and skills in the
pools in which we compete for talent;
• encourage behaviour consistent with
Barclays Guiding Principles which leads to
excellence and the appropriate balance in
ﬁnancial performance, governance, controls,
risk management, customer service, people
management, brand and reputation
management;
• promote attention to maximising personal
contribution, contribution to the business in
which the individual works and contribution
to the Group overall; and
• ensure, both internally and externally, that
remuneration policies and programmes are
transparent, well communicated, easily
understood and aligned with the interests 
of shareholders.
The graph below shows the value, at 
31st December 2006, of £100 invested in
Barclays on 31st December 2001 compared with
the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index.
It shows that, at the end of 2006, a hypothetical
£100 invested in Barclays on 31st December
2001 would have generated a total return of
£58, compared with a gain of £41 if invested in
the FTSE 100 Index. Barclays, therefore,
outperformed the FTSE100 Index for this period.
How do you set the reward levels for 
executive Directors?
We review the main parts of the reward package
for executive Directors annually. We compare
them to packages on offer at other companies
similar to Barclays and also to the packages
offered in the markets where we are competing
to attract the best talent. This includes looking
at the reward packages offered by other leading
international banks and ﬁnancial services
companies. We consider reward levels across
the Group when we set the remuneration for
executive Directors. 
We also have access to independent
advisers. Kepler Associates have been appointed
to advise us on remuneration matters. 
What makes up the reward package for
executive Directors?
The reward package for executive Directors is
made up of four main parts:
• Base salary;
• Annual Performance Bonus, 75% of which is
cash and 25% of which is deferred in the
form of Barclays shares through the
Executive Share Award Scheme (ESAS);
• Performance Share Plan (PSP), which is an
allocation of free shares that are released
after three years, subject to performance
conditions; and
• Pension and other beneﬁts.
Each part has an important role to play . T ogether,
the potential remuneration from the Annual
Performance Bonus and PSP is greater than the
other elements. Both are subject to performance
conditions, which means the majority of the total
reward is at risk and is not ﬁxed. The balance of
reward at risk is different for Robert E Diamond Jr,
as his reward arrangements reflect general
practice in the investment banking and
investment management industry .
The chart to the left shows the balance
between ﬁxed reward and reward at risk for 
a typical executive Director (excluding pension
and beneﬁts).
Do executive Directors take part in any 
other share plans?
Executive Directors may still hold options

in share plans that we have operated in 
previous years. No options were granted to
executive Directors under these plans in 2006.
Robert E Diamond Jr is also a participant in the
BGI Equity Ownership Plan. His participation
dates back to before he became a Director 
of Barclays. 
All eligible employees, including executive
Directors, can take part in our Sharesave and
Sharepurchase plans. Both are ‘all-employee’
share plans approved by HM Revenue 
and Customs.
Y ou can ﬁnd full details of the share plans
that we have operated and continue to operate,
and executive Directors’ involvement in them, 
in our full Remuneration report.
What fees are paid to the 
non-executive Directors?
The Board reviews the fees paid to non-
executive Directors annually. Non-executive
Directors receive an annual base fee of £65,000.
They may also receive additional fees for
Chairmanship or membership of the main Board
Committees. This is to reflect the additional
time and responsibility they are asked to
commit to when they are appointed to these
Committees. From the base fee of £65,000,
£20,000 is used each year to buy Barclays
shares, which the non-executive Directors must
hold until they retire from the Board. 
What are the terms of Directors’
contracts?
We have service contracts in place with the
Chairman and the executive Directors. These
contracts do not have a ﬁxed term. They provide
for a notice period from the Group of one year
and normally for retirement at age 65. 
Our policy is that executive Directors’
contracts should allow for termination with
contractual notice from the Group, except in
circumstances of gross misconduct. In such
cases, notice is not given. When we consider
payments in the event of termination, our
approach is to take account of the individual
circumstances. This includes the reason for
termination, contractual obligations and share
and pension plan rules.
Non-executive Directors have letters of
appointment, rather than service contracts.
These letters set out the terms of their
appointment, including the time commitment
expected of them. They provide for a notice
period of six months from the Group.
What did Directors earn in 2006?
The 2006 annual remuneration of the Chairman
and Directors is set out on page 19.

2006 Annual Remuneration
A
G Robert E Diamond Jr joined the Board on 1st June 2005. The amount shown in the ‘2005 Total’ column is for the
period from that date to 31st December 2005. The remuneration for 2006 for Robert E Diamond Jr was based
on the strong performance of Barclays Capital, Barclays Global Investors and Barclays Wealth, both on an
absolute and industry relative basis and given signiﬁcant upward movement in market reference points. The
composition of this package remains consistent with the composition of remuneration shown on page 127 of
the full Remuneration report.
H Naguib Kheraj received an allowance of 23% of base salary (£149,500) in lieu of pension contributions (2005:
£115,000). This amount is included in the amount shown in the column for ‘Beneﬁts’.
I David Roberts ceased to be a Director on 31st December 2006. His service contract provides for a notice period
of 12 months or contractual pay in lieu of notice for 12 months, subject to mitigation if alternative employment

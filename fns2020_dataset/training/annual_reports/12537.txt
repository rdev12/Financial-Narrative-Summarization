CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
This strong operational
and financial performance
supports continuing
investment in new
opportunities, an increasingly
material exploration programme
and the initiation of a dividend
payout for the year.”
“
Mike Welton
Chairman The industry context
2012 was a year of difficult macroeconomic conditions and depressed capital markets. The
energy industry, however, has performed strongly and continues to present opportunities for
growth. Signs of recovery in western economies and world financial markets are at an early
stage, but it is encouraging to start 2013 on a stronger note. Commodity prices have
remained remarkably stable, providing a healthy backdrop for continuing investment and
new opportunities. Although costs are rising in some areas, good projects are still earning
attractive rates of return.
Premier’s performance
Premier has again achieved strong growth in the value of the underlying assets of the
business. In 2012 we increased production by 43 per cent, cash flow by 66 per cent and
report record profitability for a fifth successive year. Reserves and resources now amount to
773 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) compared to 513 mmboe at the end of 2011.
Four new projects also received development approval during the course of the year. While
we invested in excess of US$250 million in acquisitions and US$772 million in development
and exploration projects during the year, balance sheet gearing remained stable at 36 per
cent and is well within our target range. We continue to have good access to several
sources of debt capital, both reducing our average cost of debt and extending its maturity.
This strong operational and financial performance supports continuing investment in new
opportunities, an increasingly material exploration programme and the initiation of a
dividend payout for the year.
Premier’s growth plans
Building on the new fields which came on-stream in Indonesia and Vietnam in late 2011,
2012 saw a significant increase in group production. 2012 average production of 57.7 thousand
barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd) will rise to a run rate of around 75 kboepd as two
new fields, Huntington and Rochelle, come on-stream. Looking further ahead, we have
made significant steps in progressing the Solan and Catcher projects, which are expected
on-stream in 2014 and 2016 respectively. These new fields, together with our existing
producing areas, will underpin our medium-term production target of 100,000 boepd.
We continue to invest in new project opportunities where we see the potential for attractive
returns for shareholders. We are delighted to have secured the operatorship and a large
equity interest in the Sea Lion field in the Falkland Islands. Our project team is already
working closely with both the Falkland Islands and the UK Governments to deliver an
approved development plan by the middle of 2014. We also look forward to our first
exploration campaign in the Falkland Islands which further builds up our increasingly
material drilling programme.
Our 2012 exploration programme delivered successes in the UK, Pakistan and Indonesia.
These are valuable additions to the portfolio due to their proximity to existing producing
assets. In the UK Central North Sea, our exploration drilling programme attempted to
replicate the successes we had in the Catcher area in previous years. However, with the
exception of the Carnaby discovery in a new play area west of the Catcher development,
the programme was unsuccessful. This serves to underline the necessity, as we grow our
production and development asset base, to identify new basin opportunities for future
exploration away from the more mature areas in the North Sea and South East Asia. Our
exploration and new venture teams have done an excellent job in identifying and negotiating
entry into such opportunities offshore Kenya, in the North Falklands Basin, in the Phu Khanh
basin in Vietnam, in the Mandal High area in Norway and in Southern Iraq. Over the course
of 2012, the team added approximately 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bnboe) of
prospective resources to the portfolio. We look forward to maturing these for drilling over
the next two to three years. Success in any of these locations, because of the nature of their
play-opening potential, will be transformational for Premier. Focus of the Board
As the group and its scope of operations expand, the Board has taken a number of initiatives
to ensure longer-term plans can be delivered successfully. A comprehensive strategy review
incorporating asset profiles, capital allocation and funding plans was completed in the first half
of 2012 and has been reviewed again by the Board in the first quarter of 2013.
Significant progress has been made in the way in which risks are identified, analysed and
mitigated throughout our operations, reporting back to the Board via the Audit and Risk
Committee. The Board’s Nomination Committee has, with the help of the senior management
team, taken new initiatives in succession planning, career development and competency
programmes. Members of the Remuneration Committee have held a number of meetings with
key shareholders and advisory bodies to ensure that our remuneration policies achieve an
appropriate balance between reward for our investors and incentives for our employees. At the
Board level, we continue to devote significant time to the management of the critical issues of
health, safety and the environment. The group’s improving record in all of these areas is
testament to this effort. However, the tragic accident in December in which a crew member on
an emergency standby vessel close to our Balmoral facilities lost his life in extreme weather, is a
sad reminder of the need for constant vigilance and determination by all industry participants.
Returns to shareholders
We recognise that the upstream industry is a sector in which substantial capital growth can be
achieved by companies focused on short-term exploration success. Such exploration activity
yields potentially attractive but inconsistent returns. It is our objective to provide investors with
consistent growth, above that of the major companies in our industry, but with the potential for
higher returns through our exploration activities.
Premier’s share price today stands higher than at 1 January 2012 and over a five-year period
has significantly outperformed the FTSE All-Share Oil and Gas Producers Index. However, we
recognise that the share price has not kept pace with the growth in value of the underlying
assets of the business. The onus is on the Board and the executive team to deliver on our
growth plan and to demonstrate an improved return on our exploration programme, so that a
higher market rating will be achieved.
The Board has also considered again our policy in respect of shareholder distribution. As
foreshadowed at the Annual General Meeting in May 2012, the Board intends to propose a
2012 dividend of 5 pence per share, to be approved by shareholders at the June 2013 Annual
General Meeting. The level of future payouts will depend on the progression of cash flow over
time and the capital required to fund our investment opportunities, but the Board believes that
the payment of a sustainable dividend underlines our confidence in rising cash flows, the strength
of our balance sheet and the quality of our asset base. It is a reward too for the loyalty of our
shareholders. We also thank our employees, all of whom participate as shareholders through
our employee long-term incentive plans, for all of their hard work in 2012. We all look forward to
2013 and the continuing growth in the company as it achieves its medium-term aspirations.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW We focus on growing the underlying value of the business through
disciplined investment in high quality projects. Our skill set and
experience give us the confidence and capability to take on complex
operated development projects, typically offshore and utilising
floating production systems. We believe in offering our investors and
our employees continuing growth opportunities reflected in rising
production targets. We will judge ourselves, and invite others to judge
us, by the growth in our net asset value (NAV) per share year-on-year
without relying on a rising oil price. We target in excess of 10 per cent
NAV growth per share per year and, over the seven-year period to
end-2012, have achieved in excess of 15 per cent. Going forward we
will source this growth from the development of existing assets, new
acquisitions and material organic exploration, while maintaining a
strong balance sheet so that we are well placed to take advantage of
attractive opportunities as they arise.
In the five-year period since 2007, we have generated impressive
growth in all key financial and operational metrics which define our
business. Our growing undeveloped reserves and resource base will
support substantial future growth.

Our growth rates have significantly exceeded the 54 per cent rise in
the oil price over the same five-year period. The majority of this
growth has been financed by the re-investment of internally generated
cash flows or new debt funding. With some US$1.1 billion of cash and
undrawn facilities on hand and a gearing ratio stable at 36 per cent,
our balance sheet continues to provide a strong platform for further
material growth.
Reservoir performance from all our producing fields in 2012 was
encouraging and generated a 43 per cent increase in working interest
production year-on-year.

strategy?
Q //
How do
you assess
Premier’s overall
performance
over the last
five years?
Q //
Were you
pleased with
Premier’s 2012
production
performance? Well productivity was supported by improved facility uptime in the UK,
Indonesia and Pakistan. We continue to work on the re-development
of the Kyle field in the UK which has been shut down since December
2011 following a severe North Sea storm. The supply of additional gas
to the Indonesian domestic market which would have generated
further gas sales remains under discussion with the Indonesian
authorities. These two factors reduced 2012 production by around
4,000 boepd, though value will be recovered by a combination of
insurance proceeds and future production. Equipment issues at our
Chim Sáo field in Vietnam, notably with power supply, prevented the
full application of water injection, limiting our production rates from the
field. This is being addressed and overall the field continues to produce
above the level originally anticipated in our field development plan.
First oil from the Huntington field is expected at the end of March, in
line with our 2013 budget. After a ramp up period, the field is expected
to produce 25-30 kboepd (gross), following a successful development
drilling programme. The smaller Rochelle field (Premier share: 15 per
cent) is now expected on-stream around mid-year after storm damage
to the initial development well. The rig is currently drilling the
Rochelle West well and will return to Rochelle East after first gas.
Further significant milestones were achieved within our development
portfolio during the year, especially on our operated development
projects. The Pelikan and Naga projects, which will sustain and grow
our position in the Singapore gas market, received development
approvals and will add to existing volumes in the Natuna Sea from
2014 onwards. The Dua and Solan fields received project sanction
during the course of the year and are progressing well towards first oil
in 2014. On our operated Catcher development in the UK North Sea,
concept selection was formally agreed in December and various
tenders are now under way for key contracts. We expect to submit the
field development plan for approval to the UK Government once
these tender processes are complete. Targeted first oil date will be
driven by the contract negotiation process, notably for the floating
production, storage and offtake vessel (FPSO). Elsewhere, we increased
our equity interest in the Bream area in Norway and are working with
the revised partnership group to finalise development plans. In
Mauritania, the partnership submitted a development plan for the
Banda gas field, though this remains subject to final agreement on
a gas sales contract.
In line with our stated strategy, we were delighted to acquire
operatorship and a significant equity interest in the Sea Lion
development project in the Falkland Islands during the course of the
year. With some 350 million barrels of appraised oil in the Sea Lion
field and nearby discoveries, a clear fit with our development skills
and an attractive fiscal regime, this is a substantial opportunity for
Premier. It is also exciting to work in an environment where there is
such strong support from both the Falkland Islands and the UK
Governments. The location of the islands raises logistical and
infrastructure challenges. However, the resourcefulness of our own
project team members and that of the Falkland Islanders gives us
every confidence that these can be more than adequately addressed.
Q //
What milestones
did Premier
achieve in 2012
with respect to

portfolio?
Q //
What are the
key opportunities
and challenges
associated with
your entry into
the Falkland
Islands? Building on the work that our partner Rockhopper Exploration plc
(Rockhopper) had already commenced, we expect to make key
development concept decisions during the course of 2013, with final
development approval targeted for mid-2014. This should facilitate
first oil from the Sea Lion field during 2017. Whilst the geology of the
North Falklands Basin is complex, we also see a large number of
prospects and leads which offer potential for future exploration. We
are working closely with the Rockhopper team to define the targets
for the next exploration programme, now expected in late 2014 or
early 2015.
The Falkland Islands transaction contributed significantly to a 51 per
cent increase in reserves and resources year-on-year. While the Sea
Lion field has been fully appraised, our reserve booking policy
dictates that resources associated with the field will not be booked
into the reserves category until further development milestones have
been achieved.
As at 31 December 2012, proven and probable (2P) reserves, on a
working interest basis, were 292 mmboe (2011: 285 mmboe) giving a
reserve replacement ratio of 134 per cent.

to 67 per cent (2011: 51 per cent). Given that the price we receive for
our Indonesian gas volumes exported to Singapore is linked to oil
prices, around 88 per cent of our resource base is effectively oil-price
driven. Our current development portfolio is dominated by oil-based
projects.
Premier’s exploration programme over time has generated notable
successes. Indeed, the largest projects in our portfolio – our gas
reserves in the Natuna Sea, our Chim Sáo oil field in Vietnam, our
Catcher field in the UK – come from Premier exploration drilling
initiatives. In 2009 we set a goal of adding 200 mmboe of net 2P
reserves over a five-year period. Based on discoveries to date, the
follow-on potential which they have generated and the programme
still to come, we are confident that this objective will be achieved.
We added four discoveries to the portfolio during 2012. The Carnaby
discovery adds additional reserves on the Catcher Block and is
encouraging for the ongoing exploitation of the smaller accumulations
around the Catcher field itself. The Catcher area near-field exploration
has commenced in 2013 with the drilling of the Bonneville prospect.

How would
you describe

strategy going

Natuna Sea, opened up a new play, the Lama play, which extends
across a wide area within Premier’s Natuna Sea acreage. Plans to
follow up on this success with a new drilling campaign in 2014 and
2015 are advanced. In Pakistan, two notable successes were recorded
with the K-30 well on the Kadanwari lease and the BBN-1 well on the
Badhra field. These two discoveries added 116 billion cubic feet (bcf)
(gross) and have both been brought into production post-discovery.
However, we recognise the need to update the portfolio as prospects
are drilled out and as areas like the UK North Sea become mature.
This is why we have taken steps to add new areas in Kenya, Iraq, the
Falkland Islands, deeper water acreage in Vietnam and the Mandal
High area in Norway. We believe in targeting play-opening
opportunities which, on success, will deliver not just one discovery but
will open up a series of prospects and leads. Success in any of these
areas would lead to multiple opportunities and reduced risk over
time. Such new acreage additions in 2012 were significant with a total
of 30 new licences, amounting to net acreage gain of 11,800 km

.
In 2013, Premier plans to drill 15 exploration and appraisal wells. This
includes five high impact exploration wells targeting in excess of 150
mmboe, including the Luno II well which is currently drilling on the
south west margin of the Utsira High, and the Lacewing well, Premier’ s
first high pressure high temperature well in the North Sea. In addition,
we look forward to the results of the Kuda Laut and Singa Laut wells in
Indonesia and the Ca Voi exploration well in Vietnam. The latter is a
true frontier exploration well with the potential to open up a new play
in Eastern Vietnam. We also hope to replicate our near field exploration
success achieved in 2012 by the drilling of six near field wells in 2013,
including the Matang well in Indonesia and the Bonneville well in the
UK North Sea, both of which are currently drilling.
We continuously review the structure of our organisation to get the
most out of our assets and to optimise project delivery. During 2012
we reorganised our teams into six country units – UK, Norway,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and the Falkland Islands – reflecting the
growing critical mass of those units and the need to have strong local
presence in all our key business areas. At the same time our exploration
teams now report directly to a central exploration function, pulling
together all the technical skills in the group into one team and
allowing us to make better informed choices about where to allocate
our exploration funds. We continue to believe that our organisational
model – strong local units supported by a head office team, focused
on critical decision points – will deliver our ambitious medium and
long-term goals.

One of our greatest
achievements last year was
our successful entry into the
Falkland Islands through the
farm-in for 60 per cent of
Rockhopper’s licence interests
in the North Falklands Basin.
The current focus of the

Lion field and the exploitation
of the remaining exploration
potential in the basin.”

Premier interests
Sea Lion main field
Sea Lion satellites DEVELOPMENT //
In July 2012, Premier agreed to farm-in to 60 per cent of Rockhopper’s
licence interests in the Falkland Islands, including the Sea Lion development
project. Following the approval of the Falkland Islands Government, the deal
was completed in October with an initial cash payment of US$231 million.
In addition, Premier will pay an exploration carry of up to US$48 million and,
subject to field development plan approval, a development carry of up to
US$722 million. These are fully-funded from a combination of existing cash
resources, facilities and cash flow from operations. Premier and Rockhopper
also agreed jointly to pursue exploration opportunities in the Falkland
Islands and analogous plays in selected areas offshore Southern Africa.
The Sea Lion field is located on the Falklands Plateau, 220 kilometres north
of the Falkland Islands and lies in 450 metres of water. The geological setting
is a north-south Atlantic failed rift with primarily early Cretaceous to Tertiary
fill in a typical half graben structure with a large bounding fault in the east.
The Sea Lion accumulation is close to the eastern margin. Stacked Early
Cretaceous lacustrine fan reservoirs contain waxy 28 degree API crude oil.
Oil-in-place is estimated to be over 1.1 billion barrels with 300 million barrels
(gross) recoverable. Including the discoveries at Casper and Casper South,
the transaction added approximately 230 million barrels of net contingent
resources.
The Sea Lion field is expected to be developed by drilling and completing
subsea wells in manifold clusters tied back via flexible risers to an anchored
FPSO. Water injection and gas and produced water handling facilities will be
provided on the FPSO. Gas will be used for fuel or re-injected to boost
recovery. Shuttle tankers will collect the crude oil and ship to international
markets. Gross estimated capital expenditure costs remain unchanged at
US$5 billion. Premier will fund its share from rising cash flows.
On 1 November, Premier formally became operator of all of the licence
interests previously operated by Rockhopper, thereby becoming the
operator of the Sea Lion development project. A new dedicated project
team is undertaking detailed planning of development drilling and the
specification and sourcing of production facilities prior to commencing
front-end engineering design. Notably, an FPSO market enquiry, which
included visits to ship yards, has been undertaken to assess options of
conversions or new builds to meet the design life criteria. Technical reviews
have also been undertaken to study the option of gas lift instead of hydraulic
submersible pumps while design studies of flow line systems have been
completed. Health, safety and environmental management plans are being
set to safeguard the development and operations phases. Concept selection
is targeted for mid-2013 while project sanction is planned for mid-2014 with
first oil targeted for third quarter of 2017. Once on-stream, the Sea Lion
development is expected to add 50,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of
production net to Premier.
Building development
capability EXPLORATION //
Since the announcement of the farm-in in July 2012, Premier has been working
closely with Rockhopper to define the prospect inventory within its acreage in
the North Falklands Basin. To date, we have technical agreement on a
programme of between three and six exploration wells for the next drilling
programme, which is targeted for 2014/15, subject to rig availability. Wells
currently included in the proposed programme include play-opening wells
targeting prospects beneath the existing Sea Lion sands, prospects from
independent feeder systems along the east flank of the basin, as well as Sea
Lion look-alike prospects.
Premier has received notification from the Falkland Islands Government that
licences PL023 and PL024 (Premier interest 60 per cent) have been extended
to November 2013 pending further seismic interpretation work and that
licences PL003 and PL004 (Premier interest 4.5 per cent) have been extended
to May 2016 with the addition of a one well commitment.

PROGRAMME OF EXPLORATION NEW VENTURE WORK, WE ARE SEEKING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF OUR LONG-ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS AND GAS MARKETING
EXPERTISE TO INCREASE OUR IN-COUNTRY PRESENCE. PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT //
During 2012, the Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A (Block A) sold an
overall average of 217 billion British thermal units per day (BBtud) (gross)
(2011: 161 BBtud) from its gas export facilities, a 35 per cent increase, due to
a full-year of production from the new Gajah Baru facility and the established
Anoa field.
The Anoa facility continued to increase its market share of sales under the
first gas sales agreement (GSA1) delivering 7.5 per cent over its contractual
market share of 36.9 per cent. In addition, three Anoa development wells
were drilled and put on production in 2012, adding 36 million standard cubic
feet per day (mmscfd) of gas deliverability. The non-operated Kakap Block
contributed a further 33 BBtud (gross) (2011: 42 BBtud). Gross liquids
production from the Block A Anoa field was steady at an average 2,400 bopd
(2011: 2,400 bopd) with a further 3,500 bopd (2011: 3,400 bopd) from Kakap.
Overall, production from Indonesia was up substantially to 14,200 boepd
(2011: 11,450 boepd) on a working interest basis.
The Pelikan and Naga projects, also on Block A, were sanctioned in April 2012
and are now in full execution mode. The contract for the engineering,
procurement, construction and installation of two wellhead platforms and
connecting pipelines was awarded in May 2012. The two projects will involve
drilling six new development wells to develop an expected 150 bcf of gas
reserves. First gas will be delivered in 2014 to supply existing Indonesia and
Singapore sales contracts.
In parallel, a major brownfield development project, to upgrade the
compression facilities on the Block A Anoa gas production facility, has also
progressed through its first phase. In 2012, two cantilever deck extensions,
housing a new gas compressor and turbine generator, were fabricated and
installed on the Anoa platform. 2013 will see a second major offshore
campaign, during which the existing compression equipment will be
reconfigured for low pressure production. The project, when complete in
September 2013, will extend the field plateau for another three years and
develop 200 bcf of gross field reserves.
On the non-operated Block A Aceh, work continued on the gas development
project. The focus has been on improving the economics such that the
project can be sanctioned by year-end. The tendering process for most
facilities is complete with current efforts towards securing higher gas prices
with end buyers and the Indonesian Government progressing well. First gas
is targeted for third quarter of 2015.
EXPLORATION //
Premier carried out exploration in five production sharing contracts (PSC)
in Indonesia: Natuna Sea Block A, Kakap, Tuna, Block A Aceh and Buton.
In 2012, Premier drilled three exploration wells on its Indonesian acreage,
one of which was successful and opened up a new play.
The Anoa Deep-1 well, drilled as an exploratory tail to the Anoa WL-5X
development well, discovered gas below the Anoa field. The well flowed
over 17 mmscfd of gas from fractured sandstones of the Lama formation.
Building on strong share
of Singapore gas market The discovery of gas in the Lama sands provides additional gas resources that can be
dedicated to existing gas sales agreements and opens up a new proven play type which can
be pursued across Premier’ s Block A and adjacent West Natuna areas. Prospect development
continued in Natuna Sea Block A with the overall prospect inventory being upgraded
through seismic reprocessing on selected prospects and prospect development in the newly
proven Lama play. Premier expects to start to drill out these prospects in 2014/15.
The Biawak Besar-1 well on Natuna Sea Block A was drilled to test a stratigraphic trap which
was assessed on seismic data to have a good possibility of containing gas. Biawak Besar-1
encountered good reservoir development and gas shows but was not deemed commercial.
In the Buton PSC, Premier participated in the Benteng-1 exploration well which was aimed
at discovering oil in limestone reservoirs in the Cretaceous Tobelo formation. While the well
was successful in proving an oil presence in the area with oil shows in the Miocene Tondo
limestones, no commercial oil accumulation was found. Premier and partners will not
continue exploring in the Buton PSC and the licence will be relinquished shortly.
In the Block A Aceh PSC in Northern Sumatra, the Matang-1 exploration well was spudded
in late November 2012. The objective of the Matang-1 well is to discover gas resources in a
Miocene Peutu limestone reservoir. The drilling of the top seal sequence has taken longer
than expected with the results now anticipated by the end of March 2013.
In 2011 exploration wells Gajah Laut Utara-1 and Belut Laut-1 were drilled in the Tuna PSC
to test the Miocene and Oligocene potential of two prospects. The wells did not find
commercial hydrocarbons but, utilising the information gained, two new prospects, Kuda
Laut and Singa Laut, were matured in 2012. These prospects are approved for drilling in 2013
with the Kuda Laut-1 and Singa Laut-1 wells expected to spud in the second half of the year.
During the year Premier maintained an active programme of exploration new ventures work
aimed at capturing new licences. This work entailed a number of regional basin studies as
well as three formal joint studies carried out in conjunction with the Indonesian Government
agency MIGAS.

PREMIER WAS AWARDED FOUR NEW EXPLORATION LICENCES IN JANUARY 2012
AS A RESULT OF THE AWARDS IN PREDEFINED AREAS (APA) 2011 ROUND AND
CONTINUED TO MATURE A NUMBER OF PROSPECTS TOWARDS DRILL DECISIONS
IN 2013. THE COMPANY ALSO BUILT ON ITS ACREAGE POSITION IN AND AROUND
THE MANDAL HIGH AREA THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF THREE OPERATED
LICENCES, WHICH COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2012, AND THE AWARD OF THE SKALA
EXPLORATION LICENCE IN THE APA 2012 ROUND. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY
INCREASED ITS INTEREST IN THE BREAM FIELD DEVELOPMENT AND THE ADJACENT
BLOCK AT ATTRACTIVE PRICING. DEVELOPMENT //
In August, Premier acquired a 20 per cent interest in PL407, which contains
the Bream field, and a 40 per cent equity interest in the adjacent PL406
licence. This increased Premier’s share in the Bream project to 40 per cent
and the company’s operated interest in PL406, which contains the Mackerel
oil discovery and the Herring exploration prospect, to 80 per cent. Premier
paid an upfront consideration of US$10 million with further payments of up
to US$17.5 million contingent upon certain milestones being reached.
Engineering studies for the subsea systems and wells for Bream were
completed during 2012 but the studies carried out for the lifetime extension
and upgrade of the FPSO targeted for the field demonstrated that the
vessel was not suitable. The joint venture partnership has investigated
alternative production facility options and a new build vessel has been
identified. Commercial negotiations are under way with the contractor for
this vessel and it is expected that front end engineering studies will start in
the second quarter of 2013.
During 2012, Premier completed subsurface evaluations for the Mackerel
discovery. Based on the results, a subsea tie-back to the Bream FPSO is the
most economic solution. An exploration well on the adjacent prospect,
Herring, is also planned to be drilled as part of the development project.
Project sanction and submission of development plans to the authorities
for the Bream development are expected in early 2014. First oil is targeted
for 2017 with an initial production rate of approximately 14,000 boepd net
to Premier.
Elsewhere in Norway, commercial discussions have been held with field
owners in the Frøy area with the intent of developing a central processing
hub for a number of discoveries close to Frøy. This has proved a slow
process, however the pace is expected to pick up in 2013 with equity
alignment discussions taking place with the operator of a nearby field.
Active exploration EXPLORATION //
Work continued in 2012 to evaluate the Grosbeak discovery in PL378. The
partnership is participating in an area forum that is evaluating the best way of
developing the resources in the area. In addition, a significant oil discovery
(Skarfjell) was made in the adjacent licence in 2012. Current mapping indicates
that a significant portion of Skarfjell extends into PL378 and preparations for
appraisal drilling have been initiated.
In February 2012, Premier completed its acquisition of three operated
exploration licences. These licences are close to Premier’s existing Freki licence
and are on the margin of the Mandal High in the Southern Norwegian North
Sea. Evaluation of this acreage has so far resulted in a drill recommendation
being brought forward to our partners in PL539 and we are awaiting a decision
shortly. Premier built further on its acreage position in and around the Mandal
High through the APA 2012 Licensing Round in which it was awarded a 20 per
cent operated interest in the Skala exploration licence in January 2013. As a
result, Premier now has access to around 200 mmbbls of net prospective
resources on and around the Mandal High.
In the operated licence PL622 a 3D survey was successfully acquired during the
summer in co-operation with PGS.
Looking forward, the Luno II exploration well in PL359 in the North Sea offshore
Norway spudded in March 2013 and the results of the well are expected by the
end of April. The well is looking to prove up the Jurassic reservoir sandstones
to the south of the Edvard Greig field and is targeting a gross mean unrisked
prospective resource of 120 mmboe.

NATURAL DECLINE IN PRODUCTION FROM OUR PRODUCING FIELDS IN PAKISTAN
HAS AGAIN BEEN MORE THAN OFFSET BY SUCCESSFUL INFILL DRILLING AND
STEP-OUT EXPLORATION. FURTHER POTENTIAL WILL BE TESTED DURING 2013.
PREMIER IS ALSO SEEKING, THROUGH A PROGRAMME OF PILOT WELLS AT
KADANWARI, TO TEST THE TIGHT GAS POTENTIAL IN DEEPER HORIZONS. PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT //
Average working interest production in Pakistan during 2012 was 15,600 boepd net to
Premier, three per cent higher than in 2011 (15,100 boepd), despite the start of natural
production decline in some existing wells. The higher production was mainly due to
successful infill drilling and the tie-in of exploration and development wells in the Kadanwari
and Bhit/Badhra gas fields.
Production from the Qadirpur gas field was broadly stable in 2012, averaging 3,700 boepd
net to Premier compared to 3,750 boepd in 2011. This was due to the good performance
of the wellhead compressors and to the better than expected support from the extended
reach wells drilled in the northern part of the reservoir. Specifically, the development wells
QP-44, QP-45, QP-46 and HRL-6 were successfully drilled, completed and tied-in to
production in 2012 while QP-48 and QP-49 are currently being drilled. In addition, the
Government of Pakistan has approved a new price for Qadirpur gas, increasing it by 11 per
cent, applicable with effect from December 2012.
Production from the Kadanwari gas field averaged 2,600 boepd net to Premier during 2012,
27 per cent higher than in 2011. This was as a result of sustained production from K-19 and
the increase in field production following the tie-in to facilities of the successful exploration
wells K-27 and K-28 and the K-29 development well.
The pilot programme at Kadanwari to test the tight gas potential in the Lower Goru
formation is ongoing. The K-3 DirB vertical well has been tested and is currently being
tied-in to the facilities while the testing of the K-1 DirA vertical well commenced in January.
Six tight sand intervals were fracked and tested separately at the K-3 DirB well with total
initial flow of 3.4 mmscfd which reduced to 1.8 mmscfd upon clean up. This proved that all
the tight intervals in the Kadanwari area can flow gas after fracking, while the G-Sand and
B-Sand have demonstrated relatively better flow potentials. These two intervals are being
tested in the K-1 DirA well where preliminary results are encouraging as the G-Sand flowed
0.5 mmscfd prior to clean up. All fracked B-Sand intervals also flowed gas to the surface
while rates are likely to improve after further rigless clean up. The G-Sand will be targeted
in the K-31H horizontal pilot well in 2013.
The Zamzama gas field produced 5,800 boepd net to Premier during 2012 (2011: 5,800 boepd).
This was mainly due to continuous good performance of front-end compressors and the
Zam-8 infill well being tied-in ahead of schedule. Sub-surface studies were completed in
early 2012, following which two infill wells, Zam 8 and Zam 9, were drilled back-to-back in
the second half of the year. While the Zam-8 infill well was tied-in to the system in
November, first gas from the Zam-9 infill well was achieved in January 2013.
Production from the Bhit/Badhra gas fields was stable in 2012, averaging 3,500 boepd net
to Premier. This was mainly due to the successful drilling and tie in of the Badhra B North-1
exploration well. In addition, the Bhit-15 development well, which was spudded on
4 November, was tied-in to the facilities in January 2013, further helping to offset the natural
decline from the existing wells on the Bhit/Badhra gas fields.
A revised development plan for the Zarghun South gas field was submitted to the Pakistan
Government in May 2012 following certification of 64 bcf of tight gas in the Dunghan
formation and 12 bcf of conventional gas in the Chiltan/Mughalkot formations by
independent consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughton. The revised development plan has
been approved for application of premium ‘Tight Gas Policy’ prices and, as a result, the joint
venture commenced development work on the project early in 2013. All costs pertaining to
Premier’s 3.75 per cent interest in the project are carried by the operator.

successes Outlook /
• Continue the infield development programme

EXPLORATION //
Two exploration wells, K-30 on the Kadanwari gas field, and Badhra B North-1 (BBN-1) on the
Badhra gas field, were drilled in 2012. Both wells were successful and have subsequently
been tied-in to infrastructure.
The K-30 exploration well was spudded in January 2012 and tested gas with a flow rate of
52 mmscfd through a 60/64 inch choke. The well was tied-in to the system in April 2012.
Following this better than expected result, two more wells are planned in 2013 in the eastern
part of the existing lease.
The BBN-1 well was drilled in September 2012 and made a significant gas discovery in the
Kirthar Foldbelt. The well was drilled to a total depth of 2,450 metres and encountered a new
sand interval, 44 metres thick, in the Mughalkot reservoir formation which tested gas at a
flow rate of 31 mmscfd. The well was tied-in to the Bhit facilities in November. The joint
venture has agreed to drill an appraisal well, Badhra B North-1 West, in the second quarter
of 2013 to assess the full potential of the 100 bcf discovery as part of an appraisal programme
submitted to the government. The planned Badhra-6 development well will be deepened
in 2013 to test the potential of the Parh Limestone. In addition, the Badhra South-1 Deep
exploration well will be drilled in 2013 to test the potential of a deeper lead at the Lower
Goru level.

PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT //
In Mauritania, 2012 working interest production from the Chinguetti field averaged 600 bopd

The undeveloped discovery, Tevet, in PSC B will continue to be held by the joint venture
partners until May 2013, development studies are on-going to make a ‘develop or drop’
decision.
In September 2012, the joint venture submitted an application for grant of an Exclusive
Exploitation Authorisation (EAA) for the Banda field along with a gas field development
plan (FDP) and Declaration of Commerciality to the Government of Mauritania, subject to
various conditions precedent. Subsequently, the government has approved the FDP and
awarded the EAA in January 2013. Gas sales arrangements and payment guarantees for
Banda are currently under discussion with prospective buyers.
The Tiof discovery was relinquished in November 2012, being sub-commercial, with a
request to the government that the partnership group is re-engaged in the event of a future
satellite development of the field.
EXPLORATION //
The consolidation of Premier’s exploration licences offshore Mauritania was finalised in 2011
with the grant of a new licence, PSC C-10, in which Premier has an equity of 6.23 per cent.
Site surveys were completed over two potential drilling locations, and a final decision on the
candidate for the first of two commitment wells will be made in the first half of 2013. The

Production from Premier’s UK fields increased to 12,100 boepd compared to 10,300 boepd
during 2011 despite no contribution from the Kyle field. The Banff FPSO, which handles Kyle
production, was damaged during exceptionally bad weather at the end of 2011. Since then
it has been off location while repairs are undertaken. The increased production in the North
Sea can be attributed to significantly higher uptime at the Balmoral facility, positive results from
the Scott field well intervention programme and our increased stake in the Wytch Farm asset.
Production from Premier’s Balmoral area averaged 4,500 bopd during 2012 compared to
3,750 bopd in 2011. An active year of work culminated in a highly successful Health, Safety and
Environment (HSE) KP4 audit during August, in which a significant improvement in overall
integrity was noted. Safety performance at the Premier-operated Balmoral floating production
vessel also improved in 2012 with a marked reduction in incident frequency and severity.
At the end of 2011, Premier increased its equity in the Wytch Farm field to 30.1 per cent.
Upgrades to the process plant and improvements to management systems have facilitated
increased production efficiency. An infill drilling programme commenced in February 2012,
ahead of schedule, and has resulted in the completion of three new wells and seven workovers.
On the Huntington field the six well development programme was successfully completed
in July 2012 with three of the four producers coming in above expectations. The FPSO
Voyageur Spirit sailed away in September and all five risers have subsequently been
installed. Adverse weather conditions late in the fourth quarter delayed the commissioning
and installation programme. However, the DSV Polaris is nearing completion of the final
subsea tie-in in preparation for first oil, which is anticipated by the end of March.
On the Rochelle project the subsea pipeline and umbilical installation programme and
upgrades to the host Scott platform were successfully progressed in 2012. The East Rochelle
well, the first of the two development wells, was damaged during a North Sea storm in
February 2013. As a result, drilling operations were suspended safely pending further analysis
and the order of the development wells was reversed with the Prospect rig spudding the
West Rochelle well in February. First gas from the Rochelle field is now expected either at
the end of the second quarter or in the third quarter of 2013.
Significant progress was achieved on our UK-operated development assets. Premier was
appointed operator of the Solan field, which is located West of Shetland, on 31 January
2012. The Solan project received full DECC and partner approvals in April 2012 and is now
in full execution mode with all of the significant contracts awarded. The platform is currently
being fabricated in Fife, Scotland while the fabrication of the subsea tank is being
undertaken in Dubai. Phase 1 of the development drilling is on track to commence in April
2013; the heavy lift installation work is planned for the summer of 2014. First oil is targeted
for the fourth quarter of 2014 with an initial production rate of 24,000 bopd (Premier equity
60 per cent).
In January 2012, Premier completed its acquisition of EnCore Oil plc which resulted in the
company taking over operatorship of the Catcher project and increasing its stake in the
project to 50 per cent. The development concept, which was formally approved by the joint
venture in December, consists of a leased FPSO with subsea tie-backs. The project has now
entered the design phase and the tender process with the FPSO providers and for the
subsea facilities front end engineering and design (FEED) is under way. The design phase is
expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2013 and it is anticipated that the
partnership will move to joint venture sanction thereafter. Timing of first oil from the Catcher
field is dependent on the results of the FPSO tender process. Premier is currently modelling
a first oil date during the second half of 2016.
Strong production growth EXPLORATION //
In 2012, Premier drilled seven exploration wells in the UK North Sea, primarily
focused on extending the successes of previous years’ drilling in the Catcher
licence across a wider area of the Central North Sea basin. This resulted in
success with the Carnaby well, the first well drilled to date on the western part
of the Catcher Block, which encountered 51 feet of net oil in excellent quality
sandstones. The remaining UK exploration wells that targeted this play in 2012
were either dry or encountered non-commercial discoveries. As a result, the
strategy will now focus exclusively on the prospectivity within the Greater
Catcher area. In particular, the Bonneville well spudded in early March with the
results expected shortly.
In addition to Bonneville, Premier will drill one other well, Lacewing, in the UK
Central North Sea in 2013. Lacewing is targeting Triassic reservoirs and is
Premier’s first high pressure high temperature (HPHT) well. In 2012, Premier
transferred a 37.2 per cent interest in Block 23/22b to ConocoPhillips in
exchange for a carry for the Lacewing well. As a result, Premier’s retained equity
in the well is 20.2 per cent. The well, which will be drilled using the Maersk
Resilient rig, is expected to spud in April.
In the 27
th
UK Licensing Round, the company was awarded a total of 12 licences
(six operated), building on our acreage position in the UK North Sea. In particular,
Premier was awarded four operated licences adjacent to the Catcher area,
which offer both near-field and deeper exploration potential. In addition,
Premier reached an agreement with EnCounter Oil (the former management
team of EnCore Oil plc) jointly to pursue several Mesozoic prospects and leads,
primarily in the Inner Moray Firth. Premier also secured a non-operated licence
interest in the west of Shetland Basin. It is anticipated that the leads and
prospects identified on this newly captured acreage will be matured during
2013, with drilling in 2014 and beyond.

ON BLOCK 07/03 TO THE SOUTH OF CHIM SÁO AND LOOK FORWARD TO
THE CA VOI EXPLORATION WELL IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2013, A POTENTIAL
PLAY-OPENER FOR THE UNDER-EXPLORED PHU KHANH BASIN. PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT //
The Premier-operated Chim Sáo field was brought on-stream at the end
of 2011 and the first full-year of oil and gas production from the field was
accomplished safely. 2012 production from the field averaged 15,200 boepd
(net to Premier), ahead of the original development plans. The price of oil
cargoes sold from the field during the year averaged in excess of US$4.50 per
barrel (/bbl) over Brent. 
The Chim Sáo development drilling programme, which comprised nine
producing wells and six injection wells, was completed safely and under
budget in April 2012. This programme was followed by three additional
wells aimed at capturing upside resources identified during development.
Two wells were targeted at a fault terrace to the north west of the field: one
was successful and commenced production at approximately 3,000 bopd
in August; the second well, targeting a separate fault segment to the north,
was dry. Separately, a third well was drilled to accelerate production from
a shallow reservoir with larger reserves than initially evaluated and was
brought on-stream in September at a rate of about 2,000 bopd.
The Chim Sáo field is currently producing 30 thousand barrels of oil per day
(kbopd), some 5 kbopd ahead of expectation at sanction, with potential for
further increases to deliverability when power constraints currently impacting
the FPSO are resolved. The plan is to add power generation capacity to
allow the water injection pumps to sustain reservoir pressure at higher
production levels, and the compressors to export higher volumes of
associated gas.
The development of the Premier-operated Dua oil field as a three well
subsea tie-back to the Chim Sáo facilities received partner sanction in the
second quarter of 2012 and Prime Ministerial approval in August. Installation
of the main pipeline commenced in February 2013. The field, which is forecast
to average a gross production rate of 8-10 kboepd in the first 12 months,
is expected on-stream in 2014.
Optimising Chim Sáo
production EXPLORATION //
In July 2012, Premier agreed to farm-in to the Origin Energy-operated Block 121,
in the northern part of the under-explored Phu Khanh Basin, offshore central
Vietnam, for a 40 per cent working interest. The farm-in received government
approval in February 2013. Premier will pay its participating interest share in the
drilling of the high risk Ca Voi prospect which is planned for May 2013. The
prospectivity of Block 121 centres on the untested Oligocene play fairway which
Premier recognises as being geologically similar to the Cau formation that it
has successfully explored in Blocks 12W and 07/03 in the Nam Con Son Basin.
Immediately after the high risk Ca Voi well, the Ocean General will move to drill
CRD-3X, which will appraise the Cá Rˆ o

(CRD) discovery, on Block 07/03.
The rig will then move to spud the wildcat exploration well on the Silver Sillago
prospect also on Block 07/03 in mid-2013. The well, 07-CD-1X, will evaluate the
petroleum potential of a new sub-basin within the overall Nam Con Son Basin.
The Ocean General will then move to Indonesia where it will spud the Kuda
Laut well on the Premier-operated Tuna Block.

New Country Entry – Exploration
2012 Highlights and achievements /
• Acquired 5,000 square kilometres of new 3D seismic
across the western part of our Kenya acreage
• Successful entry into Southern Iraq, one of the
world’s most prolific basins
• Gained a significant acreage position in the relatively
un-drilled, highly prospective North Falklands
Basin through the acquisition of 60 per cent of
Rockhopper’s licence interests
• In total, added in excess of 1 bnboe of gross
unrisked prospective resources through new

Andrew Lodge
Exploration Director
Premier is building an increasingly
material exploration programme.
Our biggest achievement in 2012
was to rebalance the portfolio
through the addition of in excess
of 1 bnboe of gross unrisked
prospective resources through
new country entry. We continue
to look for opportunities in new
countries which meet our criteria
of delivering play-opening
opportunities with significant
follow-on potential.”

IN ADDITION TO EXPLORATION IN THE EXISTING BUSINESS UNIT AREAS,
PREMIER LOOKS TO OPEN UP NEW FRONTIER GEOGRAPHIES IN TARGETED
NEW COUNTRIES WHERE THE GEOLOGY IS ASSESSED TO BE SIMILAR TO THAT
OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS UNITS WHERE PREMIER HAS BUILT EXPERTISE. The acreage recently accessed by Premier in new areas is dominated by
deepwater environments where an exploration success has the potential to
transform the resource base of the company. To date Premier has exposure
to frontier exploration acreage in selected areas of Africa and the Middle
East. We continue to evaluate new areas for potential entry in 2013.
In East Africa, Premier has equity interests in two blocks offshore Kenya,
Blocks L10A and L10B. Processing and interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic
data on these blocks continued throughout 2012, and a new 2,250 km
2
3D
seismic acquisition programme took place over the western part of the blocks
in late 2012. A prospect inventory is being prepared with a view to drilling
the first exploration well in 2014 or potentially in the fourth quarter 2013.
In November 2012, Premier was formally awarded a 30 per cent non-operated
interest in Iraq’s Block 12. Block 12, an 8,000 square kilometre block in the
foreland of the Zagros fold belt up dip from producing fields, lies in a frontier
part of one of the world’s more prolific oil and gas basins. The forward plan
on Block 12 is to reprocess the existing seismic data in 2013 and then acquire
new seismic data in 2014. Subject to the interpretation of the new seismic an
exploration well will be drilled in 2015 or 2016.
In Egypt, following the drilling of the Cherry prospect in the North Red Sea-1
licence in 2011, Premier has decided to relinquish its equity share of the
licence. Premier has also withdrawn from the South Darag Block in the Gulf
of Suez, due to the lack of formal government approval of the licence award.
Premier’ s exploration rights in the Daora, Haouza, Mahbes, Mijek and Laguara
Blocks offshore the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) remain under
force majeure, awaiting resolution of sovereignty under a United Nations
mandated process.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Profit after

US$252.0 million 
resulting in basic
earnings per share
of 47.9 cents”
“
Economic background
Oil prices for the year as a whole were unusually stable, averaging US$111.7/bbl against
US$111.3/bbl for 2011, and trading in a range of US$126.7/bbl to US$88.7/bbl. Premier’s
portfolio of crudes traded at a weighted average of US$3.5/bbl premium to Brent,
boosted by favourable prices for our Chim Sáo crude in the Asian markets. Premier’s
average realisations for the year were US$111.4/bbl (2011: US$111.9/bbl) influenced by
the timing of actual crude oil liftings. After taking into account the effect of hedging
contracts, this reduced to US$107.5/bbl (2011: US$89.6/bbl).
Average gas prices for the group were US$8.34 per thousand standard cubic feet (mscf)
(2011: US$8.51/mscf). Gas prices in Singapore, linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO)
pricing and in turn, therefore, linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$18.7/mscf
(2011: US$19.5/mscf). Average prices for Pakistan gas (where only a portion of the
contract formulae is linked to energy prices) was US$4.3/mscf (2011: US$3.8/mscf).
Income statement
Production in 2012 averaged 57.7 kboepd (2011: 40.4 kboepd) on a working interest
basis. On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our PSCs allows for additional
government take at higher oil prices, production was 51.6 kboepd (2011: 37.7 kboepd).
Working interest gas production averaged 180 mmscfd (2011: 153 mmscfd) or
approximately 54 per cent of total production.
Total sales revenue from all operations reached a new record level of US$1,408.7 million
(2011: US$826.8 million), driven by higher production and the sustained high oil prices.
Cost of sales rose to US$742.4 million (2011: US$414.9 million). Unit operating costs were
US$16.2 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) (2011: US$15.9/boe) and amounted to
US$342.4 million (2011: US$235.2 million). The operating costs per boe in Pakistan and
Indonesia remained stable, increased marginally in the UK and were significantly
reduced in Vietnam due to one-off production start up costs in the prior year. Underlying
unit amortisation (excluding impairment) rose to US$16.4/boe (2011: US$13.8/boe)
reflecting increased production from Vietnam, which has a higher amortisation charge
per boe compared to the group average.
Exploration expense and pre-licence expenditure costs amounted to US$157.7 million
(2011: US$187.5 million) and US$29.2 million (2011: US$23.0 million) respectively. This
includes the write-off of the following exploration wells: a Chim Sáo North West well in
Vietnam; Benteng in Indonesia, and the Spaniards, East Fyne, Stingray, Cyclone, Bluebell
and Coaster wells in the UK North Sea. Net administrative costs were US$24.2 million
against 2011 of US$25.8 million.
Operating profits were US$455.2 million (2011: US$175.6 million). Finance costs and
other charges, net of interest revenue and other gains, were US$107.6 million (2011:
US$68.1 million). The increase reflects historically low levels of interest rates on cash
deposits, increased gross debt levels to fund development projects in Asia and the UK,
and in the latter parts of 2012, the US$231.0 million funding for the acquisition of the Sea
Lion discovery in the Falkland Islands. The charge for the unwinding of the discounted
decommissioning provision increased to US$33.2 million (2011: US$28.3 million) reflecting
increased provisions for future decommissioning as industry cost estimates rise.
Pre-tax profits of US$359.9 million (2011: US$141.5 million) also show a positive
adjustment of US$14.2 million in respect of the group’s commodity hedge portfolio
(2011: US$34.0 million). This represents the unwinding of prior year provisions in respect
of our embedded oil hedging programme, which finished at the end of 2012.
Tony Durrant
Finance Director Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  25
The group tax charge for 2012 is US$107.9 million, an effective tax rate of 30 per cent of
our profit before tax. The group’s theoretical tax rate is close to 50 per cent, a higher
taxation rate in the UK being offset by lower rates in Vietnam and Pakistan. The 2012 tax
charge is reduced as a result of a deferred tax credit in the UK, arising from the Ring
Fence Expenditure Supplement (RFES) allowance and the small field allowance for the
group’s Solan field. The group has an estimated US$1.9 billion of carried forward UK
corporation tax allowances, which will be utilised against UK ring fence profits over time,
and are therefore reflected in the deferred tax asset position at the year-end.
Profit after tax is a record US$252.0 million (2011: US$171.2 million) resulting in basic
earnings per share of 47.9 cents (2011: 36.6 cents).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a dividend of 5 pence per share (2011: nil). This dividend is
subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held in London on
7 June 2013. If approved, the dividend will be paid on 14 June 2013 to shareholders on
the register as of 17 May 2013.
Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities was US$808.2 million (2011: US$485.9 million) after
accounting for tax payments of US$233.1 million (2011: US$44.0 million). The higher cash
flow and tax payments reflect increased production in Gajah Baru, Indonesia and Chim
Sáo, Vietnam.
Capital expenditure in 2012 totalled US$771.6 million (2011: US$660.5 million).

The principal field and development projects were Solan, Huntington and Rochelle in
the UK, Naga and Pelikan in Indonesia and Dua in Vietnam, together with drilling and
compression projects in Pakistan.
Exploration and evaluation spend includes costs principally related to the exploration
drilling activities in the UK, Vietnam, Pakistan and Norway.
Acquisitions and disposals
In January, the company completed the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc (EnCore).
Shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCore’s shares elected to take new Premier
shares, resulting in the company paying a total of £14.1 million (US$21.6 million) in cash
to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new Ordinary Shares to those who
elected to take the share alternative.
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement to
on-sell the 16.6 per cent interest in the Cladhan area, which it acquired via the EnCore
acquisition, for an adjusted consideration of US$52.4 million. This on-sale was completed
in March 2012.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
In May, Premier agreed to acquire a 20 per cent interest in PL407 and a 40 per cent
interest in the adjacent PL406 licence on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. These
interests increased Premier’s share of the Bream development project to 40 per cent and
the company’s operated interest in PL406 to 80 per cent. PL406 contains the Mackerel
discovery and the Herring prospect, which could form part of the Bream area
development in the future. Upfront consideration for the acquisition was US$10.0 million
with contingent payments of US$17.5 million payable upon certain project outcomes.
The acquisition was completed in July 2012.
Also in July, Premier announced it had agreed to farm-in to 60 per cent of Rockhopper’s
licence interests in the Falkland Islands, including the Sea Lion development project.
The initial payment was US$231 million in cash. In addition, Premier will pay an
exploration carry of up to US$48 million and, subject to field development plan
approval, a development carry of up to US$722 million. Premier has also agreed to
provide additional stand-by funding to complete the project. In the event that
Rockhopper chooses to draw down on this facility, Premier will take an enhanced share
of entitlement production and cash flows from the Sea Lion and related fields. This
enhanced share continues until Premier realises a 15 per cent post tax internal rate of
return on its investment. Thereafter cash flows are shared pro-rata to equity interests.
Premier’s investment in Sea Lion and related fields will be funded from a combination
of Premier’s existing cash resources and facilities and future cash flow from operations.
Premier and Rockhopper have also agreed to pursue jointly exploration opportunities
in the Falkland Islands and analogous plays in selected areas offshore Southern Africa.
The transaction, accounted for as an asset purchase, was completed in October 2012.

rate. However these will be redeemed at an average of US$1.397:€ due to cross currency swap arrangements.
In February 2012, additional bank facilities of US$350.0 million were negotiated and a
second issue of senior loan notes was completed. This second issue, with maturities of
seven, 10 and 12 years, amounted to US$202.0 million and €25.0 million. A US$175.0 million
term bank loan was repaid during March 2012.
In October 2012, further to an offer from the company, holders representing 98.13 per
cent of the total principal amount of the US$250.0 million guaranteed convertible bonds
due in 2014 (representing a principal amount of approximately US$245.3 million) elected
to exchange their existing bonds for guaranteed convertible bonds due in July 2018.
The new bonds have a conversion price of US$7.00 (£4.34) per share and a coupon of
2.5 per cent. This compares with the old convertible bonds, which had a conversion
price of US$6.69 per share and a coupon of 2.875 per cent. Following completion of the
Exchange Offer, Premier exercised its right under the terms and conditions of the old
bonds to redeem the remaining outstanding bonds (in an aggregate amount of

Financial risk management
Commodity prices
The Board’s commodity pricing and hedging policy continues to be to lock in oil and
gas prices for a proportion of expected future production at a level which ensures that
investment programmes for sanctioned projects are adequately funded. Where
investment requirements are well covered by cash flows without hedging, it is recognised
that there may be an advantage, in periods of strong commodity prices in locking in a
portion of forward production at favourable prices on a rolling forward 12-18 month basis.
At year-end, therefore 3.0 million barrels of Dated Brent oil were hedged through
forward sales for 2013 at an average price of US$109.0/bbl. This volume represents
approximately 25 per cent of the group’s expected liquids entitlement production in
2013. 48,000 metric tonnes (mt) of HSFO, which drives our gas contract pricing in
Singapore, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-2013 with a cap of
US$500/mt (equivalent to around US$85/bbl). An additional 96,000 mt have been sold
under monthly forward sales contracts for 2013 at an average price of US$657/mt. These
two hedges cover approximately 32 per cent of our expected Indonesian gas working
interest production for 2013.
During 2012, embedded oil price collars and forward oil sales of 3.9 million barrels,
and fuel oil collars and forward sales for 246,000 mt expired at a cost of US$60.7 million
(2011: US$119.1 million) which has been offset against sales revenue.
Oil hedge collars are incorporated within the pricing terms of physical off take agreements,
avoiding the requirement to revalue them for accounting purposes. A credit of
US$9.6 million (2011: US$28.0 million) occurred in respect of past mark-to-market
provisions for oil hedges, which have now fully expired.
Foreign exchange
Premier’s functional and reporting currency is US dollars. Exchange rate exposures relate
only to local currency receipts, and expenditures within individual business units. Local
currency needs are acquired on a short-term basis. During the year, the group recorded
a gain of US$1.5 million on such short-term hedging (2011: loss of US$0.4 million). In 2012,
the group also issued €25.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been
hedged under a cross currency swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.328:€.
Interest rates
Although the group’s borrowing facilities are defined in floating rate terms, a majority
of its current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate
swap markets. On average, therefore, the cost of drawn bank funds for the year was
4.6 per cent. Mark-to-market movements on these interest rate swaps amounted to
US$2.5 million (2011: charge of US$6.4 million), which was credited to other comprehensive
income.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds,
subject to Board approved limits and with a view to spreading counterparty risks.
Insurance
The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact
of physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities.
Business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing
fields for a maximum period of 18 months. Due to exceptionally bad weather in
December 2011, the Banff FPSO – which handled Kyle production – lost its anchors and
the risers were severely damaged, stopping Kyle production for the foreseeable future.
A claim for business interruption insurance and property damage is being negotiated
with the underwriters.

Going concern
The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year
to ensure it has sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements. Sensitivities are run
to reflect the latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil and gas prices, and other
negative economic scenarios. This is done to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or
covenant breaches and to ensure the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Despite economic volatility, the Board consider the expected operating cash flows of
the group and the headroom provided by the available borrowing facilities give them
confidence that the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern. As a
result, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2012 Annual
Report and Financial Statements.
Business risks 
Premier’s business may be impacted by various risks leading to failure to achieve
strategic targets for growth, loss of financial standing, cash flow and earnings, and
reputation. Not all of these risks are wholly within the company’s control and the
company may be affected by risks which are not yet manifest or reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting
our assets, personnel and reputation and therefore Premier has a comprehensive
approach to risk management.
A critical part of the risk management process is to assess the impact and likelihood of
risks occurring so that appropriate mitigation plans can be developed and implemented.
Risk severity matrices are developed across Premier’s business to facilitate assessment of
risk. The specific risks identified by departments, project teams, corporate functions and
business units are consolidated to provide an oversight of key risk factors at each level,
from operating level through business unit management to Executive Committee and
the Board.
For all the known risks facing the business, Premier attempts to minimise the likelihood
and mitigate the impact. According to the nature of the risk, Premier may elect to
tolerate risk, treat risk with controls and mitigating actions, transfer risk to third parties,
or terminate risk by ceasing particular activities or operations. Premier has a zero
tolerance to financial fraud or ethics non-compliance, and ensures HSES risks are
managed to levels as low as reasonably practicable whilst managing exploration and
development risks on a portfolio basis.
The group has identified its principal risks for the next 12 months as being:
• health, safety, environment and security (HSES);
• production and development delivery;
• exploration success and reserves addition;
• host government – political and fiscal risks;
• commodity price volatility;
• organisational capability;
• joint venture partner alignment; and
• financial discipline and governance.
Further information detailing the way in which these risks are managed is provided
on pages 52-53.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Premier measures its performance in line with its strategic objectives of growing the
value of the underlying assets of the business and creating significant returns for
shareholders. Specifically, key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to measure
progress against agreed targets in the areas of safe, responsible and sustainable
operations; growth through exploration, development, production and acquisitions;
and maintaining financial strength. These KPIs also link to senior management’s
remuneration.
Operating safely, responsibly and sustainably 
Premier is committed to operating responsibly in every part of the business. Success in
these areas inherently protects our assets, our revenue streams and our reputation.
Health and Safety performance is measured using total recordable injury rate (TRIR) per
million man-hours and near miss high potential incidents (HIPO) per million man-hours.
Safety performance data includes both Premier employees and contractors.
Premier’s TRIR performance improved in 2012 as the company sought to improve
performance by reinforcing procedures and standards, frequent training and ongoing
communication. A TRIR of 1.8 per million man-hours was achieved in 2012, which
is below the TRIR target of 2.0. 
As part of its safety performance management process, Premier tracks HIPOs which
include any event that might lead to significant injury, environmental damage, property
damage or security breaches. Premier continues to ensure that key lessons are learned
and disseminated for all HIPOs and company-wide Safety Alerts are issued, citing key
causes and preventative actions required. Premier’s HIPO performance, while still within
the target of 2.0 HIPOs per million man-hours, declined in 2012: 2012 saw eight HIPOs,
which equates to a frequency rate of 1.3 HIPOs per million man-hours. The 2013 target
is 1.5 HIPOs per million man-hours.
Building the strong production base 
One of the metrics by which Premier’s growth performance is measured is by the
compound annual growth rate in net asset value per share. Premier targets in excess of
10 per cent NAV growth per share per year and, over the seven-year period to end-2012,
the company has achieved in excess of 15 per cent.
Premier also aims to build on the existing production base in order to sustain and
continue to deliver growth. This is measured using daily average production and the
number of development projects being brought through to sanction. Average daily
production increased 43 per cent in 2012 to 57.7 kboepd due to a full-year of production
from the new Asia fields, Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru, which came on-stream in late 2011.
Premier is targeting average production of 65-70 kboepd for 2013 and a run rate of
100 kboepd once the Catcher project comes on-stream.

Premier’s production goal is underpinned by the pipeline of
development projects being progressed across the portfolio, and
the ability to commercialise and bring on-stream these projects is
key to the company’s success. In 2012, Premier sanctioned four
development projects (Solan, Pelikan, Naga and Dua).
Delivering growth 
Premier looks to create future growth through exploration in
focused geologies and value-led acquisitions. Progress towards
this growth ambition is measured by reserves replacement, risked
prospective resource added and finding costs.
Premier also undertakes acquisitions to access additional resources.
In 2012, the company acquired 60 per cent of Rockhopper’s
licence interests in the Falkland Islands, including the Sea Lion
project, and increased its stake in the Bream project to 40 per
cent through a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Skeie Energy
AS. Exploration successes, which included the Carnaby discovery
in the UK North Sea and Badhra B North-1 and K-30 in Pakistan,
also added to Premier’s reserve and resource base.
Reserves and resources increased 51 per cent to 773 mmboe
giving a reserve replacement ratio of 138 per cent. In addition,
2012 saw Premier add approximately 250 mmboe of contingent
resources and in excess of 1.5 billion barrels of unrisked
prospective resources to its portfolio.
Premier added reserves and resources through exploration and
acquisition at an average cost of around US$2/bbl during 2012.
Maintaining financial strength
One of Premier’s strategic objectives is to maintain financial
strength in order to invest in the future of the business and deliver
significant returns to shareholders. 2012 was another strong year
with record profit after tax of US$252.0 million, an increase of 
47 per cent, and operating cash flow of US$808.2 million, an
increase of 66 per cent.
Premier’s portfolio of crudes was sold at an average of
US$111.4/bbl. Realised average gas prices, a significant portion of
which tracks oil price movement, achieved US$8.34/mscf in 2012.
Operating costs were stable in 2012 at US$16.2/boe. Rising cash
flows, along with successful bank and bond market transactions,
provide Premier with the funding required for future growth.
Ability to add new capital and sufficient covenant headroom are
measured to ensure the company has the funds to meet forecast
cash requirements and maintain liquidity throughout the cycle.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
High ethical standards
PREMIER IS COMMITTED TO APPLYING THE HIGH ETHICAL
STANDARDS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN OUR REPUTATION 
AS A WORLD-CLASS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION COMPANY. 
Our reputation for doing the right thing enables us to access new licences, enter new
countries, build lasting relationships with local communities and ultimately to secure
our licence to operate. We recognise that our licence to operate as an international
upstream oil and gas company has to be earned through responsible behaviour that
does not compromise the wellbeing of current or future generations. 
We have policies and procedures in place to ensure that our investment and operational
decisions take appropriate account of the impacts that might arise from our activities.
These policies cover business ethics, human rights, human resources, health, safety and
environment, and community investment. All policies are compliant with relevant
legislation and take due account of appropriate standards, industry guidance and
relevant best practice. 
Premier commissions independent reviews or audits of its policies and their supporting
management systems to evaluate compliance with the requirements of the following
bodies: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); the International Petroleum Industry
Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on
Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2010; the Carbon Disclosure Project; FTSE4Good
and the United Nations Global Compact (of which Premier is a signatory). This report
summarises how we have evolved, applied and delivered on our stated policies in 2012,
and we explain any areas where we have not complied. Additional insight into each area
is reported in the Corporate Responsibility Report 2012.
The Corporate Responsibility Report 2012, together with further details on our policies
and procedures are available on our website at www.premier-oil.com. 32 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT (continued)
Our Global Code of Conduct
In June 2011, Premier issued its Global Code of Conduct and the associated due diligence process. The Code
is available in both English and Bahasa Indonesia for those employees and contractors based at our operations
in Indonesia. It is compliant with the United Kingdom Bribery Act and covers the following key areas:
• anti-corruption; 
• facilitation payments;
• gifts and hospitality (given and received);
• charitable and political donations; and
• appointment of intermediaries.
Scope of application
The Code of Conduct applies to employees at every level in the business and those associated with Premier
such as contractors; all of whom are required to behave ethically and with personal integrity. This includes
adhering to laws in the countries in which we operate, explore and have joint venture interests. All employees
and associates are required to perform their duties in accordance with the Code of Conduct, and to disclose
any potential and actual conflicts between personal interests and those of Premier. The Code of Conduct
requires all transactions relating to Premier to be recorded in proper detail and according to applicable
accounting and reporting standards. Any breach of the Code of Conduct will result in disciplinary action, and
in extreme cases will result in instant dismissal. The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board in monitoring
ethical business conduct as well as the effectiveness of the Code of Conduct and its supporting policies.
Training and monitoring
Our Legal team delivered a comprehensive set of workshops on the Code of Conduct and its requirements
to all business units worldwide during 2011 and 2012. Each of our business units is analysed for risks relating
to corruption, some being more exposed than others depending on geography and area of work. The
content of our training was refined to take account of local nuances and cultural norms and thus better equip
local teams to manage business ethics risks. An online training course was established in 2012 and was
completed by all employees and consultants. All new employees are expected to complete the ethics
training programme within one month of joining the company. A briefing on the content of the Code of
Conduct is also included in the induction programme for all new employees and consultants.
Whistle-blowing hotline
Premier encourages employees, contractors and agency workers to voice their concerns to line managers if
they think the company or anyone working on behalf of the company has not acted in accordance with the
Code of Conduct. Premier provides a confidential and well-publicised independent third party reporting
hotline for employees that feel unable to raise concerns in the normal way. This hotline is available 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week. No reports were made through this service in 2012 or at any point over the last
three years. 
No incidents of corruption or non-compliance with the Code were identified in 2012.
Business ethics
INTEGRITY, HONESTY AND FAIRNESS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE WAY WE
CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. WE WILL NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING
BRIBERY OR CORRUPTION IN ANY FORM, THAT UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY IN ALL OF
OUR DEALINGS. Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  33
Human rights
IN 2012, PREMIER CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF ITS HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
AGAINST BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS (SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS
GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS) AND THE POSITION
OF OUR PEERS IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR. 
Our revised policy more explicitly recognises the moral, reputational and operational value of respecting
and promoting human rights both inside and outside of our company. It includes the need to: 
• engage with stakeholders in our efforts to respect and promote these rights;
• recognise the development and cultural rights of external stakeholders as basic human rights;
• recognise our responsibility to respect the rights of indigenous people in all countries where we operate;
• help prevent, manage and resolve conflict where we are in a position to do so;
• ensure we are in no way involved or associated with the issue of forced, involuntary or child labour;
• ensure our security practices do not undermine the human rights of local communities;
• encourage joint venture partners to adopt the principles in this policy;
• consider withdrawal from relationships with business partners where there is no evidence that they are
moving towards the application of international human rights standards; and
• use our legitimate influence to promote human rights outside our areas of operation. 
Our Human Rights Policy is based on the fundamental rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and is guided by those rights enshrined in the core labour conventions of the International Labour
Organisation and by the United Nations Global Compact principles. Our policy addresses the rights of our
employees including their health and safety as well as their security arrangements and working conditions;
and the development rights of our external stakeholders, in particular local communities.
Further detail on our performance and alignment with this policy is included in the Corporate Responsibility
Report 2012. There were no reported violations of our Human Rights Policy in the review period. 34 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT (continued)
Employees
WE AIM TO PROVIDE OUR STAFF WITH SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND JUST
AND COMPETITIVE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS A CORE PART OF OUR
BUSINESS AND PEOPLE STRATEGY. THIS MEANS RESPECTING ALL INDIVIDUALS
REGARDLESS OF ETHNIC ORIGIN, CREED, AGE OR GENDER. 
We are an equal opportunities employer. When recruiting, developing and dealing with employees and
service providers, people will be treated fairly, equally and without prejudice. We respect the right of
individual employees to join a legitimate trade union. Through training and appraisal, we encourage staff
to develop their own professional skills to the advantage of both the individual and the company.
This sentiment is embedded in our employment policies which apply to all permanent, contractual and
temporary staff as well as all job applicants. There were no reported violations of these policies in 2012. There
were also no reported instances of discrimination and no use was made of our formal grievance procedures. 
In 2011, Premier launched a new People Strategy to support its continued growth in exploration and
production. The strategy is accompanied by a suite of updated tools and processes to facilitate the
recruitment, development, deployment and retention of high calibre employees. It promotes efficiency,
innovation, knowledge sharing and leadership all of which are essential to the delivery of our business goals.
2012 saw the continued roll-out of this strategy across the group.
To achieve this we will:
• encourage open and honest communication; 
• seek ways to continually improve our performance; 
• assess and manage risks;
• provide appropriate resources; 
• maintain clean, safe and healthy workplaces; 
• investigate and learn from any incidents; 
• plan and prepare for potential emergencies; 
• maintain high-quality documented systems and processes; 
• seek external certification of key management systems; and 
• meet or surpass statutory requirements. 
Health and safety
PREMIER IS COMMITTED TO OPERATING RESPONSIBLY AND WILL NEVER KNOWINGLY
COMPROMISE OUR HEALTH, SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS TO MEET OUR
OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES. OUR GOALS ARE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE
INVOLVED WITH OUR OPERATIONS AND TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  35
In 2011, we introduced and communicated our Golden Rules. The Golden Rules reinforce the HSES Policy,
associated procedures and standards, and have been established to help prevent the most common causes
of serious incidents in our industry. Continued implementation of the Golden Rules during 2012 has been a
key part of our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement in health and safety performance.
Premier continues to ensure that every employee, contractor and individual at our operations understands
company rules and expectations. Every employee is accountable and has a personal responsibility for
health, safety and environment. Employees are also expected to ‘stop the job’ if they see or believe
something can be better controlled or is unsafe.
Premier has been certified to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 since 2004 for global drilling and since 2006 for
our Indonesian production operations. In 2012, we completed a number of OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001
surveillance audits on our production and drilling operations. During 2012 Drilling, Anoa and Balmoral
Production retained their certifications and Gajah Baru was added to the scope of our Indonesian
production operations certificate. Our Chim Sáo production operation in Vietnam is working towards
OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 certification in 2013.
Occupational safety performance
In 2012, we worked 6.1 million man-hours (2011: 7.2 million man-hours). This decrease on the previous 
year was due to reductions in drilling man-hours (from 1.7 million in 2011 to 0.8 million in 2012) and in
construction (from 2.8 million in 2011 to 2.0 million in 2012). Most of these man-hours (4.3 million vs. 
5.9 million in 2011) were worked by contractors on our operations. We expect to see a progressive 
increase in man-hours during 2013 with a number of new projects continuing and coming into the
construction phase.

Note: All safety statistics include both Premier employees and contractors.
Total recordable injuries
Our overall TRIR performance improved significantly from 2.4 in 2011 to 1.8 in 2012, showing a continued
improvement in performance over the last three years and meeting our 2.0 target. TRIR performance at our
construction operations was exceptional at 0.0 (2011: 1.8), much improved at our production operations at
2.8 (2011: 6.1) but poor at our drilling operations at 7.5 (2011: 0.0). This overall positive trend in our TRIR
performance was largely due to significant improvements at our North Sea operations where rates improved
from 9.4 in 2011 to 4.5 in 2012; following a series of site-specific safety initiatives and leadership courses to
address the previously high number of mostly minor accidents including slips, falls and finger injuries at our
production facilities. Our operations in Asia continued to perform well with a TRIR score of 0.9 (2011: 1.5).
Our TRIR target for 2013 is 2.0. 
Process safety performance
Insight into High Potential Incidents (HIPOs) and their rate of occurrence enable us to learn about how to
mitigate future incidents, often by addressing the root causes. We believe these HIPOs act as a leading
indicator of potential injury and complement the continued testing of asset integrity through our Project
Safety Reviews (PSRs) and Safety Case processes. 36 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT (continued)
High potential incidents
Last year saw a slight increase in HIPOs per million man-hours from 0.8 in 2011 to 1.3 in 2012. This was well
within our target of 2.0. The increase in rate from 2011 was due to a significant decrease in the number of
man-hours but a small increase in the number of high potential incidents from six in 2011 to eight in 2012,
(seven of which occurred at our Asia operations). Performance improved at our construction operations
where there were zero high potential incidents in 2012 (2011: one). All of the eight high potentials reported
in 2012 were investigated in-depth, corrective actions identified and their implementation monitored. Safety
alerts based on each incident were made available to all employees in order to share learning across the
group. Safety alerts are mandatory for all HIPOs but may also be issued where there are incidents or events
that require heightened awareness and caution. Our HIPOR target for 2013 is 1.5.
Loss of primary containment
Measurement of loss of primary containment (LOPC) is a new metric proposed by the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP). We recognise further work is required to harmonise process
safety performance measurement across the industry; and continue to work with OGP as members of its
process safety sub-committee to develop an industry approach to indicators and reporting that includes
leading metrics. It is anticipated OGP will publish the first LOPC industry data in 2013, and that this will be
able to be used to set future Premier targets.
In 2012, there were 41 LOPC events (2011: 35) at our operations. Of these none were Tier 1 LOPC events
(2011: one). There were seven reported Tier 2 events (2011: five). The remaining minor events (34) included
small gas leaks and contained oil spills that did not reach the environment. Tier 1 events are those where
there is a significant loss of containment from a process system, i.e. gas over 500kg and oil over 1,000kg
(outdoor). Tier 2 are those releases of lesser consequence, i.e. gas over 50kg and oil over 100kg (outdoor)
and some events defined by American Petroleum Institute (API). We measure the number of incidents or
rate per activity man-hour (LOPCR) at both our operated drilling and production operations and sum it as
a company metric.
Safety by design
Premier has integrated process safety protocols into the PSRs of all its projects. These reviews provide
assurance that material HSE issues have been identified and are being effectively managed throughout the
project lifecycle. A typical project lifecycle will require six strategic reviews as a project moves from concept to
construction and then to operation. These PSRs align with our project approval gates, at which time strategic
decisions are made to either progress a project further towards the operations stage or to delay or divest.
Safety cases are in place at all of our operated installations. This safety case regime is aligned with the
regulated standards in the United Kingdom. We believe this represents best practice and we are committed to
implementing such cases at all of our operated production facilities worldwide, even when not required by the
local regulatory regime. A safety case is developed during the early stages of a project and becomes more
detailed as a project nears the operation stage. A safety case must be in place before production commences.
Each case includes a review and impact assessment of the relevant process safety risks, the requirement to
meet established safety benchmarks and the adoption of further steps to reduce risks to a level that is as low
as is reasonably practicable (the ALARP principle). For our operating assets, these are reviewed every five
years to ensure continued compliance. Safety cases are reviewed by either the local regulatory authority or
a competent independent third party to provide assurance that they comply with our standards.  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  37
Environment
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING FORMS A
MAJOR PART OF PREMIER’S HSE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. WE CONDUCT
BASELINE SURVEYS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS
FOR EACH NEW OPERATED ACTIVITY.
This involves an assessment of the physical, socio-economic and biological environments including the
rights of indigenous peoples and biodiversity. We measure and review each impact in turn and gauge both
its significance and how it can be reduced to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable. Potential
actions to improve environmental performance are screened based on cost, duration and impact to
determine which are feasible for implementation. We periodically review these environmental impacts and
actions for our existing facilities to ensure we are complying with our policy of continuous improvement.
Environmental indicators and targets
We report our environmental performance in line with the IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on
Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2010 and to meet GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Our emissions
performance is benchmarked by contributing our data to an industry database compiled and published by
the OGP . As an oil company with production facilities in the North Sea, we also comply with the European
Union Emissions Trading Scheme and submit an annual, externally verified report on our emissions profile
to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). We also participate in the Carbon Disclosure
Project where we achieved a carbon disclosure score of 66 (out of 100) in 2012 (2011: 66).

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT (continued)
Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrocarbon combustion at our operations amounted to 
890,809 tonnes in 2012 (2011: 615,000 tonnes). This increase in total emissions was largely due to a full year
of production from our Gajah Baru and Chim Sáo operations in Asia, versus only a limited number of months 
in 2011.
Our operated emissions intensity decreased from 305 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production in 2011 to
242 in 2012. This was mainly due to reduced flaring at Chim Sáo versus 2011. Additional contributing factors
included a reduction in development drilling and increased overall production from both our Asian and North
Sea assets. Our Anoa and Gajah Baru facilities in Indonesia delivered strong performance with an average
intensity of 175 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production (2011: 139 tonnes) and 119 tonnes per thousand
tonnes of production (2011: 228 tonnes) respectively. Our performance at Gajah Baru was lower than the
159 tonnes industry average published by OGP . Despite the overall reduction of around 20 per cent, we failed
to meet our intensity target, mainly due to unexpected flaring at Chim Sáo, in Vietnam. 
We calculate our greenhouse gas (CO
2
equivalent or CO
2
e) emissions both for operated assets and on an
equity basis for production across our global portfolio. Greenhouse gas intensity from flaring and fuel gas
combustion associated with our full equity portfolio amounted to 170 tonnes per thousand tonnes of
production (2011: 172 tonnes).
Spills and discharges
The total volume of produced water discharged from our operations in 2012 amounted to 3,905,611 tonnes
(2011: 2,055,878 tonnes). Over 90 per cent of the total was produced by our North Sea operations, with the
increase in 2012 being largely due to the Balmoral field after a period of shut-down in 2011. The average oil
in produced water decreased slightly from 13.9 parts per million weight (ppm-wt) in 2011 to 10.0 ppm-wt in
2012. This decrease in the oil concentration of produced water was mainly due to a reduction at Balmoral that
averaged 10.3 ppm-wt (2011: 14.0 ppm-wt). The average concentration of oil in produced water discharged
by our Anoa facility in Indonesia also reduced to 10.7 ppm-wt from 13.3 ppm-wt in 2011.
In 2012, there were 13 spills to the environment (2011: 20 spills), 11 of these were hydrocarbon spills (2011:
16 spills), eight of which were upsets of the produced water system at Balmoral in the North Sea. The largest
of these was three barrels (2011: 5.4 barrels). The total volume of spills amounted to 0.8 tonnes (2011: 2.7 tonnes);
100 per cent (2011: 90 per cent) of which was associated with spills at our production operations. There were
zero hydrocarbon spills at our drilling activities in 2012. We maintain oil spill contingency plans for each of our
operations and have ongoing contracts with oil spill response specialists to provide support in the unlikely
event of a major incident. Two other chemical spills occurred at our drilling operations in 2012 (2011: four
spills) totalling 0.02 barrels and 0.002 tonnes (2011: 1.3 tonnes). Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  39
It also includes the need to: 
• maintain timely, constructive and transparent ongoing engagement with all stakeholders;
• treat neighbours with respect and understanding, acknowledging community governance and seeking
free and informed consent prior to initiating operations that have a potentially significant social impact
on the community;
• work to achieve a net positive socio-economic impact on local communities, promoting opportunities
which enhance sustainable benefit;
• support the socio-economic sustainability and wellbeing of communities through local procurement and
other engagement with local business;
• invest in well-planned social projects that support the development priorities of host communities and
governments, and seek to ensure that these are implemented in a way that leads to enduring benefit;
• provide fair and adequate compensation for any losses for which we are liable;
• provide local communities access to appropriate grievance mechanisms; and
• encourage joint venture partners to adopt the principles in this policy. 
This Community Investment Policy is supported by a community investment management system that is
aligned with IPIECA standards and that facilitates the systematic identification, management, evaluation and
budgeting of disbursements and engagements in host countries. The procedures in this system have been
available to local business units via our business management system since late 2010.
No non-compliances with this policy were reported in 2012.
Increased community investment in 2012
All of our operations are supported by local community engagement and development programmes.
In 2012, Premier disbursed a total of US$674,000 on charitable donations and community projects (2011:
US$427,000). Approximately 40 per cent (2011: 30 per cent) of this was disbursed in Indonesia on long-
standing community and environmental projects. The progressive increase in our community investment
reflects the inclusion of charitable donations from our London, Norway and Singapore offices, as well as our
more mature operations in country. We expect these investments to increase as Premier develops new
upstream production operations in Indonesia, Vietnam, the North Sea and the Falkland Islands.

OUR REVISED COMMUNITY INVESTMENT POLICY RECOGNISES THE VALUE
OF BUILDING POSITIVE EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH
COMMUNITIES, GOVERNMENTS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS (NGOs),

Directors’ Report: Governance The company is required to make certain statements relating to the way it is governed as laid down in the UK Corporate
Governance Code (the Code). This report describes the manner in which the company has applied the main principles of
governance set out in the Code and complied with the Code provisions. It is the Board’s view that the company has fully
complied with the Code throughout 2012. While the Board supports the value of the Code, it does not believe that good
governance can be defined merely in terms of compliance with a set of rules. 
The Board is committed to high standards of governance and aims to create a culture which demands the same commitment
and performance in all our business activities. This is enshrined in our Code of Conduct which was updated and rolled out to our
employees in 2011.
The Board 
The role of the Board 
One major purpose of the Board is to ensure that the company’s strategic objectives are properly pursued and that the major
business risks are actively monitored and managed. This goes beyond regulatory compliance and puts the interests of our
shareholders as the Board’s primary focus.
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditures,
the overall group debt and equity structure and consideration of significant financing matters. The Board has continued to focus
its efforts in 2012 on strategic issues which will create shareholder value, monitoring performance against agreed objectives and
planning future business opportunities.
Board composition
The Board of Directors comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive, four other executive directors and five independent non-
executive directors. Biographical details of each, including membership of Board committees are set out in the Board of
Directors section of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and the
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are laid out in the Remuneration Report.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Chairman’s role is part-time and he is a non-executive director. His key responsibility is the leadership of the Board, ensuring
its effectiveness in all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. Between Board meetings the Chairman is responsible for
ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the Board/Executive relationship. This is effected through meetings, as well as
contact with other Board members, shareholders, joint venture partners and host governments. The Chief Executive is
responsible for the operational management of the business, developing strategy in consultation with the Board and then
implementing such strategy. 
Non-executive directors 
The non-executive directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy and resources, including key
appointments and standards of conduct. The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to challenge
independently and constructively the performance of the executive management and to monitor the performance of the
management team in the delivery of the agreed objectives and targets. In meeting this responsibility, the Chairman and the
non-executive directors meet periodically without the executive directors present, and the non-executive directors meet once
a year without the Chairman.
We require that our non-executive directors are free from any relationship or circumstances that could materially interfere with
the exercise of their independent judgement. The Board considers each of the non-executive directors to be independent in
character and judgement. 
Non-executive directors are appointed for a specified term of three years subject to annual re-election and to Companies Act
provisions relating to the removal of a director. The terms and conditions of their appointment are made available for
inspection. All non-executive directors undertake that they will have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively
and any significant commitments are disclosed to the Board prior to appointment. Changes to such commitments are disclosed
to the Board on an ongoing basis.

Senior independent director 
Mr Joe Darby is the company’s senior independent non-executive director. He is available to shareholders who have concerns
that cannot be resolved through discussion with the Chairman or Chief Executive.
Appointments and development 
Premier is an international business which has to manage a variety of political, technical and commercial risks. It is therefore
important that the Board contains the appropriate mix of skills and experience to meet these challenges. To this end, the
Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board
with regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary. In selecting new directors, the Committee prepares a description
of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.
How the Board operates
The Board meets at least eight times each year and in addition a regular update conference call takes place in the months when
no formal meeting is scheduled. The agenda for each Board meeting is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief
Executive and the Company Secretary. Board members receive a monthly report of the company’s activities which incorporates
an update on progress against objectives and the management of business risks. 
The Board has a formal schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board, a copy of which can be found on the company’s website
(www.premier-oil.com). The schedule is reviewed by the Board regularly. Key matters reserved are the consideration and
approval of: 
Corporate Strategy • Overall direction and strategy of the business
• New country and/or business entry
• Acquisition or disposal of interests 
Finance • Group debt and equity structure
• Budget
Expenditure • Major capital expenditure and budgets 
• Development plans and projects
• Major acquisition 
Risk Management • Recognising high impact business risks and risk mitigating strategies

Environment and Security (HSES)
Corporate Governance • The group’s corporate governance and compliance arrangements
Succession planning • Appointment and removal of directors and officers of the Board
and appointments • Appointment and removal of external auditor, brokers and advisers to 
the company 
Delegated authorities 
Board committees
The Board has established Audit and Risk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Each committee has formal terms of
reference approved by the Board which can be found on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). The Company Secretary
provides advice and support to the Board and all Board committees. Board committees are authorised to engage the services
of external advisers as they deem necessary.

Notes:
1. There were six scheduled meetings of the Remuneration Committee during the year. The remaining meeting (only attended by Ms I J Hinkley and
Mr J Darby) was called to approve the detail of arrangements approved in principle by a prior scheduled meeting of the Remuneration Committee. 
Executive Committee and management structure
The Board has delegated the day-to-day running of the group to the Chief Executive who has established an Executive
Committee (EXCO) to assist him in this role.
During the year the structure of EXCO was enhanced with the creation of three new roles:
• The role of Director, Business Units was created to manage performance of all Business Units and ensure coordination with
the functions. The creation of this role has removed the need for a layer of management at the regional business unit level;
• The role of Strategy and Commercial Manager was created to ensure that the group’s longer term strategic needs are
properly addressed; and
• The role of Corporate Services Director was created to bring together a number of the critical service functions.
The responsibilities of EXCO include the development of group strategy for approval by the Board, portfolio management and
the delivery of performance against the targets set by the Board. 
Delegation of authority 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the group as part of corporate accounting and through an authorisation
manual which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures. This manual
was updated in 2012 to reflect the new organisational structure and the increased size of the group.
Board performance evaluation
The Board believes that there is benefit in the periodic involvement of an independent external facilitator in the annual Board
evaluation process as this brings independent perspective. It has been the Board’s practice to engage such an external
facilitator every two years and in normal circumstances an externally facilitated evaluation would have taken place in 2012.
However, as the Board spent considerable time on strategic issues in 2012, it was decided that an external evaluation will be of
more value next year when the new strategy and organisation have bedded down and thus an internal evaluation process was
carried out in 2012.
The Board and Committee evaluations were facilitated by the Chairman. The evaluation comprised a series of questions on
major issues which were used as the basis for the one-to-one interviews by the Chairman with all directors. The interviews
covered a number of key areas including strategy, succession planning, Board size and composition, the roles and
responsibilities of the Board and its Committees, risk management and the relationship between the Board and management.
The results of the reviews were considered by the Chairman and the Committee chairmen and were then discussed with the
relevant Committees and collectively by the Board as a whole. 
The performance of individual non-executive directors was evaluated by the Chairman, with input from the Committee chairmen
and the other directors. The performance of the Chief Executive and other executive directors was evaluated by the Chairman
and non-executive directors. 
No major issues arose from the evaluation process and the directors have concluded that the Board and its committees operate
effectively. Recommendations were made to further enhance the performance and effectiveness of the Board and a process of
continuous improvement led by the Chairman is in place.
44 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (continued) Induction, information and support 
New directors receive a full induction to the company. This consists of information covering the operations of the Board as well
as meetings with the Board, Chief Executive and other executive directors. All non-executives have direct contact with the
company’s senior management between Board meetings and also visit the company’s operations in order to familiarise
themselves with its activities and to meet and engage with staff. Shareholders are given the opportunity to meet with new
directors upon request or at the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) following their appointment. The company has directors’
and officers’ liability insurance in place, and details of the policy are given to new directors on appointment. Formal procedures
are in place to enable individual Board members to take independent advice where appropriate. 
Conflicts of interest
A director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the company. Formal procedures are in place to ensure the Board’s powers of
authorisation of conflicts or potential conflicts of interest of directors are operated effectively. The Board determined that during
2012 these procedures were enforced and adhered to appropriately.
Risk management and internal controls in Premier
The corporate governance process in Premier is designed to determine the nature and level of risk that the company is willing
to take in pursuit of its strategy and to ensure that any risks taken are soundly managed and that the system of internal controls
is effective. Any system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial
irregularities will be detected or that the risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. 
Business management system
Internal controls within Premier are governed by the Business Management System (BMS). This system is composed of the
policies, standards, procedures, processes and guidelines for every function required to carry out Premier’s business including
Risk, HSES, Corporate Social Responsibility, Operations, Exploration, Business Development, Finance and other business
support services. Corporate group functional management systems are complemented by local management systems within
the business units which are designed to supplement corporate policies, standards, procedures, processes and guidelines with
those specifically required in order to operate and manage the business under local conditions and in compliance with local
laws and regulations.
The BMS is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to meet our business objectives. The effectiveness
of the BMS is a function of both the adequacy of the system and compliance with the system. Premier’s audit and review
programme includes specific scope to review adequacy of and compliance by component business unit and functional
management systems at appropriate regular intervals. 
The annual cycle of monitoring in Premier culminates in the completion of declarations by business unit and functional
management confirming compliance with the group’s BMS as well as identifying enhancements as part of a continuous process
for improvement of the effectiveness of management systems.
Risk management
Premier believes that risk management is just part of good management which leads to quality decision making and
achievement of targets for growth of the business. The risk management process is central to Premier’s BMS. 
Since the appointment of a Group Audit and Risk Manager in 2010, Premier’s risk management system has been further
developed in accordance with the risk management principles and guidelines of ISO 31000 (Risk Management – Principles and
Guidelines). The processes developed by the company cover all key elements of ISO 31000:

Core process Risk management (continued)
In early 2012, Det Norske Veritas (DNV) carried out an assessment of the extent to which Premier’s risk management system
is aligned with ISO 31000 and found that Premier had a well structured system of risk management that was strongly aligned.
The core process for risk management lies at the heart of the system framework:
This core process is used to manage the spectrum of risks which Premier face from strategic, geopolitical and other external
risks to operational, financial and organisational risk.
The context for risk management is established by development and communication of strategy, growth targets, team
performance deliverables and KPIs. 
A systematic process for identification and assessment of risk is undertaken across the company business units and functions.
Regular workshops are undertaken with input from independent consultants with specialist knowledge and from dialogue with
our partners to assist with risk identification and assessment, and risks are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that new risks or
exposures as a result of changes in the business or the business environment are captured. 
A standard matrix of impact versus likelihood is used to assess risks at all levels in the organisation. Appropriate consideration is
given to risk dependency and amalgamation of similar specific risks across the organisation. Risks are categorised according to
a scale of Major, Medium, Minor and escalated to the appropriate level.
Risk treatment includes risk acceptance or tolerance and active risk reduction measures. Risk appetite objectives are defined
and action plans are implemented. Particular attention is given to safety and environmental factors to ensure that residual risks
are at a level that is as low as reasonably practical. 
The status of risks and progress with risk treatment plans are monitored continuously and reviewed periodically via
performance reviews, workshops, audits and risk assessments.
The architecture of the organisation provides the framework for defining the accountability and responsibility for risk
identification and management and links the Board and Audit and Risk Committee to the Executive Committee and functional
and business unit management structure and enables risks to be escalated and managed at the appropriate level. The Group
Audit and Risk Manager is responsible for the risk management system and the overall running of the process. 
The risk protocols are the policy, procedures and processes documented as part of the risk management system and key tools
used in the process. The corporate risk register is the primary tool for risk management in Premier. The register is a web-based
tool which is updated at regular intervals. The register facilitates recording of functional and business unit risks, together with
their assessment, definition of existing and new treatment plans for control and mitigation and assignment of responsibility at
the appropriate level in the organisation.
A cycle of continuous improvement to the risk management system within the organisation is adopted and regularly reviewed
with both the Executive Committee via regional and functional performance reviews and the Audit and Risk Committee. 
As already noted, Premier’s risk management process has been developed significantly over the past three years in accordance
with the risk management principles and guidelines of ISO 31000. Initiatives are in hand to further embed risk management in
the group’s culture and business processes.

Audit and review
The effective operation of internal control procedures is reviewed by planned audits. An annual programme of audit and review
is agreed between functional and business unit management and approved by Audit and Risk Committee. The programme
adopts a risk based focus and includes audit of management system effectiveness and control as well as targeting key
operational, financial and organisational delivery milestones.
A process of business control reviews has been developed and implemented across the group. This process is designed, inter
alia, to provide assurance to the Board that Premier is embedding effective risk management into its operations. Significant
findings from each review are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. A rolling three-year plan to cover all operations 
is in place. 
In addition, where the company is the operator, audits of joint venture operations are carried out by our joint venture partners.
Where one of our partners is the operator, we participate in audits of these joint venture partners.
The Business Management System, risk management processes and programme of audits and reviews provide the Board with
reasonable assurance that appropriate controls are in place to provide effective management of business risks and to safeguard
the group’s assets from inappropriate use or from loss and fraud. 
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given significant attention. Extensive information about the group’s activities is provided in
the Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Interim Report, Trading Updates and Interim Management Statements, all of
which are available to shareholders. There is regular dialogue with institutional investors through meetings, presentations and
conferences, general presentations to analysts and investors for the full-year and half-yearly results (which are broadcast live via
the company’s website) as well as other ad hoc investor events. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, who are
the directors primarily responsible for dealing with shareholders, ensure that other members of the Board receive full reports of
these discussions. The company’s website (www.premier-oil.com) also provides detailed information on the group’s activities.
In accordance with current regulations, the company uses its website as its default method of publication for statutory
documents to reduce printing costs and help benefit the environment. All shareholders are offered the choice of receiving
shareholder documentation, including the Annual Report, electronically or in paper format, as well as the choice of submitting
proxy votes either electronically or by post. All new shareholders receive hard copies of statutory documents until they elect, or
are deemed to have elected, otherwise.
The company promotes the use of online shareholder services at www.premier-oil-shares.com. On this website, shareholders are
able to access their shareholding and to update their address or submit queries on their account directly to the company’s
Registrars. Shareholders also have the ability to vote online prior to the 2013 AGM. The share portal also encourages
shareholders to register to receive communications by e-mail, rather than by post, thus further reducing the number of
documents printed and distributed. Shareholders who have registered receive an e-mail notifying them when the company has
added a statutory document to its website. For each new registration processed, the company will donate £1 to PURE the Clean
Planet Trust, a UK charity dedicated to combating climate change.
The company has posted guidelines on its website, advising shareholders of how to recognise and deal with potential share
scams. Shareholders are advised to be extremely wary of any unsolicited advice or offers, and to only deal with financial services
firms that are authorised by the FSA. More information can be found in the Shareholder Information section of the Investors
area of the company’s website: www.premier-oil.com. 
Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and the business of the group are welcomed and are dealt
with in a timely manner. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM to discuss the progress of the group.
By order of the Board
S C Huddle
Company Secretary
20 March 2013 
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  47 As Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee it is my responsibility to ensure that the
Committee is rigorous and effective in its role of monitoring:
• the integrity of the company’s financial statements, and other formal announcements
relating to the company’s financial performance and the significant financial
reporting judgements they contain;
• the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems, including the
results of the programme of reviews of these systems and management’s response to
the review findings;
• the effectiveness and objectivity of the company’s Group Audit and Risk function;
• the appropriateness of the company’s relationship with the external auditor and the
effectiveness and objectivity of the audit process;
• the enforcement of the company’s code of conduct and the adequacy and security of
its whistleblowing procedure.
The terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board, and are available on
the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). Throughout 2012 the Committee consisted of myself, Joe Darby and Michel
Romieu all of whom are independent non-executive directors. The Board is satisfied that the membership of the Committee
meets the requirement for recent and relevant financial experience.
The meetings of the Committee are normally attended by the Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the Corporate
Services Director, the Group Audit and Risk Manager and representatives of the external auditor. The Company Secretary acts
as secretary to the Committee. Other executive directors or senior managers are required to attend when significant risk
management or control issues relating to their area of responsibility are considered by the Committee.
The Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that action or
improvement is needed, and make recommendations on the steps to be taken.
Meetings 
The Committee is required to meet at least three times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the company’s 
financial calendar.
Activities during the year
The Committee met four times in 2012 and has met twice in 2013 to date.
Its January and March 2012 meetings focused primarily on the status of the 2011 risk management and internal control reviews,
the 2012 plan for such reviews, and the 2011 full-year results and Annual Report and Financial Statements together with the
Committee’s annual review of the effectiveness of internal controls. At its June meeting the Committee considered the results of
the group internal control reviews carried out in the first half of the year, together with accounting and reporting issues relating
to the half-year results, and in August it reviewed the half-year results. In January 2013 it considered accounting and reporting
issues relating to the full-year results, reviewed the status of the 2012 risk management and internal control reviews, focusing on
the significant findings and actions, and reviewed and approved the 2013 audit plan for such reviews. In March it reviewed the
2012 full-year results, the Annual Report and Financial Statements and its annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal
controls to enable the Board to make its statement on internal control in the Corporate Governance Report.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
David Lindsell
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee Activities during the year (continued)
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were discharged as follows:
• The Committee reviewed the group’s risk management process designed to identify and mitigate the key risks facing the
group. There is an ongoing process of refinement and embedding of risk management best practice through the group 
in accordance with the principles and guidelines set out in ISO 31000. In particular, following the positive findings of the
external review carried out by Det Norske Veritas in early 2012, the Committee noted improved reporting of findings and
implementation of control improvements arising from reviews of the risk management and internal control systems. These
measures will continue to be developed and reported on to the Committee through 2013 and beyond. We intend during
2013 to invite DNV to re-validate their 2012 assessment and provide a progress report on the development and embedding
of risk management process in the group;
• The Corporate Risk Register (CRR) is the principal record of information about identified risks and the controls in place to
mitigate them, at departmental, asset/project, business unit and corporate function levels. Ongoing development and
refinement of the CRR during 2012 has enabled risks and mitigating processes to be described more completely and the
programme of financial and operational control reviews to be prioritised further against the most significant group business
risks as ranked in the CRR. CRR functionality has also been improved to allow risks assessed to have a pre-selected potential
impact (which can be measured in terms of effect on net present value or other severity of consequence) to be flagged and
referred automatically up to the next level(s) in the organisation, enabling more effective top-down monitoring of risk;
• Some 36 reviews of aspects of risk management and internal controls in operations and corporate functions were carried
out during the year. In reviewing the findings from these reviews, the Committee noted with approval that reporting had
become more directed towards the group’s major risks, allowing the Committee to focus on the key issues and challenges
facing the group. Recommendations to improve internal controls and/or to mitigate risks were agreed with the relevant
business unit or corporate function management after each review and progress in implementing the recommendations was
monitored by the Group Audit and Risk Manager;
• The group continues to use both Premier staff with the necessary expertise and experience and third-party specialists to
carry out the programme of review. In addition the group obtains independent confirmation of the effectiveness of internal
controls from a variety of external sources, including joint venture and governmental financial and operational audits; 
• The Committee reviewed the 2012 half-year and full-year financial results announcements and draft 2012 Annual Report 
and Financial Statements with the Finance Director and Group Financial Controller and considered the findings from the
external auditor’s review of the interim results and their audit of the 2012 financial statements. The Committee considered in
particular the significant assumptions, estimates and forecasts used in measuring items in the financial statements, including
future oil and gas price assumptions, oil and gas reserves’ estimates, fair valuation of assets for the EnCore acquisition and
decommissioning cost estimates, together with the financial statement items directly or indirectly affected by them such as
the recoverability of producing and exploration and evaluation assets, deferred tax assets and depletion, depreciation and
amortisation charges. The Committee noted that no significant deficiencies in the financial reporting system were identified
by the external auditor in the course of their audit. The Committee also reviewed the narrative in the Annual Report and
Financial Statements, in particular Section 1 (Directors’ Report: Performance), to assess whether the narrative is consistent
with the accounting information in the financial statements;
• the fee proposals for the external audit and half-yearly review were considered and agreed, and the Committee reviewed
the scope and fees for non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditor to satisfy itself that the assignments
concerned did not give rise to threats to the auditor’s independence and objectivity;
• the performance and effectiveness of the Committee was reviewed as part of the Board performance evaluation process.
The Committee was considered to be operating effectively and in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council
Guidance on Audit Committees; and 
• the Committee met with the external auditor in the absence of management in March and no matters of significance were
drawn to the Committee’s attention at this meeting.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  49 Group Audit and Risk function
We reported last year that the role of Group Audit and Risk Manager, which was created in 2010, had evolved to the point where
the Committee believed that the company had a function substantially equivalent to internal audit. The Group Audit and Risk
function has developed further during 2012 and the Committee now considers it to be fully equivalent to an internal audit
function. The Committee approves the appointment or termination of appointment of the Group Audit and Risk Manager.
External auditor
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was initially appointed as external auditor of the company in 2004.
The Committee regularly reviews the issue of the independence of the external auditor. This review considers the overall
relationship between the auditor and the company, based on feedback from the company’s finance team and from the auditor,
and the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the auditor, and takes account of the safeguards established by the
auditor against loss of audit independence, including rotation of the audit partner and other key members of the audit team.
The Committee believes that in certain limited circumstances non-audit work may be carried out by the external auditor. The
allocation of non-audit work is considered by reference to the company’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by the
auditor, which can be found on the company’s website. This policy is aimed at ensuring their continued independence.The use
of the external auditor for services relating to accounting systems or financial statements is not permitted, nor are various other
services which could give rise to conflicts of interest or other threats to the auditor’s objectivity that cannot be reduced to an
acceptable level by applying safeguards. The Committee believes that there is non-audit work such as certain assurance and
advisory services that may be best performed by the auditor as a result of their unique knowledge of the company. Any material
non-audit work of this nature requires approval by the Committee. The policy and overall fees paid to our auditor are also
reviewed on an annual basis by the Committee.
Deloitte are required to confirm to the Committee that they have both the appropriate independence and objectivity to allow
them to continue to serve the members of the company. The Committee also requires the external auditor to confirm that in
providing non-audit services, they comply with the Ethical Standards for auditor issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board.
This confirmation was received for 2012.
In accordance with the Ethical Standards for auditor, the audit engagement partner rotates at least every five years. The
current audit engagement partner is David Paterson who has been in the role since the auditor’s limited review of the 2012
half-year results.
The Committee reviews the expertise, performance and effectiveness of the auditor. On the basis of the reviews carried out,
the Committee recommended to the Board that it should propose the reappointment of Deloitte as the external auditor of
the company.

Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee
20 March 2013
50 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT (continued) Premier’s business may be impacted by various risks leading to failure to achieve strategic targets for growth, loss of financial
standing, cash flow and earnings, and reputation. Not all of these risks are wholly within the company’s control and the company
may be affected by risks which are not yet manifest or reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our personnel, assets, the communities
where we operate and with whom we interact and our reputation. Premier therefore has a comprehensive approach to risk
management as set out in more detail in the Corporate Governance Report.
A critical part of the risk management process is to assess the impact and likelihood of risks occurring so that appropriate
mitigation plans can be developed and implemented. Risk severity matrices are developed across Premier’s business to
facilitate assessment of risk. The specific risks identified by departments, project and asset teams, business units and corporate
functions are consolidated and amalgamated to provide an oversight of key risk factors at each level from operations through
business unit management to Executive Committee and Board level.
For all the known risks facing the business, Premier attempts to minimise the likelihood and mitigate the impact. According to
the nature of the risk, Premier may elect to take or tolerate risk, treat risk with controls and mitigating actions, transfer risk to
third parties or terminate risk by ceasing particular activities or operations. Premier has a zero tolerance to financial fraud or
ethics non-compliance, and ensures that HSES risks are managed to levels that are as low as reasonably practicable, whilst
managing exploration and development risks on a portfolio basis.
The key risk factors identified from this approach are represented in the matrix below and the accompanying table summarises
their potential impacts and our approach to managing them. The assessment of the impact and likelihood takes into account
the risk mitigation measures currently applied.

COMPANY RISK FACTORS (continued)
Key risk factor Risk detail How is it managed?
Health, safety,
environment and
security (HSES)
Major process safety incident or operational
accident, natural disasters, pandemics, social
unrest, civil war.
Consequences may include accidents
resulting in loss of life, injury and/or
significant pollution of the local environment,
destruction of facilities and disruption to
business activities.
Comprehensive HSES and operations
management systems including emergency
response and oil spill response capability and 
asset integrity.
Active security monitoring and management and
regular testing of business continuity plans.
Learning from company and third-party incidents.
Production and
development delivery
Uncertain geology and reservoir
performance leading to lower production
and reserves recovery. Availability of services
including FPSOs and rigs, availability of
technology and engineering capacity,
availability of skilled resources, maintaining
project schedules and costs as well as fiscal,
regulatory, political and other conditions
leading to operational problems and
production loss or development delay.
Consequences may include lower production
and/or recovery of reserves, production
delays, cost overruns and/or failure to fulfil
contractual commitments.
Geoscience and reservoir engineering
management systems, including rigorous
production forecasting and independent reserves
auditing processes.
Operations, development and project execution
management systems and cost controls together
with capable project teams.
Long-term development planning to ensure timely
access to FPSOs, rigs and other essential services.
Exploration success
and reserves addition
Failure to identify and capture acreage and
resource opportunities to provide a portfolio
of drillable exploration prospects and
sufficient development projects to achieve
reserves addition targets.
Consequences may be that specific
exploration programmes may fail to 
add reserves and hence value. Failure 
to negotiate access rights or close
transactions could slow growth of reserves
and production and lead to loss of
competitive advantage.
Strong portfolio management and alignment with
strategic growth targets. Appropriate balance
between growth by exploration and acquisition.
Exploration management systems including
comprehensive peer review with focus on
geologies in core areas we know well and in which
we can build a competitive advantage.
Focused mergers and acquisitions effort focusing
on geographical and technical areas aligned with
our strategy. Diligence in acquisition process and
post-acquisition integration to ensure targeted
returns.
Host government –
political and fiscal risks
Premier operates in some countries where
political, economic and social transition is
taking place or there are current sovereignty
disputes. Developments in politics, laws 
and regulations can affect our operations 
and earnings.
Consequences may include forced
divestment of assets; limits on production or
cost recovery; import and export restrictions;
international conflicts, including war, civil
unrest and local security concerns that
threaten the safe operation of company
facilities; price controls, tax increases and
other retroactive tax claims; expropriation of
property; cancellation of contract rights; and
increase in regulatory burden. It is difficult to
predict the timing or severity of these
occurrences or their potential impact.
Premier’s portfolio includes operations in both low
and higher risk environments. Premier actively
monitors the local situation and has business
continuity plans in each area which can be
activated depending on predefined levels of alert.
Premier strives to be a good corporate citizen
globally, and fosters reputation by strong and
positive relationships with government and
communities where we do business. Premier
engages in respectful industry-wide lobby and
sustainable corporate responsibility and
community investment programmes. Rigorous
adherence to Premier’s business ethics policy and
code of conduct.
Continuous monitoring of the external
environment for emerging risks to the business. Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  53
Key risk factor Risk detail How is it managed?
Commodity price
volatility
Oil and gas prices are affected by global
supply and demand and price can be subject
to significant fluctuations. Factors that
influence these include operational issues,
natural disasters, weather, political instability,
or conflicts and economic conditions or
actions by major oil-exporting countries.
Price fluctuations can affect our business
assumptions and can effect investment
decisions and financial capability.
Oil and gas hedging programmes to underpin our
financial strength and capacity to fund our future
developments and operations.
Premier investment guidelines ensure that our
development programmes are robust to downside
sensitivity price scenarios.
Organisational
capability
Risk that the capability of the organisation
is not adequate to deliver plans for strategic
growth. The capability of the organisation is
a function of both the strength of its human
resources and its business management
systems. Inadequate systems or lack of
compliance may lead to loss of value and
failure to achieve growth targets. Loss of
personnel to competitors, inability to attract
and retain quality human resources and
competency gaps could affect our
operational performance and delivery of
growth strategy.
Premier has created a competitive remuneration
and retention package including bonus and long-
term incentive plans to incentivise loyalty and 
good performance from the existing, highly 
skilled workforce.
Premier is continuing to strengthen its
organisational capability to achieve strategic
objectives. This includes resource planning,
competency development, training and
development programmes, succession planning
including leadership development.
Continuous strengthening of business
management systems and controls as appropriate
to the size and market position of the company.
Joint venture partner
alignment
Global operations in the oil and gas industry
are conducted in a joint venture environment.
There is a risk that joint venture partners are
not aligned in their objectives and drivers
and this may lead to inefficiencies and/or
delays. Many of our major projects are
operated by our joint venture partners and
our ability to influence our partners is
sometimes limited due to our small shares
in such ventures.
Due diligence and continuous and regular
engagement with partners in joint ventures in both
operated and non-operated projects. Premier
takes strategic acquisition opportunities where
appropriate to gain a greater degree of influence
and control.
Financial discipline and
governance
Risk that sufficient funds are not available to
finance the business. Risk of financial fraud.
Strong financial discipline and balance sheet.
Premier has an established financial management
system to ensure that it is able to maintain an
appropriate level of liquidity and financial capacity
and to manage the level of assessed risk
associated with the financial instruments. Premier
maintains access to capital markets through the
cycle. The management system includes policies
and a delegation of authority manual to reasonably
protect against risk of financial fraud in the group.
An insurance programme is put in place to reduce
the potential impact of the physical risks associated
with exploration and production activities. In
addition, business interruption cover is purchased
for a proportion of the cash flow from producing
fields. Cash balances are invested in short-term
deposits with minimum A credit rating banks, AAA
managed liquidity funds and A1/P1 commercial
paper, subject to Board approved limits. On behalf of the Nomination Committee, I am pleased to present our report in 
relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2012.
Composition and role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee meets under my chairmanship and, in addition to myself, comprises 
Joe Darby, Jane Hinkley, David Lindsell, Simon Lockett, Michel Romieu and David
Roberts. The Board considers the membership of the Committee to be in compliance
with the Code.
The role of the Committee includes:
• reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and making
recommendations to the Board with regard to any adjustments that are deemed
necessary. This requires an ongoing assessment of the appropriate skills-mix required
at Board level in light of the strategy of the company in the medium-term;
• responsibility for identifying and nominating candidates, subject to Board approval, to fill Board vacancies as and when they
arise and to prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment; and
• reviewing the development and leadership potential of senior executives below Board level and ensuring that appropriate
succession plans are in place for both Board and senior positions.
The Committee met once in 2012 to discuss and agree on:
• Management Succession – with emphasis on the new leadership development programme which was rolled out in the
organisation during the year and which is designed to develop the competence of our staff; and
• The Challenges Facing the Leadership of the Business - with emphasis on the need for good governance, clear
accountabilities and communication. These issues influenced discussions at the Board which resulted in organisational
changes in 2012, key elements of which are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report.

By order of the Board
S C Huddle
Company Secretary
20 March 2013 Dear fellow shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration
Report, for which we are seeking approval from shareholders at our Annual 
General Meeting. 
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that our remuneration policy serves
shareholder interests and closely reflects the group’ s business strategy. The Committee is
mindful of the need to demonstrate the link between remuneration and performance and
to incentivise its employees. T o this end, Premier operates a similar philosophy to pay
throughout the organisation and all employees, including executive directors, receive
awards under the same incentive schemes, thus ensuring group-wide focus on common
business goals.
During 2012, the Committee undertook a full review of the executive remuneration
arrangements at Premier, taking into account shareholder views from the 2011
consultation, the company’ s strategy, market practice and evolving best practice
guidelines. The review concluded that:
• The pay mix, being heavily weighted towards long-term variable elements, is in the best interests of shareholders as it ensures
a long-term focus, direct alignment with shareholders and a highly performance-oriented culture;
• The annual bonus, based on a corporate scorecard capturing financial, operational and strategic objectives, helps reward
shorter-term objectives key to achieving our long-term strategy;
• The Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) ensures alignment with shareholders, being based on both absolute and relative T otal
Shareholder Return (TSR), and measured over a total of six years;
• The significant deferral requirement of vested LTIP Equity Pool and LTIP Performance Share awards helps support staff
retention and lengthens the incentive time horizon;
• Against our comparators, total cash (i.e. salary plus bonus) for our executive directors is below market. The LTIP is geared to
provide the opportunity to achieve above market levels of pay only through exceptional sustained relative TSR performance
over six years; and
• The review of the company’ s underlying performance before LTIP payouts are finalised ensures that the impact of external
factors are taken into account where appropriate. The Committee reviews a range of measures, and not just those specified
in the plan, to ensure this assessment is robust. 
As a result of the review, the Committee concluded that the aims and structure of the remuneration packages are embodied in
the existing policy and therefore it remains appropriate for 2013. 
The LTIP is structured so as to reward both absolute and relative share price performance, thereby directly aligning the interests of
executives and shareholders. Over the 2010 LTIP cycle ending in December 2012, even though Premier’ s absolute share price
performance was positive (at 5.1 per cent p.a.), the LTIP Equity Pool threshold of 10 per cent p.a. was not met and consequently
no awards were earned for this element. Over the same period, however, Premier’ s relative performance against its sector peers
was strong (at just below upper quartile) and consequently 2010 LTIP Performance Share Awards and 2010 LTIP Matching Share
Awards will partially vest in early 2013 (at approximately 90 per cent and approximately 65 per cent of maximum respectively). As
detailed later in the report, the Committee also considered the underlying performance of Premier over the three-year period
and concluded that the performance merits the awards made.
Remuneration issues across all sectors continue to be in the spotlight. T o stay ahead of requirements we have incorporated a
number of changes in this report consistent with the draft proposals that have been tabled by the Department for Business
Innovation & Skills (BIS) during 2012. However, as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting this year there will continue to
be a single advisory vote on this report. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank shareholders for their continuing support.
Yours sincerely
I J Hinkley

REMUNERATION REPORT
Jane Hinkley
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The company complied with the provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) regarding best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration. The
report has been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information. 
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee has reviewed
the company’s remuneration policy and concluded that the policy will not raise environmental, operational, social or governance
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour (e.g. one of the important factors in determining annual bonus
performance is the achievement of specific HSES targets). 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee currently comprises four non-executive directors and met six times during the year. The members of the
Committee and their attendance are summarised below:

Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  59 Remuneration policy for all employees, including executive directors
The company’s remuneration policy for all employees is to provide remuneration packages which reward them fairly and
responsibly for their contributions. Remuneration packages are intended to be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and
motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the group’s objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value. The
Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid in respect of comparable positions in similar companies. The
Committee is informed of pay and conditions throughout the group, including how company-wide pay tracks against the
market. When awarding salary increases to executive directors, the Committee takes account of the salary increases across 
the group. 
While all employees participate in the company’s incentive structures, the package of executive directors in particular is
structured such that the greater part of total remuneration is delivered through long-term share-based incentives to ensure
maximum alignment with shareholders. These schemes provide a clear link between pay and performance ensuring that
superior remuneration is paid only if superior performance is delivered over a six-year period.
Remuneration in 2012 
The table below reports a single figure for total remuneration for each executive director for 2012, calculated in accordance with
the methodology set out in the draft regulations issued by BIS in 2012. The value of LTIP awards shown here is different to what
has been disclosed under the Directors’ emoluments table on page 71. The table below shows the value of LTIP awards for
which the performance period ended during 2012, but will be released to participants at a future date. The Directors’
emoluments table on page 71 shows the value of LTIP awards that were released to participants during the year.

2. LTIP awards reflect an estimated value of the 2010 Performance Share Awards (PSA) and 2010 Matching Share Awards. On 19 March 2013, the
Committee determined that the 2010 PSA and 2010 Matching Share Award will vest, as soon as the company enters an open period for dealing in
shares. An average share price over the three months to 31 December 2012 (£3.45) has been used to calculate the value of the LTIP awards.

Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  61 Executive director pay mix
The charts below illustrate the potential reward opportunities for executive directors for ‘low’, ‘median’ and ‘stretch’
performance (see below for assumptions on performance scenarios) based on long-term incentive grants made in 2012.
Remuneration is significantly geared towards performance-oriented pay, with particular emphasis on long-term performance.
For example, at ‘median’ performance approximately 54 per cent of the CEO’s remuneration package is delivered through
variable components, rising to approximately 90 per cent at ‘stretch’ performance. The maximum value is delivered only if upper
quartile TSR is delivered against sector peers over six years, with a requirement for upper decile performance in the last three
years. The charts also include the actual remuneration delivered to the executive directors in respect of performance for 2012,
for comparison. 
62 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
REMUNERATION REPORT (continued)
‘Low’ performance assumes: nil payout under all incentives. 
‘Median’ performance assumes: bonus payout of 60 per cent of salary,
LTIP Equity Pool based on 1 per cent of the change in market value and
share price appreciation of 10 per cent per annum compound, LTIP
Performance Shares vesting at 25 per cent, and LTIP Matching Award
vesting at 62.5 per cent. 
‘Stretch’ performance assumes all bonus, Performance Shares and
Matching Awards vest in full and equity pool share price growth of
20 per cent per annum compound. The value of all long-term incentives
is their net present value.

A G Lodge Exploration Director 330,000 345,000 4.5
The above increases are lower than the average increases across the group’s operations of five per cent.
The Committee will continue to review salaries annually to ensure they remain appropriate, particularly given the current highly
competitive talent market in this sector and the fact that it is critical to the company’s future success that we retain key talent. Annual bonus scheme 
In line with previous years, executive directors participate in non-pensionable bonus arrangements. The Committee sets yearly
targets on the basis of a balanced scorecard comprising KPIs and other corporate objectives. Payout is determined with
reference to the balanced scorecard after careful assessment by the Committee and subject to the Committee’s discretion
based on a broader assessment of overall company performance. Bonuses for executive directors are subject to a maximum 
of 100 per cent of base salary. 
For executive directors and other senior management, any annual bonus earned above 50 per cent of salary is deferred in
shares for three years. Deferred bonus shares remain subject to a ‘bad leaver’ provision. Annual bonus awards are subject to a
claw-back provision in the event of a material misstatement of the company’s financial results, gross misconduct or error in the
calculation of performance conditions.
2012 annual bonus outcome 
In assessing 2012 performance, the Committee has taken into account the various measures of the five criteria below, against
specific targets. Targets were set at the beginning of 2012 and designed to be stretching but achievable. The exact targets
are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, however performance in relation to threshold, base and stretch levels 
is detailed: 
Performance achievement
Between
Below threshold Between base At or above
Metric Measures threshold and base and stretch stretch
Health, Safety, Environment Group Total Recordable Injury
and Security (HSES) Rate (TRIR) 3
Production Daily average (mboepd) 3
Exit rate (mboepd) 3

Exploration Risked prospective resources 
added (mmboe) 3
Finding costs for 2C + 2P 
resource adds ($/boe) 3
Reserves replacement 3
Finance Net operating cash flow 3
Business development Strategic acquisitions 3
In addition to the achievement against specific targets, the Committee considered the wider overall company performance 
and awarded annual bonuses of 45 per cent of salary to the executive directors.
The 2013 annual bonus structure is broadly similar to that used for 2012, but with NAV growth now included. In addition, a new
element based on personal objectives will be included, with a 20 per cent weighting. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
All employees participate in the company’s LTIP , approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM, thereby encouraging a focus
throughout the company on longer-term performance and alignment with shareholders. 
The LTIP is structured to reinforce the delivery of strong share price growth and relative stock market out-performance over the
long-term. Performance is assessed over a minimum of three years, and over six years including the matching scheme. Vesting
is based on a combination of the absolute change in the company’s equity value per share and the company’s relative Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) (i.e. share price plus dividends) performance against peers. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the choice of performance measures and in particular, the sensitivity of TSR to
changes in oil price. The Committee concluded that TSR remains an appropriate performance measure as it rewards the
delivery of the company’s strategy and also aligns management’s interests with those of shareholders. Absolute TSR captures
the absolute return delivered to shareholders and relative TSR measures performance on a relative basis, thereby helping to
negate the impact of uncontrollable factors such as oil price movements on the reward delivered through the LTIP . 
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  63 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (continued)
To optimise the link between reward and performance, the plan allows the Committee certain discretions on determining the
outcome of the LTIP . Based on its assessment of the company’s underlying financial and operational performance, the
Committee may: 
• reduce the size of the equity pool;
• allow for the equity pool to be fully funded when growth in equity value exceeds 20 per cent p.a.;
• lift the cap of 100 per cent of salary under the equity pool;
• decide whether or not to grant matching shares; and
• reduce the level of vesting for performance shares and matching shares.
In assessing the underlying performance of the company the Committee has previously considered performance against the
five metrics noted below, which are specified in the plan. As a result of the review undertaken in 2012, the Committee has
broadened the ‘inputs’ used to determine whether the TSR performance is reflective of the company’s underlying financial and
operational performance and from 2013 will also consider other measures, such as Net Asset Value per share, finding and
development costs per barrel, delivery of the strategy and relative TSR.
Underpin measures
Return on invested capital 
Reserves replacement 
Operating cash flow 
Earnings per share growth 
Health and safety record 
Further, all LTIP awards are subject to claw-back in the event of a material misstatement of the company’s financial results, gross
misconduct or material error in the calculation of the performance conditions. 
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements:
Equity Pool Awards: vest after a three-year performance period and are based on a share of a pool which is subject to
annualised growth in the company’s equity value per share; the vested award is delivered in
shares and 50 per cent of the vested award is deferred for a further three years.
Performance Share Awards: vest after a three-year performance period based on the company’s TSR relative to a comparator
group of international oil and gas companies; 50 per cent of the vested award is deferred for a
further three years.
Matching Awards: Deferred Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards are eligible for a Matching Award of
up to 2.5 times the number of shares deferred, vesting after a further three years, based on the

The structure of each element of the 2012 LTIP is described in more detail below and it is the Committee’s intention that awards
granted in 2013 will also be based on this structure. 
64 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
REMUNERATION REPORT (continued) Equity Pool Award 
The value of the LTIP Equity Pool is based on the growth in the company’s equity value per share over the performance period
(see below). If the company’s compound annualised growth is equal to 10 per cent per annum, one per cent of the growth will
be credited to the LTIP Equity Pool. For growth of 20 per cent per annum or more, 2.5 per cent of the growth will be credited.
For growth of more than 10 per cent but less than 20 per cent, between one per cent and 2.5 per cent of the growth will be
credited on a straight-line basis. All employees are eligible to participate in the LTIP Equity Pool.The value of an entitlement is
calculated at the end of the performance period and is delivered in shares. Allocations awarded under the 2012 LTIP Equity Pool
are detailed on page 75. 
Equity Pool funding schedule
Performance Share Award
Performance Share Awards vest subject to the company’s three-year TSR relative to a comparator group of oil and gas
companies. The oil sector comparators have been selected on the basis of their similarity to Premier with regard to several
factors, including business mix and geographic location, and are detailed on page 66.
Matching Award
For executive directors and senior management, 50 per cent of the shares vesting from the LTIP Equity Pool Award and LTIP
Performance Share Award are subject to compulsory deferral over three years and, subject to the Committee’s discretion, are
eligible for a potential match of up to 2.5 : 1 dependent on the TSR performance of the company against the same comparator
group used for coterminous LTIP Performance Share Awards as detailed on page 66.

LTIP vesting outcomes in 2012
The 2010 LTIP award cycles completed their three-year performance periods on 31 December 2012 as follows:
• 2010 LTIP Equity Pool cycle: over the performance period, the company’ s market capitalisation increased from £1,341.7 million
to £1,822.7 million, equivalent to growth in equity value per share of 5.1 per cent per annum (after including a £250.0 million
adjustment to reflect the increase in the company’s share capital as a result of the acquisition of EnCore in January 2012).
As a result, awards under the 2010 Equity Pool will not vest as the threshold was not met; 
• 2010 LTIP Performance Share cycle: over the performance period the company’s TSR relative to its peers was between the
median and upper quartile, warranting vesting of 89.9 per cent; and
• 2010 Matching Award cycle (matched over deferred shares granted in 2010 under the AEP 2007 award): over the
performance period the company’s TSR relative to its peers was between the median and upper quartile, warranting a
matching ratio of 1.64 : 1.
The Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is reflective of the underlying performance of the company. In assessing the
underlying performance of the company the Committee took into account, amongst other factors, the company’s earnings per
share growth, cash flow, return on invested capital, reserve replacement and health and safety record as shown below.

On 19 March 2013, the Committee determined that the 2010 Performance Share Award (PSA) and 2010 Matching Share Award
will vest as soon as the company enters an open period for dealing in shares. For the executive directors, 50 per cent of the PSA
will be released immediately on vesting, with the remaining 50 per cent deferred for three years. The LTIP Matching Shares will
be released immediately on vesting. The number of shares to vest in 2013 for each of the executive directors is shown in the
table below:

Note: 
1. Owned outright includes SIP Partnership shares, SIP Matching shares held for more than three years, and any shares owned by a spouse.
Formal shareholding guidelines exist which encourage the executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee
to retain no less than 50 per cent of the net value of shares vesting under the company’s deferred bonus and long-term
incentive arrangements until such time as they have achieved a holding worth 100 per cent of salary (200 per cent for the CEO).
As the graph below shows, all the executive directors hold shares with a value substantially higher than these threshold
shareholding requirements.
Shareholdings at 31 December 2012 against guidelines
Note:
Includes value of deferred awards under the annual bonus, Asset and Equity Plan and LTIP (where performance conditions have been achieved and such
awards are subject to a holding period). The value of shareholdings is based on the closing price of a Premier share on 31 December 2012 (£3.365).
Sourcing of shares and dilution limits
Awards under all the company’s share schemes may be met using a combination of market purchases, financed by the company
through the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust, and newly-issued shares. The company complies with the Association of
British Insurers’ recommended guidelines on shareholder dilution through employee share schemes: awards under the group’s
discretionary schemes which may be satisfied by new issue shares must not exceed five per cent of the company’s issued share
capital in any rolling 10-year period, and the total of all awards satisfied via new issue shares under all plans must not exceed 
10 per cent of the company’s issued share capital in any rolling 10-year period.

Executive directors’ contracts of service and exit payments policy
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the company are as follows: 
Unexpired Potential
term of termination
Director Contract Date Notice Period contract payment
S C Lockett 09.12.03 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
R A Allan 09.12.03 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
A R C Durrant 01.07.05 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
N Hawkings 23.03.06 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
A G Lodge 20.04.09 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months’ notice in writing by either party, in accordance
with current market practice. In such an event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to
one year’s remuneration based on base salary and benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period. In line with
normal market practice, an individual may receive an annual bonus for the proportion of a financial year worked before
cessation of employment but there will be no right to any bonus for any period of notice not worked. There are provisions for
termination with less than 12 months’ notice by the company in certain circumstances. If such circumstances were to arise, the
executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the
termination. The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive
director and would consider each case on an individual basis. 
In the event of an executive leaving the company the LTIP rules provide for vesting in certain circumstances, as follows:
• If the executive leaves as a ‘good leaver’ (e.g. through retirement, death, injury, disability, redundancy, or for any other
reason if the Committee decides) unvested awards will vest on the normal vest date (or earlier if the Committee decides) to
the extent that any performance conditions had been satisfied. For awards other than those deferred into the LTIP Matching
plan, there will also be a pro-rata reduction in the value of the awards to take into account the proportion of the vesting
period not served; and
• If the executive leaves for any other reason (i.e. is a ‘bad leaver’) unvested awards will lapse.
In the event of a change of control of the company, unvested LTIP awards will vest immediately to the extent that any
performance conditions had been satisfied. For awards other than those deferred into the LTIP Matching plan, there will also be
a pro-rata reduction in the value of the awards to take into account the proportion of the vesting period not served.
External appointments
Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Board’s approval
is sought. Mr A R C Durrant was appointed a non-executive director of Greenergy Fuels Holdings Limited on 1 October 2012
and has retained associated fees for 2012 of £10,000. As a result of the acquisition of EnCore, the company has a 29.65 per cent
interest in Egdon Resources plc (Egdon) and is entitled to board representation. Mr A G Lodge was appointed to the board of
Egdon as a non-executive director on 9 March 2012 and has elected to donate his fees to several charities (2012: £12,346). 
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  69 Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective for a period of three years (subject to annual
reappointment by the members in the Annual General Meeting), all of which have a notice period of three months. There are no
arrangements under which any non-executive director is entitled to receive compensation upon the early termination of his or
her appointment.

The company’s Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the
Board within the limits set by the shareholders. Fees for non-executives are reviewed at least every two years, having regard to
the size of the company and the time commitments of the non-executives. The Board reviewed the fees of the non-executives,
including the Chairman, and decided to increase them for 2013 by six per cent, on the basis that the next review will not be
effective until 1 January 2015. The increase is broadly in line with comparable businesses. The fees for 2012 and 2013 are set

  Pension benefits include non-bonusable salary supplements and target funding payments which are paid direct to the executive. Pension contributions
are paid into a pension scheme and therefore are excluded from the emoluments section in the above table. Full details of pension arrangements for
each director are given on page 72 of this report. 
** Shares vested and realisable is the sum of the value of various share awards (as at the date of vesting) which have vested during 2012. These relate to
the deferred annual bonus, LTIP and AEP matching shares, based on performance periods stretching back as far as 2007 in some cases.
† Total remuneration receivable is the sum of the salary, annual bonus, cash-based benefits, pension benefits, pension contributions and shares vested
which became realisable in the year (at the share price on the date of vesting of the award).
1. Mr S C Lockett was paid a non-bonusable salary supplement of £55,185, and a target funding payment of £146,928 as part of his pension arrangements. 
2. Mr R A Allan was paid a non-bonusable salary supplement of £14,064, and a target funding payment of £102,839 as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr Allan received £175,186 of expatriate benefits in the year to 30 September 2012 and was also paid a non-pensionable and non-bonusable overseas
premium of £61,875, relating to his position in Singapore. The company deducted a hypothetical tax equivalent to UK tax rates on Mr Allan’s salary,
annual bonus and long-term incentive payments. This was offset against local Singapore tax due. As the maximum tax rate in Singapore is lower than in
the UK, the difference is retained by the company.
3. Mr A R C Durrant was paid a non-bonusable salary supplement of £63,264 and a target funding payment of £108,884 as part of his pension
arrangements.
4. Mr N Hawkings received a non-bonusable salary supplement of £57,996 and a target funding payment of £82,350 as part of his pension arrangements.
5. Mr A G Lodge sacrificed £8,499 of his salary into his pension scheme. He also received a non-bonusable salary supplement of £10,548 and a target
funding payment of £64,169 as part of his pension arrangements.

Note:
1. Relates to non-executive director fees for Mr J R W Orange, who retired from the Board in 2011.  Pension schemes 
The company operates a group personal pension plan in the UK together with a funded, registered, defined benefit pension
scheme, the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (the ‘Scheme’) which was closed to new members in 1997.
The Scheme provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of
inflation, or five per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed. In the
Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2012, this was set at £129,600, and will
increase to £137,400 for the year to 31 December 2013. 
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension
substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their
appointment as directors, not subject to the cap. The value of this target pension provision is made available at each director’s
option in the form of an enhanced level of pension contributions and/or a non-pensionable salary supplement. Regular reviews
are carried out to assess the extent to which the payments already made to each director are projected to be sufficient to
provide the accrued component of their target pension; where such reviews indicate a shortfall, the company provides an
additional, non-pensionable target funding payment.
In respect of 2012, Messrs A R C Durrant and N Hawkings elected to receive a salary supplement, whilst Messrs S C Lockett,
R A Allan and A G Lodge elected to receive a combination of pension contributions and a salary supplement.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge are members of the company’ s group personal pension plan whilst Mr S C Lockett
is a member of the Scheme and also has a personal pension policy.
These payments by the company in respect of pension benefits are summarised below:

Scheme in respect of his membership thereof.

Notes:
1. The amounts of accrued pension under (a) and (c) represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
2. The transfer values under (b), (d) and (f) have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations
2008 (SI 2008/1050).
3. The increases under (e) are principally due to the additional pension accrued over the year. 
4. The amounts under (f) represent the increase in value of the directors’ benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the
year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits (as revalued by price inflation) less contributions by the
directors.
5. The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision; in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are
principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements. 
6. In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period
with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
7. Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions; none of the directors have elected to do so.
The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities:

Notes:
* On 29 March 2010, these awards were changed from conditional awards of shares to restricted shares. Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax
and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the awards, but the
amounts received from the sale remain subject to claw-back in the event of the participant leaving Premier other than as a ‘good leaver’. In the case of
Mr R A Allan, who was an expatriate and therefore not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares equal to the percentage tax rate that would have
applied had he been subject to UK income tax were withheld. These shares reverted to the Employee Benefit Trust and the company will pay any
overseas duties payable by Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to claw-back if Mr Allan leaves Premier
other than as a ‘good leaver’. The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the original
deferral period, and are forfeitable if the director leaves other than as a ‘good leaver’.
(a) Shares released from nominee account on 22 March 2012. 
(b) Shares released on 22 March 2012. The mid-market closing price on 22 March 2012 was 426.2p. 
Annual bonuses for the year-ended 31 December 2012 were awarded on 23 January 2013. Details of the bonuses awarded to
executive directors are given on page 63.

Notes:
1. There are no performance criteria for the Deferred Shares.
2. Matching Awards granted are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria based on TSR against a
comparator group of approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector. Full vesting requires upper decile performance.
Outstanding awards under previous long-term incentive arrangements
Asset and Equity Plan (AEP)
The AEP preceded the LTIP as the company’s main long-term incentive and expired in 2009. The AEP had two elements: the
Asset Pool and the Equity Pool. The value of the Asset Pool was based on the increase in the net asset value per share of the
company over a three-year period and the value of the Equity Pool was based on the increase in equity value per share of the
company over a three-year period. In both cases, no pool was created for growth (in asset value or share price) of less than 10
per cent per annum. At growth of 10 per cent per annum, the pools were funded by one per cent of the growth. The funding of
the pools was capped at 2.5 per cent of the growth at growth of 20 per cent per annum. The funding rate of the pools increased
on a straight-line basis between these two points. In addition, the vesting of awards was subject to the Committee being
satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company. 
The pools were allocated to eligible employees based on their pro-rata entitlement. 50 per cent of vested AEP awards were
released in shares at the end of the performance period. The remaining 50 per cent were deferred in shares over three years
and are eligible for a Matching Award of up to 2.5 : 1, dependant on the TSR performance of the company relative to a
comparator group of oil and gas companies (i.e. on the same basis as LTIP Matching Awards).

the percentage tax rate that would have applied had he been subject to UK income tax. These shares reverted to the Trust and the company will pay
any overseas duties payable by Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to claw-back if Mr Allan leaves
Premier other than as a ‘good leaver’. The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the
original deferral period, and are forfeitable if the director leaves other than as a ‘good leaver’.
1. There are no performance criteria for the Deferred Shares.
2. Matching Awards granted are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria based on TSR against a
comparator group of approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector. Full vesting requires upper decile performance.
3. Awards released net on 19 January 2012, as disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
4. Awards vested 19 January 2012, as disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The mid-market closing price on the date of vesting
was 425.4p. 
5. On 19 March 2013, the Committee determined that the 2010 Matching Award will vest as soon as the company enters an open period for dealing in
shares. Details of the anticipated vesting schedule for the 2010 Matching Award are given on page 67 of this report.

20 March 2013 80 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Group financial statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 – ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ -
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance; and
• make an assessment of the company’s and group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’ s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and group and enable them
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable international financial reporting framework, give a true
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in
the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2. the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  81
General information
Premier Oil plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the
registered office is Premier Oil plc, 4th Floor, Saltire Court, 20 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EN. The principal activities of the
company and its subsidiaries (the group) are oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea, Asia, the Falkland Islands,
Middle East, Africa and Pakistan.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars since that is the currency in which the majority of the group’s transactions
are denominated.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted, these have no material
impact on the group’s annual results:
• IAS 1 (amended) – ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’
• IAS 12 (amended) – ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’
• IAS 19 (revised) – ‘Employee Benefits’
• IFRS 7 (amended) – ‘Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets’
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the
European Union):
• IFRS 1 (amended) – ‘Government Loans’
• IFRS 7 (amended) – ‘Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
• IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’
• IFRS 10 – ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
• IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 – ‘Investment Entities (amended)’
• IFRS 11 – ‘Joint Arrangements’
• IFRS 12 – ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’
• IFRS 13 – ‘Fair Value Measurement’
• IAS 27 (revised) – ‘Separate Financial Statements’
• IAS 28 (revised) – ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
• IAS 32 (amended) – ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
• IFRIC 20 – ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’
Other than to expand certain disclosures within the financial statements, the directors do not expect that the adoption of 
the other standards and interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the group in
future periods.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of financial instruments
and certain oil and gas properties at the transition date to IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern
assumption is provided in the Financial Review.
During the year, management changed the organisational structure of the group and the previous three regional setups were
restructured to form seven business units; namely the Falkland Islands, Indonesia, Norway, Pakistan, the United Kingdom,
Vietnam and Rest of the World. The segmental information for the comparative year contained within these financial statements
has been re-presented to reflect this change.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 82 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into
line with those used by other members of the group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of
contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the
fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3(2008)
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination
occurs, the group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts
are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected
the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the group obtains complete information about
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date).
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the
consideration transferred, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is
allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an
indication the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of
the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  83
Interest in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject
to joint control. 
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the group’s shares of jointly
controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant
company and classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Income from the sale or use of the group’s share of the output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture
expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to/from the
group and their amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are
referred to as jointly controlled entities. The group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate
consolidation – the group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are combined with
the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where the group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
group’s interest in the joint venture.
Sales revenue and other income
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Oil and gas assets
The company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs, having regard to
the requirements of IFRS 6 –’Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’.
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially
capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred
during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or
the determination process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement
as they are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, costs of technical
services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the group’s vehicles, drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property,
plant and equipment used by the company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment.
However, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting
that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable
overhead, including the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of
other materials consumed during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward, until the existence (or otherwise) of
commercial reserves has been determined subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment. If
commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets, is then
reclassified as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves have not been found, the capitalised
costs are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
(b) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of
developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures
incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy (a) above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and
decommissioning. 84 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Oil and gas assets (continued)
(b) Development and production assets (continued)
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production
method by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into
account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(c) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the
present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash
generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be
grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation. Where conditions giving rise to
impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement,
net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
(d) Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed constitute a business.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a
business, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field
interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and
the consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production
assets disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement.
(e) Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed. The amount recognised is the
present value of the estimated future expenditure. A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised
as part of the cost of the related oil and gas property. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the
production facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with prospectively as an
adjustment to the provision and the oil and gas property. The unwinding of the discount is included as a finance cost.
Inventories
Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Petroleum products and
under and over lifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively.
Tax
The tax expense/credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable/recoverable and deferred tax movements during the year.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference
arises from goodwill/excess of fair value over cost or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  85
Tax (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. The group reassesses its
unrecognised deferred tax asset each year taking into account changes in oil and gas prices, the group’s proven and probable
reserve profile and forecast capital and operating expenditures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in
the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the
deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the group intends to settle its current
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the
functional currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Any gain or loss arising from a
change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income
statement. Non-monetary assets held at historic cost are translated at the date of purchase and are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences
are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Group retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the group’s obligations
under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered
fund. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of
comprehensive income. Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and
otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting
from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in
future contributions to the plan.
Royalties
Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised 
as income.
Leasing
Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that
they are not settled in the year in which they arise. 86 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use, i.e. when they are capable of commercial production. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of
general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general
borrowings of the group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period
in which they are incurred.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried
at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are
recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types: fair value hedges are hedges of 
particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks
that may change the amount or timing of future cash flows; and hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of
particular risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity. Currently the group only has cash flow
hedge relationships.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of
occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not
qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there
were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in
financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that is
an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income. If the hedging
relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value
of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at
the time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction
affects net income. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded derivatives which are closely related to host
contracts, including in particular price caps and floors within the group’s oil sales contracts, are not separated and are not
carried at fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated
transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as
option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and short-term deposits, less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise funds held in term deposit accounts with an original maturity not exceeding three months.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based 
vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 19.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  87
Convertible bonds
The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component
at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar
non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the
liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity
and is not re-measured. The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue,
for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the
interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of the group’s significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial
statements and include:
• carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets (note 8);
• carrying value of property, plant and equipment (note 9);

We have audited the group financial statements of Premier Oil plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the
Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow
Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 26. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an
opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, contained within the Financial Review, in relation to going concern;
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Premier Oil plc for the year ended 31 December
2012 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

1. Operating segments
During the year, management changed the organisational structure of the group and the three previous regional setups were
restructured to form seven business units; namely the Falkland Islands, Indonesia, Norway, Pakistan (including Mauritania),
the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Rest of the World. The segmental information for 2011 has been re-presented to reflect
this change. Some of the business units currently do not generate revenue or has any material operating income.
The group is only engaged in one business of upstream oil and gas exploration and production, therefore all information is
being presented for geographical segments.

The Audit and Risk Committee has a policy on the use of auditors in a non-audit capacity which is aimed at ensuring 
their continued independence. This policy is available on the group’s website. The use of the external auditor for services
relating to accounting systems or financial statements is not permitted, as are various other services that could give rise 
to conflicts of interest or other threats to the auditor’s objectivity that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level by 
applying safeguards.

During the year a charge of US$3.6 million for currency exchange losses was made by the group to income (2011: credit of
US$3.5 million of currency exchange gains). This excluded exchange gains and losses arising on financial instruments
measured at fair value through profit or loss. 98 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Effect of change in tax rates 41.9 (61.6)
Tax charge/(credit) for the year 107.9 (29.7)
Effective tax rate for the year 30.0% (21.0%)
The weighted average rate is calculated based on the tax rates weighted according to the profit or loss before tax earned
by the group in each jurisdiction. The change in the weighted average rate year-on-year relates to the mix of profit and loss
in each jurisdiction. The standard tax rate on UK ring fence profits is 62 per cent (2011: 59.3 per cent).
Tax not related to profit before tax includes the impact of the ring fence expenditure supplement (US$80.0 million) and
small field allowances (US$46.0 million) in the UK, partially offset by the impact of the UK PRT charge.

the purchase of a 60 per cent interest in the Falkland Islands Sea Lion development project.
The amounts for intangible E&E assets represent costs incurred on active exploration projects. These amounts are written
off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination
process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore
whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

* Finance costs that have been capitalised within oil and gas properties during the year total US$13.5 million (2011: US$26.3 million), at a weighted
average interest rate of 5.21 per cent (2011: 5.44 per cent).
** Acquisitions in the current year mainly relate to the acquisition of EnCore (note 25).
Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment. 
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil
and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at
the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are
based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir
performance, which are inherently uncertain. Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates
and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount
of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.
The 2012 impairment charge relates to assets on the Block A Aceh Production Sharing Contract in Indonesia due to
application of a higher discount rate. The impairment charge was calculated by comparing the future discounted cash flows
expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves (the value-in-use) against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2013 and
2014, and US$85/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter and were discounted using a discount rate of 12.5 per cent (2011: 10 per
cent). Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production
volumes, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.

Goodwill
In January 2012, the group completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore. This transaction has
resulted in recognition of US$240.8 million goodwill which arose principally due to the difference between the fair value of
the assets and the consideration transferred and the requirement to recognise deferred UK corporation tax liabilities for the
difference between the assigned fair values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill has been assigned
to the UK business segment and more specifically to the Catcher field, which will be considered the cash generating unit
for the purpose of any impairment testing of this goodwill.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be
impaired. The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations with the same key assumptions as noted
for the impairment calculations above. The discount rate in 2012 is 10 per cent. The value in use forecast, which is formerly
approved by management, takes into consideration cash flows which are expected to arise during the life of the Catcher
field as a whole, currently expected to be around 2026. This period exceeds five years but is believed to be appropriate as
it is underpinned by estimates of commercial reserves provided by our in-house reservoir engineers using industry standard
reservoir estimation techniques.

A maturity analysis showing the ageing profile of the total borrowings is shown in note 17.
During the year, the group undertook a private placement of senior loan notes of US$202.0 million and €25.0 million. At the
year-end date, the group’s principal credit facilities comprised a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$695.0 million revolving
credit facility and a £216.0 million (US$351.1 million) letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015. In addition, in March 2012,
group also entered into a US$350.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2017. Senior loan notes have various
maturities starting from 2018 to 2024. 
Convertible bonds exchange offer
In October 2012, the group invited holders of the outstanding US$250.0 million guaranteed convertible bonds (‘old bonds’)
to exchange their existing bonds (due 2014) for guaranteed convertible bonds due 2018 (‘new bonds’). The new bonds have
a conversion price of US$7.00 per share and a coupon of 2.5 per cent. This compared with the old bonds which had a
conversion price of US$6.69 per share and a coupon of 2.875 per cent. Bond holders representing 98.13 per cent of the total
aggregate principal amount of the US$250.0 million (approximately US$245.3 million) elected to exchange their old bonds for
the new bonds. The remainder of the old bonds were settled in cash (US$4.6 million) or company shares (US$0.1 million) at par.

14. Borrowings (continued)
Convertible bonds exchange offer (continued)
The new bonds were issued on 1 November 2012, with a par value of US$245.3 million which are convertible into Ordinary
Shares of the company at any time from 11 August 2016 until six days before their maturity date of 27 July 2018. At the
conversion price of £4.34 (US$7.00 at fixed exchange rate) per share there are 35,035,495 Ordinary Shares of the company
underlying the bonds. If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will
be redeemed at par value on 27 July 2018. Interest of 2.50 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to
that date. 
The group has derecognised the book value of the old bonds as the new bonds have significantly different terms. The
equity component and liability portion of the new bonds has been calculated based on the last day market price of the old
bonds and effective yield of a similar maturity corporate bond. US$8.6 million difference between equity component of the
old bonds and the new bonds have been assigned to the equity reserves and a US$1.9 million residual difference has been
charged to income statement.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.

The total interest charged on the new bonds has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 4.58 per
cent to the liability component for the period since the new bonds were issued. The effective annual interest rate on the old
bonds was 6.73 per cent. The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component (as the cash interest is only
paid at 2.5 per cent) to US$245.3 million at maturity. There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the
liability component of the convertible bonds and its fair value. This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash
flows at the market rate.
Capital management 
The primary objective of the group’s capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order
to support its business and increase shareholder value. The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to
it in light of changes in economic conditions. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the
years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
The group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by net assets plus net debt. The group’s policy
is to keep the long-term gearing ratio below 50 per cent. Net debt comprises interest-bearing bank loans, senior loan
notes and convertible bonds, less cash and short-term deposits.

The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to oil and gas interests 
in the UK, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Mauritania which are expected to be incurred up to 2038. These provisions
have been created based on Premier’s internal estimates and, where available, operator’s estimates. Based on the 
current economic environment, assumptions have been made which are believed to be a reasonable basis upon which 
to estimate the future liability. These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the
assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary
decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of
decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will
depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for operated fields in the
UK, Indonesia and Vietnam.
17. Financial instruments
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments (derivatives), comprise accounts
payable, bank loans, convertible bonds and senior loan notes. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to
manage short-term cash flow and to raise finance for the group’s capital expenditure programme. The group has various
financial assets such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the group’s financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price
risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The group uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the group’s policies
and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2012 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  105
17. Financial instruments (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and
foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, reverse collars, swaps and hedges embedded in long-term crude
offtake agreements. Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options. Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore
180cst which is the variable component of the gas price. 
The group’s exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest
rate borrowings within its debt portfolio. However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to
historical rates, a substantial portion of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest
rate swap markets. 
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the group’s transactions are
denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency (such as Pound Sterling,
Norwegian Kroner) receipts and expenditures within individual business units. Exchange rate exposures are managed
within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Fair value hierarchy
In line with IAS 39 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ the group uses the following hierarchy for
determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either
directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable 
market data. 
As at 31 December 2012, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value (excluding any primary
financial instruments such as cash and bank loans):

Commodity price risk
Oil
At 31 December 2012, the group had 3.0 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged through forward sales at an average
floor price of US$109.0/bbl. The forward sales have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be
effective, with a fair value movement of US$5.1 million recognised directly in retained earnings. A residual fair value
movement of US$1.2 million was credited to the income statement.
The group’ s long-term oil collars expired on 31 December 2012, resulting in a US$50.0 million credit to the income statement.
During the year, embedded oil price collars and foward oil sales contracts for 3.9 million barrels matured generating a net
cost of US$34.4 million (2011: US$101.3 million). This cost has been offset against sales revenues. 
Indonesian gas
At the year-end date, 48,000 metric tonnes (mt) of Singapore 180 HSFO, which underlies the pricing mechanism for
Indonesian gas sold into the Singapore market, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-year 2013, with a floor of
US$250.0/mt and a cap of US$500.0/mt. An additional 96,000 mt have been sold under monthly forward sales contracts for
2013 at an average price of US$657.0/mt. 
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 246,000 mt matured generating a cash cost of US$26.3 million (2011:
US$17.8 million) which have been offset against sales revenues. All of these contracts have been designated as cash flow
hedges and were assessed to be effective. In the current year, US$3.2 million of the movement in the fair value of these
contracts was credited to the income statement (2011: credit of US$6.0 million), as this movement related to the 
time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39. The remaining movement, being a credit of US$15.4 million (2011: charge
of US$6.3 million), related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

Interest rate risk
At 31 December 2012, US$300.0 million of the group’s long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate
to fixed rate. Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and
floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the
risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and are assessed to be effective. The fair value of interest rate
swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date. The
movement in fair values is shown in the table below:

Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis
The key variable which affects the fair value of the group’s hedging instruments is market expectations about future interest
rates. The following illustrates the sensitivity of comprehensive income to an increase of 50 basis points in this variable:
Total 
Increase/(decrease) in mark-to-market value $ million
Increase of fifty basis points (3.4)
A decrease of 50 basis points in this variable has not been considered appropriate due to the current very low level of
floating interest rates.
Foreign currency exchange risk
During the year, the group issued €25.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been hedged under a cross
currency swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.328:€. This is in addition to existing swaps of €75.0 million at a fixed rate
of US$1.423:€. The fair value of these cross currency swaps at the reporting date is shown below:

To cover sterling exposures an amount of £497.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year (2011: 
£182.0 million) to cater for its North Sea developments and operations, all of which were closed out by year end. The
group’s activities are largely conducted in US dollars. The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in

Credit risk
The group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits. The amount of receivables presented in
the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2012 and 2011. The group does
not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties. The credit risk on liquid
funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from five customers each
exceeded 10 per cent of the group’s consolidated revenue in 2012 (2011: four). 
The ageing profile of the group’s trade and other receivables and trade and other payables as at 31 December, including
the related undiscounted interest amounts, was:

Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the group’s short, medium and long-term funding and
liquidity management requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities
and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of
financial assets and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments. 
Borrowing facilities
The group has committed borrowing facilities of US$1,345.0 million and letter of credit facilities of £216.0 million
(US$351.1 million), in addition to the convertible bonds and senior loan notes. The undrawn cash balance from the
committed borrowing facilities as at 31 December was:

The group’s unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2012 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are
expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised. In accordance with paragraph 37
of IAS 12 – ‘Income Taxes’ the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2012 with respect to
ring fence tax losses and allowances. The corporate model used to assess whether additional deferred tax assets should be
recognised was re-run, using an oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in 2013 and 2014, and US$85/bbl in ‘real’
terms. The results of the corporate model concluded that it was appropriate to recognise all of the group’s UK ring fence
deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and allowances in full.
In addition to the above, there are non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$327.6 million (2011: US$181.2 million)
and current year non-UK tax losses of approximately US$26.9 million (2011:$69.4 million) for which a deferred tax asset has
not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses (ring fence and non-ring fence) have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax
legislation in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions 
are satisfied.
On 23 March 2011 it was announced that tax relief on decommissioning expenditure would be restricted to 50 per cent
rather than 62 per cent. This restriction was substantially enacted in the 2012 Finance Bill and has resulted in a deferred tax
charge to the income statement of $27.2 million.

Share-based payments and share incentive plans
The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As
You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only. 
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the total cost recognised by the group for equity-settled share-based payment
transactions is US$30.5 million. A credit of US$30.5 million has been recorded in retained earnings (2011: US$34.6 million)
for all equity-settled payments of the group. Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the
time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc
group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income
statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs. 
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: 
(i) Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates
all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise
three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance
period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at
the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards. 
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the
Performance Share Awards. The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: 
Volatility: 41.0% to 42.0%
Risk free rate of interest: 1.1% to 3.7%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.30 to 0.35
(ii) Share Incentive Plan
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares. If an employee
agrees to buy partnership shares the company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award of
shares (matching shares), on a one-for-one basis. 114 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements
19. Share capital (continued)
(iii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join
the scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five
years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

Funded pensions
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK - The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan
(the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in
1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the
payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds. 
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2012 by a qualified independent
actuary. The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 - ‘Employee Benefits’. 
The Scheme’s assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and
present employees. The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The
appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation. 
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid
out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method. This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the
balance sheet. The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities
make allowance for the projected earnings. 
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2012. The results
of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below. 
As at 31 December 2012, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the group at the rates set out in the schedule of
contributions dated 24 July 2012. Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 per
cent of the aggregate of members’ pensionable salaries.

23. Group pension schemes (continued)
Projected components of pension expense for year to 31 December 2013
The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the IAS 19 figures for the next year
with confidence. The following projections should therefore be treated with caution. Assumptions implicit in the following
projections are:
• the return on assets from 31 December 2012 is 4.4 per cent per annum;
• contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2013 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in
place at the date of signing this report; and
• there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the components of pension expense are:
2013
$ million
Current service cost 0.3 
Interest cost (0.2)
Expected return on Scheme assets –
Total 0.1 
Unfunded pensions
In Indonesia, the group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour
Agreement with the local workforce. This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in the UK in regard to which annual increases and
a reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme. On the same actuarial
basis as used to assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2012 of the future payments
projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million (2011: US$0.9 million).
Defined contribution benefit scheme
The group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The only obligation of the group with respect to the
retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions. Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as
an expense as they fall due. The total cost charged to income of US$4.2 million (2011: US$3.5 million) represents
contributions payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.

25. Acquisition of subsidiaries
In January 2012, the company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore Oil plc (EnCore).
EnCore was an AIM listed oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the offshore UK Continental 
Shelf where its portfolio of assets included interests in the Catcher and Cladhan discoveries, exploration acreage and a
29.65 per cent holding in Egdon Resources plc, an AIM listed exploration and production company focused on onshore
assets with interests in the UK and Europe. 
Under the terms of the agreement announced on 5 October 2011, shareholders in EnCore were offered a consideration of
70 pence in cash for each EnCore share held. Alternatively, EnCore shareholders could elect to receive 0.2067 new shares in
the company for each EnCore share held instead of part or all of the cash consideration. 
On completion, shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCore’s shares elected to take new Premier shares, resulting in
the company paying a total of £14.1 million (US$21.6 million) in cash to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new
Ordinary Shares to those who chose the share alternative. The new shares began trading on 17 January 2012. 
As a result of the acquisition, the group increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 to 50 per cent and became
operator of the development. 
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement to on-sell the 16.6 per cent interest in
the Cladhan area which it indirectly acquired from the EnCore acquisition for an adjusted consideration of US$52.4 million.
The buyer also agreed to farm-in to a 50 per cent interest in EnCore’s wholly-owned Block 28/10a on a promoted basis
whereby it paid 80 per cent of certain well costs and 50 per cent of back costs on the Coaster prospect, which was drilled
as part of the company’s 2012 drilling programme. The on-sale of these assets was completed in March 2012. 
The transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 16 January 2012,
being the date on which the group gained control of EnCore. Information in respect of assets acquired and the fair value
allocation to the EnCore assets in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 - ‘Business Combinations’ is as follows:
Fair values 
$ million
Net assets acquired:
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 74.6 
Property, plant and equipment 138.8 
Investment in associate 7.5

Goodwill 240.8 
Total consideration 407.6

$ million
Net cash inflow arising on acquisition:
Cash consideration 21.6 
Less: cash and restricted cash balances acquired (26.2)
Net cash inflow (4.6)
These fair values have been finalised based on a detailed review of the exploration portfolio and a reassessment of the
Catcher area discoveries in December 2012.
Goodwill arises due to the difference between the fair value of the assets and the consideration transferred and also due to
the requirement to recognise deferred UK corporation tax liabilities in respect of for the difference between the assigned
fair values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. None of the goodwill
recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related expenses of US$6.9 million had been incurred by the group in 2011 and 2012 and were included within
general and administration costs.
Premier acquired exploration interests as part of the acquisition and fair valued these assets within the EnCore portfolio.
During 2012 three exploration prospects were drilled, two of which were unsuccessful. The unsuccessful drilling resulted in
an exploration write-off of US$49.0 million income statement, being the only significant impact on the group’s 2012 profit
arising from the acquisition.
26. Events after the balance sheet date
Letter of Credit Facilities
In March 2013, the company negotiated an additional £100 million (US$163.0 million) letter of credit facility, increasing them
to £316.0 million (US$515.1 million). This facility will expire in 2015.
Dividends
On the 19 March 2013 the Board proposed a final dividend of 5 pence per share (2011: nil). This dividend is subject to
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held in London on 7 June 2013. If approved, the dividend will
be paid on 14 June 2013 to shareholders on the register as of 17 May 2013. 122 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements

assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors;
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2012
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and law. The results relate entirely to continuing operations.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the going
concern assumption is provided in the Financial Review. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and
the preceding year. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately
administered fund. The scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits)
in 1997. The company accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 - ‘Retirement Benefits’. 
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and
losses on settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the
benefits have vested. If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits
adjacent to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains 
and losses. 
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit
credit method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of
equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities. 
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The resulting defined
benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the 
balance sheet.
Foreign exchange
The local currency of the company is US dollars. All transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other
than the local currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the year-end. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the
transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account. 
Cash flow statement
No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 - ‘Cash Flow Statements’ as the cash flows of the
company have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc. 
Related party transactions
The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 - ‘Related Party Disclosures’ with regard to the
non-disclosure of transactions between group companies. 
Share-based payments
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 8.
Tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay
less or to receive more tax. The exception to this is that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the
directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of
the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  125
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss

(2011: profit of US$8.0 million).

Funded pensions
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK - The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits
Plan (the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits)
in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by
the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds. 
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2012 by a qualified independent
actuary. The figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’ (incorporating the amendment
announced in December 2006). 
The Scheme’s assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and
present employees. The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The
appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation. 
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid
out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method. This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the
balance sheet. The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities
make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2012. The results
of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below. 
As at 31 December 2012, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the company at the rates set out in the schedule of
contributions dated 27 July 2012. Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 per
cent of the aggregate of the members’ pensionable salaries.  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  127

Projected components of pension expense for year to 31 December 2013
The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the FRS 17 figures for the next year
with confidence. The following projections should therefore be treated with caution. Assumptions implicit in the following
projections are: 
• the return on assets from 31 December 2012 is 4.4 per cent per annum;
• contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2013 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in
place at the date of signing this report; and
• there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.

6. Pension schemes (continued)
Sensitivity and risk
The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used. The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17
calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets (with a significant exposure to
equities) is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields. 
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the FRS 17 balance sheet position to small changes in some of the assumptions.
Where one assumption has been changed all the other assumptions are kept the same as disclosed. 
Change from 
Revised disclosed
Surplus/ Surplus/
(Deficit) (Deficit) 
$ million $ million
Discount rate less 0.1% pa 3.5 (0.7)
RPI inflation and linked assumptions plus 0.1% pa 3.5 (0.7)
Members living one year longer than expected 3.5 (0.9)
The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as
follows:
• a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities;
• an increase in price inflation and/or salary inflation; and
• improving life expectancy (lower mortality rates) resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions
The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary
spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme. On the same actuarial basis as used to
assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2012 of the future payments projected to be
made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million (2011: US$0.9 million).
7. Commitments and guarantees
At the year-end date the company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, had jointly guaranteed the group’ s borrowing
facilities which consist of a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$695.0 million revolving credit facility and a £216.0 million
(US$351.1 million) letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015, a US$350.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2017,
and private placements of senior notes of US$244.0 million and €75.0 million, and US$202.0 million and €25.0 million with
various maturities starting from 2018 to 2024.

Ordinary Shares
The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows: 
Dividend rights: the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation
to dividends. 
Winding up or reduction of capital: on a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion,
redemption or purchase of shares) the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets
of the company available for distribution shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other. 
Voting rights: the holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General
Meeting of the company. 
Share-based payments and share incentive plans
The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As
You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only. 
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the total cost recognised by the company for equity-settled share-based payment
transactions is US$30.5 million. A credit of US$30.5 million has been recorded in retained earnings (2011: US$34.6 million)
for all equity-settled payments of the group. Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the
time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc
group. Part of this cost is therefore recharged to the relevant subsidiary undertaking where it is capitalised as directly
attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration
costs or general and administration costs. 
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: 
(i) Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates
all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise
three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance
period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at
the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards. 
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report. 
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the
Performance Share Awards. The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: 
Volatility: 41.0% to 42.0%
Risk free rate of interest: 1.1% to 3.7%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.30 to 0.35
(ii) Share Incentive Plan
Under the share incentive plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares. If an employee
agrees to buy partnership shares the company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award of
shares (matching shares), on a one-for-one basis.  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  131
8. Share capital (continued)
(iii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join
the scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five
years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

In October 2012, the group invited holders of the outstanding US$250.0 million guaranteed convertible bonds (‘old bonds’)
to exchange their existing bonds (due 2014) for guaranteed convertible bonds due 2018 (‘new bonds’). The new bonds
have a conversion price of US$7.00 per share and a coupon of 2.5 per cent. This compared with the existing convertible
bonds which had a conversion price of US$6.69 per share and a coupon of 2.875 per cent. Bond holders representing
98.13 per cent of the total aggregate principal amount of the US$250.0 million (approximately US$245.3 million) elected
to exchange their old bonds for the new bonds. The remainder of the old bonds were settled in cash (US$4.6 million) or
company shares (US$0.1 million) at par. 
The new bonds were issued on 1 November 2012, with a par value of US$245.3 million which are convertible into Ordinary
Shares of the company at any time from 11 August 2016 until six days before their maturity date of 27 July 2018. At the
conversion price of £4.34 (US$7.00 at fixed exchange rate) per share there are 35,035,495 Ordinary Shares of the company
underlying the bonds. If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will
be redeemed at par value on 27 July 2018.  132 /  Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Premier Oil plc categorises petroleum resources in accordance with the 2007 SPE/WPC/AAPG/SPEE Petroleum Resource
Management System (SPE PRMS).
Proved and probable reserves are based on operator, third party reports and internal estimates and are defined in accordance
with the Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) issued by the Oil Industry Accounting Committee (OIAC), dated 
July 2001.
The group provides for amortisation of costs relating to evaluated properties based on direct interests on an entitlement basis,
which incorporates the terms of the PSCs in Indonesia, Vietnam and Mauritania. On an entitlement basis reserves were 255.5
mmboe as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 263.8 mmboe). This was calculated in 2012 using an oil price assumption equal to the
Dated Brent forward curve in 2013 and 2014 and US$85/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter (2011: Dated Brent forward curve in 2012
and 2013 and US$75/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter). Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  135

Share portal 
As a shareholder you have direct access to the online Share Portal operated by Capita Registrars at www.premier-oil-shares.com.
You will need your Investor Code (IVC) which can be found on your share certificate. The portal provides a range of services free
of charge to help you to administer your shareholding quickly and efficiently by allowing you to:
• Check your share balance;
• Change your address details;
• Opt into receiving electronic shareholder communications;
• Set up or amend a dividend mandate so dividends can be paid directly to your bank account; and 
• Buy and sell Premier Oil plc shares using the dealing service operated by Capita Deal.
Dividends 
Shareholders can have their dividends paid directly into a UK sterling bank account and have the tax voucher sent directly to
their registered address. You can register your account details using the Share Portal: www.premier-oil-shares.com.
Overseas shareholders who wish to have their dividends paid in a local currency can use the International Payment Service that
Capita has established. The International Payment Service is available to holders who receive individual dividend or interest
payments of £10 or more (payments of less than £10 or more than £100,000 will be paid by sterling cheque, unless otherwise
agreed). Further information, including the terms and conditions of the International Payment Service, is available on Capita’s
International Payment Service website: www.international.capitaregistrars.com. Please note, this service may not be available
to all overseas shareholders. 
E-communications 
You can receive documents by electronic format, rather than through the post. Premier has pledged to donate £1 to PURE
The Clean Planet Trust (www.puretrust.org.uk) for every shareholder that registers their email address. PURE is a UK based
carbon offsetting charity dedicated to combating climate change. To register for this service, please visit the Share Portal:
www.premier-oil-shares.com. You will need your Investor Code (IVC) which can be found on your share certificate. Once
registered, Premier will use your email whenever they communicate with shareholders electronically, for example notice of
meetings, Report and Accounts and information regarding the Share Portal service.
Shareholder security 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy Premier shares at inflated prices, or offers of
free reports about Premier. More information can be found in the Shareholder Information section of the Investors area of the
Premier website: www.premier-oil.com.

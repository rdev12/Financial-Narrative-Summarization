We have executed our strategy successfully across a much 
broader geographical footprint in 2011, with 50% of our 
revenue coming from overseas customers. This not only 
offers increased opportunities for future growth but it also 
reduces the Company’s dependence on the UK.
eur OPe 
The acquisition of Time Care at the end of 2010 
brought over 200 new customers in sweden, 
Benelux and other scandinavian territories. 
Time Care has grown steadily in 2011 and  
is an important platform for growth in europe.
asia /Pacific
Australia has been the biggest driver of 
overseas revenue and following the recent 
acquisition of r ostero n, we now have a team 
of almost 30 staff in Australia and a strong 
growing customer base in Healthcare and 
Defence. This year we signed an agreement  
to sell Bankstaff to the state of Queensland, 
meaning that we now have two Australian state 
wide agreements covering over 1,000 facilities.

With the ongoing reforms to the nhs, what  
has been the impact on your business?
The reforms have inevitably been unsettling for NHS 
organisations, many of whom are our customers and their 
staff. Allocate’s objective is to help our customers drive 
efficiency whilst delivering savings, without compromising the 
quality of care delivered to patients. Regardless of the reform 
agenda and in support of the drive to find sustainable savings 
within the NHS, we can help Trusts to deliver significant 
savings on an ongoing basis with a very strong ROI. In some 
cases we have helped enable customers to save hundreds 
of thousands of pounds per year. Government policy will 
continue to evolve. Our agenda is to enable our customers 
to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible within 
whatever organisational structure or financial budgets are 
imposed on them. 
Do you still see growth in the uK healthcare 
sector for allocate?
Absolutely. Healthcare remains the largest and fastest 
growing sector for Allocate with a significant amount of scope 
remaining in the UK Healthcare market. There is significant 
potential for cross-sell of our other products to our customers 
as well as the opportunity to address more of the broader 
Healthcare market.
 
at the moment your software uses only english 
as a language but that is set to change with 
the re-engineered applications. how will this 
impact on the business?
Three years ago we embarked upon a project code 
named “Columbus”. The project will see the complete 
redevelopment of Allocate’s core applications from the 
ground up, delivering improved performance and enhanced 
functionality. In particular the platform will provide multi-
lingual capabilities which will enable us to target Europe 
for example. From a growth perspective, it will enable 
Allocate to reach much further afield and build on the 
current international network which already reaches Sweden, 
Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Malaysia, France, Denmark, 
Qatar, Iceland, the Netherlands and Belgium. It should also 
be noted that the applications developed by Time Care 
already have localised language versions and we will build  
on that expertise. Allocate Software plc

You have recently acquired rosterOn  
in australia – why does this territory  
work so well for you?
International expansion is a key part of our growth strategy, 
and having secured our first two State wide customers in 
Australia, we started to embed the Allocate footprint in 
this new territory, winning these significant tenders against 
international competitors. RosterOn was a logical step to 
build on this solid start as it brings specialist capabilities in 
local regulatory requirements and an established presence 
in the Healthcare market across Australia, whilst at the same 
time growing our customer base.
there has been quite an aggressive M&a 
strategy with six acquisitions in the past 
36 months, do you envisage this strategy 
continuing at the same pace?
The principle drivers for acquisitions are to acquire products 
to cross-sell into our growing customer base and to 
accelerate the development of our international business. 
With the successful acquisition of six companies, Baum 
Hart, Key IT Solutions, Dynamic Change and most recently 
Zircadian in the UK, whilst overseas we acquired Time Care  
in Sweden and RosterOn in Australia, we have made a strong 
start in achieving our objectives. The first three acquisitions 
are now fully integrated into the business, and this process 
is underway with Zircadian. We have strengthened our 
management team with the recent appointments of a new 
Marketing Director, Support Director and Chief Technology 
Officer, who all bring significant international experience  
to the business.
Going forward we will continue to make acquisitions that 
support our strategy for growth.

Since the end of the financial year, we have continued our 
strategy of supporting our strong organic growth with carefully 
selected acquisitions. In July we acquired RosterOn in Australia. 
This acquisition will both enable further growth in Australia and 
will also provide us with a larger establishment and broader 
customer base. Following this, in August we acquired Zircadian, 
which complements our HealthRoster application and will 
significantly enhance the product portfolio that we can bring  
to our customer base.
Our results for the 2011 financial year were outstanding and  
the outlook for the 2012 financial year is for continued profitable 
growth and success. 
I would like once more to thank our customers for their business 
and their partnership with Allocate and our Alliance partners for 
their continuing support. Finally, I would like to recognise and 
thank all of the Company’s growing number of employees in  
all parts of the world, for another year of hard work and 
commitment in support of the Company’s success.

Chairman
5 September 2011
The 2011 financial year has been another outstanding year  
for Allocate. We have executed successfully across a much 
broader geographical footprint and have exceeded our 
expectations despite continuing difficult trading conditions.
As can be seen from our results, Allocate continues to expand 
its business operations and to generate increased profit and 
cash. The expansion of the Company’s activities across broader 
territories provides not only increased opportunities for future 
growth, but it also reduces the Company’s dependence upon 
the UK. We continue to expand in Australia both in Healthcare 
and in Defence. Our operations in Europe via Time Care 
continue to perform well. 
Richard Morgan-Evans has announced his decision to resign as 
a member of the Board of Directors. His last Board meeting will 
be the September 2011 Board meeting. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank Richard for his years of service to Allocate, 
not only serving as a member of the Board of Directors in recent 
years but also serving as Chief Executive Officer prior to that. 
During Richard’s tenure Allocate has grown significantly and has 
enjoyed considerable commercial and financial success. 
I was pleased to welcome Richard King to the Board earlier this 
year. Richard has been appointed Chair of the Audit Committee 
and he has also joined the Remuneration Committee. Richard 
joins us after a notable 35 year career at Ernst & Young where 
he most recently held the position of Deputy Managing Partner 
of Ernst & Young UK. Allocate Software plc

Penang adventist hospital
the challenges
In response to ongoing financial pressures and clinical 
safety guidelines, Penang Adventist Hospital (“PAH”) 
needed to become more effective in the management 
of their staff. Following a thorough Roster Assessment 
carried out by Allocate, it identified: 
No ability to link patient demand to nursing levels  >
thereby enabling staffing levels to be objectively set 
Lack of bottom up, real time operational   >
information on the nursing workforce at ward  
level, resulting in ineffective decision-making 
regarding staff deployment 
A lack of objective creation and management of  >
substantive staff off-duties resulting in ineffective  
use of the nursing workforce 
Ineffective management of the nursing staff budget  >
the solution
The hospital replaced disparate paper-based systems 
with HealthRoster to drive out inefficiencies and 
significantly improve transparency of the workforce to 
achieve improved performance across all areas of the 
hospital. The solution has been implemented across all 
clinical units so far, and is now effectively working across 
the entire workforce process to deliver multiple benefits 
on a hospital-wide scale.
Key benefit
HealthRoster has enabled the hospital to use a more 
diverse staffing mix on the wards allowing them to 
reduce staffing costs whilst at the same time improving 
the delivery of care services and minimising risks by 
having more staff present on the wards.
“Our objective to deliver the best possible 
care is focused on making the best use of our 
available workforce in line with service needs. 
h ealthr oster has helped us to achieve this 
goal through significantly increased visibility 
of our workforce, allowing effective decisions 
regarding refocusing services to meet patient 
needs. in addition, staff morale has increased  
as a result of this solution and we are delivering 
better quality care through a more sophisticated 
approach to workforce management.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Overview
2011 has been a year of great success for Allocate. We achieved 
our financial goals, we have continued to develop new and 
existing customer relationships, developed new geographical 
territories and greatly strengthened our management team. 
With considerable disruption in our markets, we have executed 
well delivering such strong 2011 results. We have made 
investments in external acquisitions, internal product 
development, customer support and IT infrastructure. These 
will provide the platform required to support future growth.
Business drivers
Allocate has grown revenue at a CAGR of 38% and profits  
at a CAGR of 51% over the past five years, the vast majority  
of that growth coming from Healthcare. Healthcare revenue 
represented 77% of total revenue in 2011 and will continue to 
provide the principal platform for growth in the future. Whilst 
headline growth percentages at these levels cannot be assured 
in upcoming years, Allocate now has a business model that will 
continue to deliver growth in both revenues and profits. 
What are the key drivers of growth and shareholder value  
in the future?
1. Overall. Allocate’s product portfolio targets the efficient 
deployment and working practices of the single biggest 
component of cost within Healthcare organisations 
worldwide – the cost of staff. The worldwide Healthcare 
market is very large providing Allocate with considerable 
opportunity for growth and expansion with both existing  
and new customer acquisition worldwide.
2. New customer acquisition. Over the past five years Allocate 
has grown its customer base from a few dozen customers to 
now over 740. These customers have been won in the UK, in 
Europe, in Australia, in the USA and in the Far East. All of 
these markets, especially the UK, offer considerable scope 
for further new customer wins. These markets are not only 
large; they are also addressable by Allocate as evidenced  
by the increasing number of customers that choose to invest 
in our applications. Over 135 NHS Trusts do not have an 
automated rostering solution such as HealthRoster and some 
57 have competitor products. The overall size of the 
Healthcare markets is such that our addressable market 
opportunities significantly exceed the size of our existing 
business. We will continue to acquire new customers in the 
Healthcare sector based on our current market momentum, 
our customer referenceability and our increasing levels  
of investment.
3. Customer satisfaction and new product development 
leading to increased recurring revenues. The vast majority 
of our 740 customers currently have only one Allocate 
product and we have a great opportunity to cross-sell  
further products to this established base. 
a. We will continue to develop products organically.  
In recent times we have successfully launched new 
products for the doctor rostering market as well as  
our e-expenses product.
b. We will continue to acquire new products for value in their 
own right but also for cross-sell into the customer base. 
c. Our continued focus on the satisfaction of our customers 
will lead to new products being sold on a permanent  
or term licence basis or increasingly on a subscription/
SaaS basis, such as HealthAssure acquired from  
Dynamic Change.
d. This will further increase the recurring revenue share of 
our business, plus, it will further increase our commitment 
to our customers and their commitment to us.
e. Finally, the support renewal income from this growing 
customer base continues to increase each year and is 
expected to continue to do so. This will have the effect  
of increasing the recurring revenue share of our total 
revenue which will provide us with better visibility  
and transparency.
4. Overseas territories. In 2011 £15.0m of revenue came  
from overseas customers, representing c50% of total revenue 
for the year. (2010: £7.8m representing 35% of total revenue). 
Australia has been the biggest driver of overseas revenue  
for Allocate and with the acquisition of RosterOn (announced 
July 2011) we now have a team of almost 30 staff in Australia 
and strong, developing customer relationships in both 
Healthcare and Defence. 
5. Mergers and Acquisitions. We have now successfully 
acquired six companies, of which four are UK based and  
two are overseas. The principal drivers for acquisitions  
are to acquire products to cross-sell into our growing 
customer base and also to accelerate the development of 
our business overseas. These acquisitions helped drive our 
headline revenue growth by 39% in 2010 and by 37% in 2011. 
However, organic growth was 21% in 2010 and 15% in 2011 
and adjusted EPS grew by 18% in 2010 and by 24% in 2011. 
The growth in organic revenues demonstrates the core 
strength of the Allocate business and the growth in  
adjusted EPS demonstrates the synergies that have been 
gained from the acquisitions. In future, we will continue to 
make acquisitions to produce this synergistic growth.

natO special forces
the requirement
Strategic success in NATO’s non Article V 
operations is underpinned by mentoring 
and military assistance programmes. 
Although there will always be a place for 
kinetic effect, in simple terms ‘meeting the 
indigenous population needs’ is a critical 
element in countering an insurgency. 
Historically Special Operations Forces 
(“SOF”) have been composed of 
specialists, with a typical team comprising 
a linguist, a signaller, a medic and a 
demolitions expert. Today this degree of 
specialisation is being taken to greater 
levels as the need for civil and military 
training assistance grows. Many of the 
skills required are still vested in a few 
individuals, therefore their selection, 
management and deployment requires 
detailed planning.
the solution
To increase the pool of SOF specialists 
requires a continual training programme 
that is flexible enough to accommodate 
the changing nature of operations and 
the increasingly sophisticated tasks being 
faced by NATO SOF. In this respect one of 
the facilities offered by the Defence Suite 
is a fully automated means of identifying 
the shortfalls, proposing the remedial 
action, allocating resources and then 
recording the results. The NATO Special 
Forces Operations Headquarters has 
assumed responsibility for the critical 
task of improving the range of trained 
personnel by identifying relevant national 
SOF courses and ensuring a timely, 
prioritised and equitable allocation of 
vacancies available to Allies.
“i wanted to tell you that your team 
has done a remarkable job and we 
are extremely pleased. f rankly 
speaking, i believe we now have 
a valuable mechanism to project 
combat power.

healthcare 
Healthcare remains our largest and fastest growing market 
sector, accounting for 77% of total revenues in 2011. 
In the UK we have a substantial customer base, which  
extends to 373 NHS Trusts, and worldwide we have  
450 Healthcare customers.
At 31 May 2011, HealthRoster was installed in 145 NHS Trusts  
in England and Wales. This represents 35% of the total number 
of Acute, Mental Health and Primary Care Trusts in England  
and Wales. In addition, HealthRoster is installed in eight 
international Healthcare organisations. HealthRoster BankStaff, 
our temporary staffing solution which empowers NHS Trusts  
by automating the planning of bank and agency staff and 
reporting across hospitals, is now installed in 179 NHS Trusts. 
Add to that the 102 customers who have HealthAssure, the 
former Dynamic Change product, and Allocate can justifiably 
claim to have significant coverage across the NHS. At the same 
time, there are many incremental opportunities for further 
cross-sell of some or all of the aforementioned products. 
We believe that we continue to have the best products on the 
market. By that, we mean products that have been developed 
with our customers, for our customers, over many years, to 
provide the most productive and most cost effective solution 
for staff management and corporate governance.
Finally, it should be noted that this year we also extended  
the HealthRoster contract of eight NHS Trusts creating an 
important and continuing stream of incremental revenue  
from our customer base.
In addition to success with our sales efforts, we have also 
invested significantly in new headcount and IT systems in the 
area of customer support. This we have done in conjunction 
with feedback from our colleagues on the Healthcare User 
Group and the results were demonstrated to hundreds of 
customers at the recent annual User Group meeting. As a  
result, over 100 customers are now logged on to the new 
system and it is receiving very positive feedback.
Dynamic Change’s products are now integrated in to 
the Allocate Product portfolio and have been renamed 
HealthAssure, which is currently used by over 100 healthcare 
organisations and is a fully managed online software-as-a-
service governance risk and compliance solution. The business 
of Dynamic Change suffered at the start of the year as a result 
of the Government changes in the NHS. However, the level of 
new business has now recovered, with more new customers 
signed in the second half of 2011 than were signed in the 
second half of 2010.
In August 2011 we acquired Zircadian, a UK based SaaS  
provider of software used to plan the rotas of junior doctors  
and consultants in the NHS. The business, which has 142 
healthcare customers, uses a SaaS delivery model with  
multiple year agreements. This acquisition will enhance revenue 
visibility due to the subscription nature of its business model.
Time Care has had a good year. The Swedish market has  
not been as badly affected as some others by the worldwide 
recession and the requirement to reduce spending. In the  
year, Time Care secured 16 new customers, being eight 
municipalities, three Healthcare and five non Healthcare.  
They now have customer relationships with some 62 hospitals 
and 135 of Sweden’s 290 municipalities, and in addition with  
a number of customers in Benelux and other Scandinavian 
territories. Time Care continues to progress well and meet 
performance expectations as a semi-autonomous business.
In Australia, our Healthcare business continues to develop  
very well. The previously announced State wide deal is now 
rolling out, we have recently announced that we have secured  
a new State wide agreement in Queensland for HealthRoster 
BankStaff, our temporary staffing solution and we have 
also announced, post 2011 year end, that we have acquired 
RosterOn, a highly regarded local vendor of Healthcare 
solutions that will accelerate our business there.
Finally, we were delighted to secure two more major US 
customers this year; Dean Healthcare Inc and Austin Radiology 
Labs. Both customers have HealthRoster and are in the process 
of deployment, continuing to meet expectations.
Defence 
The Defence sector has achieved a number of successes  
this year. Defence revenues were £4.1m, representing 14%  
of revenues in 2011.
The principal highlights include the following: 
Awarded the NATO APMS contract which has commenced •	
delivery. This contract will be multiyear rollout and although 
there was little revenue benefit in 2011, there will be much 
greater benefit in 2012. In essence, the agreement is for 
MAPS to become the HR system used by NATO in Brussels 
to manage their entire workforce.
The British Army agreed to a new support agreement and •	
also implemented a major extension to Collective and 
Individual Training modules.
In Australia, the Royal Australian Navy extended its licence •	
agreement with Allocate such that 100% of Navy employees 
are now supported by MAPS. In addition, the major 
Australian Army licence contract booked at the end of 2010 
has been largely executed in 2011. Allocate Software plc

Development
This year we extended the product to meet the differing needs 
of our international markets:
In Australia, a number of extensions to HealthRoster in •	
particular to support regulatory reporting requirements. 
Additionally, extensions to HealthRoster BankStaff to 
support Australian casual staff. 
In the United States, considerable development to support •	
Ambulatory Care working practises, driven by the Dean 
Healthcare project.
Improved our HealthRoster medics product, in particular  •	
to manage better the workflow of interdisciplinary teams  
(i.e. medics working with other staff groups like nursing).  
This is very important not only in the UK but also for our 
international clients like Dean Healthcare in the US.
We embraced the mobile revolution with our Employee •	
Online Mobile offering, allowing staff to view their rostering 
information from anywhere.
Lastly in Healthcare, we launched HealthRoster BankStaff.  •	
This product represents the best of breed integration of the 
temporary staffing products from the Key IT and Baum Hart 
Partners acquisitions along with Allocate’s own product. 
Over 80 Trusts have now committed to upgrade from their 
original product to HealthRoster BankStaff and satisfactory 
progress is being made with the program to implement the 
customer upgrades.
In Defence, the principle accomplishments included:
Australian Defence Force implementation went live with  •	
the base platform and this has been followed up with two 
enhancement releases to increase platform capability  
in the area of capability management. The enhancement 
programme is focused on extending capability management 
from the upfront decision making support and providing 
support for in year and post activity business processes.
NATO’s HR platform was updated to the latest version of  •	
the MAPS platform in preparation for the first release of the 
new APMS application provided by Allocate Software in 
partnership with Siemens.
Three years ago Allocate embarked upon a project code named 
“Columbus”. The project will see the complete redevelopment 
of our core applications from the ground up, delivering 
improved performance and enhanced functionality. The 
programme is nearing completion. The first product to be built 
on the new platform will be HealthRoster V10 which is also 
nearing completion. The platform, which brings new standards 
of usability, reliability and scalability also provides multi-lingual, 
hosting and SaaS capabilities.
Outlook
The last year for Allocate has been one of considerable success 
in the face of the largest reorganisation in the NHS. Our 
business has prospered and we have continued to secure new 
customers in the NHS and elsewhere as well as retaining and 
growing our existing customers. The markets into which we sell 
around the world show signs of recovery from the recent low 
points and I believe that we are past the worst.
I am confident that we will continue to grow in our principal 
markets this year. I believe that our growth will be led by not 
only our new product offerings, both those developed in-house 
as well as those acquired, but also because of the increased 
focus on customer satisfaction.
We have greatly strengthened the management team this year 
with new heads of Product Development, Marketing and 
Customer Support each of whom brings over 20 years of 
success in high tech and leading, multi-national companies.
Our financial model is now very strong. As at the year end,  
we had over £8m of net cash on the Balance Sheet, recurring 
revenues continue to rise, now 39% of total revenue affording 
much greater visibility into future revenue streams, and giving 
greater assurance as we consider investments both internally 
and externally.
We are now in the enviable position of having a great track 
record of performance, new products and technology to bring 
to our customers, a rapidly expanding footprint across a broad 
range of markets and a very secure Balance Sheet. I am very 
confident that Allocate will have a successful year in 2012.

f inancial report
Revenue in the financial year was £30.1m (2010: £22.0m),  
an increase over last year of 37%. EBITDA was £5.8m  
(2010: £3.7m), an increase over last year of 57%. The  
resulting trading profit margin was 19.3% (2010: 16.8%),  
a good expansion over the previous year. Diluted adjusted  
EPS (excluding amortisation of intangibles, share-based 
payments and the deferred tax adjustment) increased by  
23% to 6.4p (2010: 5.2p). 
Recurring revenues grew by 68% to £11.6m (2010: £6.9m). 
Licence revenue grew by 40% to £13.0m (2010: £9.3m),  
while services and support revenue grew by 34% to  
£16.7m (2010: £12.5m).
 
By sector, Healthcare revenue in the period increased by  
56% to £23.1m (2010: £14.8m), reflecting the impact of the 
previously announced State wide Australian agreement. 
Defence revenues fell by 9% to £4.1m (2010: £4.5m),  
principally due to the large order from the Australian  
Army that was booked in 2010. Maritime revenue fell by  
6% to £1.7m  (2010: £1.8m). 
Organic revenues (excluding the acquisitions of Time Care and 
Dynamic Change which were both acquired part way through 
2010) grew by 15% to £21.9m (2010: £19.1m) during the year. 
EBITDA as a percent of revenue rose to 19.3% in 2011 from 
16.8% in 2010, driven primarily by controlled investment in 
operating costs and also by the change in mix away from  
lower margin services revenue to higher margin recurring, 
support and maintenance revenues.
Diluted adjusted EPS has risen by 23% to 6.4p per share in 2011 
from 5.2p per share in 2010. Cash generated from operations 
grew by 20% to £5.9m in 2011 from £4.9m in 2010. This is a 
conversion rate in excess 100% of EBITDA, as it was in 2010  
and arises as a result of growing recurring revenues, strong 
operating profits and close management of working capital.
Net cash on the Balance Sheet was £8.4m, consisting of  
gross cash of £10.4m and debt of £2.0m. Net cash, gross  
cash and debt at the end of 2010 were, respectively, £2.9m, 
£5.1m and £2.2m.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
report of the directors
The Directors present their annual report on the affairs of the Group, together with the audited accounts and auditors’ report for 
the year ended 31 May 2011.
principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are the development, sale and support of workforce management solutions, and the provision 
of related IT services to major healthcare, defence, government and commercial customers.
Business review
Allocate Software is a leading workforce optimisation software applications provider for global organisations with large, multi-
skilled workforces. 
The business of Allocate is focused principally on the Healthcare market in addition to Defence and others, including Maritime. The 
business has grown significantly over the last five years from annual revenue of £8.3m in 2007 to £30.1m annual revenue in 2011.
Allocate’s revenue is earned through three principal streams, those being licence revenue, professional services revenue and 
support and maintenance revenue. Allocate typically sells its products on a permanent or term licence basis although with the 
acquisition of Dynamic Change in 2010, the Group now has a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) based revenue stream.
Internationally, business has developed a great deal in recent years and 2011 in particular. The Group now has significant customers 
and revenue streams in Australia, those coming from the Healthcare market but also the Defence market as well. Since the year 
end, the Group has completed the acquisitions of Rosteron Pty Ltd in Australia and Zircadian Holdings Limited in the United 
Kingdom, both software suppliers in the Healthcare market. Finally, the Group’s business in Sweden, based upon the acquisition of 
Time Care AB in 2010 continues to grow and to develop well not only in Healthcare, but also local government and other 
commercial markets.
r esults and dividends
The audited accounts for the year ended 31 May 2011, which comprise the Principal Accounting Policies, the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statements of Financial Position, the Statements of 
Changes in Equity, the Cash Flow Statements and the related notes, are set out on pages 28 to 60. The Group profit for the  
year after tax amounted to £797,000 (2010: £1,250,000). The Directors are not proposing the payment of a dividend for the year 
(2010: £nil).

r elations with shareholders
The Company encourages two way communications with both institutional and private investors and responds promptly to  
queries received. All shareholders have at least twenty-one working days notice of the Annual General Meeting. The Directors  
and Committee Chairs are introduced and are available for questions at the Annual General Meeting. Every shareholder receives  
a full annual report each year-end. The preliminary and interim results are published by the Regulatory News Service and on the 
Company’s web site.
Care is exercised to ensure that any price sensitive information is released to all shareholders, institutional and private, at the same 
time in accordance with the Financial Services Authority’s requirements.
c orporate governance
While, as an AIM listed company, there is no requirement to comply with the Combined Code and the Turnbull Guidance, the 
Board has applied the Code and the Guidance as it feels appropriate for a company of this size.
In applying the principle that the Board should maintain a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets, the Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains proper 
accounting records and a system of internal control to provide them with reasonable assurance regarding effective and efficient 
operations, internal financial control and compliance with laws and regulations. However, there are inherent limitations in any 
system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance particularly against misstatement or loss.
Board responsibilities
The Board has adopted a formal schedule which sets out the various matters for which it is responsible and that are reserved to it. 
The Board meets regularly during the year and it met formally on four occasions, plus held five telephone meetings, during the 
period from 1 June 2010 to 31 May 2011.
The Board is responsible for the overall strategy and direction of the Group and for approving acquisitions and disposals, 
management performance, major capital and development expenditure and significant financial matters. It monitors exposure to 
key business risks and reviews the strategic direction of the Company and its subsidiaries, their annual budgets, their progress 
against those budgets and their development programmes. The Board also considers employee issues and key appointments.
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee. Each Committee 
operates within defined terms of reference. The Nomination Committee comprise J I Lang, A R D Pringle and M J S Loveland, 
Non-Executive Directors. The Audit and Remuneration Committees consist of R W King, J I Lang, A R D Pringle and  
M J S Loveland, Non-Executive Directors. The Audit Committee is chaired by R W King, the Nomination Committee is chaired  
by A R D Pringle and the Remuneration Committee is chaired by J I Lang. The Audit Committee is required to meet at least twice  
a year and its primary responsibilities include monitoring internal controls, approving the Group’s accounting policies and 
reviewing the interim and annual reports.  22

Clear management responsibilities have been determined for each subsidiary and division with authorisation limits and 
segregation of duties established for the operating functions of the Group. Financial reports are reported regularly to the Board 
with a comparison against budget in addition to quarterly income statement and cash forecasts. Towards the end of each financial 
year, the annual business plan as well as appropriately detailed functional and business unit budgets for the following year are 
reviewed by the Board.
financia L ris K Manage Ment
The Company uses various financial instruments, which include loans, cash and other items such as trade debtors and trade 
creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the 
Company’s operations.
The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Company to a number of financial risks. These are currency risk, liquidity 
risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are 
summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years.
c urrency risk
The Company is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. In relation to translation risk, so far as possible,  
the assets held in the foreign currency are matched to an appropriate level of borrowings or liabilities in the same currency. 
Approximately 50% (2010: 35%) of the Group’s sales are to customers overseas and in currencies other than UK sterling. The 
Company’s policy is to try to match the timing of all foreign currency transactions to eliminate, so far as possible, currency 
exposures. Foreign exchange differences on transactions relating to foreign currency assets and liabilities are taken to the  
income statement of the Group. 
The table below shows the net of foreign currency assets and liabilities, which expose the Group to foreign exchange risk.

ris K Manage Ment
Given the size of the Company and the close involvement of the Executive Directors in all its activities, the Directors do not 
consider that an internal audit function is necessary.
The Board has identified the following key risks which are controlled as set out below:
c ustomer retention
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining positive and enduring customer relationships. As such, the Board reviews 
customer support performance measures each quarter in addition to monitoring the investment in customer support of both staff 
and others, including systems. Allocate Software plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Business Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
product quality and services delivery
In order to ensure the quality of its product and service delivery the Group has a Quality Management System which is registered 
with the British Standard Institute as ISO 9001 compliant. A formal program has now commenced to extend this program to our 
Swedish and Australian offices. In addition, a formal program is being reviewed to bring the Group into certification under  
ISO 27001.
product development and intellectual property
A new program is being initiated this year to make more robust the Group’s physical operations for server security, network 
security and protection of confidential data. This program will include partnering with a vendor of high repute to provide these 
services to us. In addition, a study will be commissioned to examine the implications of our ownership of intellectual property, 
given the recent acquisitions that have been made, particularly with respect to those located in overseas territories.
Liquidity
The Company seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest 
cash assets safely and profitably. Additionally, the Company has entered into loan arrangements with HSBC. At year end, the loan 
in place had a value of £2m.
A cash forecast is updated regularly and provided to the Board quarterly in order to monitor the Group’s medium term cash 
position and to identify funding requirements as appropriate.
f orecast and pipeline review
The Board regularly reviews the status of the outstanding sales forecast and pipeline. This information is then taken into account in 
considering and evaluating future business and investment activity.
c ost management
As specified in the Board powers, significant investment decisions, including capital expenditure, are considered by the Board for 
authorisation. Appropriate management accounts are prepared and presented monthly and quarterly, which review business 
metrics and the Income Statement, actual and budget, with significant variances identified.
international taxation and foreign exchange
The Board recognises that as the proportion of the Group’s revenues and profits earned outside of the UK rises, that additional 
consideration needs to be given to matters of international taxation and also foreign exchange. As a result of this, the Board has 
commissioned an international transfer pricing study from a firm of experts to be completed in financial year 2012, which will 
provide an appropriate framework for future risk management. 
Key performance indicators
The following financial and non-financial KPI’s are used by the Board and management to monitor the performance of the business:
    2007 2008 2009 2010 2011
Total revenue (£m)    8.3 11.6 15.8 22.0 30.1

Non-financial indicators include:

New customer acquisition and customer retention •	
Employee turnover •	
The above mentioned measures are being initiated this year in a robust and measurable manner and as such, targets for •	
performance will be set as results are reviewed during the course of this year.
going concern B asis
After review of the 2011 financial statements as well as the approved business plan for 2012, the Directors have formed the view, at 
the time of approving the accounts, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts. 24

eMpLo Yees
During the year, the Group has continued to provide employees with relevant information and to seek their views on matters of 
common concern. Priority is given to ensuring that employees are aware of significant matters affecting the Group’s trading 
position and organisational changes, subject to Stock Exchange and other disclosure requirements.
It is the policy of the Group to support the employment of disabled employees where possible, both in recruitment and by 
retention of employees who become disabled while in the employment of the Group.
r eMuneration c o MMittee 
The members of the Committee are Non-Executive Directors. The Company Chairman, also attends on a regular basis.
During the year, the Committee has met formally on four occasions to review and agree Executive Directors’ basic salaries, annual 
bonuses and performance conditions, quarterly performance and award of bonuses, award of options, and the creation of a new 
option scheme. The Committee has taken advice from two external expert sources, consulted a number of major shareholders and 
conducted a survey of remuneration in comparable companies.
On 26 November 2010, shareholders approved a new CSOP and Unapproved Option Scheme.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole within limits set out in the Articles of 
Association.
r eMuneration p o Lic Y
The policy of the Group is to provide levels of remuneration that attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors of the high  
calibre required to achieve the Group’s demanding profitability and growth objectives and to reward them for enhancing 
shareholder value.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management are:
Basic annual salary •	
Annual performance related bonus •	
Pension contribution and benefits in kind •	
Share Option awards •	
directors’ r eMuneration
Basic annual salary
Salaries and bonuses are reviewed annually, at the start of each financial year, and are paid as a fixed cash sum on a monthly basis. 
They are designed to be competitive with salaries and bonuses for positions holding similar levels of responsibility and 
achievement in comparable companies.
a nnual performance related bonus
The Group’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of Executive Directors should be performance related. The 
bonus elements are payable dependent on the Executive Directors achieving the performance criteria set out by the Remuneration 
Committee. In this financial year, the majority of the bonus was dependent on meeting demanding quarterly revenue and profit 
plans. Bonuses were also paid on meeting operating targets in the services sector and also in cash management.
pension contribution and benefits in kind
Ian Bowles, Chris Gale and Allen Swann receive a pension contribution of 5% of basic salary and benefits in kind of car allowance, 
private medical cover, life insurance cover. The value of the pension contributions and benefits in kind is shown in the table of 
Directors’ remuneration below.
share o ptions
Until 26 November 2010, there were three option schemes in operation: the Manpower Software plc Approved and Unapproved 
Executive Share Option Schemes and the Manpower Software plc Enterprise Management Scheme (an EMI scheme). 
On 26 November 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of the Allocate Software plc 2010 Executive Share Option Scheme  
(a CSOP scheme) and the Allocate Software plc 2010 Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
No share options were awarded to Directors during the fiscal year. Allocate Software plc

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial •	
statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as each of the Directors is aware: 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and •	
the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and •	
to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
paYMent of creditors
The Group does not follow any published code or standard on payment practice in respect of any of its suppliers. The Group’s 
policy in respect of the majority of its trade creditors is to negotiate terms and conditions with the suppliers and, provided the 
suppliers comply with these, payments are made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. Where payment terms are 
not specifically agreed, suppliers are paid in accordance with local commercial practice. The average number of day’s credit for the 
year is 33 days (2010: 24 days).

Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements are for the year ended 31 May 2011. They have been prepared in compliance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union 
as at 31 May 2011.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Allocate Software plc, is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and is listed on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is 180 Piccadilly, London, W1J 9ER. 
r estatement of May 2010 statement of f inancial position
On 5 May 2010, the Group acquired Dynamic Change Limited, a UK-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) provider of regulatory 
compliance, corporate governance, risk and performance management for the UK healthcare market, for up to £9,000,000 over 
three years. 
The initial consideration was £4,900,000 in cash and £100,000 in shares of Allocate plc. In addition, deferred consideration of up to 
£4,000,000 in cash would become payable based on the financial performance of Dynamic Change for the 12 month periods 
ending 31 March 2011, 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2013. 
In the financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2010 intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Dynamic Change 
were identified at their provisional fair value.
During the year the Directors finalised their assessment of the conditions at the date of acquisition and, in line with the 
requirements of IFRS 3, the contingent consideration was reduced by £4,000,000 and consequently the intangible assets acquired 
reduced by £2,613,000, the goodwill arising on the acquisition by £2,118,000 and the associated deferred tax by £731,000. This 
restatement has had no impact on the previously reported net assets, or the prior period’s profit and total comprehensive income. 
Further details are set out in note 21.
This restatement has no impact for periods prior to the year ended 31 May 2010, therefore an additional comparative balance sheet 
has not been presented for the Group or the Company.
t he g roup has adopted the following new interpretations, revisions and amendments to ifrs issued by the i nternational 
a ccounting standards Board, which are relevant to and effective for the g roup’s financial statements for the annual period 
beginning 1 June 2010.

a doption of ifrs 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ and consequential amendments to IAS 27, IAS 31, ‘Interests in Joint ventures’, are effective 
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting 
period beginning on or after 1 July 2009, which in the case of the Group is the year ended 31 May 2011. The revised standard 
continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes e.g. all payments to 
purchase a business are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently 
re-measured through profit or loss. There is a choice on an acquisition by acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Acquisition 
costs are expensed as incurred.
Business combinations which took place in prior periods have not been restated and continue to be accounted for under the 
previous version of IFRS 3. 
a doption of ias 27 (revised), ‘ c onsolidated financial statements’
IAS 27 (revised) requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change 
in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains or losses. The standard also specifies the accounting 
when control is lost. Allocate Software plc

‘improvements to ifrs ’ (issued in a pril 2009)
The improvements project contains numerous amendments to IFRS that the IASB considers non-urgent but necessary. 
Improvements to IFRS’s comprise amendments that result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or measurement 
purposes, as well as terminology or editorial amendments related to a variety of individual IFRS standards. The adoption of these 
amendments has not resulted in any significant changes to the Group’s accounting policies.
standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early 
adopted by the g roup in the 31 May 2011 financial statements
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements certain new Standards, amendments and Interpretations to existing 
standards have been published but are not yet effective. The Group has not early adopted any of these pronouncements. The new 
Standards, amendments and Interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements are as follows:

IFRS 9 Financial instruments: Classification and measurement 1 January 2013 
IAS 24 Related party disclosures 1 January 2011
ifrs 9, ‘ f inancial instruments: c lassification and measurement’
In November 2009, the IASB issued the first part of IFRS 9 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 
will ultimately replace IAS 39. The standard requires an entity to classify its financial assets on the basis of the entity’s business 
model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset, and subsequently 
measures the financial assets as either at amortised cost or fair value. The new standard has yet to be adopted by the EU, but is 
expected to be mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This standard is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
In 2010, the Group did not early adopt any new or amended standards and does not plan to early adopt any of the standards 
issued not yet effective.
t he principal accounting policies adopted by the g roup in conformity with ifrs in force at 31 May 2011 are set out below: 
c onsolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of over one-half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated on the date control ceases.
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition of a subsidiary. The cost of an acquisition is measured by 
the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition 
date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
investments
Investments held as non-current assets comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings and are stated at cost less any provision 
for any impairment. 
r evenue recognition
General
Revenue is the fair value of the total amount receivable by the Group for supplies of services which are provided in the normal 
course of business. VAT or similar local taxes and trade discounts are excluded.
Revenue from the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the statement of 
financial position date. The outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;
(c) the stage of completion of the transaction at the statement of financial position date can be measured reliably; and
(d) the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. 30

r evenue recognition continued
Licensing
The Group licenses software under non-cancellable licence agreements. Licence fee revenues are generally recognised when a 
non-cancellable licence agreement has been signed, there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance, there are no 
significant vendor obligations, the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable. 
Where licence fees are attributable to contracts extending over more than one period, revenue is taken based upon the stage of 
completion when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and after allowing for costs to 
completion.
Where appropriate, the Group allocates a portion of contracted fees to post-contract activities covered under the contract, which 
may include installation assistance, training services and first year maintenance.
Professional services
The Group provides professional services which include installation, consulting, and training. Revenues for training or consulting 
services are recognised as the services are performed. 
Product Support
Revenues from support agreements are recognised over the support period.
segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (“CODM”). The CODM is the person or group that allocates resources to and assesses the performance of the operating 
segments of an entity. The Group has determined that its CODM is the Board of Directors of the Group.
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same as those used in its financial 
statements.
f oreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentational currency
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Company’s functional currency and the 
Group’s presentational currency is Sterling.
(b) Transactions and balances
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
reporting period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in 
profit or loss. 
(c) Group companies 
 The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the •	
statement of financial position;
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at actual rates, the average exchange rate is used as an •	
acceptable approximation where there are no significant rate fluctuations during the period; and
on consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities is recognised in •	
other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.
intangible assets
Internally generated intangibles
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the development of software is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
it is probable that the asset will create future economic benefits; •	
the development costs can be measured reliably; •	
the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset can be demonstrated; •	
there is the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it; •	
there is the ability to use or sell the asset; and •	
adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset are available. •	 Allocate Software plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
31
Business Review Business Overview Financial Statements Corporate Governance
Where no intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which 
it is incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its useful economic life, which is 
between 3 – 5 years. 
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangibles acquired as part of a business combination
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a cost 
to the Group of its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations about the 
probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group. Where an intangible asset might be 
separable, but only together with a related tangible or intangible asset, the Group of assets is recognised as a single asset 
separately from goodwill where the individual fair values of the assets in the Group are not reliably measurable. Where the 
individual fair values of the complementary assets are reliably measurable, the Group recognises them as a single asset provided 
the individual assets have similar useful lives.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its useful economic life, which is 
between 3 – 8 years. 
g oodwill
Goodwill arising from business combinations is the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair 
value of the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. It is recognised initially as an intangible asset at cost 
and is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset may have been 
impaired. Details of impairment testing are described in the accounting policies. 
property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method to write off the cost of the asset less any residual value over its useful 
economic life as follows: 
Equipment    33%
Leasehold improvements    25%
Long leasehold property (999 years)  nil
impairment
The Group’s goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable  
cash flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies 
of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management controls the related 
cash flows. 
Individual assets or cash generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets or cash generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value  
in use, based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash generating units, to which 
goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged 
pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for 
indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. 
Leases
Finance leases are recognised as being those that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Assets held under 
finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in payables at the present value of the lease 
payments. They are depreciated over the term of the lease or their useful economic lives, whichever is the shorter. The interest 
element (finance charge) of lease payments is charged to profit or loss over the period of the lease. 32
Allocate Software plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
principa L accounting po Licies CONTINUED
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to profit or loss in the period in 
which they are incurred. The Group does not act as a lessor.
f inancial assets
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are assigned to the appropriate category by management on initial 
recognition, depending on the contractual arrangements. Loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets which are 
recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs. Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment. Any change in 
value resulting from impairment or the reversal of impairment is recognised in profit or loss.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount by which they are written down is determined as 
the difference between the receivables carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.
Derecognition of financial assets occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred and 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least 
at each statement of financial position date whether or not there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired.
f inancial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables. 
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to  
the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less settlement payments. Interest related charges 
are recognised as an expense in finance costs in the income statement.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to  
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Dividend distributions to shareholders are included in ‘Other short term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are approved by 
the shareholders meeting.
income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities in the countries in which the Group carries 
out its operations. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal period and the country to 
which they relate. All changes to current tax liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. 
However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the 
Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short term bank deposits. 
share-based employee compensation
The Group operates equity settled share-based compensation plans (share options) for remuneration of its employees. Allocate Software plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
33
Business Review Business Overview Financial Statements Corporate Governance
All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are measured at their fair values. These 
are indirectly determined by reference to the share option awarded. Their value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions (e.g. profitability or sales growth targets).
All share-based compensation is ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to 
share-based payment reserve, net of deferred tax where applicable. If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the 
expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of shares options expected to 
vest. Non market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs 
from previous estimates. No adjustment to expenses recognised in prior periods is made if fewer share options ultimately are 
exercised than originally estimated.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, up to the nominal value of 
the shares issued are reallocated to share capital with any excess being recorded as additional share premium.
equity
Equity comprises the following:
“Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares. •	
“Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of •	
expenses of the share issue.
“Share-based payment reserve” represents equity-settled share-based employee and non-employee remuneration until such •	
share options are exercised.
“Retained earnings” represents retained profits and losses. •	
“Foreign exchange reserve” represents translation differences arising on the consolidation of investments in overseas •	
subsidiaries.
u se of accounting estimates and judgements
Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience, 
but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and 
estimation is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements and the key areas are summarised 
below.
Judgements in applying accounting policies:
Corporate acquisitions require the Directors to make judgements regarding the value of the net assets that have been acquired. 
Specifically, to value the amount of future service revenues that are likely to flow from the current customer base. 
Management make judgements as to which costs incurred meet the requirements of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ and are therefore 
capitalised. 
Sources of estimation uncertainty:
Depreciation and amortisation rates are based on estimates of the useful economic lives and residual values of the assets involved. 
The assessment of these useful economic lives is made by projecting the economic lifecycle of the asset and, particularly for 
computer software intangibles, this is subject to alteration as a result of product development and innovation. Depreciation and 
amortisation rates are changed where economic lives are re-assessed and technically obsolete items written off where necessary. 
Refer to notes 11 and 13.
Estimates are required as to asset carrying values and impairment charges.
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the 
inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Group has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable 
life of options granted and the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Group is a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
Full details are shown in note 18.
Business combinations:
On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are included in the consolidated statement of financial 
position at their provisional fair values. In measuring fair value, management uses estimates about future cash flows and discount 
rates, however, actual results may vary. Management also uses a best estimate to determine the future payable contingent 
consideration. Details of acquired assets and liabilities are given in note 21.
Contingent consideration:
Where contingent consideration is payable in cash and discounting would have a material effect, the liability is discounted to its 
present value. Where the deferred consideration is contingent and dependent upon future trading performance, an estimate of 
the present value of the likely consideration payable is made. See note 21. 34

Under IFRS 8 there is a requirement to show operating profit and total assets for the operating segments, however, attributable 
expenses and total assets cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis and, as a result, the analysis is limited to the Group revenue 
which is then reconciled to the profit before tax. 
Revenues from external customers in the Group’s domicile, the United Kingdom, as well as its major markets, the European Union 
and the USA, have been identified on the basis of the customer’s geographical location. Non-current assets are allocated based on 
their physical location.
Revenue arises from customers in the following locations:

There was 1 customer (2010: nil) who contributed in excess of 10% of total revenues. Their aggregate contribution to revenue 
amounted to 14% of revenue.
The internal reporting of the Group’s performance does not require that statement of financial position information is gathered on 
the basis of the business streams ‘Licenses’, ‘Services’ and ‘Other’ reported above. This information is therefore not accessible and, 
as a result, the segmental analysis does not include statement of financial position details. However, the Group operates within 
discrete geographical markets and the non-current assets of the Group are split between these locations:

a djusted earnings per ordinary share
An adjusted earnings per share has been calculated in addition to the post tax earnings per share which eliminates the effects of 
share-based payment, amortisation of intangibles and the deferred tax adjustment. It has been calculated to allow shareholders to 
gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group. The basis of the calculation of the basic and adjusted profit 
per share is set out below:

r estatement
The basis of this calculation has been changed since the prior year, as the Directors consider this presentation of EPS to be a better 
measure of the Group’s performance. The comparative adjusted EPS has been restated so as to be presented on the same basis as 
the current year figures. 46

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
n otes to the financia L state Ments CONTINUED
g oodwill 12. continued
The recoverable amount of all CGU’s has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a one year period, followed by an extrapolation of 
expected cash flows for a five year period. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth 
rates appropriate to the industry. This growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry in which the 
CGU operates.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are as follows:
       Dynamic  Time 
       Change Care
5 year growth rate       13.6% 12.5%
Discount rate       14.0% 14.0%
The projected performance of the businesses is driven by the acquisition of new customers, cross-sell and up sell of products into 
complimentary customer bases and also maintenance of existing customer renewals. The cross-sell and upsell opportunities will 
increase more gradually for Time Care AB as compared to UK acquisitions such as Dynamic Change Limited.
Management has determined the key assumptions based on their significant experience of the customer base in the UK, and for 
Sweden the historical performance of that business. The growth rates are based on a combination of historical performance and 
on management’s judgement on the cross-selling opportunities afforded by long standing customer relationships in addition to a 
go to market model of proven endurance. 
Impact of possible changes in key assumptions
Dynamic Change CGU
If the discount rate had been 1% higher than management’s estimates this would have resulted in a reduction in value in use of this 
CGU by £236,000.
Time Care CGU
If the discount rate had been 1% higher than management’s estimates this would have resulted in a reduction in value in use of this 
CGU by £921,000.

r eserves 18. 
Nature and purpose of reserves
Retained earnings – comprises the accumulated retained profits from current and prior periods.
Share-based payments – the share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the grant date fair value of options issued to 
employees but not exercised.
Share-Based Payments
There are four share option schemes in operation: an HMRC Approved Scheme (“the Approved Scheme”), two schemes which has 
not been approved by HMRC (“the Unapproved Schemes”) and an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (“the EMI Scheme”) 
which complies with the requirements of HMRC. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, 
the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the options become available to exercise.
Share options vest subject to demanding earnings per share targets being achieved over specified performance periods.
The fair values of the services received in exchange for share-based payments were calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. 
The inputs into the model were as follows:
        Expected 
  Share price Exercise Expected Expiry  Risk free dividend

The Company had a two year revolving facility secured against the assets of the UK companies in the Group, which it took out to 
fund the acquisition of Dynamic Change Limited. The amount outstanding at the statement of financial position date is £2,000,000 
(2010: £2,000,000). The interest rate is 2% above HSBC bank base rate. As this facility was due to expire in May 2012, this has been 
presented as a current liability on the statement of financial position (2010: non-current liability).
Subsequent to the year end the Company has negotiated a new £4,000,000 revolving facility, which replaces this facility. The new 
facility, which has been fully drawn down, will expire in August 2013.
In the prior year the Group had a mortgage secured on a long leasehold property owned by its subsidiary, Allocate Software 
Technology Systems Limited. The amount outstanding at the statement of financial position date is £nil (2010: £172,000).

Dynamic Change Limited
On 5 May 2010, the Company acquired Dynamic Change Limited, a UK-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) provider of regulatory 
compliance, corporate governance, risk and performance management for the UK healthcare market, for up to £9,000,000 over 
three years. 
The initial consideration was £4,900,000 in cash and £100,000 in shares of Allocate Software plc. In addition, deferred consideration 
of up to £4,000,000 in cash would become payable based on the financial performance of Dynamic Change for the periods ending  
31 March 2011, 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2013. 
As at 31 May 2010, the Group carried out a provisional fair value exercise recognising values for intangible assets and goodwill  
and offset by a deferred tax liability and deferred payments. Management have now revised those provisional fair values by 
re-examining the underlying assumptions in the valuation model. As a result of this exercise, the provisional fair values have been 
reassessed as follows:

There is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of these financial assets and financial liabilities.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies were fully reviewed by 
the Board during the year and no significant changes were required.

Group  
Interest rate risk
The Group finances itself through a combination of equity and short term debt. The Group’s policy is to borrow on a floating rate 
basis and, if appropriate, it will enter into arrangements to fix the cost of borrowings. The Group has not used interest rate 
derivatives in the year.
At 31 May 2011 the Group’s financial assets, other than short term receivables, amounted to cash and cash deposits totalling 
£10,398,000 (2010: £5,042,000).
At 31 May 2011 the Company had a loan secured on the UK assets of the Group, which it took out to fund the acquisition of 
Dynamic Change Limited. The amount outstanding at the statement of financial position date is £2,000,000 (2010: £2,000,000).  
The interest rate is 2% above HSBC bank base rate.
The Directors do not intend to use swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rate movements as any likely movement in 
the interest rate of this will not be significant. A movement of plus or minus 1% in the interest rate charged on borrowings will result 
in a reduction or increase in profit and equity of £20,000 (2010: plus or minus £22,000).
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.  
In order to minimise this risk the Group endeavours only to deal with companies and public sector bodies which are demonstrably 
creditworthy and this, together with the aggregate financial exposure, is continuously monitored. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk is the value of the outstanding amount of the Group’s financial assets £20,100,000 (2010: £12,921,000).
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are from government health, defence, education and local authorities. The Group 
has trade receivables resulting from sales of products and services, which management consider to be of low risk, other receivables 
consist predominantly of deposits and prepayments. Management does not consider there is any concentration of risk within 
either trade or other receivables.
Deposits of cash are placed only with financial institutions whose credit rating is high. 
Liquidity risk
Deposits with the Group’s bankers are placed when cash is available surplus to immediate requirements. In addition, the Group has 
a loan facility of £2,000,000 (2010: a loan facility of £2,000,000). At the statement of financial position date the amount drawn down 
was £2,000,000, being the loan used to fund the acquisition of Dynamic Change Limited. 
The provision of cash for the payment of day to day business commitments is carefully monitored and forecasts are made of future 
cash requirements. There are no significant single amounts due for payment in the foreseeable future other than those arising in 
the normal course of business. The loan taken out to fund the acquisition of Dynamic Change Limited was repayable on or before  
4 May 2012, but subsequent to the year end has been renegotiated (refer note 19). 
Financial liabilities mature according to the following schedule:
     Within  One to Two to Over

Capital risk management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an adequate 
return to shareholders. The Group will also seek to minimise the cost of capital and attempt to optimise the capital structure which 
currently comprises equity raised through the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The details of the Group’s issued share 
capital and any share issues are disclosed in note 17. 
The Group monitors cash balances and prepares regular forecasts which are reviewed by the Board. Currently no dividends are 
paid to shareholders and capital for further development of the Group’s activities is achieved by share issues and organic growth.  58

The Company has trade receivables resulting from sales of products and services, which the management consider to be of low 
risk, other receivables consist predominantly of deposits and prepayments. A substantial majority of trade receivables are due 
from national or local government bodies in the health and defence sectors. The management do not consider that there is any

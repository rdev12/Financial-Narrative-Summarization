I am pleased to present the financial results 
for the year ended 31 December 2007.

This was our first full year of operating 
without our former largest market, the 
US. We have successfully re-focused  
our operations into other markets with 
fantastic results. Our success is 
manifested by our recent return to the 
FTSE 250 and by industry accolades 
such as Best Betting and Gaming 
C o m p a n y at the Leisure Report Awards 
2007, C a s i n o 	 o f 	 t h e 	 Y e a r and Best Land-

Our first ever acquisition was completed 
in May with the purchase of the online 
Bingo business of Globalcom Ltd., and 
has proven to be a great success with 
excellent financial results following its 
integration into 888’s offering umbrella. 
The year was marked as a year of 
innovation and initiatives – we have 
expanded our business model by 
offering our full service on a “white label” 
basis to selected business partners as 
demonstrated by our strategic alliances

with Rileys Poker in the UK and Tower 
Torneos in Latin America, obtained an 
online sportsbetting licence in Italy, 
introduced a targeted local offering in 
Asia through Live Dealer and released 
our first ever branded Video Slot 
Machines to name a few. 
I would like to thank all 888 employees, 
our management and our customers for 
making 2007 an outstanding year. 
Financial results
2007 was a phenomenal year for us. 
NGR increased 36% to US$213 million 
(2006: US$157 million) with Total 
Operating Income increase of 38% to 
US$217 million (2006: US$157 million) 
driven by turnover growth from both our 
core Casino and Poker products and 
from the introduction of new products, 
particularly Bingo. Profit Before Tax* 
showed remarkable growth and 
increased 106% to US$46 million (2006: 
US$22 million).
  Annual Report & Accounts 2007  Responsible gaming is a fundamental pillar to our business.  
Our aim is to ensure our services are used responsibly.
Dividend
Given our strong financial results, in 
addition to our interim dividend of 1.8 
cents per share paid in October 2007, 
the Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 5.0 cents per share. 
Our values
During 2007 we outlined and 
implemented our core values that 
represent the philosophy by which we 
operate. We take pride in our ability to 
consistently maintain them. Our values 
were implemented across all parts of the 
organisation, and comprise excellence, 
innovation, caring, customer centricity, 
leading and collaboration. 
Responsible gaming
Responsible gaming is a fundamental 
pillar of our business. Our aim is to 
ensure our services are used 
responsibly, and are fair and transparent. 
We work hard to raise awareness 
through education and to provide our 
staff with first rate tools for ensuring a 
responsible gaming environment. In 
2007, we were awarded for the first time 
“Gamcare” certification, recognising 
888’s dedication to customer protection. 
We also launched our responsible 
gaming website (www.888responsible.
com) where we offer comprehensive and 
easily accessible information about 
responsible gaming practices, dealing 
with problem gambling, preventing 
underage gambling and more. 
Outlook
Building on a great 2007, we have 
introduced our new Bingo brand, 
888ladies, and launched 888sport,  
our Sportsbook offering. Quarter 1 of 
2008 started well across our business, 
particularly in our new Bingo and 
Sportsbook offering. Your Board  
believes we are well positioned to 
develop and grow our business in this 
exciting and expanding space for the 
foreseeable future.

Our success in 2007 was based on a clear 
strategy and business focus coupled with 
great execution.
* 	 E x c l u d i n g 	 s h a r e 	 b e n e fi t 	 c h a r g e s 	 o f 	 U S $ 7 . 8 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 0 6 : 	 U S $ 8 . 8 	 m i l l i o n ) . 	 C o n t i n u i n g 	 o p e r a t i o n s .
2007 was a year of transformation for 
888, in which we had to restructure the 
business following the enactment in the 
United States of the Unlawful Internet 
Gaming Enforcement Act (“UIGEA”) in 
October 2006, which resulted in us losing 
55% of our revenues almost overnight. 
I am very pleased to report that we  
have now successfully completed the 
restructuring and repositioning of the 
business and have delivered very strong 
results for the year, both in terms of 
revenue and profit. We have emerged a 
better company, clearer in our strategy, 
more diverse and complete in our 
offering, with a stronger presence in  
more markets and much greater local, 
“in-country” focus. We have also 
restructured our senior operational 
management team, with a mix of 
experienced managers from within the 
Group and seasoned executives recruited 
from other industries, enabling us to 
innovate where the industry has been 
slow to change in recent years. 
The financial results speak for 
themselves: the 106% Profit Before Tax* 
growth to US$46 million and 38%. Total 
Operating Income growth to 
US$217 million demonstrate the resilience 
of our business, the strength of our team  
and the continued attractiveness of our 
business model. With basic earnings per 
share* of 12.6 cents and strong 2007 we 
have fully recovered from the effects of 
UIGEA. With various strategic initiatives 
now under way, we see a bright future for 
the business. 
Gigi Levy 
Chief Executive Officer
These are excellent results and given  
our strong financial performance, we  
will be paying a final dividend of 5.0 cents 
per share, in addition to the interim 
dividend of 1.8 cents per share paid in 
October 2007.
Delivering on our strategy 
Our success in 2007 was based on a 
clear strategy and business focus 
coupled with great execution. Our 
strategy was founded on the same 
principles that had made us successful in 
previous years but building on these core 
principles in order to incorporate several 
new directions allowing us to accelerate 
growth. We continued focusing on 
acquiring and retaining valuable 
customers by delivering a compelling, 
localised, innovative, unique and 
entertaining customer experience while 
embarking on new initiatives. These 
initiatives included strategic partnerships, 
the use of new and innovative marketing 
channels, the integration of third party 
games, the introduction of enhanced 
communication and entertainment 
features and a revolutionary gaming 
environment in which customers can 
access all games from a single location. 
2007 was a phenomenal year in terms of 
the development of our offering. We 
introduced an “industry first” with our first 
fully-integrated gaming environment, 
which allows access to all of our games 
from one location. This approach clearly 
enhanced revenues from customers who 
were able, for the first time, to play any 
game they wanted without limitation and 
enabled us to better cross-sell and up- Annual Report & Accounts 2007  sell to our customers. The success of  
this approach is now proven and we  
will continue to provide an integrated 
environment to more customers and add 
more games into this environment. 
Another significant development effort 
centred on opening our platform to easy 
integration with games from other 
providers. Whilst we will continue 
developing our own core games and 
technological infrastructure, we will 
carefully select “best-of-breed” partners 
to provide us with additional games, 
particularly those with a local flavour, 
which will assist us in penetrating local 
markets. The first of these games is being 
introduced and we plan to leverage this 
infrastructure investment and integrate 
various additional games in the coming 
years, with a number already in the 
pipeline for 2008. This capability will 
enable us to leverage the Internet’s “long 
tail” phenomena as we have no “real 
estate” costs in putting more games into 
our software client. The introduction of 
additional games, even if they will only  
be played by a small percentage of our 
customers, will have a positive return  
on investment. 
One of the key focuses of our 
development effort was the integration of 
a Sport betting platform into our offering. 
This process was successfully completed 
towards the end of the year and the 
service was recently launched. We have 
also introduced a live-dealer solution with 
our Asian partner, Entertasia, which will 
increase our presence in the Asian 
market. Early 2008 saw the introduction 
of 888ladies which is positioned to 
appeal to a whole new market for the 
Group. With these new products we now 
have a strong and complete portfolio, 
with our business based on the four core 
pillars of Casino, Poker, Sportsbetting 
and Bingo together with supplementary 
Backgammon and Live-Dealer products. 
During the year we managed to upgrade 
and improve all of our existing platforms, 
introducing new Casino and Poker 
versions with additional games, innovative 
features and a better overall interactive 
customer experience. One such 
enhancement was the introduction of our 
first-ever branded game – the “Blond 
Legend” video Slot which was an 
immediate success, and another was our 
innovative Poker client allowing users to 
choose a 3D or 2D view with a rotating 
table and various additional features. 
Finally, given the focus on geographic 
expansion, we succeeded in completing 
the translation and localisation of all our 
Casino games into the 14 languages we 
currently support on top of expanding our 
language proposition with two brand new 
languages. This major effort resulted in 
an immediate increase in revenues in 
markets which previously were not 
supported by a fully localised product. 
As in previous years, we were proud  
to see our innovative, market-leading 
offering being selected for various 
awards, including the prestigious C a s i n o	
o f 	 th e 	 Y e a r award both in the eGaming 
and the Online Gambling Awards. 
From a marketing perspective, 2007 was 
focused on additional brand building, 
innovative marketing tools, loyalty 
increasing programmes and a significant 
drive on local and integrated marketing 
efforts. Overall we had a very good year 
in which we managed to grow our 
business whilst keeping marketing spend 
at 33% of NGR.
In terms of brand building, we have 
invested in re-launching the 888 brand in 
conjunction with our “Enjoy the Game” 
tagline across all media channels and 
markets. This new campaign delivered 
our best ever brand awareness as 
reflected in surveys conducted in the  
UK and Spain. This campaign was a 
milestone in our brand building efforts.
For the first time ever, in 2007 we invested 
in web 2.0 marketing channels, including 
viral campaigns based on a combination 
of professionally crafted and user 
generated content. We have also 
integrated various additional innovative 
online marketing tools in various areas, 
especially in the search engine domain, 
which allowed us to keep our marketing 
costs within the challenging budget that 
had been set.
Customer Relationship Management 
(“CRM”) has always been one of our core 
competencies with our industry leading 
service levels and the personal service 
we are known to provide to our 
customers. 2007 saw further 
enhancements with the publication of the 
first two issues of our premium customer 
magazine “Eight”, our improved loyalty 
programme and implementation of 
improved communication and 
promotional tools. Coupled with our 
world-famous VIP programme, our CRM 
approach has ensured a very successful 
2007 in terms of customers’ lifetime value 
and loyalty. 
Our marketing success in 2007 relied fully 
on a localised and integrated approach. 
We implemented better co-ordination 
across the Group and comprehensive 
monitoring of our activities in every 
market. We signed more local TV deals 
across Europe, and benefited from 
extensive international coverage of our 
successful sponsorships of the World 
Snooker Championship and Sevilla 
Football Club. The outcome of these 
localisation efforts is apparent in our 
numbers, which show far better 
geographical diversification, with our 
European market increasing to 42% of 
our business in 2007 compared to 36% 
in 2006. We are most satisfied with our 
growth across various markets and will 
continue investing in localised integrated 
marketing efforts in 2008 as we continue 
to penetrate yet more new markets.  888 Holdings Public Limited Company  The most significant strategic move in  
the year was our decision to expand  
our pure business-to-consumer business 
model with a combined approach  
which includes working with carefully 
selected strategic business-to-business 
partners. Under the “Powered by 888” 
endorsement, we have launched a new 
line of business as a service provider to 
virtual operators. We launched three new 
partnerships in 2007 with Rileys in the 
UK, Tower Torneos in Latin America and 
LuckyAce in Europe. More such 
partnerships will follow with several 
already in the pipeline.
This new area of our business received a 
significant boost with our acquisition of 
the Bingo assets of Globalcom in May 
2007. This transaction positioned 888 at 
the forefront of online Bingo service 
providers, serving leading business 
partners such as Cashcade, operating 
Foxy Bingo, Bingo Scotland and a 
number of other well-known brands. We 
have already secured additional Bingo 
deals, including with WinkBingo, a newly 
launched Bingo network.
While the core of our business remains in 
the business-to-consumer area, this new 
approach enables us to better leverage 
our investments and generate additional 
revenues and profit streams from market 
segments where penetration would 
require significant additional effort and 
marketing spend. This activity has already 
contributed to our bottom line in 2007 
and is expected to grow in importance in 
the coming years as we announce new 
deals. Our success resulted in the Best 
L a n d - L i n k s 	 P a r tn e r s h i p award in the 
eGaming awards is a clear indication of 
the innovative nature of our approach in 
this area.
During 2007 we successfully integrated 
our acquired Bingo assets which now 
work as a seamless part of our business. 
On top of this successful integration, we 
have managed to accelerate the growth 
of the Bingo business which grew 
phenomenally throughout the year. This 
now proven ability to acquire value-
enhancing assets and integrate them into 
our business underlines the validity of our 
M&A approach and therefore we will 
continue to look for the right opportunities 
to supplement our strong organic growth. 
In addition to our strong financial  
results, our overall performance was 
acknowledged in our securing, for the 
first time, the Best Betting and Gambling 
C o m p a n y award in the 2007 Leisure 
Report awards. 
Finally, we continue to be indebted to our 
fantastic team of employees who have 
succeeded in delivering the outstanding 
2007 results. We have a phenomenal 
team at all levels, with extremely talented 
individuals who are led by a world-class 
management team. To maintain this team 
and ensure their ongoing motivation we 
continue to strive to be the employer of 
choice. These efforts have resulted in 
successful new recruits into the Group. 
Our employees will remain a key part of 
our focus in the years to come. 
Regulation
While the regulatory landscape remains 
unstable in some regions, 2007 saw 
some positive developments. In Europe, 
the European Court of Justice’s ruling  
in the Placanica case restated the 
importance of EU regulations to our 
industry. This decision, together with the 
recent infringement actions and position 
letters from the European Commission, 
marks a very positive development 
enabling EU licensed operators, such as 
888, to provide their services throughout 
the European Union. Moreover, we have 
seen a trend throughout the year of 
additional European jurisdictions 
embarking on a path to license and 
regulate online gaming, a route which  
we clearly welcome. 
Outside of Europe we have seen initial 
signs of positive regulation both in Asia-
Pacific and Latin America, where newly 
introduced regulations in some 
jurisdictions could allow us to benefit from 
working in a locally licensed environment. 
As previously stated, we see these to be 
very positive developments as we 
continue to pursue a clear regulatory 
framework for all jurisdictions in which  
we operate. We will continue to monitor 
the regulatory landscape and to look  
for opportunities to operate in  
regulated markets.
As stated in our announcement dated 
5 June 2007, we have initiated preliminary 
discussions with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York relating to our activity in  
the US prior to the signing of the UIGEA. 
It is too early to assess any particular 
outcome of these discussions.
Responsible gaming
2007 was also a turning point in our 
approach to responsible gaming.  
Whilst 888 has always been a leader  
in supporting the prevention of problem 
and underage gambling we recruited  
a dedicated executive to handle these 
important issues. We have, as a result, 
introduced both enhanced tools and 
policies giving us an even tighter control 
on problem and underage gamblers. 
These efforts were acknowledged  
by Gamcare who awarded us their 
responsible gambling certificate. 
Recently, our educational efforts 
developed even further with the 
introduction of www.888responsible.
com, a website dedicated for providing 
access to tools which identify and deal 
with problem gambling. This industry-first 
educational effort and our additional 
activities in the area mark our continued 
commitment to prevent problem and 
underage gambling.
Our 2008 focus
2008 will see the continued execution of 
our strategy with accelerated innovation 
facilitated by the investment made in our 
infrastructure in 2007. Now that we have 
delivered all of the required products, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’s REVIEW cont.
Best operator of the year – 2007 Annual Report & Accounts 2007  developed integration capabilities and

a far deeper localised offering, we

these assets. 
In terms of our offering, our plans include 
the introduction of several new games, 
with a strong focus on localised games 
which will continue to support our push 
into new markets. We will continue  
to develop our relationships with third 
party games providers to ensure that  
we will not miss any exciting, potential 
“hit” games. We will also introduce 
various new innovative features such as 
increased personalisation, tournaments 
around Casino games and more  
content and entertainment across  
our product portfolio.
From a marketing perspective, 2008 will 
see further investment in our brand and 
the use of additional innovative marketing 
channels. We will also introduce some 
major events such as the recently 
launched US$3 million World Poker 
Crown Poker tournament and a major 
event planned for 8 August 2008 – the 
“888” date! 
On the business-to-business front, we 
aim to sign and launch more strategic 
partnership deals as a means to 
accelerate our growth. 
Outlook
2008 has started well, especially with  
our recently introduced female-oriented 
Bingo proposition, 888ladies. This 
innovative website, which already boasts 
thousands of active customers daily, is 
performing above our expectations. 
The recent launch of our Sportsbetting 
proposition, 888sport, is already 
generating revenues and, coupled  
with several more planned product 
launches, we expect our offering to 
continue being one of the main  
growth drivers of our business.
With our current strategic partnerships 
performing well, we are progressing with 
additional potential partners and we 
expect at least one new partnership to  
be launched in 2008. 
Given the positive start to 2008, the 
successful launch of 888ladies and 
888sport, our strategic partnership deals, 
current trading and our clear business 
strategy and focus, we are confident in 
delivering future growth during 2008.

In 2007, 888 continued to follow its strategy 
of expanding and diversifying its business. 
Introduction 
888 Holdings plc is one of the world’s 
most popular online gaming  
entertainment companies. 888 owns  
and operates various world renowned 
websites, including www.888.com, www.
Casino-on-Net.com, www.pacificpoker.
com, www.888ladies.com and 
www.888sport.com. 
In 2007, 888 continued to follow its 
strategy of expanding and diversifying its 
business on the basis of this strong 
foundation. During the year, 888 acquired 
the business and assets of a market 
leading Bingo network operator, it added 
the in-house developed Backgammon to 
its offering and an online Sportsbook 
licensed in Italy. Recent additions include 
the global rollout of an international 
Sportsbook offering in six European 
countries. In a key strategic move, 888 has 
also expanded its business model, 
leveraging its existing assets and brand 
reputation, by licensing its software and 
unique services to carefully selected 
“white label” partners who allow 888 to 
penetrate new markets. 888 is indeed the 
home of online gaming entertainment. 
2007 was 888’s first full year without a 
contribution from the US market, after the 
cessation of its operations in that market in 
October 2006. It was a year characterised 
by rapid growth, with a 38% increase in 
Total Operating Income and a 106% 
increase in Profit Before Tax*, as the Group 
refocused its activities on non-US markets 
by localising its product offerings and 
releasing more games in more languages 
than ever before.
 
Aviad Kobrine 
Chief Financial Officer
The addition of Casino games into the 
Poker client has dramatically increased the 
revenue stream from 888’s traditional core 
product, and has signalled continued 
progress towards the ultimate goal of 
providing all of its offerings through a 
single, unified client. In addition, 888’s 
offering benefited from the addition of 
Backgammon to its suite of games, and 
also enhanced the appeal of existing 
games by adding both contemporary and 
themed games such as the sports themed 
“rough rugby” and Marilyn Monroe 
inspired “Blond Legend” Video Slots. 
The immediate success of 888’s new 
white label strategy was demonstrated by 
the partnerships developed with Tower 
Torneos in Latin America, Rileys Poker in 
the UK, and Lucky Ace in Europe.
888’s Italian customers have enjoyed the 
launch of a dedicated online Sportsbook 
proposition which has not only provided 
invaluable experience from 888’s first foray 
into this product type but also, through  
its licensing by the Italian Government, 
further validated 888’s regulatory and 
licensing credentials. 
In addition to its organic growth and in-
house development, 888 completed  
its first ever acquisition through the 
acquisition of the assets comprising the 
online Bingo business of Globalcom Ltd.  
in May 2007. This business has now been 
successfully integrated into 888’s existing 
operations.

888 has achieved a great deal in 2007 and will continue to explore all 
opportunities to meet its goal of becoming the largest community of 
people who play online for money.
At the end of 2007, 888 entered into a deal 
with Blue Square which allows the Group 
to offer a sportsbetting product to all of its 
customers in early 2008. This deal 
completes the Group’s aim to provide a 
“one stop” betting and gaming proposition 
to its customers. As an added benefit, 888 
has moved closer towards its goal of 
providing a full multi-currency offering. 
The Bingo acquisition and the partnership 
with Blue Square represent new, 
previously unexplored growth avenues. 
The addition of the Bingo business is the 
first time 888 has opted for growth by 
acquisition, and demonstrates its ability to 
identify, execute and integrate profitable 
external opportunities. 
2007 was 888’s tenth anniversary and,  
as in previous years, 888’s excellence  
and market leading position was 
acknowledged by third parties. 888 was 
recently awarded Best Betting and

Total Operating Income and NGR
The Group achieved strong financial 
results in 2007 with NGR increasing by 
36% to US$213.4 million (2006: 
US$157.0 million), Total Operating 
Income increasing by 38% to US$216.9 
million (2006: US$157.0 million), EBITDA

increasing by 177% to US$45.5 million

Tax
1
 from continuing operations 
increasing 106% to US$45.8 million 
(2006: US$22.2 million). 
NGR increased strongly in both Casino 
and Poker, and also from the introduction 
of new products (“Emerging Offerings”). 
These products, particularly the newly 
acquired Bingo business (since 17 May 
2007), generated US$14.4 million NGR in 
2007. In 2007, the Group introduced, for 
the first time, the option for customers to 
transact in their local currency, and as a 
result, other operating income has been 
generated representing fees from 
processing customers’ cross-currency 
deposits and withdrawals effectively 
reducing costs associated with payment 
service providers.
Geographical segmentation 
As the table below illustrates, in 2007, 
Europe (excluding the UK) showed 
dramatic growth of 58%, with strong 
growth from both Poker and Casino, 
followed by the UK, which grew by  
32%. The Rest of the World, mostly 
attributable to the Asia-Pacific region, 
also grew rapidly by 35% compared to 
2006. Growth in the Americas (excluding 
the USA) was modest. 
As a result of the strong revenue growth 
during the year in Europe (excluding the 
UK), this region now represents 42% of 
888’s total operating income compared 
to 36% in 2006.

Casino 
The Casino business was one of the 
main drivers for the Group’s strong 
revenue growth in 2007, with a NGR 
increase of 33% to US$118.1 million 
(2006: US$88.8 million). The continued 
localisation of the Casino software client 
by providing the offering in additional 
languages and the introduction of the 
Casino games into the Poker client  
was an instant success, and was the 
source of much of this growth. This 
growth demonstrates the high  
potential for cross-selling services  
in a unified offering.

Casino growth was driven predominantly 
by the popularity of 888’s ever expanding 
selection of Video slot machines. Video 
slot bet levels increased year on year by 
a staggering 108%. It is expected that 
this trend will continue well into 2008 and 
is anticipated to be boosted by the 
planned integration of a wide variety of 
new third party games. The continued 
popularity of Roulette and Blackjack 
supported continued growth that has 
resulted in an improvement to overall 
house edge on Casino games; House 
edge increased from 2.9% in 2006 to 
3.1% in 2007. The Group will continue to 
encourage customers to migrate towards 
its higher margin games.
Poker 
The Poker business also delivered strong 
growth in 2007 with NGR increase of 
18% to US$80.8 million (2006: US$68.2 
million). This growth was driven mainly by 
the popular Texas Hold”em and Omaha 
ring games which appeal to a broad 
spectrum of customers. The attraction  
of ring games resulted in a 25% growth 
in bet levels compared to 2006. The 
Group’s tournaments benefited from  
the introduction in June of “re-buy”   Annual Report & Accounts 2007  and “add-on” functionality. Poker  
growth was also driven by the 
introduction of the white label business 
model – the launch of Rileys Poker  
and the Tower Torneos offering.
For consistency, NGR from Poker 
excludes NGR generated by customers 
playing Casino games from the Poker 
platform, which increased overall revenue 
and helped retain customers for longer. 
Emerging offerings
Emerging Offerings contributed 
US$14.4 million of NGR during the year, 
representing 6.8% of total NGR. This 
revenue is primarily generated by the 
Bingo business (acquired in May 2007), 
but also by the newly introduced 
Backgammon offering (April 2007). It is 
expected that these new games will 
generate higher NGR in 2008.
The Group’s Bingo business generates 
royalty revenue both from its position as 
a software licensor and network provider 
to a number of popular household name 
brands such as www.thinkbingo.com 
and www.foxybingo.com, and also NGR 
from customers playing on the Group’s 
own websites including www.888ladies.
com and www.bingoballroom.com. 
Over the short time that the 
Backgammon has been available, its 
main benefit has been as a retention  
tool and an expansion to the range of 
entertainment products on offer, enabling 
the Group to service a dedicated market 
segment, allowing casual customers the 
opportunity to test their skills. 
Expenses
Effective cost control during the year  
has resulted in slower expense growth 
than revenue growth, with expenses
2
 
increasing by only 22% compared to 
38% total operating income growth. 
Salaries and benefits, representing  
the largest component of operating 
expenses, increased by 30% to 
US$31.0 million (2006: US$23.8 million).  
The additional headcount related to the 
Bingo business and the expansion of the 
Group’s regional focus, were a major 
source of this increase. Modest salary 
increase and headcount increases 
across the business contributed  
the remainder. 
The second largest cost item in 
operating expenses is commissions paid 
to Payment Service Providers, which 
totalled US$13.4 million (2006: US$9.1 
million) representing 6.3% of NGR (2006: 
5.8%). When stripping out Emerging 
Offerings, this ratio stands, in 2007, at a 
comparable 6.0%.
The Group places strong emphasis  
on risk management procedures,  
which resulted in a decrease in its 
chargeback ratio to 1.3% of NGR  
in 2007 (2006: 1.6%).
Intangible assets from the Bingo 
acquisition were amortised during the 
year, which contributed an additional 
non-cash expense of US$1.6 million  
(2006: nil) to operating expenses.
The continued investment in the Group’s 
products aimed at expanding the range 
and appeal of its offering has resulted in 
an increase in research and development 
expenses in 2007 by 21% to US$23.5 
million (2006: US$19.4 million). This 
increase directly relates to headcount 
expansion and salary increase in order  
to attract and retain a highly skilled 
workforce, as the Group develops most 
its proprietary software internally.
 
Marketing expenses during the year 
reached US$70.9 million (2006: US$51.0 
million), representing a stable rate of 33% 
of NGR, demonstrating sustained 
marketing efficiency. In 2007, the Group 
focused on a rapid expansion of its 
affiliate channels. This expansion 
enabled cost control per new customer 
acquisition and a means of quickly 
penetrating new markets. Attracting 
valuable new customers at the right  
cost is a key driver of 888’s business 
profitability. In 2007 the Group continued 
to be focused on attracting, and 
retaining, customers from selected 
segments which are most profitable and 
optimising the recruitment channel to 
cost. During the year 888’s marketing 
operations recruited more than 260,000 
new Casino and Poker First Time 
Depositors (“FTDs”) from more than a 
million new real money registrations with 
an average Cost Per Acquisition (“CPA”) 
in 2007 of US$225 (2006: US$183)
3
.
Administrative expenses
4
 decreased by 
15% to US$16.9 million (2006: US$19.8 
million), mainly driven by the departure of 
the former Chief Executive Officer which 
triggered a non-recurring payment of 
US$2.75 million. Professional fees also 
decreased as post-UIGEA the Group 
looked to balance the change in costs of 
this nature.

As part of 888’s commitment to invest in 
human capital, eligible management and 
employees received in the past equity 
awards under the 888 All Employee 
Share Plan (“Share Plan”). In 2007, as in 
2006, the Group continued to award 
shares and options to employees under 
the terms of the Share Plan. The non-
cash charge for 2007 was US$7.8 million 
(2006: US$8.8 million), comprising a 
US$1.8 million charge relating to grants 
in the current year (2006: US$2.5 million) 
and US$6.0 million relating to grants 
made in the past. 
Finance income
With the Group continuing to generate 
and retain cash surpluses throughout the 
year, net interest income remained stable 
at US$5.0 million (2006: US$4.9 million).
Profit and earnings per share
As a result of strong revenue growth, 
stable marketing to turnover ratio, 
maintaining strong cost control and 
better management of resources, Profit 
Before Tax* increased dramatically  
by 106% to US$45.8 million (2006:  
US$22.2 million). 
Profit Before Tax* from continuing 
operations delivered a margin of 21% 
(2006: 14%), further testament to the 
Group’s strong operational gearing 
throughout the year, a remarkable 
achievement given the changes imposed 
by discontinuing its offering in the US. 
While the Group did not operate in  
the US in 2007, the small loss from 
discontinued operations related to  
legal fees incurred in connection with  
its past activities. 
Basic Earnings per share more than 
doubled at 12.6 cents in 2007 (2006:  
5.6 cents).
 
Dividend 
The Group’s stated policy is that it 
anticipates adopting an annual dividend 
payment ratio of approximately 50% of 
profit, but the policy would reflect long-
term earnings and cash flow potential of 
the Group. On 31 October 2007, the 
Company paid an interim dividend of  
1.8 cents per share totalling US$6.1 
million (2006 interim dividend totalling 
US$23.1 million) (in 2006 the dividend 
included earnings from discontinued 
operations). Given the strong financial 
performance in 2007, the Board 
recommends a final dividend of  
5.0 cents per share. 
Cash flow
The Group’s strong profitability  
during the year was matched by  
strong cash generation with cash 
generated from operating activities 
reaching US$46.2 million. 
During 2007, the Group made cash 
payments of US$20.0 million in respect 
of investing activities (2006: US$3.6 
million), primarily relating to the  
Bingo acquisition.
In addition, the Group returned 
US$36.2 million (2006: US$28.7 million) 
in dividends to its shareholders 
consistent with its dividend policy.
The Group’s cash position as at 
31 December 2007 remained strong  
at US$104.3 million (31 December 2006: 
US$114.4 million). This is a positive 
position given that the Group has  
no debt.
Balance sheet
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
strong, as it has no debt, but retains 
ample liquid resources, including the 
ability to repay all customers’ balances 
on demand at any time. 
As a result of the Bingo acquisition 888 
recognised intangible assets and 
goodwill totalling US$40.7 million after 
the amortisation of intangibles of US$1.5 
million in the year. Goodwill, valued at 
US$37.9 million (2006: US$nil), was not 
impaired at 31 December 2007 as per a 
review performed by the Board.
Cash and cash equivalents as at 31 
December 2007 remained strong at 
US$104.3 million (31 December 2006: 
US$114.4 million). The slight decrease in 
the cash position during the year, despite 
strong cash inflows from operations of 
US$49.3 million, is a result of the 
consideration paid in respect of the 
Bingo acquisition of US$17.1 million, and 
payment of dividends of US$36.2 million 
(2006: US$28.7 million) to shareholders.
Trade receivables have increased to 
US$13.4 million (2006: US$6.2 million), 
the increase resulting from higher 
payment processing activity during the 
year, which peaked towards the end of 
the year. Most balances were fully settled 
immediately after the start of 2008.
Deferred consideration of US$25.1 million 
payable in respect of the Bingo 
acquisition is the main reason for the 
increase in trade and other payables by 
US$35.1 million to US$63.0 million (2006:  
US$27.9 million). 
Balances owed to customers increased 
by 17% to US$26.4 million (2006: 
US$22.7 million) representing growth in 
business volume, in part being due to the 
new Bingo activity.
888’s strategy 
888’s goal is to create the largest 
community of people who play online for 
money and grow its annual revenue and 
profit numbers to a level greater than 
when its US business closed in October 
2006. To achieve this goal, 888 must

The withdrawal from the US market 
meant that 888’s principle of “thinking 
global while acting local” became more 
important than ever. Aiming to penetrate 
new markets simultaneously, 888 had to 
quickly enhance its local focus. In 2007, 
888 achieved a greater regional focus 
and localisation than ever before. All of 
888’s Casino games were provided in 14 
languages with full customer support. 
The payment system backbone was  
also upgraded to allow multi-currency 
deposits and withdrawals. These 
features succeeded in generating 
additional revenues immediately. 888 will 
continue to be focused on improving 
localisation in 2008 and beyond, by 
enhancing its offering with even more 
local games.

platform owners, to spread this offering 
beyond internet boundaries into hotels,

2007 saw 888 continue its extensive 
investment in its brand. The “enjoy the 
game” tagline was introduced to the 888 
brand, and reached phenomenal levels 
of brand recognition in both the UK and 
Spain. Additional 888 brands were 
launched such as “888ladies” and 
“888sport”. As part of the drive towards 
both increasing localisation and a more 
fully integrated marketing approach, 888 
has identified local consultants in 
selected key markets for better 
coordination and monitoring of its 
activities in these markets. 888 signed 
and launched initial strategic 
partnerships with Rileys and Tower 
Torneos which allow it greater 
penetration to distinct local markets.  
888 plans to sign further similar 
partnership deals in 2008.

888 has continued its focus on studying 
its customers’ online behaviour more 
closely, in order to improve its knowledge 
of their betting habits and preferences. 
From direct contact with customers, by 
market research of their behaviour and 
through a detailed analysis of trends 
using its in-house data warehouse, 888 
has continued to refine how best to 
engage, thrill and retain its customers.

The drive towards increased penetration 
into new markets was coupled with the 
need to expand customer support to 
non-English languages. As part of these 
significant changes, 888 achieved its 
best ever results in its customer 
satisfaction surveys.

2007 saw 888 achieve a 38% increase

year-end headcount. In 2008, 888  
will continue with strong cost control  
to ensure high profitability levels are 
maintained and further improved.

888’s most important asset is its human 
capital. 888 has a skilled, committed 
workforce who have remained with the 
Group since the early days and these 
have been joined by highly talented 
employees who have been recruited 
during the last year. It would not have 
been possible to achieve the 
phenomenal results in 2007 without the 
enormous efforts of these employees. 
888 aims to retain its employees, ensure 
their motivation and to attract further 
leading talent to secure future success 
by continuing to be the employer of 
choice in the market.
2007 Business developments
Marketing and CRM
2007 was a busy and highly successful 
year for 888’s industry leading marketing 
activities. The marketing function was 
restructured under four key work-
streams: acquisition, retention, branding 
• Thinking Global while acting Local • Enhanced and innovative offering
• State of the art integrated marketing • Customer intimacy 
• Market Leading Customer Service
• Focused, Efficient and Effective Organisation • Employer of Choice 888 Holdings Public Limited Company  and white label partnerships. This has 
enabled solid performance of the 
business in terms of acquisition and 
retention, in addition to allowing significant 
focus on the three priority areas:
Branding and integrated marketing
Customer Relationship Management
Strategic partnerships/White labels
Branding
For a number of years, the Group has 
enjoyed the highest level of brand 
awareness in the sector in its key 
markets. “888” has always been 
associated with reliability, trust and 
leading customer service, all of which are 
important attributes for the success of 
the business. In 2007, the Group started 
to build on this awareness with a strong, 
differentiated and more emotionally 
persuasive brand positioning: www.888.
com “Enjoy the game”. During 2007,  
the Group rolled out its first ever TV 
campaign supported by press and 
signage across the UK and in a number 
of other territories. By the end of 2007 
the brand saw significant improvement  
in key brand attributes.
The clear, focused brand positioning also 
enabled more integrated marketing. In 
2007, there was considerable focus 
behind fully integrated marketing 
campaigns; leveraging consistent and 
complementary messages across all 
marketing channels. This resulted in 
communication with a real impact, which 
attracted more first time depositors and 
reinforced retention activities.
Customer relationship management
As the Group evolves, it continues to 
recognise the significance of a well 
resourced Customer Relationship 
Management department. As such, 888 
has continued to invest substantially in 
both financial and human resource terms 
in the CRM department in 2007.
The CRM team is tasked with both 
creating loyalty and augmenting 
•
•
•
expenditure by ensuring that customers 
both play and stay with the Group for as 
long as they continue to e n j o y 	 t h e 	 g a m e : 
playing more games, more often, and  
for more time. This customer loyalty  
is generated via two departments, one 
focusing on the Group’s mass market 
customer base and the other 
concentrating on VIP customers.
The CRM team continuously seeks  
to innovate the range of promotions, 
bonuses and communication channels, 
whilst segmentation methods ensure that 
the relevant message reaches the right 
customer at the most opportune time. An 
excellent example of this approach is the 
888 customer magazine “Eight” delivered 
to customers in the UK. This magazine is 
a tool seeking to, reinforce loyalty and, 
ultimately, spend ratios. 
The VIP department ensures that the 
Group builds a real one-on-one personal 
relationship with VIPs so that 888 
remains their online gaming provider  
of choice. This approach has ensured  
a very successful 2007 in terms of 
customer lifespan and their playing 
revenues with the Group. 
These customer relationships have  
been strengthened by the Group’s 
commitment to localisation. 
In 2008, with the introduction of 
additional core products, together with 
sophisticated new communication and 
loyalty tools, the CRM team will be  
able to even better segment and 
communicate with its customer base to 
ensure effective cross-selling and up-
selling of the Group’s enhanced portfolio 
of products.
Strategic alliances
2007 was the year in which the Group 
became a “white label” provider. Under 
the “Powered by 888” endorsement, the 
Group launched a new line of business 
as a service provider to third parties with 
their particular skill sets and target 
audiences. 888 initially entered into  
three partnerships:
R i l e y s 	 P o k e r : Rileys, famous for their 
chain of snooker halls, sought to refocus 
their business behind in-hall Poker 
tournaments. 888 created a distinctive 
proposition for the Poker community 
enjoying a unique environment 
integrating both the online and offline 
version of Rileys Poker. This partnership 
was acknowledged by the industry when 
888 received the 2007 Land-links 
P a r t n e r s h i p 	 o f 	 t h e 	 Y e a r Award at the 
eGaming Awards.
T o w e r 	 T o r n e o s : Tower Torneos (“TT”), are 
already an established Casino operator 
in Latin America with an online Poker 
room. 888 worked with TT to provide  
an improved online offering, and 
successfully transferred TT’s existing 
customers to the new gaming client 
“Powered by 888”. This created an 
immediate and strong foothold in the 
Latin America region for the Group, 
generated significant liquidity for the 
Poker platform and opened new 
marketing channels in the region 
previously unavailable to the Group.
Lu c k y Ac e : LuckyAce is led by a team of 
gaming industry veterans with a track 
record of customer recruitment and 
traffic generation. LuckyAcePoker and 
LuckyAceCasino brands are a powerful 
combination of 888’s added value 
platform with the LuckyAce online 
marketing expertise. LuckyAce is 
focusing on rapidly growing European 
markets, and will operate in parallel to 
888’s own brands, boosting market 
share in these high potential territories. 
The new strategic alliances part of 888’s 
business received a significant boost 
with the acquisition of the Bingo 
business, positioning the Group right at 
the forefront of Bingo service providers. 
While 2007 focused mainly on Poker 
partnerships; in 2008, 888 will focus on 
ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW cont. Annual Report & Accounts 2007  providing an integrated product offering 
to business partners, encompassing 
Poker, Casino, Bingo and Sportsbetting. 
888 intends to launch several new 
integrated Poker and Casino 
partnerships throughout the year.
In addition to these priority areas, other 
marketing channels have continued to 
drive acquisition and retention:
Online
The online marketing department has 
undergone significant developments in 
the past year, recruiting a large portion of 
the Company’s new customers through 
its multi-department expertise. This 
department implemented an array of 
online branding and direct-response 
advertising campaigns targeting a wide 
range of customer segments. The 
department also experimented at the 
leading edge of online marketing, running 
campaigns using viral marketing, user-
generated video content and several 
other web 2.0 trends. There was 
considerable growth in relationships  
with technology providers, advertising 
networks and publishers, which 
contributed to increased performance  
in new and existing online campaigns. 
Sales
The affiliates department achieved 
considerable growth in 2007, led by a 
drive to register new affiliates to the 
Group’s programme. There was a focus 
on customised sponsorship promotions 
with new and existing affiliate partners 
and this contributed significantly to 
increased commitment and investment 
from these partners.
During Quarter 4, there was a drive to 
emphasise the role of offline activation 
activities for Poker. These new offline 
marketing techniques and promotions 
attracted many new customers, and  
the Group will continue to invest in a 
multitude of new marketing channels  
in 2008.
Search and Web Optimisation 
Technologies (“SWOT”)
SWOT is much more than traditional 
simple search engine optimisation 
(“SEO”). 2007 was a strong year for 
SWOT, where acquisition of new 
customers via search engine traffic 
increased significantly across the whole 
business and especially in the UK. 
2008 will bring new customer acquisition 
opportunities with the introduction of  
the “888sport” Sportsbook and the 
“888ladies” Bingo brands, and there  
are a number of web 2.0 plans in  
various regions.
Offline
2007 was another successful year for  
the Group’s offline marketing around  
the world:
888 launched a number of campaigns  
in Latin America, including shirt 
sponsorship of Club Nationale in 
Uruguay, TV poker programming across 
the region behind the 888 and Tower 
Torneos brands, as well as tournaments 
supported by a series of magazine and 
national press advertising.
In Australia, 888 launched the 888Poker 
brand offline through a heavyweight 
outdoor campaign, in Sydney, on the  
bus and train networks, supported with 
national press and magazine activities. 
Across Europe, 888 had another year of 
major success with the shirt sponsorship 
of Sevilla FC. Sevilla won the UEFA Cup 
for the second consecutive year, the 
Spanish Cup (Copa del Rey) and finished 
third in the Spanish premier league  
(La Liga).
In the UK, the coming into force of the 
Gambling Act 2005 opened the way  
for the Group to launch television 
advertising. 888 retained London’s 
leading creative agency, CHI & Partners, 
to deliver a UK based branding 
campaign across all marketing channels 
behind the new positioning “Enjoy  
the game”. 
The Group’s ongoing sponsorship of the 
World Snooker Championship in 
Sheffield generated over 140 hours of 
television coverage on the BBC and 
Eurosport, and was rebroadcast globally. 
888 also generated over 80 hours of its 
own Poker content in 2007 which is 
syndicated globally. In addition to existing 
content of the UK Poker Open, the Poker 
Nations Cup and the Women’s Poker 
Tour, 2007 saw the Group becoming the 
presenting sponsor of the World Heads 
Up Championships held in Barcelona.
2008 will prove to be an even bigger year 
for the Group as 888 continues to build 
upon its brand having launched its 
Sportsbook, 888sport, and its new 
Bingo offering, 888ladies. In addition, 
888 will run the biggest ever non-US 
facing online Poker event of its kind, 
branded the World Poker Crown, with a 
US$3 million guaranteed prize pool.
Offering and R&D
Casino
888’s major Casino brand, Casino on 
Net, has consistently been ranked as the 
leading online Casino brand in the world. 
It continues to generate substantial 
business, and despite the recent 
introduction of 888’s Emerging Offerings, 
still represented more than 55% of the 
Group’s NGR in 2007 (2006: 57%) with 
NGR growth of 33% over the year and, 
significantly, with 60% growth between 
Quarter 4 2007 (US$35.3 million) and 
Quarter 4 of 2006 (US$22.1 million).
During 2007, 888’s tenth anniversary 
year, the Group focused on retaining a 
contemporary feel to the Casino, adding 
more games, and increasing the level of 
localisation while maintaining its core 
propositions of trust and simplicity 
combined with its first class customer  888 Holdings Public Limited Company  service. Listening to its customers, 888 
has enhanced the customer experience 
by providing faster game play, and by 
giving the customer greater choice over 
bet size. 888 also continued to expand 
its Casino offering: it introduced a new 
gaming “ecosystem” which enables third 
party game developers to integrate their 
products seamlessly into 888’s gaming 
environment, provided Casino software 
to white labels and introduced a live 
dealer Casino tailored for certain  
Asian markets.
The combination of trendy entertainment 
content consumed by customers 
worldwide together with a unique gaming 
experience is a key factor to 888’s 
success, as it has increasingly become 
the entertainment destination of choice 
for more customers. To this end, 888 
added four new and unique Video Slots 
to increase game variety, with the 
majority available in each of the 14 
languages (including voice localisation) 
which 888 supports. 888 released its 
“Rough Rugby” Slot to coincide with the 
Rugby World Cup and, in October 2007, 
released the “Blond Legend” Video Slot. 
This Video Slot, featuring “Marilyn 
Monroe” pictures, provided by the “Sam 
Shaw Collection”, has proven very 
popular among customers. 888 aims to 
identify further themed content for 
Casino games. Both games ranked 
amongst the three most popular Video 
Slots in 888’s Casino immediately upon 
their launch, and made themed Video 
Slots one of the most significant 
acquisition and retention tools 888 has. 
Following this success, 888 is planning 
to maintain its front-line position through 
internal development programmes, as 
well as acquiring or licensing third party 
games to be integrated directly into 888’s 
gaming environment.
 
2007 saw 888 move product localisation 
to the next level by enabling the 
establishment of partnerships with local 
providers. These partnerships are 
possible as 888 has successfully opened 
its platform to third party games, by 
providing an “integration platform” layer. 
This “integration platform” enables the 
swift integration of third party games, 
and will be used to add additional, new 
and localised games, adapted to 888’s 
own high standards, to its Casino 
offering during 2008. This will provide its 
customers with a large variety of quality 
entertainment, and will contribute to 
customer acquisition by appealing to 
expanded demographics. Customer 
retention will be further reinforced by the 
excitement and the choice of an ever 
expanding proposition. 
The Group’s latest partnership was 
entered into with Entertasia, one of the 
leading providers of gaming solutions  
for the Asian market. Through this 
partnership, 888 has launched in 
January 2008 a Live Dealer Casino 
offering Baccarat, Asian Roulette and  
Sic Bo. These games are an entry level 
requirement to compete in the Asian 
market and will be a key tool for growing 
888’s presence in this region. 888 
continues to seek such partnerships and 
to integrate other localised games to 
further target the Asian market.
Once again, 888’s Casino has 
maintained its position as the number 
one online Casino. The Group was  
proud to receive the prestigious  
C a s i n o 	 O p e r a t o r 	 o f 	 t h e 	 Y e a r award  
at the eGaming awards, in addition  
to the C a s i n o 	 o f 	 t h e 	 Y e a r at the  
Gambling Online Awards 2007.

ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW cont. Annual Report & Accounts 2007  As can be seen from the previous table, 
the Casino experienced 60% NGR 
growth from Quarter 4 of 2006 to Quarter 
4 of 2007. The inclusion of Casino games 
in the Poker client at the end of 2006 
greatly increased the customer base and 
thus the number of quarterly active 
customers. This resulted in a 4.2% 
growth in quarterly active customers 
between Quarter 1 and Quarter 4 of 
2007. The increased number of active 
customers resulted in substantially higher 
growth in NGR in 2007, particularly in 
Quarter 4 where NGR increased 22% to 
US$35.3 million. As a result of the sharp 
increase in active customer base in 
Quarter 1 2007, NGR per active customer 
decreased, but has been steadily 
increasing since, and in Quarter 4 2007, 
reached US$478 per active customer.
During 2008, the Group aims to use its 
strong technological, CRM, data mining 
and optimisation capabilities to provide its 
customers with an even more intimate 
experience tailored to their preferences 
and playing habits. 
While, today, 888’s offering is already fully 
localised, in 2008, the Group intends to 
extend this initiative. It will introduce 
further localised versions of its popular 
games together with local games played 
in specific target markets. It will also 
adapt its traditional Casino games to the 
local preferences as best observed today 
in terrestrial Casinos. Asian and Latin 
American customers will continue to be 
at the core of 888’s focus.
Leveraging its multi-million dollar 
marketing budget and the strongest 
global brand in online gaming, in 2008, 
888 will launch www.888debut.com, a 
platform for third party game developers 
to debut themselves in the online gaming 
world and to make their product available 
on the stage of the world’s largest online 
gaming entertainment destination. 888’s 
first integration with a third party provider 
is in its final stages, and the first batch of 
games is aimed to be released during the 
first half of 2008.
 
In order to complete the excitement and 
competitive environment which 888’s 
customers seek, and to broaden its 
offering with additional gaming models, 
the Group also plans to introduce Casino 
races and tournaments. The Group sees 
these events as additional marketing 
methods for enticing new customers, and 
as a tool for retaining existing ones. With 
its expertise in tournament management, 
888 expects these events to form key 
part of its gaming environment.
Poker
Poker operations also enjoyed strong 
growth in 2007, with NGR increasing by 
18% to US$80.8 million (2006: US$68.2 
million) contributing 38% (2006: 43%) of 
the Group’s NGR. This growth has been 
achieved by combining the commitment 
to its large legacy customer base with the 
introduction of new software features; 
increasing the variety of tables and 
through the enrichment of 888’s  
existing tournaments.
During the year, 888 has demonstrated 
an ever increasing global reach. The 
Group has achieved further penetration in 
territories such as Latin America and 
Asia-Pacific, and is operating a truly 
global 24/7 Poker room, in which 
customers can find their game of choice 
at the time of their choice. 
888 has moved a step forward in 
addressing the increased retention 
requirements of its existing customers by 
integrating its Casino games into the 
Poker client. The success of Casino in 
Poker led to the integration of 
Backgammon and Bingo in Poker in 
2007, with Sportsbook in Poker 
integration planned for 2008. This 
integration strategy is the achievement of 
the Group’s stated goal of delivering a 
unified offering and adding new revenue 
streams to existing ones, and by 
capitalising on the synergies between 
888’s offerings.
Through 2007 and into 2008, the Group 
has enriched its user experience. In 2007, 
888 added 3D tables with avatars 
alongside its 2D classic view tables. While 
the 2D addresses the needs of high stake 
and multiple table Poker customers, the 
newly designed 3D tables with avatars 
have been very popular, and became the 
table of choice for the majority of 
customers. Continuing this effort, 888 is 
committed to developing features such 
as its newly introduced “chat call-outs”, 
which allow customers to get closer to a 
“live-like” user experience. 
In addition, in 2007 888 integrated 
Backgammon into its unified Poker client, 
in order to enhance customer retention. 
In 2008, 888 plans to increase its 
Backgammon liquidity, by further 
localising the game by targeting new 
customer segments. 888 also plans to 
integrate other local peer to peer games 
in different regions, to make its gaming 
environment a one stop shop, which 
includes globally popular games as well 
as locally popular ones. 
2007 has also marked 888’s evolution  
to become a new “Poker Network” 
providing a full, end to end solution for 
“white label” Poker operators, making 
888 itself a “Poker Network Operator”.  
As a Poker Network Operator, 888 
stands out by offering a complete 
solution, in which existing operators can 
leverage their customer base and new 
operators can grow from scratch using 
the shared liquidity offered by 888’s 
network and the robust back office 
operation that the Group provides. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company  0

As can be seen from the previous table, 
888’s Poker NGR grew by 18% in 2007. 
During the year, the historical seasonal 
pattern of a slower Quarter 2 and Quarter 
3 was repeated with a stronger Quarter 4. 
This continuous growth in NGR in 2007 is 
particularly impressive given that the 
additional revenue derived from Poker 
customers playing Casino games is 
included in Casino NGR. Active 
customers increased during the year, 
showing 15% increase between Quarter 
4 2006 to Quarter 4 2007. Finally, 
quarterly NGR per active customer 
remained relatively constant.
In order to drive further growth in 2008, 
888 is currently working to improve the 
conversion of its play for free “Demo” 
customers to real money customers by 
including the demo mode play option 
within the real money environment. The 
year has started with the keynote 
announcement of the “World Poker 
Crown”, a sequence of branded events, 
which will culminate with a US$3 million 
guaranteed prize pool, offline tournament. 
To date, this is the largest single event of 
its kind offered to the non-US market. 
This US$3 million event is the tournament 
final and daily and weekly satellite 
tournaments are run, customised to 
match 888’s geographic customer base 
profiles in terms of game level, risk profile 
and financial capability. This activity  
will ultimately provide 10 qualifiers for  
the final.
The Group plans to introduce more 
features designed to maintain customers’ 
engagement and commitment 
throughout the year. Such features 
include the addition of advanced 
community and communication tools, 
which 888 has already started to roll out. 
In 2008, 888 will also introduce the 
broadcasting of relevant global and 
localised TV content, generated both by 
itself and by its users. Such content will 
be made available through 888’s various 
marketing channels and on its website, 
through a planned advanced Video 
Portal. These enhancements will further 
strengthen the performance and reach of 
888’s Poker room.

reveal strong NGR growth in 2007 
compared to 2006, growth which 
accelerated during the Quarter 4. This,  
in part, can be attributed to increased 
active customer numbers that have 
grown in each quarter since the FIFA 
World Cup in the summer of 2006, as 
well as migration into higher edge 
games. The growth in both factors has 
resulted in a stable NGR per active 
customer for the first three quarters, 
followed by a significant increase to 
US$270 per quarter (2006: US$214) in 
Quarter 4 2007, which benefited from the 
substantial NGR growth.
Bingo
2007 heralded 888’s entry into the online 
Bingo market with, in May 2007, the 
successful Bingo acquisition. The 
acquired Bingo business constitutes the 
provision of software, customer support 
and payment processing to some of  
the premium Bingo partners in the UK, 
such as:
www.foxybingo.com,
www.mirrorbingo.com, 
www.thinkbingo.com,
www.bingoscotland.com,
www.thinkbingoplus.com 
In addition to the Bingo business, 888 
now operates a white label Bingo 
network which has some 50 white labels, 
including BingoBallroom and PoshBingo. 
2007 continued to see growth in online 
Bingo with a number of new networks 
and white label sites entering the market, 
in which 888 Bingo has continued to be 
a dominant customer.
In parallel to increasing the number of 
90-ball and 75-ball Bingo rooms, the 
Group continued to strengthen the 
community feel of its offering, and 
achieved significant customer 
satisfaction and retention levels. The 
community feeling in 888’s Bingo  
rooms is a combination of its friendly, 
welcoming team of moderators who 
follow customers throughout their stay 
within 888’s Bingo rooms, and its 
rewarding website that includes a variety 
of interaction, chat tools and venues. An 
example of such features is the Ladies 
L o u n g e where 888’s customers can find 
birthday bulletins, the Bingo glossary, 
Bingo calls and loyalty point offers. 
Loyalty to 888ladies and to the Bingo 
venues powered by 888, whether one  
of 888’s premium partners or one of  
its white label partners, is proof of  
the pervasiveness of community 
characteristics of an online Bingo and 
further evidence of the appropriateness 
of 888’s stated strategy to continuously 
invest in expanding the scope of 
community services and tools in its 
Bingo offering. 
888’s Bingo virtual venues are places 
that people feel excited to enter into. Its 
view on promotions to customers is 
simply: to constantly give customers a 
reason to return. The excitement in 888’s 
Bingo rooms in 2007 took the forms of 
monthly guaranteed jackpots, special 
event jackpots, weekly and bi-weekly 
indulging events such as shopping 
sprees and giveaway of daily prizes that 
were part of the games themselves. The 
other side of excitement is providing 
customers with welcome “surprises”. For 
this purpose, the Group worked closely 
with its game and content providers, and 
together tailored its gaming so that they 
do not only expand its offering but also 
excite and surprise. This included a 
variety of scratch card games, fixed odds 
games and branded games.
2008 has seen the launch of the new 888 
Bingo network: www.888ladies.com. 
The site is positioned to appeal to a 
whole new market for the Group and  
will provide women a place where  
they can enjoy Bingo games, with chat, 
community features and indulgent prizes.
In addition to 888ladies, 888’s latest 
licensee has released their Bingo 
network www.winkbingo.com in Quarter 
1, 2008, which is further evidence of the 
Group’s desire to grow its business by 
partnering with more licensees.
Currently with predominately English 
language customers, the Group plans to 
expand into the Spanish market in 2008. 
This market is increasingly a major 
market for online Bingo, and discussions 
are already underway with a number of 
potential licensees. 888 plans to 
introduce its Bingo offering in two 
additional localised versions of the game 
for identified high growth markets.
In order to crystallise its position as a 
leading entertainment and content 
destination for women, the Group is 
planning to scale up its editorial 
capabilities. This will turn 888’s gaming 
offering into a more contextual 
experience that links between what 
people read, consume and win on 888 
website; ranging from linking 
personalised online horoscope, bonuses 
and invitations to play on birthdays and 
lucky days, to games themed after the 
brands 888’s customers care the most 
about, whether their favourite TV show  
or celebrity.
Communities are comprised of 
customers and the community operator. 
In 2008, 888 plans to strengthen the ties 
between the two by taking its community 
tools to the next level, through 888’s own 
community platform. This platform is the 
culmination of the vast experience 
obtained by 888’s customer retention 
teams through chat, interaction with 
customers and observing their 
behaviour, combined with the latest 
technology developments, including RSS 
feeds and web 2.0 widgets. 888’s 
community platform will centralise 
contemporary content editing, 
information distribution, sharing spaces 
and personalisation tools. The Group  888 Holdings Public Limited Company  believes that this platform will have a 
positive effect on its business and ability 
to cross-sell new offers to its customers.
Italian Sportsbook 
In December 2006, the Group was 
awarded one of the online Sportsbetting 
licences issued by the Italian 
Government. This licence grants the right 
to offer online betting facilities to the 
Italian market in conjunction with a local 
partner. This licence became operational 
and the business commenced trading 
with a soft launch in late 2007.
Sportsbetting
In early 2008, 888 unveiled its new 
international Sportsbetting service to 
complement its existing product suite. 
“888sport” is a fully functioning portal 
allowing customers to place bets in 
various currencies via a number of 
language specific web sites.
“888sport” offers a full range of 
Sportsbetting services, including; UK, 
European and international football, horse 
and greyhound races from around the 
world and a whole host of other sporting 
events such as tennis, rugby, motor 
racing, golf and other popular sports, 
targeting both international and local 
markets. “888sport” also features an “in 
play” betting service allowing customers 
to place bets on live events as they are 
taking place, in some cases right up to 
the final whistle.
The Group’s route into this challenging 
marketplace has been to develop its 
product in conjunction with Blue Square, 
one of the most popular and well 
established sportsbooks in the UK. 
Based in London, Blue Square was 
launched in May 1999, and as well as 
providing internet based Sportsbetting 
opportunities, also offers its services 
through other channels including 
Interactive TV, WAP and Telephone 
Betting. In 2003, Blue Square was 
acquired by the Rank Group, who are a 
major force in land-based gambling, with 
Casinos and Bingo clubs across the UK 
and Europe. 
As a result of the partnership with Blue 
Square, 888 benefits from Blue Square’s 
experience in trading and risk 
management to reduce the inherent risks 
associated with this business. Instead, 
888 can concentrate on marketing to new 
customers using its sport related 
sponsorships, such as Sevilla football 
club and the 888 World Snooker 
Championship, and cross-selling its other 
products to these new customers. 
The launch of 888’s sportsbook in March 
2008 was an important milestone for the 
Group. The UK version of the sportsbook 
immediately featured the popular 
Cheltenham Festival and Champions 
League knockout stages, whilst April 
sees the climax of the UK domestic 
football season, the Grand National, the 
888 World Snooker Championships and 
the US Masters golf from Augusta. In 
addition to the UK, 888sport will be 
launching versions of the sportsbook 
simultaneously in Spain, Germany, 
Austria, Sweden and Denmark and will 
be featuring prime sporting events action 
from these countries. Additional territories 
will be added throughout the year in 
Europe, Asia and South America, each 
with its own local sporting events 
coverage. The Group sees significant 
opportunities with Sportsbetting markets 
such as Spain being largely untapped. 
The complementary skills and work 
cultures of the 888 and Blue Square 
teams make 888 confident of completing 
a global rollout by the end of 2008. The 
international launch reinforces 888’s 
strategy of creating a large community  
of people consuming entertainment 
content online.
New platforms
In 2007, 888 has become an interactive 
entertainment destination with “real 
estate” expanding beyond the www.888.
com website, spanning mobile phones 
through hotel room entertainment into  
in-flight systems. As part of its unified 
offering, 888 allows interactive gaming  
on each of these new platforms with  
the same customer account, password 
and, where allowed, wallet which its 
customers use online. 
The roll-out of 888’s gaming offerings 
onto these platforms has enabled its 
customers to play anytime, anywhere  
on 888’s global network, experiencing 
the same branded user experience 
historically enjoyed only online.
The purpose of developing these new 
platforms is two-fold: firstly, to improve 
retention of existing customers by giving 
them more ways to interact with 888 and, 
secondly, to acquire new customers by 
offering 888’s products to audiences that 
consume entertainment whilst travelling 
(airplanes, hotels) or on their personal 
communication tool (mobile phone). 
For the platform developer and owner, 
888’s wide game variety and strong 
brand enables them to broaden the 
content they offer to their users by 
incorporating 888’s offering to their 
customers, thereby increasing their own 
revenues and share of customers’ time. 
During the year, 888 entered into a 
partnership agreement with one of the 
world’s leading in-room hospitality system 
providers. This agreement allowed 888 to 
develop its first online Casino product, 
specially designed for internet enabled 
hotel room televisions, with its own 
branded look and feel. In addition, as part 
of this partnership, all Wi-Fi access in the 
hotels that install this system will feature 
free access to the www.888.com site for 
guests using laptops in the hotel’s 
network. 888 plans to extend its first trial 
in the UK in 2008, with the plan to launch 
this service throughout Europe during the 
remainder of the year.
A further deal entered into by 888 in 2007 
was with DTI, an in-flight entertainment 
ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW cont. Annual Report & Accounts 2007  industry leader. This agreement enables 
888 to offer its Casino on in-flight 
entertainment systems used by major 
international airlines. 888 will be in a 
position to offer its gaming services on 
long-haul flights using DTI’s in-seat 
entertainment systems as soon as the 
technology is in place for in-flight internet 
connectivity and the necessary regulatory 
approvals are obtained. The product  
is currently in the final stages of 
development, and the plan is to finalise 
installation on the first airplane in  
late 2008.
888mobile plans to tap into the huge 
mobile phone market, by using existing 
customer registration details on Mobile 
Phone Casino which includes Blackjack, 
Roulette and Video Slots. The mobile 
potential is considerable given that in 
excess of one billion mobile phones will 
be sold worldwide in 2008, compared to 
200 million personal computers. An 
increasing number of these mobile 
phones have bigger screens, faster 
processors, availability and portability 
which lend themselves to a great gaming 
experience. This offering, developed in 
cooperation with UK-based Cellectivity 
and M-Fuse, is available on over 250 
models sold in some 200 countries, and 
will be distributed through 3, T-mobile, 
Orange UK and other mobile portals.
In 2008, 888 intends to focus on Cable 
TV and IPTV. This untapped platform is 
expected to become an acquisition 
channel as well as a platform to increase 
customer value. 888 is currently in 
discussions with several partners and is 
evaluating the best route to penetrate this 
market.
Payments and Risk Management
E-payments, Fraud and Risk 
Management Department (“e-payments”) 
had a significant role in supporting 
several strategic growth initiatives 
undertaken by 888 in 2007. 
In 2007, customers were offered 23 
different deposit and 10 different 
withdrawal methods. Credit cards and 
debit cards were the most popular 
international payment method, 
representing 86.5% of total deposits in 
2007 (2006: 86.7%), with each region 
having its own distribution of preferred 
local methods.
When customers enter www.888.com 
they are offered a range of payment 
options tailored to suit their local market 
based on their physical location, from 
which they can choose their preferred 
payment method. The availability of 
payment methods is a key element to a 
localised offering, enabling customers  
to play their local entertaining game 
conveniently through their local preferred 
payment method. By an analysis of 
geographical data and with the 
assistance of local knowledge, new 
payment methods are identified,  
carefully evaluated and assessed  
and, where suitable, implemented. 
Deposits and withdrawals are carefully 
monitored by 888’s in-house Fraud and 
Payment Risk Management department. 
This department has a wealth of 
experience in fraud prevention from years 
of operation and has integrated their 
internally developed prevention and 
verification procedures with commercially 
available third party measures to enable 
robust verification. 
By constantly reviewing and analysing the 
performance of the payments process, 
the system is optimised to maximise 
deposit levels, approval rates, control 
fraud activity and minimise payment 
processing costs.
In Quarter 3 2007, 888 launched its state-
of-the-art payments processing system; 
an in-house developed new financial 
backbone system with both back office 
functionality and user side cashier 
interface. The new system provides a 
major upgrade in processing capability 
and flexibility, providing better customer 
service combined with an improved 
internal mechanism. This system 
increases ease of use for customers, 
significantly speeds up the integration of 
new payment methods and automates 
various back office procedures for greater 
efficiency and cost saving. Currently in 
trial, the Group intends to release the 
system to all its existing and new 
customers in 2008.
Expanding 888’s global business requires 
tailored treatment for payment and 
withdrawal methods. The Group’s e-
payments business development and 
account management teams constantly 
analyse customer deposit and withdrawal 
habits in each country, and ensure 
customers are presented with their 
preferred methods as the primary 
selections in the cashier and withdrawal 
module. In 2007, 888’s customers were 
offered the option to deposit in their  
local currency, even when the games 
themselves were played in US dollars.  
At the beginning of 2008, Sports multi-
currency was introduced in US Dollars, 
Euros, Pound Sterling, Danish Krone  
and Swedish Krona, to further align  
the Group’s cashier and games  
with customer needs and payment 
preferences. Localisation and multi-
currency support in Asia, Europe and 
Latin America, will be the Group’s focus 
in 2008 as well as the integration of new 
local payment and withdrawal options 
into the cashier.
Customer Service 
The Group remains committed to being 
market leader in the global online gaming 
industry, as measured by customer 
satisfaction. The Group’s dedicated 
teams of trained in-house customer 
support representatives provide the 
highest levels of service and support  
for each of the Group’s brands and  
white labels.  888 Holdings Public Limited Company  In 2007, the Group continued to invest in 
the support infrastructure, and expanded 
its language portfolio, including 
expanding its existing English Live Chat 
service to cover three new languages. 
The Group offers first class customer 
support via email and telephone, 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, to 
customers around the world in up to  
13 different languages. 
The ongoing relationship and dialogue 
with customers is maintained by 
Customer Relationship Management 
teams in two dedicated contact centres, 
located in Gibraltar and Antigua. The 
main Gibraltar contact centre focuses on 
providing support to the Group’s principal 
markets of Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin 
America, with the Antiguan contact 
centre focused on supporting the 
Group’s main English speaking markets 
in Europe, Australia, Asia-Pacific and 
Canada. The contact centres in Gibraltar 
and Antigua played a vital role in the 
successful launch of the Group’s first 
strategic partnerships; with Rileys in the 
UK and Tower Torneos in Latin America.
Operating a dual contact centre system  
is a cost effective way of managing the 
overflow of phone calls, chats and emails 
and allows efficient balancing of 
operational demands. The Group is 
therefore able to maintain the same high 
level of service throughout the day. In 
addition, the centres complement each 
other in a number of respects: 
Staff schedules are created jointly, 
taking into consideration business 
trends from previous years and/or 
anticipated promotional campaigns  
in a particular location.
Follow-up on customer issues can  
be completed from either location, 
from a shared database, in 888’s 
integrated back office system.
•
•
Representatives in each location are 
cross-trained to provide service for each 
of the Group’s brands. Their aim is to 
resolve customers’ issues during the  
first contact. 
The following performance levels were 
attained in 2007:
Casino in English 
94% of all phone calls are answered 
within 21 seconds.
95% of all emails are replied to within 
12 hours.
91% of all chat contacts are answered 
within 28 seconds.
Poker in English
96% of all calls are answered within 
21 seconds
97% of all emails are replied to within 
12 hours
91% of all chats are answered within 
32 seconds
In addition, expert teams in both locations 
initiate outbound interaction with new and 
existing customers experiencing deposit 
issues. Selected customers are also 
contacted about special offers and new 
products, and to reactivate those that 
have become inactive. The launch and 
upgrade to the new 3D Poker software 
and various new Casino games launched 
in all 13 supported languages provided 
the Group’s customer support 
representatives with further opportunities 
for cross-selling.
VIP service
The service level provided to individual 
customers is differentiated with the 
Group’s best customers receiving more 
personalised service. This allows the 
Group to offer its customers tailor-made 
incentives to suit their profile and 
maximise their lifetime values. A separate, 
highly skilled team is dedicated to 
providing a high level of proactive 
customer service and hospitality to the 
Group’s most valued Casino customers. 
•
•
•
•
•
•
The VIP department adopts a thorough 
approach to following up on sensitive and 
complex cases. Every VIP customer is 
provided with a Personal Account 
Manager who strives to create a personal 
relationship with his customers in order to 
offer the ultimate in personal service, 
determine customers’ interests and 
reward individual customers with gifts 
tailored to suit their personal tastes.
The VIP team organises targeted, 
worldwide hospitality events to reward 
VIPs in a tangible manner. Events range 
from horse racing, football and other 
sporting events, to weekend breaks, 
sold-out concerts and social gatherings, 
which also give customers the 
opportunity to meet their Account 
Managers face-to-face. 
The VIP hospitality programme 
significantly enhances customer loyalty 
and individual lifetime value. In 2008, the 
VIP department is set to expand into 
providing their hospitality programme  
to each of the Group’s brands and  
White Labels.
Customer satisfaction
888 continuously monitors customer 
satisfaction by requesting and analysing 
real-time feedback, and in 2007, 
conducted a comprehensive survey to 
benchmark the Group’s service level in its 
primary markets. Compared to previous 
studies, the results show a significant 
overall increase in customer satisfaction. 
Respondents attributed the highest  
rating to the level of professionalism  
of customer support representatives, 
achieving ratings of 4.27 and 4.15 out of  
a maximum of five for Casino and Poker 
respectively. Additional rating include: 
ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW cont. Annual Report & Accounts 2007  English Casino customers rated their 
satisfaction with the quality of service 
at 4.11 
English Poker customers rated their 
satisfaction with the quality of service 
at 4.01 
Overall satisfaction of customers  
from various other countries and 
languages is similar
Response time ratings were 4.29  
and 4.16 for Casino and Poker 
respectively. 
A vital component in maintaining and 
exceeding customer expectations is the 
ability to access each customer’s full and 
complete history in real time, optimising 
customer interactions at all levels. The 
Group’s advanced proprietary back office 
application functions as the backbone for 
the Group’s entire Business Operation. 
Data from various divisions is integrated 
and streamlined into a single point of 
reference, and provides representatives 
from every department – Customer 
Support, VIP, Risk Management, 
Business Production and Finance – the 
tools to provide superior assistance to 
customers regardless of the department 
the query is directed to.
Customer contacts are strictly monitored 
to ensure quality and parity. The Group 
have retained leading contact centre 
experts to further enhance the quality of 
its customer support, and representatives 
benefit from ongoing refresher training 
courses, including responsible gaming 
training. 
Reporting and Data Mining 
The Group has developed outstanding 
reporting and data mining tools that 
assist in identifying and predicting 
customer behaviour, based on data 
collected since the Group was founded in 
1997. 
Sophisticated customer tracking 
technology gives the Group the ability to 
extract and analyse relevant information 
that enables it to better target its offering 
•
•
•
•
and marketing activities to customers 
around the world. 
Customers also benefit from the Group’s 
ability to generate tailored statistical and 
contact category reports, which identify 
trends, habits and expectations of 
customers in real time highlighting 
bottlenecks and possible training needs 
at an early stage. 
Responsible gaming
“Because we care, responsible gaming 
means investing time, energy and 
resources in the people we interact with 
daily – our employees, our customers 
and our community!”
The Group’s aim is to raise awareness to 
responsible gaming through education 
and research programmes and to provide 
staff with the right tools to ensure a 
responsible gaming environment.
The Group is constantly implementing 
new ways to create a caring, ethical 
gaming environment and to ensure 
customers are safe. Responsible gaming 
is a key feature in the Group’s business 
strategy, reflecting the importance it feels 
towards this issue. In acknowledging  
the risks that the Group’s games can 
pose for a small minority of people,  
the Group strives to achieve excellence  
in its responsible gaming policy and 
ethical conduct. 
The Group’s Director of CSR & 
Responsible Gaming has wide-ranging 
responsibilities that include responsible 
gaming, fair gaming, outreach 
programmes with local charities  
and donations.
Training
888 believes that responsible gaming 
begins from within. The Group has 
therefore developed a cross-Group global 
training programme in which all Group 
employees have participated throughout 
the past year.
The Group’s responsible training 
programme includes every department in 
the Group. The training has been tailor-
made for each department so that 
responsible gaming awareness occurs 
from the first stage of each and every 
activity within the Group, including the 
game development. 
Protecting customers
Gamcare, one of the leading authorities 
on the provision of information, advice 
and practical help in addressing the 
social impact of gambling, has 
recognised www.888.com’s dedication  
to responsible gaming and customer 
protection and has awarded the Group  
its certificate this year.
After undergoing an audit covering staff 
training, underage verification, self 
deposit limits, self exclusion, referral 
processes to relevant agencies and 
related issues, the Group was 
commended for maintaining excellent 
standards of practice.
As a responsible, regulated gaming 
group, 888 also complies with all 
guidelines published by eCOGRA, a non-
profit, independent, regulatory body 
based in the UK. By examination of 
procedures and controls eCOGRA 
ensures that approved operators are 
properly and transparently monitored to 
provide customer protection.
www.888.com also adheres to the 
stringent rules concerning underage 
gambling established by the Interactive 
Gaming Council of which it is a member.  888 Holdings Public Limited Company  Preventative measures
Keeping in mind its motto “responsible 
gaming means investing in the people  
we care about”, Group staff are trained 
to respect customer privacy. Should a 
problem arise, 888 aims to work together 
with customers towards the best and 
most comfortable solution for them.
The Group has established several 
measures designed to help prevent 
gambling from becoming a problem.
Personal limits are in place across all 
Group brands, and are voluntarily 
available to all members using the new 
payment system planned to be fully 
integrated this year. If, at any stage, a 
customer becomes concerned about 
their play behaviour, they can request to 
be self-excluded for a chosen period. 
During this period, 888 will block the 
account. Any new accounts the 
customer might attempt to open during 
the exclusion period will also be blocked 
as soon as detected. In addition, the 
Group will take all reasonable measures 
to make sure the customer will not 
receive any promotional material during 
the designated time. All customers who 
reactivate their account following a self-
exclusion period are given the 
opportunity to set their own limits.
The Group has also added the 
“Gambling Therapy” button on its 
website to provide its customers with 
information and support for those who 
feel their gambling is a matter of concern. 
Gambling Therapy provides online 
support to anyone affected by  
problem gambling.
Protecting minors
In accordance with its responsible 
gambling policy, the Group does not 
knowingly allow anyone under the age  
of 18 to play its games and none of its 
promotions are targeted at minors.
Together with Gamcare, the Group trains 
call centre staff to identify and deal with 
anyone who might be underage. The 
Group has trained staff to be most 
sensitive to the possibility of underage 
gambling; whenever an account is 
suspected of belonging to an underage 
customer, it is suspended until a full 
investigation has been carried out. In 
order to protect minors, verification 
systems are used, where applicable, to 
verify and identify the age and identity of 
the customer.
Raising awareness
During 2007, the Group launched  
a new website dedicated exclusively  
to responsible gaming called 
888responsible.com (http://
www.888responsible.com/). 
888responsible.com offers 
comprehensive and easily accessible 
information about responsible gaming 
practices, dealing with problem 
gambling, preventing underage 
gambling, charity activities and more.
The new website provides tools with 
which to address online gaming. Parents 
can learn how to identify the signs 
indicating that their children might have  
a problem related to gambling, while 
customers can take the self-assessment 
test to determine their gambling habits, 
learn how to keep out of debt and even 
how to exclude themselves from playing 
at online Casinos.
Education
During 2007, 888 joined the RIGT 
(Responsibility in Gambling Trust) and 
donated to their new educational 
programme. The aim of the programme 
is to help young people understand  
the risk of problem gambling and to 
show them how they can reduce  
harm to themselves and their  
friends by developing skills, attitudes  
and knowledge. 
Corporate social  
responsibility policy 
Working with the community
As a global Group, 888 aims to reach  
out to its communities worldwide and  
to work with them for a better future. 
On 10 October 2007, in celebration of  
its tenth birthday, the Group held its  
first Charity Day in collaboration  
with two global charities. The Charity  
Day focused on fundraising campaigns 
to support humanitarian and 
environmental projects worldwide.
The day involved all aspects of the 
Group, from Group employees who 
volunteered their time at local charities, 
to customers, whose losses during the 
day, playing Casino, Poker and Bingo, 
were earmarked for donation. At the  
end of the day a total of US$100,000  
was raised and donated to two  
global charities: EarthAction and  
World for World.
During the day, the Group’s employees 
also volunteered their time to their local 
regional charity – Macmillan Cancer 
Support in the UK, St. Martin’s School in 
Gibraltar, The Adele School in Antigua 
and “Up for the Challenge” in Israel.
This day was only the start of what is 
expected to be a long lasting relationship 
between the Group, its employees and 
the various charities. 
As part of its ongoing CSR initiatives in 
Spain through our Gibraltar site, the 
Group will sponsor a pair of Lynxes, 
which are new additions to the Castellar 
Zoo in Spain, for the next five years. 
In March 2008, 888 received formal 
confirmation from FTSE4GOOD that all 
requirements had been met, and that the 
Group is now part of the index. 
ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW cont. Annual Report & Accounts 2007  Environment
As an online company, the Group has a 
low environmental impact. Nevertheless, 
the Group acknowledges that everyday 
actions may affect the environment with 
potentially adverse consequences. The 
Group’s offline operations are primarily 
office based, and its main environmental 
impact stems from transportation and 
the use of paper, lighting, heating, air 
conditioning and IT. 888 has established 
a committee to deal with office paper 
use, waste, recycling and other relevant 
environmental issues. The committee, 
led by the Group’s Director of Global 
Purchasing and Operations, is 
responsible for overseeing new 
procedures, their practical 
implementation within the Group, and  
the exploration of new ways to minimise 
environmental footprint.
This year a pilot project designed to use 
energy and resources as efficiently as 
possible was launched at the Group’s 
offices in Israel. As the pilot was 
successful, both these actions will be 
implemented at all Group offices during 
the coming year. 
As a global business, extensive 
employee travel is another environmental 
challenge with which the Group is faced. 
In order to minimise travel, the Group has 
invested in the latest multi-media 
technology and encourages employees 
to use teleconferencing facilities. For 
daily commuting, 888 provides its 
employees with bus transportation to 
minimise the use of private vehicles. The 
Group has also provided bicycle locking 
stations in the parking lots and other 
bicycle facilities in order to encourage 
employees to cycle to work. During 
2008, the Group intends to finalise its 
carbon footprint and process an action 
plan that will reduce its carbon release.

our first responsibility is to provide  
the best gaming experience to our 
customers. This means offering the  
most entertaining, innovative, exciting 
and rewarding opportunities to win, 
combined with unparalleled customer

of the complex regulatory environment  
in which it operates and the social 
responsibility that comes with the 
gaming industry. 888 understand that  
it must invest time and resources in 
caring for customers and protecting  
the vulnerable. 
Employees@888 – We are responsible 
for our employees who work with us 
worldwide. We must provide an 
enjoyable work environment where 
people are challenged and motivated  
to excel, where flair is rewarded, 
compensation is fair and the balance 
between work and family is respected. 
Individual development is encouraged 
and advancement is based solely on 
merit. We must always invest in 
developing our employees so that they

employees to risks and all employees 
should be comfortable that their actions 
are just and ethical. 
Responsibility@888 – We must use our 
financial success for the greater good. 
We are in a wonderful position to invest 
in the charities and organisations that  
are important to our employees and  
our customers. We must especially 
encourage and support the social 
responsibility that accompanies our 
work. We are committed to providing a 
fair and responsible gaming environment 
and to guiding our customers to  
play responsibly. 
Investors@888 – Our final responsibility 
is to our shareholders. We must strive  
to operate as efficiently as possible, 
achieving profitable excellence, ensuring 
that we treat their capital as if it were our 
own. We must take risks that allow step-
changes in performance while always 
calculating the risk and measuring  
our results, retaining knowledge and 
learning from our experiences. By  
doing all of the above, we will increase 
shareholder value.
Implementing our values
We set high standards for ourselves,  
and we take pride in our ability to 
consistently maintain them. Following  
the belief that “it’s in our nature” and after 
extensive internal workshops involving 
employees across the organisation, we 
have outlined and implemented a set  
of comprehensive values that represent 
the way we operate:  888 Holdings Public Limited Company  Excellence: We consistently challenge 
ourselves to reach the highest 
performance level in everything we do.
Innovation: We dare to question  
our own “way of doing things”, keeping 
an open mind, experimenting, and 
constantly creating new and  
surprising solutions.
Caring: At 888.com, we value every 
employee, colleague and customer.  
We show it by creating a nurturing 
environment of respect and sensitivity to 
the needs of others. We do not forget our 
commitment to provide a responsible 
gaming environment to all. 
Customer centricity: Keeping our 
customers (both internal and external)  
at the centre of all decision-making 
processes, we strive to exceed customer 
expectations and provide the best 
customer experience.
Leading: We strive to remain one step 
ahead of the competition. This means  
we are constantly on our toes, thinking 
ahead and keeping a close eye on 
industry developments. 
Collaboration: Our success depends on 
our ability to work as a single unit while 
sharing our knowledge, capabilities and 
opinions in an open, respectful and 
trusting environment.
These values underpin the Group’s 
strategic goals, giving all employees  
a sense of identification and a defined 
way of behaving as well as ensuring 
alignment between the organisation’s 
business objectives and those of 
individual employees. These values serve 
us as our guidelines, and we strive to 
obtain a high level of integrity in the way 
we work, communicate and act. 
Professional development
The Group recognises that investment  
in the professional development of its 
employees is a key factor in its ongoing 
success. This year, the Group developed 
a leadership programme which focused 
on providing managers with leading 
global managerial tools and solutions  
(e.g. Ken Blanchard and Myers Briggs) 
for leading and managing their 
employees successfully.
The leadership programme focused on 
coaching managers to adopt appropriate 
leadership styles to suit individuals in 
their team and to develop the behaviour 
required by managers to achieve 
excellent performance and teamwork. 
Building on effective communications, 
motivation skills and concentrating on 
the relationship between manager and 
employee, the programme succeeded  
in enabling managers to analyse and 
resolve a variety of possible situations 
that they may experience and apply 
themselves in the most appropriate way. 
This embedded the Group’s value of 
leadership in its daily operations.
Training
Ensuring that staff have all the skills and 
knowledge required to perform their job 
well and assisting them to develop the 
next generation of products and services 
is crucial to a growing business. The 
Group is dedicated to the professional 
development of its employees so  
that they can achieve their personal 
aspirations. Training is therefore part  
of life@888.com. 
Training initiatives are offered both 
internally and externally and include 
technical skills as well as soft skills 
training. In 2007, 80% of all Group 
employees participated in internal and/or 
external professional training seminars.
The training sections were divided  
into three levels: soft skill training; 
technological training; and industry 
training. In each training section, the 
Group used professional trainers 
together with well designed materials. 
This year, 888 has also initiated a “Train 
the Trainer” internal programme which 
focused on assisting expert employees 
to improve their presentational skills and 
their professionalism. 
Equal opportunity
The Group believes in promoting equal 
opportunities through every aspect of  
the employment relationship and by 
providing a workplace that welcomes 
difference and enables employees to  
feel comfortable.
As 888 enjoys a cosmopolitan workforce 
from a large variety of nationalities all 
working side by side, the Group’s 
diversity policy is explicit. The Group 
does not tolerate any form of 
harassment, including any uninvited, 
unwelcome behaviour which offends, 
humiliates or intimidates. 35% of the 
Group’s worldwide management team  
is female. 
At year end, the Group had 805 
employees (2006: 736) at the following 
locations; Gibraltar 270, Israel 451, 
Antigua 68, London 16.
ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW cont.
Excellence Innovation Caring Annual Report & Accounts 2007  Regulation and general  
regulatory developments
The regulatory framework of online 
gaming in different countries around the 
world remains as dynamic and rapidly 
evolving as ever. While some jurisdictions 
have moved to curtail the activities of 
online gaming sites, many others are 
currently contemplating liberalisation and 
regulation of the industry, and some have 
already taken this route. The Board notes 
that there are significant risks, unique to 
the online gaming industry, including 
from activity with customers in the USA 
prior to the Group’s withdrawal from  
the market in October 2006, where 
customers of 888 generated 55% of  
its Net Gaming Revenue. The Board 
remains committed to monitoring closely 
and addressing regulatory changes as 
they occur, and to fostering, so far as 
possible, the trend towards liberalisation 
and regulation of online gaming 
throughout the world.
Gibraltar
888 is licensed and regulated in Gibraltar. 
Italy
In Italy, 888 received a Sportsbetting 
licence, which allows it to offer 
Sportsbetting services (supervised by 
the  
State Monopoly Authority). Following 
regulations issued by the Italian 
authorities in 2007, the licence will allow 
888 to offer skill games (including Poker 
tournaments), subject to receiving  
the proper authorisations from the  
Italian authorities. 
EU
The European Commission is challenging 
the online gambling and betting 
regulatory regimes of various European 
States, as the Commission holds that as 
regards EU licensed companies, these 
regimes might infringe the enshrined 
freedom to provide services, the freedom 
of establishment and the concept of 
mutual recognition. This effort is  
reflected in, inter alia, the infringement 
proceedings initiated against several  
EU States – Italy, Denmark, Finland, 
Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, 
Sweden, France, Austria and Greece; 
should these Member States fail to 
supply adequate reasoning of their 
gambling legislation, the Commission 
may refer the issue with each Member 
State to the European Court of Justice. 
While these proceedings may, in the end, 
cause the European States to liberalise 
their gambling markets, it should be 
noted that it could be a very long time 
before resolutions or judgments are 
reached (if at all). In this light, in France, 
during March 2007, 888’s Non-Executive 
Director and former Chief Executive 
Officer, John Anderson, attended an 
interview with the French authorities.  
888 is in consultation with its legal 
advisers with regard to this matter, and 
closely monitors the situation for any 
developments. Specifically as to France, 
the French Supreme Court annulled a 
French Court of Appeals judgment 
issued against Zeturf, an online gambling 
operator licensed in Malta, due to the 
fact that the Court of Appeals failed to 
examine whether the French gambling 
legislation is compatible with EU law.  
The Supreme Court ordered the Court  
of Appeals to re-examine the issue 
according to EU law, and also to 
consider whether the social goals which 
justify the gambling monopoly are not 
fulfilled by the Maltese gambling 
legislation. 
In addition to these infringement 
proceedings, the EU Commission is 
involved in other instances in which the 
online gambling and betting regulatory 
regimes appear to contravene rights and 
freedoms of online gambling and betting 
operators (e.g., issuing detailed opinions 
against the enactment of prohibitive 
legislation, and intervening in the WTO 
process described above). 
On 6 March 2007, the European Court  
of Justice issued its judgment in the 
Placanica case, which focuses on the 
compatibility of the Italian gambling 
legislation with EU law. The Court ruled, 
inter alia, that insofar as the prohibition  
to offer gambling services which is set 
within a Member State’s legislation is 
found to be incompatible with EU law, 
such Member State may not apply 
criminal sanctions to an activity which 
contravenes this prohibition. The Court 
found this to be the case there, as a 
specific prohibition contained in the 
Italian gambling legislation which was 
reviewed by the Court was found to 
contravene EU law. Therefore, the Court 
ruled that Italy cannot apply criminal 
sanctions for breaching this prohibition.

USA/WTO
In the USA, UIGEA added a new section 
to the United States Code making it 
illegal for anyone engaging in the 
business of betting or wagering to 
knowingly accept any credit, electronic 
funds transfer, check, draft, etc. in 
connection with the participation of 
another person in unlawful internet 
gaming. In essence, the UIGEA act 
prohibits online gambling operators  
from receiving the proceeds of financial 
transactions in connection with internet 
gaming if the gaming is illegal in the state 
where the bettor is located. In addition, 
the United States Secretary of Treasury 
and Federal Reserve are directed under 
UIGEA to promulgate regulations which 
will require financial institutions to block 
transactions in connection with internet 
gaming (draft regulations were issued  
in October 2007). In October 2006,  
the Group stopped taking bets from  
US customers. 
On 5 June 2007, the Group announced 
that it had initiated preliminary 
discussions with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York regarding activity prior to 
enactment of the legislation. It is too early 
to assess any particular outcome of 
these discussions.
It was recently found by the World Trade 
Organization that the US legislative 
position with respect to Internet 
Gambling violates US trade 
commitments. Following this decision, 
the US withdrew its trade commitment in 
the sphere of gambling; while several 
trade partners required compensation 
from the US following this withdrawal, 
none of the agreements reached, so far, 
between the US and some of these trade 
partners, have had an impact within the 
online gambling market. Antigua and 
Costa Rica did not reach agreement with 
the US, and applied to the WTO to 
arbitrate a settlement between them and 
the US, in connection with the withdrawal 
of the US commitment. 
In December 2007, the Remote Gaming 
Association (a trade body representing 
several online gaming operators, of 
which the Group is a member) filed a 
complaint with the European Union 
against the US in connection with the 
breach of its trade commitments. 
Following this complaint, the European 
Commission decided to open an 
investigation into whether the United 
States is in breach of its WTO obligations 
in the sphere of gambling (in relation to 
the period prior to the withdrawal of its 
commitment). The investigation is 
expected to take five to seven months,  
at the end of which the Commission will 
present its findings, which could lead to 
the initiation of WTO proceedings. 
The Board continues to monitor these 
developments closely, and is alert to 
changes as they may occur in areas 
where the Group operates.

These measures include traffic filtering, 
anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) 
devices, anti-virus protection from leading 
vendors and other such means. Physical 
and logical network segmentation is  
used to isolate and protect the Group’s 
networks and restrict malicious activities. 
In order to ensure systems are protected 
properly and effectively, external security 
scan and assessments are carried out in 
a timely manner. In addition, the Group 
has recently implemented a new high-end 
storage solution enhancing storage 
availability and performance. All critical 
data is replicated to another storage 
device for disaster recovery purposes 
and all data is stored off-site on a  
daily basis.
In order to minimise dependencies on 
telecommunication service providers, the 
Group invests in network infrastructure 
redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its 
service providers. 
As a part of its monitoring system, the 
Group deploys set user experience  
tests which measure performance from 
different locations around the world. 
Network-related performance issues are 
addressed by re-routing traffic using 
different routes or providers. 
888 operate a 24x7 Network

of production activities using state-of- 
the-art systems. These systems are 
designed to identify and provide  
alerts regarding problems related  
to systems, key business indicators  
and issues surrounding customer 
usability experience. 
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each legal 
entity within the Group is a tax resident of 
the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated 
and has no taxable presence in any other 
jurisdiction. While the Group’s customers 
are located worldwide, certain 
jurisdictions may seek to tax such activity 
The Group operates in a new and 
dynamic business environment. In 
addition to the day to day commercial 
risks faced by most enterprises, the online 
gaming industry presents the Group with 
particular challenges in respect of 
Regulatory risk, Reputational risk, 
Information Technology risk and Taxation 
risk, each of which is detailed below. 
Regulatory risk
The regulatory framework of online 
gaming is dynamic and complex. Change 
in the regulatory regime in a specific 
jurisdiction could have a material adverse 
effect on business volume and financial 
performance in that jurisdiction.  
A detailed regulatory review is set  
out below.
Reputational risk 
The Group is exposed to the risk of 
under-age and problem gamblers 
accessing its online real money gaming 
sites. The Group devotes considerable 
resources in putting into place prevention 
measures coupled with strict internal 
procedures designed not to allow 
underaged players from accessing its real 
money sites. In addition, the Group 
promotes a safe and responsible  
gaming environment to its customers 
supplemented by its corporate culture. 
The Group appointed a dedicated 
Director of CSR and Responsible  
Gaming tasked with the responsibility  
of implementing such policies. Further 
details about the Group’s responsible 
gaming initiatives are set out above.
Information technology risks 
As a leading online business, the Group’s 
IT systems are critical to its operation. 
The Group is reliant on the performance 
of these systems whilst ensuring 
exposure to external risks is minimal. 
Cutting-edge technologies and 
procedures are implemented throughout 
the Group’s technology operations 
designed to protect its networks from 
malicious attacks and other such risks. 
which could have a material adverse 
effect on the amount of tax payable by 
the Group or on customers’ behaviour. 
The Group benefit from favourable fiscal 
arrangements in some of the jurisdictions 
in which it has taxable presence without 
which its results would be adversely 
affected. All gaming activities are based  
in Gibraltar, where the Group currently 
benefits from a tax exempt status.  
A change of control or activity of a tax 
exempt subsidiary would result in the  
loss of its tax status. However, this is not 
expected to have a material adverse 
effect on the overall tax rate of the Group. 
The tax exempt status is due to expire by 
the end of 2010 when the Government  
of Gibraltar intends to introduce a new 
fiscal regime that complies with EU 
requirements. The replacement regime is 
still to be unveiled although the Gibraltar 
Government has pledged its commitment 
to maintain fiscal competitiveness and a 
low effective tax rate. The Group is 
required to pay a gaming tax, currently 
set at 1% of gaming yield, with an annual 
maximum cap of £425,000 in aggregate, 
in respect of its Casino, Poker, Bingo and 
Backgammon activities. From 2008, 
additional gaming tax at the same rate  
is due in respect of the Group’s new 
Sports offering.
The Group’s subsidiary in Israel, Random 
Logic Limited, and the Israeli branch of 
Intersafe Global Limited, have each 
entered into separate transfer pricing 
agreements on an arm’s-length basis with 
the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner.  
The arrangements for Random Logic 
Limited are effective until 2010, while  
the arrangement for the Intersafe Global 
Limited branch has terminated on 
31 December 2007. Accordingly, the 
Group is in the process of discontinuing 
the use of this branch and so does not 
intend to enter into a new agreement. 
The operation in Antigua also benefits 
from a low tax regime further mitigated by 
the current small scale of the operation. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company  Richard Kilsby

The Board focuses upon the Group’s 
long-term objectives, strategic and policy 
issues and considers management of 
key risks facing the Group. The Board  
is responsible for acquisitions and 
divestments, major capital expenditure 
projects and considering Group budgets 
and dividend policy. The Board also 
determines key appointments. The  
Board receives regular updates on 
shareholders’ views. 
The Board has established a calendar of 
business. This provides for the financial 
calendar, strategic planning, annual 
budgets and performance self-
assessments, as well as the conduct of 
standing business. The calendar forms 
the basis for effective integration of 
business activities as between the Board 
and its principal Committees (see pages 
34 and 35, which individually consider 
their own operating frameworks against 
the Board’s business programme.
The Board plans to meet six times a year. 
During 2007, the Board met six times. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 34
The Chairman has responsibility for 
ensuring that agendas for Board 
meetings are set in advance. Board 
papers are, where practicable, issued  
to Directors sufficiently in advance of 
meetings to facilitate both informed 
debate and timely decisions. Given the 
importance of regulatory and compliance 
issues to the Company, the Board 
assumed direct responsibility for matters 
falling within the remit of the former 
Regulatory and Compliance Committee 
and, accordingly, this committee  
was disbanded.
Non-executive review and 
performance appraisal
The Chairman holds meetings at least 
once per year with the Non-executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present. Led by the Senior 
Independent Director, the Non-executive 
Directors meet once per year without the 
Chairman present in order to appraise 
the performance of the Chairman. The 
Directors have wide ranging business 
experience, and no individual, or group 
of individuals, dominates the Board’s 
decision making.
The Board considers that Brian 
Mattingley, Michael Constantine and 
Amos Pickel satisfy the criteria of the 
Code to act as Independent Non-
executive Directors. The Board is 
satisfied that, upon his appointment  
as Chairman, Richard Kilsby met the 
independence criteria of the Code. The 
other significant commitments of the 
Chairman during 2007 are detailed  
in his biography on page 32. The  
Board considers that Mr Kilsby’s other 
commitments do not interfere with the 
discharge of his responsibilities to the 
Group and is satisfied that he makes 
sufficient time available to serve the 
Company effectively.
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board has been adopted and its content 
is reviewed to align it with operational 
needs and the Board’s preference to 
monitor and, where appropriate, approve 
matters of substance to the Group as  
a whole. Senior executives have given 
written undertakings to ensure 
compliance within their business 
operations with the Board’s formal 
schedule of matters reserved for itself  
for decision or approval. 
Division of responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Chairman  
are clearly and formally defined, with  
the Chairman being responsible  
for the effective operation of the  
Board as a whole and supporting  
key external relationships. 
Other issues
All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary 
and the Company’s nominated advisers, 
who are responsible for ensuring  
that Board procedures are followed. 
Directors are able to seek independent 
professional advice, if required, at the 
Company’s expense provided that they 
have first notified their intention to do  
so. The appointment or removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole.
The Board accepts that there should  
be a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the induction of new 
Directors, which has been formulated 
with the guidance of the Nominations 
Committee.
The opportunity to hold office as Non-
executive Directors of other companies 
enables Directors of 888 to broaden their 
experience and knowledge, which will 
benefit the Company. Executive Directors 
may be allowed to accept non-executive 
appointments with the Board’s prior 
permission, so long as these are not 
likely to lead to conflicts of interest. 
Executive Directors may be required to 
account for fees received from such 
other companies.
The Company has arranged insurance 
cover in respect of legal actions against 
its Directors. To the extent permitted by 
Gibraltar law, the Company also 
indemnifies the Directors. Neither the 
insurance nor the indemnity provides 
cover where a Director has acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are subject to re-
appointment by shareholders at the  
first Annual General Meeting after  
their appointment, and thereafter,  
in accordance with the Articles of 
Association of the Company, at intervals 
of no more than three years. Gigi Levy 
and John Anderson were appointed as 
directors (Mr Anderson for an initial 
period of three years) at the 2007 Annual 
General Meeting. Brian Mattingley, 
Michael Constantine and Amos Pickel 
(the Independent Non-executive 
Directors) were appointed for a period of 
three years, following their reappointment 
by the shareholders at the 2007 Annual 
General Meeting. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three 
Independent Non-executive Directors: 
Brian Mattingley (Chair), Michael 
Constantine and Amos Pickel. The Board 
is satisfied that Brian Mattingley has 
sufficient recent and relevant financial 
experience to Chair the Audit Committee. 
Normally, by invitation, the Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer and Internal Auditor 
attend Committee meetings, as may 
representatives of the Company’s 
external auditors. 
The Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on request  
to the Company Secretary and are 
included on the Company’s website, 
www.888holdingsplc.com.

In summary, the Audit Committee  
assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities with regard to financial 
reporting, external and internal audits 
and controls, including reviewing 888’s 
annual financial statements, considering 
the scope of annual audit and the extent 
of non-audit work undertaken by external 
auditors, approving 888’s internal audit 
programme, advising on the appointment 
of external auditors and reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control systems.
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises 
three Independent Non-executive 
Directors, Michael Constantine (Chair), 
Brian Mattingley and Amos Pickel as  
well as Richard Kilsby, Chairman. The 
Nominations Committee did not meet 
during 2007. 
The Nominations Committee assists the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities 
relating to the composition of the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is 
responsible for reviewing, from time  
to time, the structure of the Board, 
determining succession plans for the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
and identifying and recommending 
suitable candidates for appointment as 
Directors. The Nominations Committee’s 
terms of reference are available on 
request to the Company Secretary and 
are included on the Company’s website, 
www.888holdingsplc.com.
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration 
Committee comprises solely 
Independent Non-executive Directors. 
Brian Mattingley chairs the Remuneration 
Committee and its other members are 
Michael Constantine and Amos Pickel. 
The Remuneration Committee  
assists the Board in determining  
its responsibilities in relation to 
remuneration, including making 
recommendations to the Board on 888’s 
policy on executive remuneration, 
determining the individual remuneration 
and benefits of each of the Executive 
Directors, and recommending and 
monitoring the remuneration of senior 
management below Board level. 
The Remuneration Report, which 
outlines the Remuneration Committee’s 
work and details of Directors’ 
remuneration, is on pages 37 to 44.  
The Remuneration Committee’s terms  
of reference are available on request  
to the Company Secretary and are 
included on the Company’s website, 
www.888holdingsplc.com.
Risk management and  
internal control
The Directors acknowledge that they are 
responsible for the Company’s system of 
internal control, for setting policy on 
internal control, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control. It is 
management’s role to implement Board 
policies on risk and control, including 
reporting. The system of internal control 
is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated responsibility 
to the Audit Committee to review the 
appropriateness and adequacy of 
systems of internal control on an ongoing 
basis and to make recommendations to 
the Board. The Company has an Internal 
Auditor who reports to the Audit 
Committee, whose audit programme for 
2008 was reviewed and approved by the 
Audit Committee early in 2008. 
888’s payment risk management team, 
based in Gibraltar, has developed 
stringent payment risk management and 
fraud control procedures. The team 
makes use of external and internal 
systems to manage the payment risks 
faced by 888’s operational systems. 
Detailed procedures exist throughout the 
Company’s operations and compliance 
is monitored by operational management 
and the Internal Auditor.
The Directors periodically review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control. The review considers 
individual risk control responsibilities, 
reporting lines and qualitative 
assessments of residual risks. 
Relations with shareholders and key 
financial audiences
The Company maintains an active and 
regular dialogue with principal and 
institutional shareholders and sell-side 
analysts through a planned programme 
of investor relations and financial PR 
activity. The outcome of these meetings 
is reported to the Board. The programme 
includes formal presentations of full  
year and interim results, quarterly  
release of Key Performance  
Indicators, analysts’ conference  
calls and periodic road shows.
Brian Mattingley, the Senior Independent 
Director, is available to shareholders to 
address any issues that normal contact 
with the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer is 
inappropriate or has failed to resolve  
the issue.
All shareholders are welcome to attend 
the 2008 Annual General Meeting and 
private investors are encouraged to  
take advantage of the opportunity given 
to ask questions. The Chairmen (or 
nominated members) of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees will attend the meeting  
and be available to answer questions. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 36
Compliance with the  
Code provisions
As 888 Holdings Public Limited 
Company is registered in Gibraltar, it is 
subject to compliance with Gibraltar 
statutory requirements and is not bound 
by the UK Combined Code. The main 
legislation relevant to companies in 
Gibraltar is the Gibraltar Companies  
Act 1930, which is based on the UK 
Companies Act 1929. 
Going concern
After reviewing the Group’s budget for 
2008 and its medium-term plans, the 
Directors are confident that the Company 
and the Group have adequate financial 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They 
have therefore continued to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements.
Corporate and Social  
Responsibility Statement
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is 
the Director responsible for monitoring 
corporate and social responsibility within 
888. The Board receives periodic reports 
on the Group’s activities in this area from 
the Chief Executive Officer. Further 
details are set out in the Responsible 
Gaming report on page 25.
Community 
Sponsorship
888 is a sizeable employer with a visible 
presence in Gibraltar and enjoys a good 
relationship with the local community. 
During 2007, the Group continued its 
policy of reinforcing this relationship by 
making contributions to a number of 
local causes, primarily educational. 
Charities
In 2007, the Group made donations 
totalling US$232,000 (2006: US$32,000) 
to organisations promoting various social 
causes in Gibraltar and Israel.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CONTi Nu Ed Annual Report & Accounts 2007 37
In accordance with the Listing Rules,  
the Company presents its report on the 
remuneration of its Directors for the  
year ended 31 December 2007. The 
Company is incorporated in Gibraltar 
and, therefore, is not required to comply 
with the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
requirements in Schedule 7A to the UK 
Companies Act 1985, but has chosen to 
prepare this Remuneration Report on the 
basis of those requirements.
The report sets out the structure  
and details of the remuneration of  
the Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2007. It also describes  
the Board’s policy and approach to  
the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to Directors’ remuneration.
A resolution to approve the 
Remuneration Report is proposed, 
annually, to shareholders for approval. 
This Remuneration Report will be put to 
shareholder vote at the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists 
solely of independent Non-executive 
Directors, currently Brian Mattingley 
(Chair), Michael Constantine and Amos 
Pickel. Details of attendances at 
Committee meetings are contained in the 
statement on Corporate Governance on 
page 33. The Remuneration Committee 
has formal terms of reference (which  
are available on request in writing  
to the Company Secretary and  
on the Company’s website, 
www.888holdingsplc.com).
The Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the framework of executive 
remuneration and its cost. It is required 
to take account of any recommendation 
made by the Remuneration Committee  
in determining the remuneration,  
benefits and employment packages  
of the Executive Directors and senior 
management and the fees of  
the Chairman.
REMu NERATi ON REPORT
Independent advice
The Board intends that executive 
remuneration policies be both formal and 
transparent. It further acknowledges the 
importance of taking into consideration 
independent advice in setting 
remuneration policies and benefit levels. 
The Remuneration Committee has  
taken advice from New Bridge Street 
Consultants as independent advisors 
with respect to Executive Directors’ 
remuneration towards the end of 2006 
and therefore further advice was not 
required during 2007. The policies 
applied in 2007 are consistent with  
that advice.
Remuneration policy
Executive Directors
Remuneration packages must be 
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate 
Directors of the calibre appropriate  
to a global business in a competitive 
environment. The components of  
the remuneration structure are set  
out hereafter.
At least half of the total potential 
remuneration of the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer  
are represented by a variable element, 
dependent on the performance of the 
Company. The Remuneration Committee 
considers that these represent 
achievable and motivational levels  
of personal rewards commensurate  
with stipulated levels of corporate 
performance. 
The Remuneration Committee is 
mandated by the Board to satisfy itself 
that the level of the Directors’ and senior 
management’s remuneration is 
appropriate, having regard to pay and 
conditions throughout the rest of the 
sectors in which the Group operates.  
It will further satisfy itself that such 
remuneration aligns with the risks and 
rewards to shareholders. In this context 
the Remuneration Committee will 
regularly review individual and corporate 
performance targets.
Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-executive 
Directors receive fees only, and are not 
eligible to participate in any bonus plan, 
pension plan, share plan, or long-term 
incentive plan of the Company. The 
Chairman and the Executive Directors 
determine the fees paid to the Non-
executive Directors. The Chairman’s fee 
is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee.
Fees paid to the Non-executive Directors 
are set by reference to an assessment of 
the time commitment and responsibility 
associated with each role. Levels take 
account of additional demands placed 
upon individual Non-executive Directors 
by virtue of their holding particular 
offices, such as Committee Chairman 
and/or Deputy Chairman and travel time 
to the Group’s headquarters in Gibraltar. 
The fees paid to each Non-executive 
Director during 2007 are disclosed in the 
Directors’ remuneration summary on 
page 40.
Remuneration structure
Base salary and benefits
Base salaries are subject to annual 
review. Gigi Levy’s last review took place 
in November 2006 and his salary for 
2007 was raised to GBP420,000. Aviad 
Kobrine’s last review took place in 
September 2006 and his aggregate 
salary for 2007 which is paid by his 
employers, the Company and Cassava 
Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited was raised 
to GBP275,000. Neither salary was 
raised during the 2007 financial year. 
Benefits provided to executive directors 
include a car (in the case of Gigi Levy) 
and a car allowance (in the case of  
Aviad Kobrine) and health, disability  
and life insurance. 
Annual cash bonus
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine are entitled 
to an annual cash bonus of up to 120% 
of annualised salary, subject to the 
achievement of predetermined targets. 
The Remuneration Committee sets  888 Holdings Public Limited Company 38
bonus targets and levels of eligibility each 
year. For the 2007 financial year, the 
performance target was 20% growth in 
revenue* compared to 2006 for non-US 
business and provided that the EBITDA* 
margin for 2006 will be maintained. The 
pay out levels were set at 50% of base 
salary for 80% performance, increasing 
on a linear basis up to 100% where 
targets were fully satisfied. In the event 
that revenue growth exceeded 20%, the 
percentage bonus entitlement increased 
by 4% for every 1% additional revenue 
growth, up to a total bonus entitlement  
of 120%.
These targets were met in full during  
the 2007 year and both Gigi Levy and 
Aviad Kobrine are entitled to receive  
the maximum annual cash bonus which 
was 120% of their annualised 2007 
salary. The bonuses are payable by 
 their respective employers. The 
Remuneration Committee has rigorously 
reviewed the results achieved against  
the performance targets set for the  
2007 financial year the Remuneration 
Committee and is satisfied that the 
targets it set upfront were challenging 
and the bonuses awarded were earned 
by outstanding performance.
Pensions
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine are each 
entitled to a cash payment in lieu of an 
annual contribution to their personal 
pension schemes of 15% of their 
respective base salaries (in the case of 
Aviad Kobrine, 15% of his basic salary 
under both service agreements). 
Long term incentives 
On 30 August 2005 the Company 
adopted two employee share incentive 
plans which took effect on flotation:  
(i) the 888 All-Employee Share  
Plan; and (ii) the 888 Long  
Term Incentive Plan. 
The Company currently grants awards 
only under the 888 All-Employee Plan. 
REMu NERATi ON REPORT 
CONTi Nu Ed The 888 Long Term Incentive Plan was 
approved prior to flotation but no awards 
have been granted under it. 
Performance-dependent options and 
awards were granted under the 888  
All-Employee Plan to the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives  
on 14 September 2006, 30 April 2007,  
30 May 2007 and 10 September 2007. 
Details of these awards and options are 
set out on pages 42 and 43. 
888 All-Employee Share Plan
All employees, exclusive consultants  
and Executive Directors of the Group 
who are not within six months of their 
normal retirement age are eligible to 
participate in the 888 All-Employee  
Share Plan at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Awards under the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan can either be granted for no 
consideration (or with a nil exercise price) 
or at an exercise price that will normally 
be no less than the market value of an 
Ordinary Share at the time of grant or 
average share price during a period as 
determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at time of grant. In countries 
where an award or option involving real 
shares is not appropriate or feasible for 
legal, regulatory or tax reasons, a 
phantom award may be used.
The maximum number of Ordinary 
Shares that an eligible employee may 
acquire pursuant to share awards or 
options granted to him in any calendar 
year under the 888 All-Employee Share 
Plan and the 888 Long Term Incentive 
Plan may not have an aggregate market 
value, as measured at the date of grant, 
exceeding 200% of his annual base 
salary or such higher limits as the 
Remuneration Committee may determine 
is appropriate in any individual case. 
Awards vest in installments over a  
fixed period of up to four years. The 
Remuneration Committee may determine 
that the vesting and release or exercise 
of share awards and options under the 
888 All-Employee Share Plan is subject 
to performance conditions imposed at 
the time of grant. 
The performance conditions which 
determine the vesting of the options and 
awards granted on 12 September 2006 
to Executive Directors and members of 
senior management are driven solely  
by financial performance, not by 
comparison to an external peer Group. 
Vesting occurs over a period of four 
consecutive years starting in April 2007 
and is subject to target growth in the 
Company’s annual EPS (excluding share 
benefit charges). In each year, EPS must 
grow by a target of at least 20% in order 
for 100% of the award for that year to 
vest. For the 2008 financial year, 40% of 
the award vested upon fulfilment of the 
performance conditions in full (10% of 
the award having vested during 2007 
with the remaining 50% of the award 
capable of vesting over 2009 and 2010). 
50% of the award vests upon 
achievement of 80% of the target EPS 
growth rate and increases on a linear 
basis up to 100% upon achievement of 
100% of the target EPS growth. If the 
threshold of 80% of target EPS growth 
rate is not met in any one year, the 
portion of the award due to vest in  
that year shall lapse. Performance 
conditions are capable of being 
amended by the Remuneration 
Committee if circumstances which 
prevailed at the date of grant have 
subsequently changed provided that the 
amended performance conditions would 
be a fairer measure of performance. 
*	 Subject 	 to	 certain	 adjustments	 as	 determined	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 39
EPS was taken as the parameter for 
these performance conditions as the 
Remuneration Committee is of the view 
that, given the nature of the industry in 
which the Company operates where its 
share price performance is heavily 
influenced by external factors outside its 
control, that it is a better measure of the 
Company’s own performance. The 
Remuneration Committee is of the view 
that these performance conditions 
provide a focus on delivering absolute 
financial returns.
888 Long Term Incentive Plan
All employees and Executive Directors of 
the Group who are not within six months 
of their normal retirement age are eligible 
to participate in the 888 Long Term 
Incentive Plan at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. As at the date 
of this report, no awards have been 
granted pursuant to the 888 Long Term 
Incentive Plan. 888 has given long-term 
incentive awards to Executive Directors 
under the 888 All Employee Plan. 
Scheme limits 
Awards and options granted under the 
888 All-Employee Share Plan and the 
888 Long Term Incentive Plan may be 
satisfied through the issue of new shares. 
It is intended that grants of options and 
awards are to be planned so as not to 
exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary Share 
capital in any rolling 10 year period for 
the 888 Long Term Incentive Plan, and 
10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital 
in any rolling 10 year period for the 888 
All-Employee Share Plan and the 888 
Long Term Incentive Plan, in the 
aggregate. The Committee intends to 
have regard to appropriate annual flow-
rates so as to ensure that these limits are 
not breached.
Employee Trusts
The Company has established two 
Trusts to further the interests of the 
Company, its subsidiaries and 
shareholders by providing share 
incentives to employees (including 
Executive Directors) of any Group 
company to enable the Group to attract, 
retain and motivate employees.
The 888 IPO Share Award Trust and the 
888 Holdings Plc Share Plan Trust were 
created pursuant to Trust Deeds dated 
14 September 2005. The 888 IPO Share 
Award Trust is operated in connection 
with the grant of share awards and nil 
cost options to employees of the Group 
at the time of the IPO. These trusts 
current hold 162,361 Ordinary Shares in 
the Company.
Director appointments – service 
contracts and Directors’ fees
Executive Directors
Each Executive Director’s service 
agreement is terminable on no more than 
12 months’ written notice by either party. 
Each Executive Director’s employment 
can be terminated by making a payment 
equal to the salary and pension 
contributions and the value of other 
contractual benefits due to the Executive 
Director in lieu of any unexpired notice 
period. The Executive Directors continue 
to be entitled to be paid a bonus during 
any unexpired part of the notice period 
even if the employment is terminated by 
making payment in lieu of notice. Awards 
granted under the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan to Gigi Levy and Aviad 
Kobrine pursuant to their service 
agreements, on 14 September 2006, and 
29 September and 4 October 2005 
respectively, continue to vest during any 
unexpired part of the notice period and 
they shall be treated as a “good leaver” 
under the terms of the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan where their employment has 
been terminated by making a payment in 
lieu of notice. No other benefits upon 
termination of employment are payable. 
An Executive Director’s entitlement to 
share awards and share options under 
the 888 All-Employee Plan on termination 
of employment will be governed by the 
terms of that plan (and in the case of the 
initial awards made to Gigi Levy and 
Aviad Kobrine by the relevant provisions 
of their service agreements). 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 40

Substantial shareholdings 
As at 31 December 2007 the Company had been notified of the following interests in 3% or more of its Share Capital:
     % Issued 
    Number share 
Principal Shareholder Trust    of shares capital
E Shaked Shares Trust    86,283,534 25.4
O Shaked Shares Trust    86,283,534 25.4
Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust    37,122,358 10.9
Shareholder agreements and consent requirements
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights are held by a person other than the holder of the shares.
A Relationship Agreement governing the relationship between the above Principal Shareholder Trusts and the Company was 
entered into in connection with the Company’s flotation. The Relationship Agreement provides that all transactions between the 
Group and the Principal Shareholder Trusts will be on a normal business basis, that the Group will be allowed to carry on business 
independently of them and that the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not cause the Group to contravene the Combined Code 
unless required by law or as contemplated in the Relationship Agreement. It further provides that each of the Principal Shareholder 
Trusts will not solicit Group employees without consent, that only Independent Directors can vote on proposals to amend the 
Relationship Agreement, that the Principal Shareholder Trusts will consult the Group prior to disposing of a significant number of 
shares in order to maintain an orderly market and shall not disclose confidential information unless required to do so or having first 
received the Company’s consent. The Relationship Agreement also includes restrictions on the Principal Shareholder Trusts power 
to appoint Directors and obligations to ensure that the majority of the Board, excluding the Chairman, is independent. The Principal 
Shareholder Trusts can nominate a Non-executive Director for appointment to the Board and the Directors will consider the 
appointment of the nominated person to the Remuneration Committee. In the event that this right is exercised and it results in 
fewer than half the Board (excluding the Chairman of the Board) being Independent Directors, such appointment shall only 
become effective upon the appointment to the Board of an additional Independent Director. Such restrictions and obligations 
apply whilst the E Shaked Shares Trust and O Shaked Shares Trust collectively or the Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust individually, 
hold not less than 7.5%.
Change of control
Other than the Group’s gaming licences where change of control is subject to prior consent, there are no contracts to which the 
Group is a party which would allow the counterparty to terminate or alter those contractual arrangements in the event of a change 
of control of the Group.

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at  
any time the financial position of the 
Company, for safeguarding the assets, 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities and for the preparation 
of a Directors’ report which complies 
with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) 
Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and 
the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930.
Financial statements are published on 
the Group’s website in accordance  
with legislation in the UK governing  
the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements, which may vary 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s website is the responsibility  
of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the  
ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements. The Directors are 
required to prepare financial statements 
for the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and have also chosen 
to prepare financial statements for the 
Company in accordance with IFRSs.
Group and parent company financial 
statements
Company law requires the Directors  
to prepare such financial statements  
in accordance with the Gibraltar 
Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the 
Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar 
Companies Act 1930.
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that financial statements present 
fairly for each financial year the Group 
and Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s “Framework for  
the preparation and presentation of 
financial statements”. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will  
be achieved by compliance with all 
applicable IFRSs. 
 
A fair presentation also requires the 
Directors to:
consistently select and apply 
appropriate accounting policies;
present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information; and
provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable members to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial 
performance.

(Accounts) Act 1999 to be filed with the

On behalf of the Board 
Gigi Levy
Chief Executive Officer
8 April 2008 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 48
We have audited the Group and the Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of 888 Holdings Public Limited 
Company for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Company Statement of Changes in Equity  
and the related notes 1 to 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes 1 to 11 to the Company Financial Statements.  
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the parts  
of the remuneration report described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company has complied with the requirements of rules 9.8.6 and 9.8.8 of 
the Listing Rules in preparing its Annual Report and has also complied with schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985 as if it 
was incorporated in the UK.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 and the part of the Remuneration Report described as 
having been audited, has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or if information 
specified by the Listing Rules and Gibraltar legislation is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, 
Enhanced Business Review, Regulatory and Compliance Review, Corporate Governance Statement and the unaudited part of 
the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter and for no other purpose. No person is entitled to 
rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of the terms of our engagement 
letter or has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for 
this report to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the parts of the 
Remuneration Report described as having been audited, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited.

Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the 
state of the Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, 
Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930, and
the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited, has been properly prepared in accordance with 
Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985; and
the information provided in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – regulatory issues
In forming our opinion, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of, and draw attention to, the disclosures made 
in note 24 to the financial statements concerning the residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had 
customers in the US prior to the enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. 
Note 24 includes a statement that the Board has not been able to identify reliably at this stage what, if any, liability may arise and 
accordingly no provision has been made.

2 Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are as follows:
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards, including International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and Interpretations, adopted by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”) and endorsed for use by companies listed on an EU regulated market.
The significant accounting policies applied in the financial statements of the Group in the prior years are applied consistently in 
these financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars (US$’000) because that is the currency the Group primarily 
operates in.
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930.
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC), are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no 
significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position:
IFRS 7 – Financial instruments disclosure (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007). Additional 
disclosure has been included in the financial statements to comply with this standard.
IFRIC 7 – Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 – Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies (effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006).
IFRIC 8 – Scope of IFRS 2 – Accounting for share-based payments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 
2006).
IFRIC 9 – Reassessment of embedded derivatives (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006).
IFRIC 10 – Interim financial reporting and impairment (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006).

2 Significant accounting policies continued
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or IFRIC, have not been adopted by the Group as these were not 
effective for the year 2007. The Group is currently assessing the impact these standards and interpretations will have on the 
presentation of its consolidated results in future periods:
IAS 1 (Amendment) – Presentation of Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) – 
IAS 1 has not been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007). IFRIC 
11 has been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRIC 12 – Service concession arrangements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 12 has 
not been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008). IFRIC 13 has not been 
endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRIC 14 – The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 19 has not been endorsed for use in the EU.
IAS 23 (Amendment) – Borrowing costs (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). IAS 23 has not been 
endorsed for use in the EU.
IAS 27 – Consolidated and separate financial statements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). IAS 27 has not 
been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 2 (Amendment) – Vesting conditions and cancellations (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2009). IFRS 2 (Amendment) has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 3 (Revised) – Business combinations (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).  
IFRS 3 (Revised) has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 8 – Operating segments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) contains requirements for the 
disclosure of information about an entity’s operating segments and also about the entity’s products and services, the 
geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers. The standard is concerned only with disclosure and replaces 
IAS 14 – Segment reporting. IFRS 8 has been endorsed for use in the EU.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable Financial 
Instruments and Obligations arising on Liquidation (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). These 
amendments have not been endorsed for use in the EU.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. 
These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below: 
Taxation     Note 6
Intangible assets acquired     Note 9
Impairment of goodwill     Note 10
Consolidation on the basis of control     Note 18
Share-based payments     Note 19
Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities     Note 24 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 56
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Presentation of continuing and discontinued operations
As a result of enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (“UIGEA”) in October 2006, the Group withdrew from 
offering real-money activity to the US facing market.
Although the Group did not operate the US facing business as a separate business, it was a separate geographical segment of 
the Group’s business and in accordance with IFRS 5 – “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” the 
income statement and related notes are required to show continued and discontinued operations separately. 
Net Gaming Revenue and certain direct costs associated with the discontinued operations, which are of distinct nature, were 
allocated accordingly. Other costs (such as R&D expenses, IT expenses, Share benefit charges, office rent and associated  
cost, depreciation of fixed assets, gaming duty, Directors’ and Officers’ insurance, Directors’ fees and tax), which are not 
distinguishable, were all allocated to the continuing operations and not to the discontinued business. In allocating the rest of the 
costs of the Group between the two operations, management has applied reasonable estimates in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards. However, as estimates have necessarily been used in disclosing a geographical segment as discontinued 
operations, the results do not necessarily reflect the financial performance which would have been achieved had the discontinued 
operations been managed as a stand-alone business.
The matters described above mainly refer to the year ended 31 December 2006, as during 2007 any cost associated with the 
discontinued operations was clearly distinguishable.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are companies 
controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the 
parent gained control until such time as control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of 
accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any 
excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company and using consistent 
accounting policies.
 
Net Gaming Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occurred.
Net Gaming Revenue is defined as follows: 
Casino	
Casino winnings that are the differences between the amounts of bets placed by members less amounts won by members.
Poker
Ring games: Rake, which is the commission charged from each winning hand played.
Tournaments:  Entry fees charged for participation in Poker tournaments are recognised when the tournament  
has concluded.
Emerging	Offerings		 Net Gaming Revenue from Emerging Offerings is defined as the commission charged from winnings or entry fees charged for 
participation in a tournament. In the case of white label activity, Revenue is the net commission charged.
Casino winnings, revenues from the Poker business and Emerging Offerings are stated after deduction of certain bonuses 
granted to members. 
Other operating income 
Other operating income consists mainly of revenue generated from processing customers’ cross currency deposits and 
withdrawals, effectively reducing costs associated with payment service providers.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currency
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies are translated into US dollar equivalents using year-end 
spot foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in administrative expenses.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are translated into 
the presentation currency as follows:
(i) Monetary assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance 
sheet.
(ii) Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions).
(iii) Exchange rate differences on translation of Group entities that have functional currencies different from US dollars are 
included in administrative expenses.
Taxation
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs 
from its tax base. Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the difference can be utilised. The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/
assets are settled/recovered. 
Research and development costs
Research and development expenditure is charged to the statement of income as incurred. IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” requires 
capitalisation of certain software development costs, subsequent to technological and commercial feasibility being established 
and the Group having sufficient resources to complete development. Based on the Group’s product-development process, 
technological feasibility and therefore the creation of substantially improved product, is only established upon the completion of a 
working model. The Group generally does not incur any significant costs between the completion of the working model and the 
point at which the product is ready for general release. 
Intangible assets
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets. For 
acquisitions during the year 2007, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between three 
months and four years. Intangible assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of any assets given, liabilities assumed and equity 
instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income 
statement. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration 
paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Carrying amounts are reviewed  
at each balance sheet date for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their 
estimated residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows: 
IT equipment 33%
Office furniture and equipment 7–15%
Motor vehicles 15%
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 58
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on  
31 December. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on  
the asset’s cash generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows).
Financial instruments
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Trade	receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from the 
credit-card companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full 
amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash	and	cash	equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities  
of three months or less. 
Equity
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade	and	other	payables
Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost.
Member	deposits
Member deposits are the amounts that clients place in the Group’s electronic “wallet” or bankroll, including provision for bonuses 
granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to member accounts, along with full provision for Casino 
jackpots. These amounts are repayable on demand in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Available	for	sale	financial	assets
Available for sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial categories, 
are classified as available for sale and comprise principally the Group’s investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries.  
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity. Where there is a 
significant decline in the fair value of an available for sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including any amount 
previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement.
Chargebacks and returned e-cheques
The cost of chargebacks and returned e-cheques is included in operating expenses.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which  
it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Segment information
A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or 
a Group of related products or services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business 
segments. A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or 
services within a particular environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components 
operating in other economic environments.

The Group operates in the following online gaming segments:
Casino
Poker 
Emerging Offerings is a new segment added during the year which comprises mainly the newly acquired Bingo  
business and 888’s Backgammon offering.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends this is when paid. In the case of 
final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Share based payments
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares or market value options, the fair value at the date of grant is 
charged to the income statement over the vesting period. Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount 
recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.

Gibraltar – The Company and its Gibraltar registered subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the Gibraltar Companies 
(Taxation and Concessions) Act (the “CTCA”) as a tax-exempt company. Subject to a change of ownership or activity of a tax-
exempt company, the grandfathering of tax-exempt benefits in respect of existing tax-exempt companies will extend up to 
31 December 2010. Domestic corporate tax in Gibraltar is 33% (2006: 35%). Gibraltar’s Chief Minister has announced further 
reductions in anticipation of the introduction of a flat low tax rate of between 10% and 12% in 2010. A consultation is in place with

Israel – 888’s operations in Israel have entered into separate transfer pricing agreements on an arm’s-length basis with the Israeli 
Income Tax Commissioner. The agreement in respect of Random Logic Limited is effective until the end of 2010. The agreement 
in respect of the Israeli branch of Intersafe Global Limited was effective until the end of 2007. The Group is in the process of 
discontinuing the use of this branch and so does not intend to enter into a new agreement. Domestic corporate tax in Israel is 
29% (2006: 31%).
UK – 888’s subsidiary in the UK pays corporate tax in the UK at the applicable rate of 30% (2006: 30%).
7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
In accordance with IAS 33, “Earnings per share”, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into 
account all potentially dilutive shares and share options granted, which are not included in the number of shares for basic 
earnings per share. In addition, certain employee options have also been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their 
exercise price is greater than the weighted averaged share price during the year and it would not be advantageous for the holders 
to exercise the option. The number of options excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 4,765,036 (2006: 3,230,182).

9 Acquisitions made during the year 
Online Bingo business 
On 16 May 2007 the Group acquired the assets comprising the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited (“Bingo Business”) 
for an all cash consideration. 
In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the fair value of the net assets of the Bingo Business has been valued by a 
professional valuation firm and recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 and adjustments from book value have been made where 
necessary. These adjustments are summarised as follows:

The fair value relates to the recognition of customer lists (US$888,000), royalty agreements (US$1,113,000), licensing agreements 
(US$2,113,000) and other intangible assets (US$200,000) acquired as part of the acquisition. These intangibles are being 
amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three months and four years. All intangible assets on acquisition 
have been identified and fair valued. The remaining goodwill represents the access to future trade with the Bingo customers.

The revenue and operating profit generated from this acquisition in the post-acquisition period to 31 December 2007 were
US$14.4 million and US$5.2 million respectively. Had the business been owned for the entire year, the revenue and operating 
profit would have been US$20.2 million and US$8.3 million respectively.

The other intangible assets relate to the recognition of customer lists, royalty agreements, licensing agreements and certain 
software developed and acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets comprising the online Bingo Business of Globalcom 
Limited. These intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three months and four 
years. The intangible assets have been identified and valued using third party professional valuers, and are based on their value 
in use to the business. Goodwill is associated with the cash generating online Bingo Business acquired during the year. 
In accordance with IAS 36 and IFRS 3, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its goodwill. A review was undertaken 
at 31 December 2007 to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is supported by the net present value of future cash flows 
generated by these assets using cash flow estimates for four years.
The discount rate used for purposes of the review is the Company specific weighted average cost of capital percentage of 19%. 
In estimating the future cash flows the Group has used very prudent estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs 
incurred.
The result of the review undertaken at 31 December 2007 was that no impairment is required and the carrying value of the 
intangible assets is appropriate.  888 Holdings Public Limited Company 66

managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer. The Board reviews the 
effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks. 
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arise, are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
Restricted cash
Trade and other receivables
Available for sale financial assets
Trade and other payables
Member deposits
Detailed analysis of these financial instruments is as follows:

Capital
The Capital employed by the Group is comprised of equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the Group is 
maximising shareholders’ value which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited 
to the Group’s size, strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 22 there are no demands or 
restrictions on the Group’s capital.
The main financial risk areas are as follows:
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables who are the Group’s payment service providers (“PSP”).  
These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawal of funds to and from the members’ virtual wallet with the 
Group. These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies.
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group.
The Group reduces this credit risk by:
monitoring those balances on a regular basis;
arranging for the shortest possible cash settlements intervals;
replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution;
ensuring a new PSP is contracted following various due diligence and ”Know Your Customer” procedures; and
ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on specific PSPs.
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience, it is not required to provide for any potential bad 
debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation.
None of the balances owed by the various PSPs are overdue or impaired.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to members disputing charges made to their credit cards (“chargebacks”) or any 
other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Members may fail to fulfil their obligation 
to pay which will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits (or returned e-cheques), when 
occurring will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for these 
eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis of past transactions and estimated trends. This provision is netted off from 
the trade receivables balance and at 31 December 2007 was US$845,000 (2006: US$500,000).
The Group’s inhouse Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following 
prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third 
party measures.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other locations (Israel, Antigua and 
London) maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations.
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the finance  
function in Gibraltar.
The Group segregates funds due to members and holds these funds in separate bank accounts. These funds are not used to 
fund activity other than that directly related to members.
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with a 
credit rating lower than A (based on Standard & Poor’s rating).
The Group maintains its cash reserve in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximise yield.
Restricted cash
The Group may be required to deposit cash collateral to secure a letter of credit that substitutes reserves required to be held by a 
PSP. Such deposit will be with a reputable financial institution instead of with the individual PSP. This decreases the cash balance 
with the PSP and therefore exposure. As at 31 December 2006, most of the restricted cash was of this nature. During the year 
2007, the Group was able to substantially reduce those requirements and as at 31 December 2007, restricted cash is mainly 
attributed to a deposit in respect of the Group’s obligation with the developer of the offices of its subsidiary in Israel.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk exists in the case where the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due.
The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.
In the case of the Group’s liability to its members, the Group maintains these deposits in separate bank accounts which are not 
used for its day to day operations.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had a deferred acquisition liability of US$25,145,000 in respect of the acquisition of the 
online Bingo Business of Globalcom Limited. The Group maintains sufficient funds to meet this liability which is due between 
April and May 2008. In addition the Group has assured that cash earmarked to fund its final dividend payment for 2007, is in 
place.
The Group expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances 
and will not need to resort to any debt borrowing.
The following table details the contractual maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities:

22 Financial risk management continued
Market risk
Interest	rate	risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds.
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds or on call over night facilities. The Group also 
arranged with its principal bankers that excess funds are swept automatically across its accounts, every night, in order to 
maximise availability of funds for investments.
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no borrowings. A 0.5% movement in bank interest rates would not have  
a significant impact on finance income for the year or the prior year.
Currency	risk
The Group’s overall financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is a result of a mis-match between receipts which are 
denominated is US$ and expenses, part of which are denominated in foreign currencies, of which to be noted are the British 
Pound Sterling (GBP), the Euro (EUR) and the New Israeli Shekel (ILS). The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk 
and takes steps to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia, by using foreign exchange forward 
contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities. At 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006, there were  
no outstanding forward contracts. There were no significant fair value movements on these contracts during the year.
The Group further mitigates that risk by way of natural hedging whereby a certain portion of funds collected from the PSP are 
settled in either GBP or EUR in order to fund its expenses denominated in these currencies.

24 Contingent liabilities
From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of 
success of such claims and actions. 
Regulatory issues 
As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues to monitor 
legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice in 
respect of these developments. 
Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US 
and barred such customers from wagering real-money on all of the Group’s sites.
Notwithstanding this, there remains a residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US 
prior to the enactment of the UIGEA. The Board is not able to identify reliably at this stage what if any liability may arise and 
accordingly no provision has been made.
On 5 June 2007 the Group announced that it has initiated preliminary discussions with the United States Attorney’s Office for the 
Southern District of New York. It is too early to assess any particular outcome of these discussions. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company 78

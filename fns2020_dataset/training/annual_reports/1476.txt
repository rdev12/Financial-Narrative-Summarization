ATH at a glance
From exploration to restoration, ATH Resources 
develops, operates and restores surface coal mines.
One of the largest producers of coal in the UK, producing close to 2 million 
tonnes per annum. 
Coal was used to generate around a third of the UK’s electricity in 2010 and the 
Company holds coal supply contracts with nearly all of the UK’s main electricity 
generating companies.
How do we develop?
The Group employs specialist staff to identify and evaluate 
p o te n t i a l	n e w	s i te s	t h at	c o n t a in	s u f fi c i e n t	r e s e r v e s	o f	h i g h

applications are prepared and submitted to replace the 
Group’s current coal production with new reserves, 
securing the long term sustainability of the business.

How do we produce?
The Group utilises modern plant and equipment to extract coal 
deposits from surface mines. The majority of coal is used in the 
power generation industry, whilst premium coals are supplied 
to the industrial and domestic markets, making the Group 
one of the largest producers of household coal in the UK.
How do we restore?
The Group, working closely with third parties including Local 
Authorities and Environmental Agencies, utilises innovative 
techniques to minimise its impact on the environment. 
Surface mines undergo progressive restoration during coal 
extraction and, following the completion of mining activities, 
l a n d	is	r e t u r n e d	t o	an	a g r e e d	c o n d i t i o n	an d	p r o fi l e .

Introduction
The period under review has been a 
d i f fi c u l t 	 o n e 	 f o r 	 A TH . 	 Th e 	 c o n t in u ed 	 im pa c t 	
of the below market price legacy contracts 
combined with much higher input costs, 
principally gas oil, and unexpected 
geological conditions at a number of the 
Gr o u p ’ s 	 s i tes , 	 h a v e 	 a l l 	 c r eated 	 s i g n ifi can t 	
pressure on performance.
D e s p i te	t h e s e	d i f fi c u l t i e s	t h e	G r o u p	
is committed to satisfying legacy 
contract volumes as quickly as possible 
an d	r e m a in s	o n	t r a c k	t o	f u l fi l	t h e	fi r s t	o f	
these contracts by the end of March 2012 
and the second during 2013. The Group 
has also continued to reduce net debt 
and has delivered a further reduction of 
£3.0 million to £31.5 million in the year.
Results in brief
Sales volumes for the year at 1.67 million 
tonnes were slightly lower than last year 
(1.79 million tonnes) but average selling 
p r i c e s	r o s e	b y	1 5 %	t o	£ 5 0 . 4 3	p e r	t o n n e	
( 2 0 1 0 : 	 £ 4 3 . 7 0 	 per 	 t o n n e ) , 	 in c r ea s in g 	 r ev en u e	
t o 	 £ 8 4 . 2 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 1 0: 	 £ 7 8 . 3 	 m i l l i o n ) .	
The Group’s legacy sales contracts continue 
to constrain performance and during the 
year accounted for around 32% of total 
sales volumes. Demand for the Group’s 
products remains strong and the Board is 
c o n fi d e n t	o f	b e in g	ab l e	t o	s e l l	a l l	o f	i t s	
annual production. Pre exceptional operating 
p r o fi ts 	 w er e 	 £3 . 0 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 1 0 : 	 £7 . 0 	 m i l l i o n ) . 	
However, as it is now apparent that the 
higher input costs, particularly gas oil, 
will feature for some time to come, it was 
necessary to increase the Group’s restoration 
provisions by £1.5 million. Additionally 
t he 	 d i f fi c u l t 	 g e o l o g i c a l 	 c o n d i t i o n s 	 at 	
Glenmuckloch and Muir Dean required a 
write down of the Group’s work in progress 
p r o vi s i o n s 	 o f 	 so m e 	 £ 4 . 1 	 m i l l i o n . 	 Th i s 	 t og et h er	
with other small exceptional charges 
resulted in a pre‑ tax loss of £5.8 million 
( 2 0 1 0 :	p r o fi t	£ 4 . 0	m i l l i o n )	a n d 	 a 	 b a s i c 	 l o s s	
per share from continuing operations of 
11.5 pence (2010: earnings of 6.3 pence). 
Dividend
Given the impact of the legacy contracts 
and the level of exceptional charges this 
year, the Board will not be recommending 
t h e	p a y m e n t	o f	a	fi n a l	d i v i d e n d .	H o w e v e r ,	
the Board will continue to review the 
situation and remains committed to 
delivering a progressive dividend to 
shareholders in the future.
Carbon Reduction Commitment
The Board maintains its view that the 
Group does not qualify for inclusion in the 
Government’s new Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Scheme (“CRCS”) and 
decided not to register for the Scheme. 
H o w e v e r ,	as	an n o u n c e d	o n	1 4	J u n e	2 0 1 1 ,	
the Department of Energy and Climate 
Change (“DECC”) has subsequently issued 
ATH with an enforcement notice, asserting 
a failure to register as a participant in the 
fi r s t	p h a s e	o f	t h e	C R C S,	w h i c h	t h e	G r o u p	
is appealing. Central to the issue is 
whether or not the electricity consumed 
by ATH’s conveyor, which transports coal 
from its Glenmuckloch site to its railhead 
at New Cumnock some twelve kilometres 
away, is exempt from CRCS. The appeal 
was heard on 7 and 8 November 2011 
and a decision is expected in early 2012. 
The cost to the Group should its appeal

each of the three years from April 2011. 
The Group will update the market 
as appropriate.
Takeover talks
During the year the Group was 
approached by a third party with 
a view to possibly acquiring ATH. 
The Board fully co‑ operated with the 
third party over several months in order 
to achieve the best possible outcome for 
its shareholders but ultimately could not 
agree a basis on which the transaction 
could proceed. Offer talks were 
terminated on 13 September 2011. 
In summary

Banking and restoration 
bond facilities
During the year the Group was able 
to successfully re‑ negotiate its banking 
facilities, increasing the facility available and 
extending the duration to 31 May 2013.
As the Group opens a new site it has 
to provide the local authority with an 
insurance bond to cover the liability of 
restoring the site in the event that the 
Group fails to do so. Recently this market 
has tightened considerably with one of 
the Group’s main providers withdrawing 
from the market and a second provider 
reducing its participation. Maintaining an 
appropriate level of bonding will be one 
of the main challenges facing the Group 
in the coming year. However, the Board 
has recently negotiated additional facilities 
w i th 	 i t s 	 e x i s t ing 	 pro v i de r s 	 an d 	 i s 	 con fi de n t 	
that the necessary bonding facilities will 
be available as and when required for

following the departure of the former 
Chief Executive, Tom Allchurch, and 
Finance Director, Steven Beaumont. Their 
replacements, Alistair Black and Andrew 
Weatherstone, have now been in their 
posts for over twelve months and together 
have conducted a thorough review of the 
business and re‑ negotiated the Group’s 
b an k in g 	 f a c i l i t i e s . 	 T h e 	 B o ar d 	 i s 	 s at i s fi e d 	
that the transition to the new management 
team is complete and that I can resume 
my previous role as Non‑ executive 
Chairman. This change will take effect 
from the date of the Annual General 
Meeting on 29 February 2012.
The Group’s Senior Non‑ executive Director, 
Vaughan Williams, has decided to retire 
from the Board and will step down at the 
Annual General Meeting. The Board would 
like to join me in thanking Vaughan for his 
valuable contribution over the last seven 
years and in wishing him well for the future.
Tim Stokeld will become the Senior 
Independent Director and will chair the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Outlook
Production is planned to continue at around 
current levels with the Group’s strategy 
focused on delivering as much of the legacy 
contracts as possible whilst continuing to 
comply with its commitments to its banks 
and shareholders, and further reductions 
in debt.
Following the successful re‑ negotiation 
of one of the Group’s remaining legacy 
contracts the Board expects a continued 
rise in average selling prices and turnover. 
However, it recognises that the Group 
is exposed to movements in commodity 
markets and should the recent disconnect 
between rising gas oil prices and falling 
coal prices continue margins will be 
impacted. The new mine at Netherton 
is now in full production as planned 
and Duncanziemere which has recently 
commenced coaling is performing 
satisfactorily and will progressively increase 
production throughout the coming year.
Looking to the longer term, the Group 
continues to develop and invest in new sites 
in order to increase its reserve base and 
to strengthen the business going forward.

the reduction of debt, both of which will 
improve future shareholder value in the 
longer term. Given the increased costs of

undertaken with increased focus on 
mining lower ratio, higher quality coal 
reserves. Whilst several cost‑ saving 
initiatives targeted at reducing the Group’s 
operating cost structure are beginning to 
take effect, the major challenge for the 
Group remains the continued escalation 
in the price of gas oil at a time when 
income is constrained by the impact

in the international market price of coal 
but also from an improved mix. This policy 
has helped mitigate the impact of rising 
input costs and the unexpected geological 
conditions at Glenmuckloch and increased 
old workings at Muir Dean.
Alongside these operational challenges, 
the Group was faced with a rise of 28% 
in the price of gas oil, its single largest 
input cost. Prices have risen by a further 
5% since the year end, in part driven by 
adverse movements in the value of the 
US dollar. Furthermore, following an 
increase in international rubber prices, 
the cost of replacement tyres has increased 
by 15% in the second half of the year with 
further rises anticipated during 2012.
During the year the Group invested 
some £8.0 million in successfully opening 
its new operation at Netherton. Although 
quantities of heat affected coal in the 
initial areas impacted on both volume 
and quality, this site contributed nearly 
30% of the Group’s total production 
in 	 t h e 	 p a s t 	 fi n an c i a l 	 y e ar . 	 W i t h 	 t h e 	 s i te 	
now in full production and operations 
having advanced away from the heat 
affected areas, Netherton is expected 
to account for over 37% of the current 
year’s production.
In spite of these challenging conditions 
the Group was still able to report an 
o p e r at in g 	 p r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 e x c e p t i o n a l 	
charges of £3.0 million (2010: £7.0 million).
After making capital investments of 
£10.6 million, the Group has continued to 
reduce debt to £31.5 million, a reduction 
of £3.0 million in the year. This is the third 
consecutive year debt levels have reduced.
Legacy contracts
One of the features of the Group’s 
business is the supply of coal contracted 
to the Electricity Supply Industry (“ESI”) 
at 	 fi x e d 	 p r i c e s 	 w h i c h 	 ar e 	 b e l o w 	 c u r r e n t 	
market prices. Since the year end the 
Group has been able to successfully 
re‑ negotiate improved terms for one 
of these contracts which will increase 
average selling prices. 
This year around 32% of sales volumes 
were supplied to satisfy these contracts. 
It remains a key priority for ATH to meet 
these commitments as quickly as possible. 
Consequently the Group remains on track 
t o	c o m p l e te	t h e	fi r s t	o f	t h e s e	c o n t r a c t s	
in March 2012 with a second due to be 
completed the following year. Legacy 
volumes will then fall to around 15% 
of annual sales volumes.
“Greater emphasis has been placed on fulfilling the 
supply of tonnage due under legacy contracts and 
the reduction of debt, both of which will improve 
future shareholder value in the longer term.”

Coal reserves and mine development
Following the successful opening of 
Netherton, the Group commenced 
its initial site preparations to develop 
Duncanziemere, which is expected 
to become fully operational this year. 
In addition, the Group was successful 
in achieving planning permission for 
extensions at Glenmuckloch and Muir 
Dean for 505,000 tonnes and 350,000 
tonnes respectively, both of which 
form part of current production plans.
As at 2 October 2011 the Group had 
5.0 million tonnes proved reserves (2010: 
6.1 million tonnes) and probable reserves 
of 2.9 million tonnes (2010: 2.5 million 
tonnes). The table overleaf, relating to 
exploration results, mineral resources or 
mineral reserves is based upon information

and consents to the inclusion in this report 
of the matters based on his information 
in the form and context in which they 
appear. A glossary of terms is available 
on the Group’s website www.ath.co.uk.
In addition to the table overleaf, estimated 
resources in excess of 11 million tonnes 
have been secured through various licence

The Group is anticipating bringing forward 
over 2 million tonnes into the planning 
process during the next twelve months.
Production this year exceeded new sites entering the planning 
system and therefore year end proved and probable reserves were 
lower at 7.9 million tonnes (2010: 8.6 million tonnes). During the 
next 12 months it is expected that new applications totalling 
around 2 million tonnes will enter the planning system.

Summary
The Group is expecting an improved 
performance in the current year, together 
with further reductions in bank debt. 
However, the trading environment remains 
a challenging one, with the high cost of 
gas oil expected to continue and, in the 
short term, coal prices easing from their 
earlier peak.
Alistair Black
Chief Executive
Coal prices
International coal prices rose sharply in 
t h e	fi r s t	h a l f	o f	l a s t	y e ar	t o	a	p e ak	o f	$ 1 3 0	
per tonne but have since fallen back by 
around 20%. The evident disconnect 
between coal and oil prices over the past 
few months will, if it persists, put further 
pressure on margins for the Group; 
however, the recent re‑ negotiation of the 
Group’s remaining legacy contracts will 
help alleviate the potential impact.
Health and safety
The Board understands the potential 
hazardous nature of the work undertaken 
in surface mining. The Group takes its 
responsibilities for health and safety 
levels very seriously and strives to 
continually improve the safety levels 
in all of its operations. 
ATH has been successful in maintaining 
its RoSPA Gold award and OHSAS 
accreditation from BSI for health and 
safety standards in 2011, recognising 
the Group’s continued commitment 
to creating the safest possible 
working environment. 
Each Mine Manager has the necessary 
qu a l i fi c at i o n s	an d	c o m p e te n c e	t o	m an a g e

a dedicated Health and Safety Manager.
Regular training is provided to employees

(2010: £78.3 million), an increase of 8%. 
Sales volumes were 1.67 million tonnes 
(2010: 1.79 million tonnes) including 
530,000 tonnes supplied to legacy contracts.
Notwithstanding the impact of these 
below market price legacy contracts, 
the average sales price per tonne rose

I n p u t 	 c o s t 	 in c r e a s e s 	 s i g n i fi c an t l y 	
impacted the Group’s operating margins, 
with increases in the cost of gas oil (of 
approximately 28% year on year) being 
the main driver. The Group’s hedging 
strategy did, however, help to reduce 
fuel costs by £0.5 million. In addition the 
average mining ratio at which the Group 
operates increased during the year leading 
to a rise in the unit cost of production 
t o	£ 4 3	p e r	t o n n e	( 2 0 1 0 :	£ 3 5	p e r	t o n n e ) .
During the year the Group exercised 
its option to take £2.0 million of 
royalties under its agreement with 
RecyCoal Limited. This necessitated 
an associated goodwill write off of 
£1.65 million.

There have been a number of largely 
non‑ cash exceptional charges during the 
year, which in total amounted to £6.2 million:

over a number of years. 
Consequently the overall loss before

the year in respect of prior years. There 
was a tax credit for the year of £1.2 million 
giving an effective rate of 20.8%, compared 
the standard rate of 27%. The level of tax 
credit was lower than the expected due to 
the goodwill write off of £1.65 million in 
respect of RecyCoal Limited not being 
deductible for tax purposes.
At 2 October 2011 the Group had unused

Earnings and dividends per share
Earnings per share in respect of continuing 
operations before exceptional items were

After taking into account exceptional 
items the Group recorded a loss per share 
of 11.5 pence (2010: earnings of 6.3 pence).

the Group’s accounting policy in respect 
of work in progress (deferred stripping 
costs) in the previous year, the Board does 
not believe that the adoption of IFRIC 20 
will have a material impact on the Group’s 
performance. However, IFRIC 20 requires 
the 	 de f e rre d 	 s tripping 	 c os t s 	 t o 	 be 	 cl a s sifie d

in progress balance, which is at present 
included in current assets, when the Group 
implements IFRIC 20 once it is formally 
adopted by the EU.
Cash flow and borrowings
Overall total net borrowings including hire 
purchase obligations reduced by £3.0 million 
to £31.5 million, which compares to a 
peak 	 o f 	 o v er 	 £ 4 5 . 0 	 m i l l i o n 	 t h r ee 	 yea rs 	 a g o .	
Net bank borrowings amounted to 
£18.6 million (2010: £17.6 million). 
Cash generated from operations improved 
to £16.2 million from £12.7 million last 
year which helped fund the increase in 
capital expenditure which amounted 
to £10.6 million (2010: £7.3 million); this 
was slightly lower than planned following a 
delay to the start of the Duncanziemere site.
The Group successfully re‑ negotiated 
its revolving credit facility with its existing 
lenders extending it to 31 May 2013. 
In addition the facility was increased to 
provide £23.5 million until May 2012 
from which time it reduces in stages to 
£19.0 million by the end of September 2012. 
Further reductions are then phased to 
reduce the facility to £16.0 million by 
the end of April 2013.

forecasts and projections based upon 
detailed assumptions in particular with 
regard to levels of coal production and 
the key risks and uncertainties, together 
with the level of borrowings and other 
facilities made available to the Group. The 
Board also takes account of reasonable 
possible changes in trading performance 
to determine whether the Group should 
be able to operate within its current level 
of facilities. Key factors that have been 
considered are:
•	 	 r e c e n t	p e r f o r m a n c e	h a s	d e m o n s t r ate d	
the impact of unpredictable geological 
conditions on production volumes. 
Further shortfalls of production could 
lead to a potential material adverse

•	 	 t h e 	 G r o u p 	 r equ ir es 	 a d equ ate 	 r est o r at i o n	
bond facilities to continue to operate 
both existing and new sites. Recently the 
number of bond providers providing 
surety in this market has reduced with 
one withdrawing from the market 
c o m p l e te l y	an d	an o t h e r	s i g n i fi c an t l y	
curtailing its participation. Shortage 
of bond facilities could lead to the 
Group not being able to operate at 
planned levels of production and 
failure to renew a bond could result in 
a claim on the Group under the terms 
of its counter indemnities given to 
the bond providers. However, the 
Group has recently negotiated 
additional facilities with its existing 
p r o v i d e r s	an d	is	c o n fi d e n t	t h at	t h e	
necessary bonding facilities will be 
available as and when required;

re‑ negotiated, providing a facility 
through to 31 May 2013. The facility 
is at a level of £23.5 million, with 
scheduled reductions commencing 
May 2012 onwards reducing the facility 
to £19.0 million by September 2012 
and then to £16.0 million in April 2013. 
  These facilities contain performance 
covenants including interest cover, 
debt to borrowing ratio and debt 
service ratio, which if breached could 
lead to a need to re‑ negotiate terms 
or in the extreme case, a reduction 
or withdrawal of the facilities 
concerned; and

Corporate social responsibility
The Group is aware that its activities 
can have an impact on a wide range 
of stakeholders including employees, 
neighbouring communities and local 
and national governmental agencies 
and departments. The Group strategy 
focuses on the integration of its policies 
to maximise opportunities for its people 
and the communities within which we 
operate, whilst minimising the impact 
of its activities on the environment, 
neighbours and other interested parties. 
Environment
The Group is conscious that its activities 
c o u l d	h a v e	a	s i g n i fi c a n t	im p a c t	o n	t h e	
environment. The Group considers the 
potential environmental impact of its 
operations at every stage of a mine’s life 
cycle from the initial planning phase 
t o	fi n a l	r e s t o r at i o n .	P r o m o t in g	e x c e l l e n c e	
in environmental standards is a primary 
objective of the business and these issues 
are key to the strategic development 
of each site.
During the planning phase of each 
potential project, a full environmental 
assessment is carried out which is 
included within a formal planning 
application as the Environmental 
Statement. The potential impact on 
the environment at each stage of the 
development and operation of a site 
is considered and reported by senior mine 
management which engages specialist 
external consultants as required. 
The Group implements many initiatives 
to improve the local environment and 
environmental legacy issues. At the former 
Grievehill site in Ayrshire, the Group employs 
rangers to assist in supporting suitable 
nesting areas for birds of prey, including 
the rare hen harrier. This enabled hen 
h ar r i e r	c h i c k s	t o	fl e d g e	du r in g	t h e	y e ar .	
At Grievehill, the Group improved the 
condition of 150 hectares of degraded 
bog through a re‑ wetting programme.
At Muir Dean in Fife, the Group is 
implementing a scheme to resolve what 
is considered to be the worst coal mine 
legacy pollution of a water course 
in Scotland. Working closely with the 
Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, 
the scheme involves the creation of a 
minewater treatment facility to remove 
iron and other pollutants from the 
Fordell Day Level, an old deep minewater 
drainage tunnel. The polluted minewater 
is pumped through water cascades and 
l a g o o n s 	 an d 	 fi l te r e d 	 t h r o u g h 	 o r g an i c 	
reed beds before being discharged back 
into its original course.

Environment Initiative, a partnership 
involving the local authority, conservation 
bodies and industry, working to enhance, 
promote and conserve the environment. 
This initiative has included the creation 
and enhancement of wildlife habitats 
and schools liaison amongst others.
People
The Group recognises that its people 
are the most valuable resource within 
the business and an open and challenging 
working environment is encouraged. 
ATH is committed to the training and 
development of its people to allow all 
s t af f	m e m b e r s	t o	f u l fi l	t h e ir	p o te n t i a l .	
The surface mining industry involves the use 
of large plant and machinery and the Group 
in v e s t s	s i g n i fi c an t	r e s o u r c e s	t o	e n s u r e	a l l	
operatives are properly trained to use the 
equipment safely and effectively. The Group 
undertakes an ongoing programme to 
monitor employee competency and each 
staff member has a tailored development 
and training plan to ensure that ATH remains 
an industry leader in employee competence.
Management training
During the year, the Group continued 
to focus on talent management and 
career development, with the objective 
of identifying the future managers 
of the business and providing them 
with the training and skills to develop. 
Career ladders have been created for 
all departments to provide a clear career 
progression plan for each team, setting 
o u t	t h e	e x p e c te d	qu a l i fi c at i o n s	an d	
anticipated experience required for an 
employee to be considered for promotion.
The Learning and Development Plan has 
am a l g am ate d	a l l	t h e	t r a in in g	i d e n t i fi e d	
during performance reviews. This plan 
provides cost effective, targeted training 
in order to develop the skills and capabilities 
of the Management of ATH.
Operational training
During the year, the Group continued 
to provide specialist training through the 
Mining Training School at the Grievehill 
restoration site. This School is responsible 
for all the new starter inductions and 
delivery of all the NVQ assessments. 
Conducting both the assessments and 
inductions on a restoration site ensures 
the highest standard of training is delivered 
in a safe environment under the close 
s u p e r v i s i o n	o f	a	qu a l i fi e d	t r a in e r	an d

Q u a l i fi cat i o n s 	 C r ed i t 	 F r am ew o r k 	 in 	 2 0 1 1 .
The high level of training capability 
has seen the school train 85% of the 
workforce to NVQ Level 2 standards 
on their primary piece of equipment, 
when combined with the large amount 
of tertiary training delivered to the 
workforce, means that ATH has one of 
t h e	b e s t	qu a l i fi e d	an d	m o s t	c o m p e te n t

Health and safety
A key strategic Group objective is to provide 
safe working environments for all employees 
and visitors at ATH mines and facilities.
Group health and safety policies 
and procedures are controlled through 
the ATH Resources plc Health and Safety 
Committee, chaired by the CEO responsible 
for health and safety. Health and safety is 
managed through the Health and Safety 
Assessment Model which drives Group 
performance through four key stages. 
The policy strives for continuous 
improvement through awareness, 
competence, compliance and excellence.
The Group provides ongoing high 
quality training to all employees in 
every aspect of health and safety and 
promotes an open culture where unsafe 
practices are challenged and reported 
to achieve our targets of excellence and 
continuous improvement. 
The Group had two reportable injuries 
during the year (2010: four) and suffered 
no major injuries. The Company has an 
a u d i te d	in c i d e n t	r ate	o f	4 5 6	f o r	R I D D O R	
reportable incidents compared to the 
industry average of 1292.
The Group continues to maintain full 
accreditation to OHSAS 18001 (Occupational 
Health and Safety Management Systems) 
which recognised the quality of the processes 
for the management of health and safety 
within the Group.
RoSPA Gold Award
During the year, ATH was again awarded 
RoSPA (Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents) Gold Award 2011. This 
accreditation was received in recognition 
of the Group’s performance in promoting 
and attaining a high standard in the 
management of health and safety 
and in providing a safe place of work. 
Areas of particular strength were in 
h a z ar d	i d e n t i fi c at i o n ,	t h e	u s e	o f	s af e	
working practices, compliance with 
industry regulations and the involvement 
of safety representatives in new initiatives 
and training.
These achievements are shared by all 
employees of the Group without whose 
commitment and effort the improvements 
and awards would not have been attained.
Social and community
The Group understands the importance 
of communication and interaction with 
our neighbouring communities to provide 
information about its operations and support 
through sponsorship and donations. 
ATH operates community liaison groups 
at each of its sites. These groups meet 
on a regular basis and allow the exchange 
of information on site progress whilst 
enabling community representatives 
to raise any issues for discussion. 
The Group provides support to community 
g r o u p s	an d	p r o j e c t s	an d	p r o v i d e s	fi n an c i a l	
support through direct sponsorship and 
activities or through community and 
environmental trusts. 
Supported independent trusts include the 
Cumnock and Doon Valley Minerals Trust, 
t he 	 K irk c o n nel 	 Coa lfield 	 T rust, 	 t he 	 Coa lfields 	
Environment Initiative and the Muir Dean 
Environmental Trust. Overall, the Group

Principal risks and uncertainties
Replacement of production
The Group’s operations have a finite life due to the geology of each site and will 
become exhausted at some point in the future. Production is replaced through the 
development or acquisition of new sites and extensions to existing sites. Historically 
the Group has been able to replace its coal reserves due to the efforts of its internal 
planning team combined with its longstanding relationships with planning authorities 
and local communities to deliver planning consent for new sites and extensions.
Exploration 
and development
The exploration for, and development of, coal deposits involves significant risks, which 
are managed through the combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge. 
Not all sites which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. 
There can be no guarantee that estimates of quantities and qualities made will be 
realised or that appropriate consents will be granted. With all mining operations there 
is uncertainty and therefore risks associated with operating parameters and costs.
Uncertainty over 
reserve estimates
There are many unknowns inherent in estimating coal reserves and many of these 
factors are beyond the Group’s control. Adverse geological conditions could arise which 
may not be predicted based upon available data. Reserves are also subject to ongoing 
surveys which could result in either increases or decreases to the reserves present. 
The volume, grade and site ratio of coal reserves recovered have a direct impact on the 
financial results of the Group. The Group bases its coal reserve estimates on internally 
generated geological data and it regularly reviews its coal reserves on an ongoing basis 
and the estimates are revised where necessary.
General mining 
and processing risks
The Group’s operations are subject to all of the hazards and risks normally encountered 
in the exploration, development and production of coal. As well as uncertainty over 
remaining coal reserves, referred to above, the risks include adverse weather conditions, 
flooding, mechanical plant failure and difficult blasting conditions. Appropriate levels 
of site investigation are undertaken to minimise the risks of flooding and blasting 
conditions, while using its own equipment and directly employing most of its 
maintenance engineers the Group is able to react quickly to any plant issues.
Volatility of price of coal
The market price of coal is volatile and is affected by numerous factors that are beyond 
the Group’s control. These include international supply and demand, the level of consumer 
product demand, international economic trends, currency exchange rate fluctuations, 
the level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, the cost of freight, global or regional 
political events and international events, as well as a range of other market forces. 
The Group mitigates to a certain extent its exposure to the volatility of coal prices by 
using a mix of short and long term fixed price contracts. In addition the Group has 
a number of contracts which vary in line with the international price of coal. 
Volatility in gas oil prices
A significant portion of the Group’s costs are dependent upon the price of gas oil, 
which is used to power the Group’s plant fleet. An increase in gas oil costs would 
lead to an increase in operating costs. The Group manages its exposure to gas oil 
prices by using derivatives to hedge floating fuel cost exposures. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 17 www.ath.co.uk
Health and safety
The Group’s activities are, and will continue to be, subject to health and safety standards 
and regulations. Failure to comply with such requirements may result in fines, penalties 
and/or litigation. Moreover mining activities are subject to potential health and safety 
risks associated with the operation of heavy plant and explosives on site. Risk assessments 
are carried out by management and the services of external risk consultants are retained 
to identify any potential risks and ensure safe methods of working.
Government regulations
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Government regulations, in 
particular with reference to low carbon economy initiatives such as the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment Scheme, as noted in note 27 to these financial statements. 
The possibility also exists that future legislation or regulations may be adopted that 
could adversely affect the Group’s mining operations, its cost structure or its customers’ 
ability to use coal. 
Restoration bonds
The Group’s activities result in the creation of working sites and mining voids that require 
substantial remedial and restoration works at the end of coaling operations. As part of the 
planning approvals process, the Group is normally required to obtain agreed restoration 
bonds that cover the anticipated remedial works, which are substantial in certain instances. 
The impact of recent uncertainty in the financial markets has reduced the potential sources 
of restoration bonds and could lead to insufficient facilities being made available, 
although the Group has negotiated additional facilities with its existing providers 
and is confident that the necessary facilities will be available as and when required.
Financing
The Group finances part of its operating through debt. Details of the Group’s existing 
facilities are given in notes 19 and 30. There is the risk that the Group is unable 
to refinance its bank debt or is unable to obtain new or additional debt if required. 
The ability to raise finance is affected by factors outside of the Group’s control such 
as general economic, political and capital market conditions as well as credit availability. 
As noted earlier in the Financial Review, the Group has recently extended its current 
banking facilities to May 2013. 
Environmental issues
The Group’s activities and the markets in which it operates are subject to environmental 
regulation. Such regulations typically cover a wide variety of matters including prevention 
of waste, pollution and protection of the environment. The risk is managed by daily 
inspections of all operations with a potential to cause environmental breaches and 
by careful design of the operations to mitigate any potential risk.

Directors’ report
The Directors submit their report and the audited financial statements of ATH Resources plc for the year ended 2 October 2011.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activity of the Group is the operation of surface coal 
mines and the subsequent sale of coal to UK electricity generators, industrial and domestic customers. The Group operates under the 
title of ATH Resources.
Review of developments and future prospects
A balanced and comprehensive analysis of development and performance of the Group is contained in the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Group Chief Executive’s Statement and Group Finance Director’s Financial Review on pages 4 to 11. This analysis includes 
comments on the position of the Group at the end of the financial period and consideration of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the business. The key performance indicators, which are monitored in relation to the achievement of the strategy of the 
business, are set out in this report below.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. The Directors are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the Companies Act 2006.
In the case of the Company accounts, UK company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the 
financial year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
h h select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
h h make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
h h state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
h h prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In the case of IFRS accounts for the Group, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly 
for each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation 
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Directors are also required to:
h h properly select and apply accounting policies;
h h present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
h h provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS as adopted by the EU is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
ATH Resources plc website. Legislation in the United Kingdom (“UK”) governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 19 www.ath.co.uk
Directors’ indemnities
The Group made third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors for the whole of the year, which continue to remain 
in force and the Group has taken out third party insurance in respect of these indemnities.

establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.
Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)

financial and non-financial measures. The following are the most significant KPIs used by the Group:
2011 2010
Sales price – revenue earned per tonne of coal sold (£) 50 44
Cost price – operating cost per tonne of coal sold (£) 43 35

Employees
The Directors recognise the importance of the Group’s employees in the success of the business.
The Group is committed to equal opportunities in employment and seeks to ensure that all current employees or applicants are 
treated equally regardless of age, sex, nationality, race, colour, creed or disability.

concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their employment with 
the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, provided the supplier has also complied with agreed 
terms and conditions. At 2 October 2011, the trade creditors of the Group represented 40 days (2010: 37 days) of purchases.

Corporate governance report
Introduction
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), 
the Company fully supports the principles set out in the Code and will attempt to comply wherever possible, given both 
the size and resources available to the Company. Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises three Executive Directors and two Non-executive Directors. On 4 October 2010 Mr Andrew Weatherstone 
was appointed as the Group’s Finance Director and Company Secretary. Mr Tom Allchurch stood down from the position of Non-executive 
Director on 18 January 2011.
Mr Vaughan Williams has stated his intention to stand down from the Board with effect from the forthcoming AGM to be held 
on 29 February 2012, at which time the Chairman Mr D C Port will revert to being a Non-executive Director.
The Alchemy Plan has the right to nominate a Non-executive Director but has chosen not to do so. If the Alchemy Plan’s shareholding 
in the Company falls below 10% of the issued share capital, the right to appoint ceases.
The Board generally meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors, 
together with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility to formulate, 
review and approve the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
During the year ended 2 October 2011 the Board met a total of twelve times for regular meetings and a further six times to consider 
other business.
Board committees
The Board has established three committees: Audit, Remuneration and Nominations, all having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors, Mr Vaughan Williams and Mr Tim Stokeld. The Committee is 
scheduled to meet twice a year. It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how 
to apply the financial reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with 
the independent auditor of the Group. Mr D C Port will replace Mr V Williams on the Audit Committee upon Mr V Williams’ retirement.
During the year ended 2 October 2011 the Audit Committee met on two occasions.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration 
packages for individual Directors.
During the year ended 2 October 2011 the Remuneration Committee met on three occasions.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive and meets as required to consider 
and make recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and encourages communication with private 
shareholders via the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Statement 
and website (www.ath.co.uk) to provide further information to shareholders.
The Board considers Mr Vaughan Williams to be the Senior Independent Director. Mr Tim Stokeld will become the Senior Independent 
Director upon Mr V Williams’ retirement.

Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Each year, on behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by 
considering the risks potentially affecting the Group and discussions with the external auditor.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level 
of Director review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, 
as compared against budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors, as well as against material loss 
or claims against the Group, and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial instruments and associated policies are set out in note 30.
Going concern basis
These financial statements are prepared on the basis that the Group is a going concern. In forming its opinion as to going concern 
the Board have taken into account the material uncertainties set out on page 31. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 23 www.ath.co.uk
Remuneration committee report
Introduction
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a full formal remuneration report, only disclosure as to the remuneration 
earned in respect of the financial year by each director acting in such capacity during the financial year. However, in line with current 
best practice, this report provides information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors’ remuneration is 
determined. The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors’ remuneration packages and makes 
its recommendations to the Board. The Committee comprises the two Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, 
normally in June.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages after taking advice from independent remuneration consultants are designed to be competitive and 
to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, a fully financed company car or car allowance, death 
in service benefit, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses and share options.
Service contracts
Mr Alistair Black’s agreement is dated 14 June 2011 terminable upon twelve months’ notice being given by either party. Mr David Port 
entered into a letter of appointment dated 12 May 2004, amended on 6 December 2011 to reflect Mr Port’s appointment as 
Executive Chairman, which requires twelve months’ notice to be given by either party. Mr Andrew Weatherstone has a service 
agreement dated 13 June 2011 also terminable upon twelve months’ notice being given by either party.
Non-executive Directors
Mr Vaughan Williams entered into a letter of appointment dated 12 May 2004 which was renewed in October 2009. Mr Williams 
was appointed for an initial three year term, which can be terminated upon six months’ notice being given by either party. Mr Tim Stokeld 
was appointed as an Independent Non-executive Director on 6 May 2009 and the appointment is subject to an annual review and 
can be terminated upon three months’ notice being given by either party.
Following the sale of the ATH Regeneration assets, the Group entered into an arrangement with RecyCoal Limited for the provision 
of the services of Mr Tom Allchurch as a Non-executive Director which was terminated on the resignation of Mr Allchurch on 
18 January 2011.

Group accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently to all years presented, are set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, 
which are carried at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Going concern basis
These financial statements are prepared on the basis that the Group is a going concern. In forming its opinion as to going concern, 
the Board prepares forecasts and projections based upon detailed assumptions in particular with regard to levels of coal production 
and the principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 16 and 17, together with the level of borrowings and other facilities 
made available to the Group. The Board also takes account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance to determine 
whether the Group should be able to operate within its current level of facilities. Key factors that have been considered are:
h h recent performance has demonstrated the impact of unpredictable geological conditions on production volumes. Given that 
a significant proportion of the Group’s volumes are phased to legacy contracts at prices significantly below market prices 
other shortfalls of production tend to impact on levels of higher market priced coal leading to a potential material adverse 
impact on cash and profitability;
h h the Group requires adequate restoration bond facilities to continue to operate both existing and new sites. Recently the 
number of bond providers providing surety in this market has reduced with one withdrawing from the market completely 
and another significantly curtailing its participation. Shortage of bond facilities could lead to the Group not being able to 
operate at its planned levels of production. Failure to renew a bond could result in a claim on the Group under the terms 
of its counter indemnities given to its bond providers. The Group has been in discussions with its existing providers and they 
are willing to provide additional facilities which should be sufficient to allow the Group to renew its bonding requirement as 
they fall due in the next 12 months;
h h bank facilities have recently been renegotiated, providing a facility through to 31 May 2013. The facility is at a level 
of £23.5 million, with scheduled reductions commencing May 2012 onwards reducing the facility to £19 million by 
September 2012 and then to £16 million in April 2013. These facilities contain performance covenants including interest 
cover, debt to borrowing ratio and debt service ratio, which if breached could lead to a need to renegotiate terms or, 
in the extreme case, a reduction or withdrawal of the facilities concerned; and
h h sales price in respect of a number of contracts are floating and based upon the international price of coal, creating a risk 
of unpredictability in revenues and cash.
 The Board recognises the material uncertainties noted above but, based upon information available to it at the date of approval 
of these financial statements, confirms its belief that it is appropriate to use the going concern basis of preparation for these 
financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from this not being the case.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of ATH Resources plc and entities controlled by the 
Company made up to the end of September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Aardvark TMC Limited (“Aardvark”) has 20,000 “B” ordinary shares not owned by ATH Resources plc, subscribed at their nominal 
value of 1 pence each in addition to the ordinary shares wholly owned by ATH Resources plc.
The “B” ordinary shares only carry the rights to receive a one off dividend in the event that Aardvark TFC Limited or SRMMC 
(Aardvark’s subsidiary and sub-subsidiary) are awarded damages in respect of existing and future litigation against the French State. 
The “B” ordinary shares carry no voting rights or rights to receive any other dividend. As a result, the “B” ordinary shares are not 
accounted for as a non-controlling interest as it is not material for the purposes of giving a true and fair view.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of, or is classified as being held for sale and 
represents a separate major line of business, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business 
or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Group accounting policies
continued
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in producing coal using production methods that are substantially 
different to other business segments. A geographical segment produces coal in a particular economic environment that is subject 
to different risks and returns from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Segment reporting information is detailed in note 2 of the Group financial statements.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of coal is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. This is usually 
when the coal is delivered to the location specified by the customer, generally on loading into transport where the customer is 
responsible for the transportation. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is shown 
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Royalties receivable
Royalty income relates to the licence of the Group’s coal washing technology. The income is recognised on an accruals basis based 
on the performance of the licensee.
Exceptional items
Items that are non-recurring and whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure and identification within the financial 
statements are disclosed as exceptional items within their relevant income statement category.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group only makes payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes, which are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are declared and paid.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises both current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case 
it is recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
The following temporary differences are not provided for in accordance with IFRS:
h h goodwill not deductible for taxation purposes;
h h initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
h h differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that these will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 33 www.ath.co.uk
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are released to profit or loss over the expected useful lives of the 
assets concerned. The grant received is deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and the income is recognised by way of 
a reduced depreciation charge. The consolidated cash flow statement discloses the purchase of assets and the receipt of related 
grants as separate items.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured 
by use of either a Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo model.
Goodwill and business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. For acquisitions prior to 4 October 2009, the cost of the 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill, which is recognised as an asset, is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may 
be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation 
commences when the asset is brought into use or, in the case of mine purchase and development costs, on the commencement of 
full production.
Mine exploration and development costs are expensed until such time that the Group has the legal rights to explore the prospective 
site. Exploration and evaluation costs, incurred after legal rights are obtained, are capitalised and subsequently impaired if facts and 
circumstances indicate that the site is not commercially viable and will not therefore be worked.
Costs incurred in preparing and developing sites which are considered commercially viable and technically feasible are capitalised up to 
the start of production of coal at expected operating levels. The income from incidental coal that is extracted during the development 
phase is included within the income statement together with the direct costs of production.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, in annual 
instalments, on the following bases:
Freehold land:   not depreciated 
Freehold buildings:  4% 
Investment property  not depreciated 
Mine purchase and development: tonnage basis over the estimated total recoverable reserve 
Plant and machinery:  7–50%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or over the term 
of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.

Group accounting policies
continued
Impairment of plant, property and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which 
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
as income immediately.
Leasing
The Group only acts as a lessee. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated balance 
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Inventories
Inventories include coal stocks, work in progress and spare parts and tyres stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Coal inventories
Coal inventories are mined inventories to hand. Cost comprises direct materials, plant costs, direct labour and relevant overheads 
that have been incurred in bringing the coal to its present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average 
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution.
Work in progress
Work in progress represents the costs incurred on mining operations where the coal has not yet been extracted from the ground. 
Cost comprises direct materials, plant costs, direct labour and relevant overheads that have been incurred in removing the overburden 
on site. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method over the period represented by the volume of work in progress on hand.
The Group assesses the volume of overburden moved on a site or site extension at the end of a period and compares this to the 
volume that would be expected to be moved had coal been mined at exactly the expected ratio of overburden to coal. Where the 
actual volume of overburden moved on a site or site extension is greater than the volume expected at the site ratio, the excess is 
classified as work in progress.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument, and are only derecognised when the contractual provisions expire or have been discharged, 
or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Financial assets
Financial assets are principally made up of items classified under IFRS as “loans and receivables”. The classification depends on the 
nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Loans and receivables constitute trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
These financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, 
its estimated future cash flows have been impacted. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 35 www.ath.co.uk
Financial assets continued
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s 
past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period 
of 60 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance for bad debts. When a trade receivable 
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for bad debts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the allowance for bad debts. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand, cash on demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at “fair value through profit or loss” (“FVTPL”) or “other financial liabilities”.
Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings and trade and other payables, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction 
costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of 
a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Final void provisions
Following the conclusion of coal extraction the final working void of a surface mine site must be back filled. The cost of this operation 
is recognised as a provision as the obligation arises. The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs. Costs 
are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount, being the difference between the present value and 
the total cost of the provision, is included in the interest charge for the period. An asset is created for an amount equivalent to the 
provision and this is depreciated to the income statement on a tonnage basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.

IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’
On 19 October 2011 IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’ was published and is applicable 
to accounting periods commencing after 1 January 2013.
IFRIC 20 states that the costs of a stripping activity which provides a benefit in the form of access to coal should be recognised as 
a non-current “stripping activity asset”. This will then be depreciated over the useful economic life of the coal that has become more 
accessible as a result of the stripping activity. In order for such costs to be capitalised there needs to be demonstrable and measurable 
future economic benefit.
The Group currently assesses the value of such stripping costs by comparing costs incurred to date to the average expected for the 
site and allocates cost to be carried forward to match against future coal production where costs incurred have been in excess of the 
average. These deferred costs are currently classified as work in progress and included within inventories as a current asset.
Under IFRIC 20 the Group will be required to reclassify its work in progress asset from current to non–current assets and amortise this 
asset over the expected production of coal from the site.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Due to the nature of an estimate, the eventual actual result 
will rarely equal the amount originally estimated. The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material 
misstatement within the financial statements are discussed below.
Coal reserves, overburden and coal ratio
Each working and prospective mine has overlaying rock strata that must be removed before the in-situ coal seams can be accessed. 
The volume of overburden rock compared to coal tonnage in a site is classified as the site ratio. The site ratio for each mine 
is assessed through the examination of drilled cores and extrapolation using experience and detailed modelling techniques.
Capitalised mine purchase and development costs are amortised over the tonnage of coal expected to be extracted in the future, 
which has been calculated through the assessment of the site ratio, management experience and geo-technical findings. If the 
amount of coal expected to be extracted varies this will impact on the amount of the asset which should be carried in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
Work in progress balances are based on an analysis of the remaining coal and overburden volumes in the mine or mine extension 
at the period end. If the amount of remaining coal or overburden varies, this will impact on the work in progress volume that 
should be carried in the consolidated balance sheet.
Restoration and closure provisions
Management exercises significant judgment in the determination of the provisions for the costs required in respect of restoring 
the final void and site to an agreed condition. Amounts provided are based on management experience and historical outturns.
Estimated provisions are established in the consolidated balance sheet and amortised in proportion to the coal expected to be 
extracted from a site. If that expected tonnage or the actual cost varies, then the provision may be under or overstated. Final void 
provision values are assessed using experience and detailed restoration plans. The Group appoints independent experts to review 
the carrying value of final void provisions on an annual basis. The provisions are disclosed in note 20.
Goodwill impairment
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGU to which these assets have been 
allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and 
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Goodwill is disclosed in note 13. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 37 www.ath.co.uk
Notes to the Group financial statements
for the year ended 2 October 2011
1 General information
ATH Resources plc is a company incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office 
is given on page 14. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates.
2 Segmental reporting
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board of Directors (“the Board”). The Board reviews the Group’s 
internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Until 29 July 2010, the Group was organised into two 
reportable segments: surface mining and regeneration. Following the sale of the business assets of ATH Regeneration, surface 
mining became the Group’s sole business segment.
The Board considers the business from a type of operations aspect and that all operations are carried out in one geographical 
segment, being the UK.
The nature of the segmental business operations is set out below.
Continuing operations
Surface Mining – the development, operation and restoration of surface coal mines within the UK and the sale of coal to the 
electricity generation, industrial and domestic markets.
Discontinued operations
Coal Tip Washing – the extraction of coal from redundant coal tips and its sale to UK electricity generators through the construction 
and operation of specialist processing plant. Results for discontinued operations are disclosed in note 11.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit. Finance costs and taxation 
are not included in the segment result assessed by the Board.

4 Sales contracts
In the ordinary course of business the Group has entered into fixed price sales contracts of more than twelve months’ duration with 
varying duration and price. At 2 October 2011 the Group had 1,762,000 tonnes secured under three fixed-price contracts at an average 
selling price of £34 per tonne. It is expected that the first of these fixed price contracts will be fulfilled by 31 March 2012.
In addition the Group has a number of contracts which vary in line with the international price of coal. At 2 October 2011 the 
Group had 739,000 tonnes secured under such contracts.
Selling prices in respect of all sales contracts are regularly compared to the marginal cost of producing coal and, if necessary, 
provisions made for any onerous contracts. Currently the Board believes that no such provisions are required.

6,230 —
During the year unexpected geological conditions were encountered at both the Glenmuckloch and Muir Dean sites. As a result 
remaining coal reserves were much lower than previously expected, which increased the ratio of overburden to coal for each site. 
Work in progress balances have been adjusted accordingly. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 39 www.ath.co.uk
6 Exceptional operating items – continuing operations continued
Following a significant increase in certain operating costs, particularly gas oil, the Group has examined its unit cost rates applied to 
the estimated volume of overburden to be restored at the end of the productive life of each mine. As a result future cost rates have 
been amended, resulting in a requirement to increase in the Group’s restoration provisions. This review was undertaken in 
conjunction with an independent evaluation of the Group’s restoration liabilities.
A review of the Group’s payroll procedures and systems showed that there had been an under deduction of PAYE on some allowances 
paid to a small number of individuals over a number of years. The Group has made provision to cover the expected liability.

11 Discontinued operations
On 29 July 2010, the Group disposed of the business assets of ATH Regeneration Limited, which specialised in the recovery of coal 
through the washing of redundant coal tips and its subsequent sale to UK electricity generators.
The disposal was to a newly formed company, RecyCoal Limited, which is funded by a European based private equity fund. 
Among the shareholders of RecyCoal Limited are Mr Tom Allchurch, the Group’s Chief Executive prior to the disposal and a Non -executive 
Director until 18 January 2011, and Mr Steven Beaumont, the Group’s Finance Director, until 30 September 2010. Details of related 
party transactions are set out in note 31.
The consideration received for the assets was £6,500,000, resulting in a loss on disposal of £1,136,000 together with an associated 
write off of goodwill of £2,244,000.
The Group entered into a licence agreement with RecyCoal Limited to exclusively license the intellectual property of the unique coal 
processing technology, ownership of which is retained within the Group. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 41 www.ath.co.uk

12 Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic (loss)/earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares is issue during the period.
For diluted (loss)/earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion 
of all potential dilutive ordinary shares. The potential dilutive ordinary shares relate to those options granted to employees where 
the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the balance sheet date.
The earnings and weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share are 
as follows:

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if internal or external factors indicate that 
goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU which is expected to benefit 
from that acquisition. CGUs are the lowest level of trading operation at which goodwill is separately considered.
The carrying value is allocated to CGUs as follows:
2011
£000
2010
£000
Surface Mining business 1,413 1,413
Regeneration business 2,350 4,000
3,763 5,413
A goodwill asset is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the CGU’s recoverable amount which is based on its value in use. For the 
Surface Mining business at both 3 October 2010 and 2 October 2011, impairment reviews were performed by calculating the value 
in use of the CGU and comparing this with the value of the CGU. The value in use is calculated using cash flow forecasts from the most 
recent budget and business plan together with projections for the next seven years.
Following the receipt of advance royalties during the year, the impairment review was performed by calculating the present value 
of the expected income stream from the licensing of technology retained within the business and comparing this with the carrying 
value of goodwill. The value in use is calculated by using cash forecasts from the most recent budget and business plan for the next 
six years over which income will be received from the licensing of the technology. These cash forecasts have been adjusted to reflect 
the Group’s latest assessment of the likelihood of receipt.
The forecasts include the following key assumptions:
Surface 
Mining Regeneration
Growth rate 2.5% —
Discount rate 6.5% 5%
Direct costs growth – other direct costs 3% —
Direct costs growth – fuel costs 10% —
Sales prices growth 10% —
The estimated growth rates are based on past experience, knowledge of the market sectors and the current forecast of the 
opportunities open to the business in all of their markets.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to each CGU.
Changes in direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of the future, particularly the impact of oil prices.
Sales price growth is based on current contractual agreements and expectation of new sales contracts based on the future changes 
given the market forward price curves and estimate of exchange rates, particularly sterling and the US dollar. New contracts will 
replace current contracts that are significantly below market prices.
Following the receipt of advance royalties, the present value of the expected licensing income indicated that the goodwill had been 
impaired by £1,650,000 (2010: £2,244,000). The goodwill impairment is shown separately within the income statement. There are 
no instances of goodwill impairment in the Surface Mining business from the goodwill impairment tasks performed in 2010 and 2011.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the carrying value of each CGU. In the Surface Mining 
business, an increase in the discount rate to 19.5% from 6.5% used in the impairment reviews would result in the carrying value 
being reduced to its carrying amount. In the analysis of carrying value for the Regeneration goodwill, forecast cash flows would 
need to reduce by 1% to reduce the carrying value to its carrying amount. ATH Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2011 43 www.ath.co.uk

Included within freehold land and buildings is an amount of £2,289,000 (2010: £2,289,000) in relation to an investment property. 
The investment property is included in the financial statements at cost which the Directors consider to be not materially different to 
its market value. Accordingly no depreciation has been charged.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts (note 19) are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased 
assets which have a carrying value of £23,039,000 (2010: £26,263,000).
Mine purchase and development includes assets under construction with a carrying value of £710,000 (2010: £200,000).
The depreciation charge is allocated to the income statement as follows: cost of sales £13,907,000 (2010: £13,478,000); 
administrative expenses £70,000 (2010: £86,000); and discontinued operations £Nil (2010: £194,000).

The average credit period taken on sales of goods in 2011 is 61 days (2010: 47 days). No allowance for bad debts is held due to the 
insignificant levels of default arising in recent years and the credit insurance held.
Due to the nature of the Group’s activities, trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of individual balances. Credit insurance 
is maintained and the Directors monitor receivable balances to ensure any exposure is minimised. Before accepting any new customer 
the Directors review and consider the potential customer’s creditworthiness using experience of the relevant company, the industries 
into which it sells and the availability of insurance.

A total of £3,048,000 (2010: £2,315,000) of the final void provision is classified as a current liability to reflect the time profile 
of anticipated works.
In determining the final void provision, the Group assesses the likely timing of the expenditure and inflates current estimate of cost 
by 2.5 per cent per annum. These estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 6.5 per cent to determine an estimated net 
present value of final void expenditure.
The deferred consideration related to the acquisition in 2008 of Pacific West Coal Pty Ltd where under the terms of the acquisition 
agreement, a contingent consideration was payable depending on the Group’s level of success in obtaining future contracts. This 
business is no longer operational following the sale of the ATH Regeneration assets and no additional consideration will be payable.

Deferred tax assets of £942,000 (2010: £6,000) have been recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recovered, 
based on forecasts of future taxable profits and taking into account this year’s exceptional items. Further deferred tax assets of 
£38,000 (2010: £39,000) have not been recognised due to uncertainty regarding their recoverability.

Indemnities for restoration bonds 26,966 26,715
Restoration bonds are provided by specialist insurance companies to the relevant local authority in respect of the Group’s restoration 
obligations in the normal course of business. The Group provides full indemnities in respect of these restoration bonds.
The final void provision (note 20) includes the Board’s best estimate of the costs required to meet the Group’s restoration obligations 
across all sites. Therefore no liability has been recognised in respect of the above indemnities.
In addition the Group has provided a guarantee of £3,000,000 directly to a local authority to supplement the restoration bond in place.
Carbon Reduction Commitment (“CRC”) Scheme
The Board is of the view that the electricity consumption of its 12 kilometre conveyor should be exempt from the CRC Scheme. 
However, the Government is challenging the Group’s decision not to opt into the CRC Scheme and the results of a hearing to clarify 
the situation are expected towards the end of the current calendar year. The potential impact to the Group if it fails to win exemption 
from the CRC Scheme would be an increase in its costs by a further £1,400,000 per annum for each of the three years from April 2011. 
No liability in respect of the CRC Scheme has been recognised at the year end.

General risk management principles
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal risk 
assessment and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic, operational and financial risks of 
the Group is in place to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations. Internal control and risk management systems are 
embedded in the operations of the divisions.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern whilst taking advantage of 
the opportunities in its chosen markets, providing returns for its shareholders and to maintain an optimal level of both debt and 
equity finance.
The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, including the borrowings as set out in note 19; bank overdraft and cash and cash 
equivalents; and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings 
as disclosed in notes 21 and 23.
The Group has satisfied all reportable banking covenants during the current and previous years.
The Group uses its gearing ratio to monitor its capital structure, gearing being calculated as net debt divided by total capital. 
Net debt is bank loans, bank overdrafts, drawings under the revolving credit facility and finance lease liabilities less cash and cash 
equivalents. Total capital is net debt and the equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:
2011
£000
2010
£000
Drawings under the revolving credit facility and finance lease liabilities 32,041 36,851
Cash and cash equivalents (498) (2,353)
Net debt 31,543 34,498
Total equity 22,217 27,700
Total capital 53,760 62,198
Gearing ratio 59% 55%
The reported gearing for the year has increased due to the loss for the year exceeding the reduction in the level of net debt.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity 
instrument, are disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies on pages 31 to 36.

The drawings under the revolving credit facility are shown gross of unamortised borrowing costs of £535,000 (2010: £564,000).
Cash and cash equivalents are cash balances held by the Group. All financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and 
all financial liabilities are classified as other liabilities.

The Company is part of a Group banking arrangement. On 29 September 2011, the Group extended its revolving credit facility 
to 31 May 2013.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. The overall risk management policies 
of the Group are designed to minimise implicit credit risk, market risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. Risk management 
is governed by the Group’s operational policies which are managed and reviewed by the Board of Directors.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in credit risks, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and 
interest rate movements described below.
Market risk exposures are monitored and are supplemented by sensitivity analysis. There has been no change to the Group’s exposure 
to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
The Group enters into hedging agreements to fix the forward price of gas oil, a significant operating cost. These instruments are 
entered into to provide certainty and minimise the price of oil on the Group. The fair values are based on movements in the value 
of the underlying commodity.
Derivatives used for hedging
The notional principal amounts and remaining terms of gas oil derivatives at the end of the reporting period are set out below:

Fair value
2011
£000
Less than one year 48.24 2,026 (69)
The derivatives are categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. An amount of £69,000 was debited to the income statement 
during the year in respect of these outstanding derivatives.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies when purchasing significant capital equipment 
from abroad and exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy 
parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts if considered appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities were insignificant 
at each balance sheet date.
Credit risk
Credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and refers to the risk that a counterparty 
will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has a policy of only dealing with 
creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient insurance where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial 
loss from defaults.
The Group generally transacts with large entities that are in the power generating, coal wholesale and manufacturing industries 
and has had little history of default in recent years. Credit exposures are reviewed by the Board regularly.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk relating to its financial assets is equivalent to their carrying value as disclosed below:

Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity 
management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowings facilities by continually 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 19 
is an analysis of the maturity of the Group’s borrowings along with a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has 
at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 40 days (2010: 37 days), which reflects the mix of when these amounts 
are contractually due.
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk 
is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest 
rate swap contracts when necessary. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly with a policy of aligning interest rate views and 
defined risk profiles to ensure optimal hedging strategies are applied, as considered appropriate.
The Group’s primary interest rate profile on financial liabilities is as follows:

12,853 19,188 32,041 16,101 20,750 36,851
Interest rate swap contracts
The Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes to the variable rate of interest payable 
on certain borrowings.
The contracts enable the Group to exchange variable rates of interest for fixed rates. The fair value of the interest rate swaps 
is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the end of the reporting period and the credit risk interest 
in the contract and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the period end.
Derivatives used for hedging
The notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts at the end of the reporting period are set out below:

One to two years — 3.9 — 7,500 — (197)
7,500 17,500 (217) (357)
The interest rate swaps are settled on a quarterly basis. The floating rate is the LIBOR based rate implicit on the Group revolving 
credit facility. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating rates on a net basis. The derivatives are categorised 
as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. An amount of £140,000 was credited to the income statement during the year in respect of 
these derivatives.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates in respect of the Group’s borrowings. 
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding 
for the whole year. A 2% increase (2010: 2%) or 1% decrease (2010: 1%) represents management’s assessment of the reasonably 
possible change in interest rates, which is attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.

Company accounting policies
for the year ended 2 October 2011
Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK GAAP and law.
Basis of preparation
The Company is a holding company and meets its day to day working capital requirements through an overdraft facility which 
is repayable on demand and through the support of its trading subsidiaries.
Accounting period
The Company has drawn up its accounts for the 52 week period to 2 October 2011 (2010: 52 week period to 3 October 2010).
Profit and loss account
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Cash flow
The Company is exempt from the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements (revised)’.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost and provision is made for any impairment in the value of fixed asset investments.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the 
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which 
they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
measured on a non-discounted basis.
Share-based payments
Share-based payments are accounted for as described in the Group Accounting Policies on page 33.

Notes
1.  A member who is entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who 
need not be a member of the Company) to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of the member. Completion and return of a form 
of proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting in person, should he subsequently decide to do so.
  The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have 
been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 
(“nominated persons”). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds 
the shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons 
do not have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to 
the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
2.  In order to be valid, any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or notarially certified 
or office copy of such power or authority, must reach the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham 
Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or of any adjournment of the meeting.       
3.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so 
for the Annual General Meeting to be held on 29 February 2012 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who 
have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able 
to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the 
information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be 
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments 
specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
4.  As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, shareholders who hold shares in uncertificated 
form must be entered on the Company’s share register at 6pm on 27 February 2012 in order to be entitled to attend and 
vote at the Annual General Meeting. Such shareholders may only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes 
to entries on the relevant register after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote 
at the meeting.

Notes
1.  Every holder has the right to appoint some other person(s) of their choice, who need not be a shareholder as his proxy to exercise 
all or any of his rights, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. If you wish to appoint a person other than the 
Chairman, please insert the name of your chosen proxy holder in the space provided (see over). If the proxy is being appointed in 
relation to less than your full voting entitlement, please enter the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act 
as your proxy. If left blank your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full voting entitlement (or if this proxy 
form has been issued in respect of a designated account for a shareholder, the full voting entitlement for that designated account).
2.  In order to be valid, any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or notarially certified or 
office copy of such power or authority, must reach the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or of any adjournment of the meeting. 
3.  To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares 
in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by 
you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be 
returned together in the same envelope.
4.  The vote withheld option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a “vote 
withheld” is not a vote in law, and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution. 
5.  If a member is a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or by the signature of an officer or attorney 
duly authorised in writing. 
6.  Entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the number of votes which may be cast thereat will be determined by reference 
to the Register of Members of the Company as at 6pm on 27 February 2012. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after 
that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
7.  Shares held in uncertificated form (i.e. in CREST) may be voted through the CREST Proxy Voting Service in accordance with the 
procedures set out in the CREST manual. 
8.  The completion and return of this form will not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you attend 
the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
9.  In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient, but the names of all joint holders should be stated, 
and the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote will be accepted to the exclusion of the vote(s) of other joint holder(s), seniority 
being determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members of the Company.
10. Any alterations made to this form of proxy should be initialled. A T H	R e s o u r c e s ’	c o m m i t m e n t	t o	e n v i r o n m e n t a l	i s s u e s	i s	r e fl e c t e d	i n	t h i s

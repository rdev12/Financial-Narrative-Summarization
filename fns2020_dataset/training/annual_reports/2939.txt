CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The strength of the enlarged Group is also clearly evident in the
value of its order book, which more than doubled to £16 billion 
at the year-end (2005: £7 billion). Mowlem’s order book at
acquisition was approximately £2.5 billion, therefore most of 
this increase came from new orders won during the year.
The good progress we have made in 2006, particularly with the
integration of the Carillion and Mowlem businesses, is due to
the leadership of our management team and the commitment
and professionalism of our people. On behalf of the Board 
I should like to thank all our employees for the contributions 
they have made to the integration process and to Carillion’s
success in 2006. 
With an order book of £16 billion and strong positions in 
a wider range of growth markets, we have created a more
resilient business, capable of accelerating our strategy for
growth. This positive outlook for the Group confirms the 
Board’s view that Carillion is firmly on track to deliver 
materially enhanced earnings in 2007. 
Chris Girling retires from the Board on 30 April 2007, having
served as Finance Director since shortly after Carillion was
launched as an independent company in 1999. Chris has 
played a major role in Carillion’s development and he 
leaves with the Board’s grateful thanks for his outstanding
contribution to the Company’s success and with our very best
wishes for the future. Our new finance director, Richard Adam,
joins the Board on 2 April from Associated British Ports where
he has been Group Finance Director since 1999. Richard is an
experienced and successful Finance Director with strong
operational and business management skills and we are
delighted to welcome him to the Board.
As I announced in my interim report to shareholders, we
strengthened the Board during the year with the appointment
in September 2006 of Don Kenny as an executive director and
Steve Mogford as a non-executive director. Don is a Managing
Director responsible for six Carillion business units and brings to
the Board extensive experience not only of Carillion’s business,
but also our industry sector, having held a number of senior
positions in Carillion and in other major UK support services 
and construction companies. Steve has been a main Board
director of BAE Systems for over six years and is currently 
BAE’s Chief Operating Officer responsible for Programmes. 
With his considerable experience as a senior business leader 
and also in managing major capital projects, Steve will make 
a valuable contribution to the development of our business. 
In view of the Group’s performance in 2006 and prospects for 
2007, the Board is recommending a final ordinary dividend for 
2006 of 5.9 pence per share, making the total full-year dividend 
9.0 pence per share, an increase of 12.5 per cent on the total 
paid in respect of 2005 (8 pence per share). The final dividend 
for 2006 will be paid on 22 June 2007 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 27 April 2007. 
Philip Rogerson
Chairman
7 March 2007
In particular, the benefits of acquiring Mowlem plc in 
February 2006 have been greater than expected at the time 
of acquisition: integration cost savings have increased, new
order intake has moved strongly ahead and the acquisition 
has been significantly earnings enhancing in 2006, rather than
earnings neutral. 
In 2006, revenue increased by some 57 per cent to £3,593
million, including joint ventures (2005: £2,284 million), which
reflects both organic growth and the acquisition of Mowlem.
Profit before tax, non-operating items and amortisation
increased by 48 per cent to £82.1 million (2005: £55.5 million).
Earnings per share on the same measure rose by 15 per cent 
to 23.5 pence per share (2005: 20.4 pence). 
Cash flow from operations was again strong and average net 
debt in 2006 was £110 million, well below the £200 million we
expected at the time of acquiring Mowlem. At 31 December
2006 the Group had net debt of £108 million. 
I am pleased to report that Carillion
made good progress in 2006 and 
either achieved or exceeded all our 
key financial and strategic objectives.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Building opportunity
We design, build and manage
innovative learning environments 
for schools and universities.
The acquisition of Mowlem in February
2006 marked a step change in Carillion’s
development as a leading support
services and construction company.
Greater than expected benefits from this
acquisition, combined with continuing
organic growth, enabled us to deliver
profit and earnings per share ahead of
our original expectations, backed by
strong cash flow from operations.  Section 04
Operating and Financial Review
07 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Carillion is now one of the largest support services businesses 
in the UK with enhanced positions in its key market sectors and
a greater ability to meet the needs of its customers, whether
this involves a single service or fully integrated solution. 
Combining the PPP investment activities of Carillion and
Mowlem has delivered significant benefits, including a larger,
more valuable portfolio of equity investments, a stronger
pipeline of new projects and a considerable increase in our
capacity to win and deliver PPP projects. 
Mowlem’s strengths in construction, particularly in the regional
building and civil engineering markets where previously Carillion
had relatively little presence, have broadened our construction
base and given us the capability to provide integrated solutions
for customers in these markets.
The good progress we have made with integration resulted 
in the acquisition being significantly earnings enhancing in
2006, rather than earnings neutral as expected at the time of 
acquisition. Furthermore, we remain firmly on track to deliver
materially enhanced earnings in 2007 through both revenue 
and margin growth.
Business performance. Total revenue in 2006 increased 
by 57 per cent to £3,593 million (2005: £2,284 million)
including revenue from joint ventures of £528 million 
(2005: £259 million). 
Total operating profit increased by 78 per cent to £117.1 million
(2005: £65.8 million), including profit from joint ventures of 
£47.7 million (2005: £20.3 million). After central costs of 
£20.3 million, a net interest charge of £6.6 million and tax on 
joint ventures of £8.1 million, profit before tax, non-operating
items, restructuring costs and amortisation was £82.1 million,
an increase of 48 per cent (2005: £55.5 million). Earnings per
share on the same measure increased by 15 per cent to 
23.5 pence per share (2005: 20.4 pence). 
Non-operating items, restructuring costs and amortisation
amounted to £14.5 million, leaving profit before tax of 
£67.6 million (2005: £51.9 million). Profit after tax was 
£60.4 million (2005: £40.8 million) and basic earnings per 
share were 21.6 pence (2005: 18.7 pence). 
Our pre-tax profit margin was broadly unchanged at 2.3 
per cent despite the effect of lower margins in the businesses
acquired with Mowlem, as we continue to implement our
Group-wide cost reduction and margin improvement
programme. As previously indicated, the potential to drive 
profit growth through improving margins in the businesses
acquired with Mowlem remains a significant opportunity. 
Our continuing focus on cash management has again 
delivered strong cash flow from operations of £91 million.
Average net debt in 2006 post the acquisition of Mowlem 
was £148 million, including finance leases of £47.9 million.
Financial reporting segments. We continue to report our
financial results in three segments – Investments, Support
Services and Construction Services – in which we group
together activities of a similar type and risk profile to make 
it easier to value our earnings on a consistent basis. 
The businesses acquired with Mowlem made no contributions
to profit in Support Services or Construction Services in the 
first half. However, as expected, all these businesses made 
good second-half contributions in all three reporting segments,
as summarised on page 8. A more detailed analysis of these
segments follows in the Finance Director’s review. 
More specifically, we have achieved or exceeded each of 
the six key objectives we set for 2006, namely to
– attract and retain excellent people, by becoming an 
employer of choice 
– integrate Carillion and Mowlem successfully
– achieve cost synergy savings at a minimum running rate 
of £10 million per annum by the end of 2006 and be on
course to achieve a minimum running rate of £15 million 
per annum by the end of 2007
– reduce net debt to circa £200 million by the end of 2006 
and be on course to reduce it to below £100 million by 
the end of 2007
– be on track to deliver materially enhanced earnings for 
the enlarged Group in 2007 
– be a recognised leader in the delivery of safety and
sustainability. 
Our performance against each of these objectives is discussed 
in the following sections of this review. 
Acquisition of Mowlem. When we acquired Mowlem, we 
said it was an outstanding strategic fit and that integrating
Carillion and Mowlem would deliver substantial cost savings,
create a stronger, more resilient business and accelerate our
strategy for growth.
Immediately after acquisition, we restructured the Group to
create 14 business units, each aligned with key growth markets
and supported by lean and effective shared central services. 
By the end of 2006, the integration process was substantially
complete. When we acquired Mowlem we announced that we
expected to deliver integration cost savings at a running rate 
of £15 million per annum by the end of 2007, for a one-off
implementation cost of £10 million. We now expect to achieve
cost savings at a running rate of £26 million per annum by 
the end of 2007, for a one-off cost of up to £28 million.

Gary Bentley, Foreman
Carillion Regional Civil Engineering
Investments generated revenue of £148 million in 2006.
Operating profit increased by over 200 per cent to £26.5 million,
due to the addition of Mowlem’s substantial portfolio of
investments in Public Private Partnerships (PPP), achieving financial
close on a number of major new projects during the year and the
effect of projects moving from construction into operation.
In September 2006, we sold equity investments in eight projects
with a total book value of £21.1 million. The net proceeds from 
this sale of £46.7 million generated an exceptional profit of 
£25.6 million and reflected a net present value of the cash flows
from these investments based on a discount rate of less than five
per cent. Given that we target an overall internal rate of return of
15 per cent from PPP equity investments, an equity sale has once
again demonstrated the considerable long-term value we are
creating for shareholders through our ability to win and deliver 
PPP projects successfully.
The Directors’ valuation of our equity portfolio at 31 December
2006 was approximately £238 million, based on discounting the
cash flows from investments in financially closed projects at an
average of 8 per cent (December 2005: £89 million, based on 
a 10 per cent discount rate). 
We also have a good pipeline of new PPP projects, including three
projects for which we are the preferred bidder, in which we expect
to invest some £11 million of equity, and eight projects for which
we are shortlisted, with a potential equity requirement of up to
£69 million. 
In Support Services, revenue including joint ventures increased 
by 56 per cent to £1,539.7 million, due to further healthy organic
growth and the acquisition of Mowlem. Operating profit increased
by almost 43 per cent to £58.2 million.
The operating margin in this segment reduced from 4.1 per cent
to 3.8 per cent due to lower margins in the businesses acquired
with Mowlem and also in rail infrastructure, as expected. As
previously announced, we took action in the second half of 2006
to downsize our rail business to reduce its overheads and focus
the business on sustainable areas of the rail infrastructure market. 
This, together with our drive to improve margins in the businesses
acquired with Mowlem, is expected to improve operating
performance in this segment in 2007.
In Construction Services, revenue including joint ventures
increased by 55 per cent to £1,902.4 million, due primarily to 
the acquisition of Mowlem. Operating profit almost doubled to
£32.4 million and the operating margin increased from 1.4 per
cent to 1.7 per cent, as the effect of lower margins in the
businesses acquired with Mowlem were more than offset by
margin growth in other businesses, particularly in the Middle East. 
Order book. The value of our order book more than doubled 
to £16 billion at 31 December 2006 (December 2005: £7 billion).
Mowlem’s order book at acquisition was approximately £2.5
billion, therefore most of this increase is due to new orders won
during the year. This outstanding performance reflects the strength
of the enlarged Group and our ability to accelerate our strategy
for growth. Some 86 per cent of the order book is for Support
Services and PPP concession contracts. This continues to provide
long-term visibility, with over 70 per cent of our 2007 order book
for support services already secure. We have also strengthened our
Construction Services order book, with some 60 per cent of orders
for 2007 already secure. Furthermore, we have maintained a
healthy pipeline of probable new orders worth around £1.6 billion
at 31 December 2006.
Our people. As a services business, our success depends primarily
on the quality of our people. Only through their efforts every day
can we meet or exceed the expectations of customers and
maintain our competitive advantage. In order to attract, develop
and retain excellent people by becoming an employer of choice,
we have a wide range of policies and programmes in place 
across the Group, the success of which rests on how well we
communicate with all our people, including listening to what they
tell us and acting upon it.
We have a structured approach to communication, from one-to-
one individual performance and development reviews to monthly
team talks and an award winning group-wide newspaper. We also
conduct regular surveys through which our people can share their
views openly and frankly. These surveys culminate annually in “The
Great Debate” in which over 2,500 people from across the Group
took part in 2006, including around 1,000 people who joined us
from Mowlem. This enables us to monitor and measure our
progress on a wide range of issues, such as how well we engage
with our people to recognise and value the contributions they
make to our business and to help them fulfil their potential. 
The acquisition of Mowlem and its integration with Carillion was
the main focus of internal communications in 2006. It will
naturally take time for the large number of people who joined us
from Mowlem to identify fully with Carillion and, in particular, the
importance we place upon living our values. We know we have
much to do to build a culture of excellent communication across
the enlarged Group, but the results of surveys carried out in 2006
were encouraging and we shall continue to drive this forward in
2007. Good two-way communication starts with our business
leaders and the “Power of Engagement” workshops, attended by
around 2,000 Carillion managers and supervisors in 2005, were
extended in 2006 to include some 230 business leaders who
joined us from Mowlem. 
Health and Safety. Our absolute commitment to Health and
Safety is being translated into positive results through “Target
Zero”, the initiative we launched throughout Carillion at the end
of 2004, aimed at eliminating reportable accidents by 2010.
Target Zero, which is being led by our Board, applies to all our
people, those who work with us and those who are affected 
by Carillion’s activities. It requires the continual vigilance and commitment of everyone in Carillion to ensure that safe working
practices are always used and is supported by regular and rigorous
reviews, audits and training.
Target Zero is an extremely ambitious target that will be achieved
only if we can create a culture of zero tolerance to accidents
within Carillion, our customers, suppliers and partners. I am
delighted to report that we have made good further progress
towards this target. In 2006, the Group’s Accident Frequency Rate
(AFR) reduced by 25 per cent to 0.18 reportable accidents per
100,000 hours worked, compared with an AFR of 0.24 in 2005,
itself a 35 per cent reduction on our AFR in 2004 of 0.37. This
performance ranks Carillion among the very best in our industry. 
The total number of reportable accidents under RIDDOR (Reporting
of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995)
reduced by 24 per cent to 346, after taking account of the
increase in our workforce resulting from the acquisition of
Mowlem, and follows a reduction of 27 per cent in 2005. 
2006 was free of fatal accidents to our own people and to those
who work on our project sites and contracts. We were the subject
of one prosecution by the Health and Safety Executive, which
related to an incident in 2005, and one of our subcontractors
received an enforcement notice in respect of work being carried 
out on Carillion’s behalf.
In April 2006, around 200 people from across the Group attended
our first “Safety Action Group” conference, focused on delivering
Target Zero. Similar events will be held in 2007 to ensure we
maintain this focus and the momentum we have created towards
achieving this challenging target. 
In September 2006, Carillion Rail was suspended by Network 
Rail from bidding for new projects, following an increase in less
serious workplace accidents over an approximate four-week 
period. We believed this increase was temporary and not
representative of our overall performance. However, we entirely
share Network Rail’s objective of improving workforce safety and
regard any accident as unacceptable. Since September 2006, 
our AFR has reduced significantly and Network Rail lifted the
suspension in February 2007. 
In December 2006, Carillion was the first and only major
construction company to submit information on the Health and
Safety performance of all its businesses to the benchmarking
process sponsored by the Health and Safety Commission. 
The “Corporate Health and Safety Performance Index” resulting
from this process will enable us to benchmark our performance
against all participating companies and help us to deliver
continuous improvement. 
More detailed information on Health and Safety will be included 
in our 2006 Sustainability Report that will be published on our
website at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability, in April 2007. 
Sustainability. Our commitment to becoming a more sustainable
business has made Carillion a recognised leader in developing and
adopting socially responsible business practices.
We continue to believe that this commitment not only creates
positive impacts on the environment and the communities in 
which we operate, but also delivers measurable business benefits.
We systematically quantify the links between our business
objectives and our impacts on the environment and society 
and set specific targets for performance improvement. The targets
we set and our performance against them are externally audited
and the results published in our annual sustainability report.
We also benchmark our performance externally. For example, 
we participate in Business in the Community’s annual Corporate
Responsibility Index and Carillion is also a member of the
FTSE4Good index.
We say more about our sustainability programme and
performance in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of 
this report on page 22. More detailed information will be provided 
in our 2006 Sustainability Report, which will be published on 
our website at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability in April 2007.
Risk management. The rigorous policies and processes we use to
identify, mitigate and manage risk continue to be a cornerstone of
our business. They enable us to address strategic risks and those
specific to individual businesses and contracts, including social,
environmental and ethical risks.
Our risk management processes apply to every aspect of our
operations, from choosing our market sectors to the contracts 
we bid for and the selection of our suppliers and sub-contractors. 
They also apply to every stage of a contract from inception to
completion, in order to deliver the cash-backed profit we expect
and a service that delights our customers.
The more significant areas of risk where our failure to perform well
or changes to macro-economic or market specific environments
would affect our business, are summarised below.
– Attracting, developing and retaining excellent people: the
success of our business depends primarily on the quality of 
our people.
– Managing major contracts: completing contracts on time and 
to the required standards avoids financial penalties and damage
to our brand and reputation.
– Closing out existing contracts: settling completed contracts 
and collecting the cash we are owed is essential to reducing
debt and delivering the earnings growth we expect.
– Winning new work: our ability to remain competitive by
adapting our strategy and service offering to the changing
needs of our markets and customers is essential to the
continuing success of our business.
– Managing our pension schemes: the cost to Carillion of 
funding its pension schemes depends on the macro-economic
environment, equity market stability and regulatory
requirements.
– Process and systems: doubling the size of our business through
the acquisition of Mowlem has increased our dependence on
having efficient and effective integrated project, financial
accounting, internal audit and HR systems.

MARKETS AND OUTLOOK 
Defence. We made further outstanding progress in this sector in
2006, winning new orders worth nearly £6 billion. This followed 
the major breakthrough we achieved in this sector in 2005 when
Carillion joint ventures won two major support services contracts –
Housing Prime and Regional Prime Central – for Defence Estates,
together worth around £600 million to Carillion. 
In 2006, we generated some £232 million of revenue from the
Defence sector, almost a ten-fold increase on 2005 (£24 million).
Growth has been driven by mobilising the two support services
contracts won in 2005 and by achieving financial close in 2006 
on two major PPP contracts for the Ministry of Defence – 
the £12 billion Allenby Connaught project and the £880 million
Permanent Joint Headquarters, Northwood, project. We will invest
some £70 million of equity in these projects, on which we also
commenced construction and the provision of facilities
management services in 2006. 
The outlook in this sector in 2007 is for continuing growth as
construction and facilities management services reach full-year
volumes on the Allenby Connaught and Northwood projects. 
In addition, we are the preferred bidder for the £250 million 
Royal School of Military Engineering project and there are good
prospects for further substantial construction work associated 
with the Regional Prime Central contract. 
Education. In 2006, we reached financial close on the £76 million
South Ayrshire PPP schools project, our sixth such project, and 
we were appointed as a framework contractor for Academies 
to be built under the Government’s Building Schools for the 
Future programme.
The education sector contributed around £162 million of revenue
in 2006 (2005: £141 million), with growth driven primarily by full-
year contributions from the £100 million Renfrewshire schools PPP
project and the £100 million Leeds schools project. 
The outlook in the education sector continues to be very positive.
Although the Building Schools for the Future programme has
made a slower than expected start, the Government remains
committed to this programme under which it plans to invest up to
£60 billion over the next 15 years in replacing secondary schools
and some £1.6 billion over the next five years in building Academy
Schools. In Scotland, investment continues to be made in new PPP
schools and Carillion has been shortlisted for a further project in
West Dunbartonshire, worth approximately £130 million.

In the UK, Carillion has eight principal market
sectors – Defence, Education, Health, Building,
Facilities Management and Services, Roads, 
Rail and Civil Engineering.
In the Middle East, our two principal market 
sectors are Construction and Facilities 
Management. In Canada and the Caribbean, 
our main market sectors are Health, Roads
Maintenance and Construction. 
With the exception of rail infrastructure, where
volumes have declined as expected, we have 
made progress in all our market sectors in 2006. 
In 2007, we again expect opportunities for 
growth in our UK and international markets.
Defence, Education and Health 
In these three sectors we provide a wide range of design,
construction, facilities management and integrated service
solutions, including private finance.  Section 04

Health. In 2006, our activities in the health sector generated
revenue of £229 million (2005: £146 million). We made good
progress in facilities management in this sector, winning and
mobilising a £330 million contract for Barts and The London
Hospital and mobilising services at two of our UK PPP hospitals –
the John Radcliffe, Oxford, and the Queen Alexandra, Portsmouth.
Our Clinicenta joint venture also made further substantial 
progress, winning preferred bidder positions on two more
Independent Sector Treatment Centre (ISTC) contracts – London
South and London North – to add to the preferred bidder position 
it already held on a similar contract for ISTCs in Bedfordshire and
Hertfordshire. Since the year-end, Clinicenta has also been
appointed as the preferred bidder for a fourth ISTC contract to
provide diagnostic services in South East England. These four
contracts, which involve fully integrated solutions including clinical
services, are expected to generate around £450 million of revenue
for Carillion over five years. Clinicenta is therefore on course to
become a key supplier of community-based clinical services. 
Looking forward, we expect continuing opportunities for growth 
in the health sector. In 2006, the Government reviewed its PPP
programme for acute hospitals and confirmed its commitment to
this programme and to investing between £7 billion and £9 billion
in 20 new hospitals. In addition, the Government plans to invest
around £150 million per annum over the next five years in
community hospitals.

We have completed a 
major redevelopment of 
Glencourse Barracks, the
Milton Bridge Camp and
Medical Centre at Redbridge
Barracks in Edinburgh. Old
accommodation blocks were
demolished and replaced with
modern, high quality living
accommodation together with
new recreational areas and
welfare facilities.
02. John Radcliffe Hospital
This £135 million PPP hospital
was completed on time and 
to budget in December 2006
and has enabled the Oxford
Radcliffe NHS Trust to relocate
services from the ageing
Radcliffe Infirmary to the John
Radcliffe Hospital, as well as
providing a new Children’s
Hospital. Carillion is now
delivering facilities
management services for the
new hospital, which provides
general health services to
Oxfordshire’s 625,000 residents
and specialist services to 
some 2.3 million people in 
the county and beyond.
03. Renfrewshire Schools
Carillion is providing 10 new
PPP schools, including nursery,
primary and secondary schools,
for Renfrewshire Council at 
a capital cost of £150 million.
The new schools will provide
state-of-the-art facilities for
over 6,000 pupils in Paisley,

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Facilities Management. In 2006, we generated some 
£656 million of revenue from this sector (2005: £370 million),
reflecting the acquisition of Mowlem and further organic growth. 
As we indicated at the half-year, we are now much more
positive than we were in 2005 about the outlook for this 
sector in which there is a growing number of opportunities,
particularly for larger integrated solutions. We won new orders
in 2006 worth some £700 million, including a £100 million,
five-year extension to our contract with ntl TeleWest (now Virgin
Media) and a £360 million, three-year claims management
contract for Norwich Union. Carillion has also been appointed
by the Office of Government Commerce as a framework
supplier of facilities management services to the public sector. 
Currently we are bidding for further contracts worth
approximately £100 million per annum for public and private
sector customers and we believe the positive outlook in this
sector is set to continue. Overall, the UK outsourcing market
grew by around 5 per cent to £110 billion in 2006 and growth
is forecast to continue at this level over the next five years.
About 60 per cent of the market is forecast to be contracted
out by the end of this period. With building fabric maintenance
and facilities management expected to be among the areas of
strongest growth, we are well positioned to make further
progress in this sector. 
Building. In 2006, UK building contributed £848 million of
revenue (2005: £528 million) with the increase primarily due to
the acquisition of Mowlem. New orders totalling £885 million in
2006 reflected positive trading conditions in our target sectors
of the UK building market.
This market is expected to remain buoyant in 2007, with non-
housing new build forecast to grow by around 6 per cent per
annum over the next five years. Although we propose to bid
only selectively for projects let by the Olympic Delivery Authority
(ODA), the ODA investment programme should help maintain
buoyant trading conditions across the UK market by attracting
suppliers from regions beyond the South East. Furthermore, 
as well as the facilities needed for the Games themselves,
substantial regeneration investment is planned for London 
over the next 10 to 15 years and this represents an important
opportunity for us, given our strength in providing integrated
solutions for urban regeneration.
02. Arla Foods
We designed and built this new
dairy for Arla Foods in Leeds. It
replaced an outdated dairy with
a fully automated, state-of-the-

million litres of milk a year.
03. BT
Working with our joint 
venture partners, we provide 
a fully integrated facilities
management service for some
7,000 BT properties, including
offices, research centres,
telephone exchanges, computer

Tower in London. This service
includes cleaning, security,
mechanical and electrical
engineering maintenance,
grounds maintenance,
equipment procurement, site
safety, building inspections and
programmed maintenance.

Roads and Civil Engineering
In these sectors we are focused primarily on long-term road maintenance

projects for Local Highway Authorities, Network Rail and water companies.
Rail
In the UK rail infrastructure market we provide project services to upgrade and
improve the national rail network, together with track renewal, signalling and
other specialist services. We also provide maintenance services for the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link. Section 04
Operating and Financial Review

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Roads and Civil Engineering. These sectors contributed 
£465 million of revenue to the Group in 2006 (2005: £172
million) with the increase due primarily to the acquisition of
Mowlem’s regional civil engineering business whose portfolio
included six road contracts under the Highways Agency’s Early
Contractor Involvement (ECI) programme. 
In 2006, we won a steady flow of new orders in the roads
sector, notably construction of the £122 million ECI project 
to upgrade the A74 in Cumbria to motorway standards 
(the “M6 missing link”) and two further ECI contracts, the
A5117/A530 improvement scheme on Deeside and the 
M25 junction 28 improvement scheme. Since the year-end, 
we have also won a £120 million contract for the operation 
and maintenance of the M40 motorway between the M25 
and Warwick. For regional civil engineering, 2006 was a year 
of consolidation in which we implemented a more selective
approach to the projects for which we bid.
The outlook for the roads sector in 2007 is encouraging. We
expect to bid for Highways Agency maintenance contracts for
Areas 6 and 8, potentially worth around £500 million over
seven years. Carillion is also an equity partner in a consortium
that has been shortlisted for the Design, Build, Finance and
Operate (DBFO) project to widen the M25, which has an
estimated total value of around £5 billion. Carillion’s interests in
this project lie in being an equity investor and the maintenance
provider over the life of the concession. Carillion is currently 
the maintenance contractor for the M25 and Area 8 and we
believe we are well positioned to bid for all these contracts. 
The outlook in our target sectors for regional civil engineering 
is for modest growth in 2007.
Rail. Revenue from this sector was £368 million in 2006 
(2005: £410 million) and reflected the decline in the UK rail
infrastructure market, on which we have commented previously.
Consequently, during the second half of 2006 we restructured
Carillion Rail to reduce overheads and focus the business on
sustainable areas of the rail infrastructure market. 
Although the outlook in this sector is still uncertain, it has
improved since we reported at the half-year and is now
expected to stabilise in 2007 rather than decline further. In
October 2006, a Carillion joint venture won the £363 million
contract for Transport for London for the East London Line. 
In December 2006, Network Rail announced its intention to
reduce the number of suppliers it uses to provide track renewal
services from six to four by July 2007. This represents an
opportunity to increase our market share and we believe
Carillion Rail is well positioned in this market, particularly in 
the more specialised area of switches and crossings renewals.

Middle East 
Our operations in the Middle East are based in Dubai and Oman and
focused on two sectors, Construction and Facilities Management.
Canada and the Caribbean 
In Canada, our key sectors are Health and Roads Maintenance. In the
Caribbean, we provide Construction Services to public and private
sector customers. Section 04
Operating and Financial Review
17 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
The Middle East. Revenue in the Middle East grew strongly 
in 2006 to £274 million (2005: £165 million), maintaining a
compound annual growth rate of around 60 per cent over the
last three years. This reflects the strength of our market sectors
and of the relationship with our joint venture partner and main
customer, the Al Futtaim Group. During 2006, the Al Futtaim
Group joined Carillion and Emaar Properties as a third partner 
in our facilities management joint venture, Emrill. This opens up
significant new opportunities for growth, as Emrill is now the
preferred supplier for the property portfolios of both Emaar
Properties and the Al Futtaim Group. 
In 2006, our joint ventures secured orders worth £360 million 
to Carillion of which some £275 million were in Dubai with the
balance in Oman. We also have a substantial pipeline of
construction and FM opportunities in Dubai and for construction
in Oman. Consequently, we expect growth in the Middle East to
remain strong in 2007. Beyond that, the prospects for further
healthy growth continue to be encouraging in Dubai and Oman
and there are emerging opportunities elsewhere in the region,
notably in Abu Dhabi and Egypt. 
Canada and the Caribbean. In 2006, revenue in Canada and
the Caribbean increased to £163 million (2005: £132 million).
New orders worth approximately £230 million were secured in
2006, the largest of which was a seven-year road maintenance
contract in Alberta, Canada, worth £137 million. Carillion is
already established as the leading supplier of road maintenance
services in Ontario and the contract in Alberta extends our
operations to a new and growing market. 
We have made good progress with construction of the first two 
PPP hospitals to be built in Canada: the Royal Ottawa has been
completed on time and to budget and is now operational and
the new William Osler Hospital in Ontario is nearing completion,
also on time and to budget. This has firmly established Carillion
in this growing sector of the health market in Canada. Currently,
we are shortlisted for two more PPP hospitals – the Sault Sainte
Marie and Niagara Hospitals in Ontario – and there are prospects
to bid for further PPP hospitals in British Columbia over the next
12 to 18 months. 
New order intake in the Caribbean improved significantly in
2006, the largest of which was a £46 million building contract
for the Viceroy Resort complex in Anguilla and the prospects for
further growth in 2007 are encouraging.
With an order book of nearly £1 billion, the outlook in this
region is therefore positive and we expect it to continue to
deliver healthy growth.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Chris Girling
Finance Director 
Accounting policies. The Group’s annual consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and there have been no
changes in accounting policies during the year. 
Acquisitions. On 23 February 2006 we acquired Mowlem plc
for a total consideration of approximately £350 million,
comprising £117 million in cash and 66.2 million new ordinary
Carillion shares. At the point of acquisition, Mowlem had net
debt of £122.5 million.
Intangible assets of £550 million, comprised £532 million
relating to Mowlem plc and £18 million relating to Pall Mall
previously recognised in the acquired business. The increase 
of £36 million in intangible assets relating to the acquisition 
of Mowlem since the half-year (30 June 2006: £496 million) 
is due entirely to the application of IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. 
Of the original £496 million of intangible assets, £119 million
will be amortised over its period of consumption. Under IAS 12,
a deferred tax provision equal to 30 per cent of the value of
assets to be amortised (£35.7 million) has been established with
a corresponding increase in the total value of intangible assets.
Amortisation of intangible assets. Amortisation of intangible
assets relating to business acquisitions was £16.8 million, which
relates to the £119 million of intangible assets arising from the
acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 and £6.2 million arising from
the acquisition of PME in 2005. 
Interest and cash. The Group net interest credit of £1.4 million
(2005: £4.0 million) reflects average net debt in 2006 of 
£110 million (net of average finance leases of £42 million),
offset by an interest credit from pensions of £3.5 million 
(2005: £1.2 million). 
Net debt at 31 December 2006 was £108 million after finance 
lease liabilities of £47.9 million (31 December 2005: net cash 
£90.8 million, after finance leases of £37.7 million).
Strong cash generation from operations of £91 million and
dividends received from jointly controlled businesses of 
£15.7 million continue to demonstrate our focus on cash
management and the resilience of our business. Capital
expenditure was £41 million, the main components of which
were investments in the previously announced project to
outsource business processes for Human Resources and 
Finance and in highways maintenance plant.
Dividend payments in 2006 were £23.2 million and net
corporate tax refunds of £1.7 million were received.
Jointly controlled businesses. An important part of our
strategy for Public Private Partnership (PPP) and large
construction projects is the development of jointly controlled
businesses that enable us to structure the resource and risk
profiles of these activities to generate reliable returns. In 2006,
these businesses generated £528.5 million of revenue (2005:
£258.7 million) and £47.7 million of operating profit (2005:
£20.3 million) for Carillion. This reflected growth in joint venture
activities in PPP investments, in construction services, notably in
the Middle East, and in UK support services. After an interest
charge of £8 million, profit before tax from joint ventures was
£39.7 million (2005: £21.4 million) and profit after tax was
£31.6 million (2005: £16.4 million). 
Taxation. The Group’s effective rate of tax on underlying profit
remained at 27 per cent. We have £242 million of corporate tax
losses in the UK and overseas that are potentially available to
reduce future tax liabilities. Of these losses some £33 million,
with a cash value of £10 million, have been recognised as a
deferred tax asset.

Non-operating items. The Group had a net exceptional profit
of £2.7 million in 2006. This comprised an exceptional profit 
of £25.6 million from the sale of eight PPP equity investments,
exceptional costs of £18.4 million in respect of integrating 
the Carillion and Mowlem businesses, exceptional costs of 
£4.2 million in respect of restructuring Carillion Rail and other
net costs of £0.3 million. 
Pensions. The Group’s ongoing pensions charge against profit 
in 2006, calculated on the basis of IAS 19, was £35.1 million
(2005: £21.4 million), with the increase on 2005 due to the
acquisition of Mowlem.
In addition, cash payments totalling £31.8 million were made in
2006 to the Group’s pension schemes to reduce funding deficits 
in line with plans agreed with the trustees. The Group’s pension
schemes had a net deficit of £75.8 million at 31 December
2006 (2005: £47.5 million), of which £43.0 million relates to
the schemes acquired with Mowlem.

In this segment we report the equity returns on our investments 
in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
Through our ability to win and deliver PPP projects successfully,
we continue to build a portfolio of good quality equity
investments that is generating significant value for the Group. 
At 31 December 2006, our portfolio comprised 24 financially 
closed projects (December 2005:19) in which we have invested, 
or have commitments to invest, some £168 million. During
2006, the acquisition of Mowlem added 10 projects to our
portfolio, we sold our investments in eight projects and reached
financial close on three projects – the Allenby Connaught and
Joint Permanent Headquarters projects for the Ministry of
Defence, and the South Ayrshire schools project. 
Profit in this segment increased substantially due to growing
returns from our maturing investment portfolio, contributions
from the investments acquired with Mowlem and reaching
financial close on the three new projects. 
The sale of equity investments in eight PPP projects in
September 2006 generated proceeds of £46.7 million and
exceptional profit of £25.6 million. The proceeds reflected 
a net present value for the cash flows from the investments 
sold based on a discount rate of less than 5 per cent and
further demonstrated the substantial value being created 
from these investments. In a full-year, effect of the sale will 
be to reduce operating profit by approximately £7 million.
In view of the value achieved from this sale and the continuing
strength of the secondary market for good quality equity, the
directors now value the cash flows from our equity investments
using an average discount rate of 8 per cent, rather than 
the 10 per cent used previously. On this basis, the directors’
valuation of investments in financially closed projects at 
31 December 2006 was £238 million (December 2005: 
£89 million), reflecting the reduction in the valuation discount
rate and the increase in equity invested and committed.  Section 04

In this segment we report the results of our building and civil
engineering activities.
Revenue in Construction Services increased by 55 per cent, 
due primarily to the acquisition of Mowlem. Operating profit
increased by 92 per cent and the operating margin increased
from 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent. Margins improved despite 
the effects of lower margins in the businesses acquired with
Mowlem as these were more than offset by margin
improvements in other businesses, both in the UK and our
International Regions. 
The approach Carillion takes to recognising profit on major
construction contracts has been extended to the enlarged
Group. No profit is taken on the first 20 per cent of revenue 
on such contracts and this profit is deferred until contracts are
completed. On revenues between 20 per cent and 100 per cent,
profit is recognised broadly in proportion to revenue after taking
account of risks and uncertainties. The effect of this approach 
in 2006 has been to reduce reported operating profit by a net
£2.2 million (2005: £5.4 million), comprising £5.6 million of
profit deferred and £3.4 million of profit released in respect of
contracts completed successfully during the year. Total deferred
profit carried forward at 31 December was £10.9 million

Operating and Financial Review
21 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Revenue in Support Services increased by nearly 56 per cent,
reflecting the acquisition of Mowlem and organic growth,
partially offset by the expected reduction in revenue from rail
infrastructure. Organic growth was driven primarily by facilities
management, particularly in the Defence sector, our mechanical
and electrical engineering business, PME, and highways
maintenance.
Operating profit increased by 43 per cent, but lagged revenue
growth due to lower revenues and margins in rail infrastructure
services and lower margins in the businesses acquired with
Mowlem. Consequently, the overall operating margin in this
segment reduced from 4.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent. 
As previously reported, in response to declining activity levels 
and margins in the UK rail infrastructure market we restructured
Carillion Rail in the second half of 2006 to reduce overheads
and focus the business on sustainable areas of the rail
infrastructure market. This, together with improving the margins
in businesses acquired with Mowlem, is expected to improve
operating performance in this segment in 2007. 
Committed bank facility. As previously reported, a new 
committed bank facility, originally totalling £490 million, 
was arranged in connection with the acquisition of Mowlem. 
Of the original amount, £331 million remained in place at 
the year-end of which £141 million is repayable over the four
years up to December 2010 and £190 million is repayable in
December 2010. 
Treasury policy and risk management. The Group has a
centralised Treasury function whose primary role is to manage
funding, liquidity and financial risks. In addition, Treasury
sources and administers contract bond and guarantee facilities
for the Group. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter
into speculative transactions. The Board sets policies within
which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective financing
of the Group’s operations and limit exposure to financial risk.
The areas of significant financial risk facing the Group relate 
to funding and liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates.
Funding and liquidity risk. The Group’s policy is to avoid
carrying significant net debt over the long term. Carillion plc’s
principal borrowing facility is a syndicated loan facility led by
The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and short-term overdraft and
money market facilities are provided by a group of relationship
banks. Finance and operating leases are also employed to fund
longer-term assets. The quantum of committed borrowing
facilities available to the Group is regularly reviewed and 
is designed to satisfy the requirements of the Group’s 
business plan.
Currency risk. The Group hedges all significant currency
transaction exposures using foreign exchange risk management
techniques. In order to protect the Group’s balance sheet from
the impact of exchange rate volatility, foreign currency net
assets are hedged using matching currency loans, where these
assets exceed the equivalent of £10 million. Profits arising
within overseas subsidiaries are not hedged unless it is planned
to make a distribution. Such distributions are then treated as
currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Interest rate risk. Borrowing facilities relate primarily to the
funding of the Mowlem acquisition and short-term working
capital requirements and are at floating rates of interest 
linked to LIBOR. The Group has not entered into interest rate
derivatives to fix or hedge interest rate risk and none are
outstanding. Certain longer-term assets have been financed
using fixed rate leases.
Carillion has equity in a number of PPP joint venture Special
Purpose Companies (SPC). SPCs obtain funding for these
projects in the form of long-term bank loans or corporate 
bonds without recourse to the joint venture partners and
secured on the assets of the SPC. A number of SPCs have
entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging
interest rate risk. These derivatives are interest rate swaps 
that fix the rate of interest payable and an interest rate cap 
and collar that limits the maximum and minimum interest 
rates payable.
Going concern. The Directors confirm that, after making
enquiries, they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.

We have consistently demonstrated that adopting the
highest standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR)
not only has positive effects on the environment and
the communities in which we operate, but also helps 
us to deliver our business objectives. This continues 
to reaffirm our belief that Carillion’s leadership in CSR 
will increasingly differentiate us from our competitors
and help us to win more orders, minimise our social,
environmental and ethical risks, control costs and 
deliver better services to customers.
In this section of our Annual Report we provide a summary 
of what we are doing to make our business more sustainable. 
A more detailed account will be provided in our 2006
Sustainability Report, which will be published on our website 
at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability in April 2007.
Strategy. In 2006, we continued to use our well-established
strategy model for sustainable development, which
demonstrates and quantifies how improving our impacts 
on the environment and society supports the delivery of our
business objectives.
The model aligns our strategy with the four priority areas
defined by the UK Government in its sustainable development
strategy, “Securing the Future” , namely
– Sustainable communities
– Natural resource protection and environmental enhancement
– Climate change and energy
– Sustainable consumption and production. 
We have identified 12 business behaviours and activities that
have most impact on these four priority areas, as illustrated 
in the diagram opposite. Our policies in respect of these
behaviours and activities are reproduced below. These policies
are applied across all our businesses to support everything 
we do, from marketing and work-winning to service design 
and delivery.
Managing sustainability. Our commitment to sustainability
continues to be driven by our Board, supported by our
Sustainability Committee. This Committee is chaired by our
Chief Executive, John McDonough, and includes a number of
senior directors, drawn from across our businesses, to ensure
that it maintains close links with the Group’s operational
activities. The Committee also benefits from expert advice from

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY two external members, Jonathon Porritt, Chair of the UK
Government’s Sustainable Development Commission, and Julia
Cleverdon, Chief Executive of Business in the Community (BITC),
who we were delighted to welcome to the Committee in
January 2007. David Cowans, Chief Executive of Places for
People Group, stepped down from the Committee in 2006.
David joined the Committee in 2002 and we are grateful to him
for the support and wise council he has provided over the last
four years. 
In 2006, Adrian Bull, the Managing Director of Carillion Health,
took up the additional role of Director of Group Sustainability 
to lead the development and implementation of the Group’s
sustainability programme. 
Our performance. In 2006, we focused our efforts on 
three areas in particular
– introducing a Sustainability Excellence Model to support 
the delivery of our policies and objectives
– the integration of the Carillion and Mowlem businesses
– using our participation in Business in the Community’s 
Corporate Responsibility Index to identify areas for
improvement.
The Group’s sustainability objectives for 2006 were based 
on 11 specific and measurable targets. In order to drive
continuous improvement we set demanding targets and 
our performance against them is independently audited by
Bureau Veritas. Our average score against the 11 targets set 
for 2006 was 81.6 per cent. 
We continue to benchmark our performance through
participating in Business in the Community’s Corporate
Responsibility Index. Since the inception of the Index in 2003,
Carillion has improved its score each year. In the 2005 Index
(published in 2006) Carillion scored 91 per cent compared to
the average score of 84 per cent for the 131 companies that
participated. In 2006, we were encouraged to see that more of
our peers and customers took part in the Index. This indicates
the growing importance of CSR and the potential benefits to
our business of being amongst the UK’s top performers. 
Sustainability in action. There are many examples of the
benefits that we and our stakeholders derive from Carillion
putting its policies for sustainable development into practice.
Listed below are just some of the benefits achieved through 
the sustainability action plan adopted for the John Radcliffe
Hospital, Oxford. Opened in 2006, this Public Private 
Partnership hospital was designed and built by Carillion at 
a capital cost of £135 million and Carillion is now providing
facilities management services over the 30-year life of the
concession contract. 
– More than 90 per cent of waste was diverted from landfill
through recycling.
– Permeable car park surfacing filters pollution from surface
water and reduces peak run-off during storms. 
– Introducing a green transport plan for site workers, such as
car sharing schemes, reduced carbon dioxide emissions by
over 20 per cent.
– 60 per cent of the flooring selected for the project is 
linoleum, manufactured from renewable raw materials and 
biodegradable. This material is also hard-wearing and will
extend replacement life-cycles from typically 10-15 years for
vinyl, to around 25 years, with a potential saving of some
£264,000.
– Ceiling tiles were manufactured using around 30 per cent
industrial waste and they do not require metal fixing clips,
which reduced costs by some £60,000 and makes
maintenance easier. 
– By working closely with our paint supplier we sourced paint 
in 10-litre metal cans, which were recycled. This avoided 
the use of PET plastic (polyethylene terephthalate) containers, 
which cannot be recycled once they have contained paint. 
– The biodiversity framework for this project involved the
Carillion team working with the local community and also
sponsoring the local wildlife group to improve wildlife
habitats and create educational resources for local schools. 
– Health and Safety performance was strong, with one 
period of over 500,000 hours worked without a reportable
workforce accident. 
The John Radcliffe Hospital has been selected as a case study 
of best practice by the Office of Government Commerce 
(OGC) and this can be accessed via the OGC website,
http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/Oxford_Radcliffe_Hospitals_
NHS_Trusts-embracing_sustainability.pdf. 
Carillion is a member of Business in the Community’s PerCent
Club, comprising companies that contribute over one per cent
of their profits in cash or in kind to community activities. One
example of this is the work we are doing with Business in the
Community and Business Action on Homelessness to help
homeless people find employment and achieve independence.
Another example is our partnership with The Wildlife Trusts: 
to date we have contributed £150,000 to The Carillion Natural
Habitats Fund, which finances Trust projects and provides
opportunities for our people to work with Trusts local to
Carillion’s business activities. 
Carillion is also one of the UK’s leading providers of training 
for support services and construction skills, which makes a major
contribution to the development of individuals and communities.
In 2006, around 2000 adults undertook vocational training
programmes and some 800 apprentices successfully completed
their training at our 16 UK training centres.
Carillion is a corporate supporter of RedR, the charity which
sources, trains and places people with the professional skills 
and resources required by the main aid agencies to provide
disaster relief and recovery around the world. 
2006 was the fourth year in which we organised a company-
wide “Sustainability Week”, in which over 100 events took
place across the Group, helping to put corporate social
responsibility and a culture of sustainability at the heart of 
our business.
Our success in creating a successful and sustainable business
depends primarily on the quality and commitment of our
people. In 2006, 525 Carillion employees won Values awards
for their outstanding contributions, which showed that by living
our values we can make a real, tangible difference to the quality
of the services we provide for our customers and to the
performance of our business. 
Supply chain. Carillion was represented on two of the 
working groups supporting the UK Government’s Sustainable
Procurement Taskforce (SPTF) and helped in the development 
of its “Flexible Framework”. We were delighted to see that 
our sustainable strategy model was included in the SPTF action
plan “Procuring the Future” and cited as an example of good
practice. This framework for procurement has been adopted 
by Carillion’s supply chain and is an integral part of our
Sustainability Excellence Model.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Corporate Governance Report
General principles
The Board is firmly committed to high standards of corporate
governance. During the year to 31 December 2006 and as
detailed below and in the Remuneration Report, the Company
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (July 2003) and
voluntarily complied with the updated section of the 2006
Financial Reporting Council Combined Code (July 2006). 
Ethics and Business Integrity Policy
Carillion has a clear and unequivocal approach to business
integrity and ethics which underlies the Carillion values of
openness, collaboration, mutual dependency, sustainable
profitable growth, professional delivery and innovation. 
The Ethics and Integrity Policy demonstrates how Carillion 
will conduct its business to the highest ethical standards.
The policy applies to all employees of any Carillion group
company. The way Carillion delivers this policy is and will be
reflected in the way the Group competes for business, through
the quality and value of its work and through the reliability 
and reputation of its employees.
The policy is:
– business integrity: we do not give or accept bribes. We do 
not sanction or accept any illegal payments, allowances, or
gifts-in-kind. We will investigate fully all alleged breaches. 
We will dismiss any employee who has breached this policy;
– mutual respect: we do what we say we will do. We treat 
our people fairly and with respect at all times, avoiding
discrimination and bullying. We provide a safe and healthy
working environment, and respect sustainable principles in 
all our dealings;
– trust: we engender trust within our work groups and
companies, respecting diverse traditions and cultures. 
We respect the trust placed in us by others, not least when
we are asked to take responsibility for aspects of their
business or resources. We maintain and demand high
professional standards and demand honesty and openness.
We avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible, and we
proactively declare any unavoidable conflicts for open scrutiny
and resolution;
– legality: we respect the rule of law in all our dealings. 
We clearly communicate procedures for disciplining those 
who do not comply with the law or our standards and
policies. We maintain a system for confidential reporting 
of breaches of our standards and policies;
– human rights: we support the belief that human rights are
universal and adhere to the principles of human rights in 
our operations. We support the United Nations Universal
Declaration on Human Rights.
This policy is carried into Carillion’s business through a series of
detailed procedures. They allow Carillion to carry into practice
its reputation for conducting business to the highest ethical
standard which is essential to its relationships with customers,
business partners, employees, shareholders and the public. 
The detailed procedures reflect the way Carillion competes for
business, through the quality and value of its work and through
the reliability and reputation of its people.
The Ethics and Business Integrity Policy and its implementation 
is reviewed annually by the Board.
Directors
The Board
The Company is led by a Board comprising four Executive and
five Non-Executive Directors. Throughout 2006, the Chairman
and the Non-Executive Directors comprised more than half of the
Board and this continues to be the case. The Chairman and each
of the Non-Executive Directors is considered to be independent
of management. They each have wide areas of experience and
have no business or other relationship that could materially
interfere with their independent judgement. David Garman 
is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the Executive Directors’
service contracts are terminable by one year’s notice. 
A detailed internal evaluation of the Board’s corporate
governance procedures and compliance was again conducted 
in 2006 by the Chairman in conjunction with the Company
Secretary. The internal evaluation took into account the views 
of each of the Directors on (i) the role of directors, (ii) the
performance of the Board, the Chairman and the Non-Executive
Directors, (iii) Board Committees, (iv) leadership and culture, 
(v) Corporate Governance (vi) Directors’ remuneration, 
(vii) relations with shareholders and (viii) Board accountability
and audit. The Board at its meeting in November 2006 reviewed
the results of the internal evaluation and, where required, issues
were acted upon in order to further enhance the effectiveness
of the Board’s procedures and working practices. 
This is the fifth year that this process has taken place and will
be repeated annually as the Board considers it satisfactory. In
addition, reviews of the performance of each of the Directors
has taken place. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and encompasses
the following parameters:
– the primary job of the Chairman of a public company is 
to provide continuity, experience and governance while the 
Chief Executive provides leadership, energy, imagination 
and the driving force;
– the Chairman is viewed by investors as the ultimate steward
of the business and the guardian of the interests of all the
shareholders. Nonetheless, it is essential that the outline of
their respective roles encourages the Chairman and Chief
Executive to work well together to provide effective and
complementary stewardship;
– the Chairman must:
– take overall responsibility for the composition and
capability of the Board;
– consult regularly with the Chief Executive and be 
available on a flexible basis for providing advice, 
counsel and support to the Chief Executive.
– the Chief Executive must: 
– manage the Executive Directors and the Group’s day 
to day activities;
– prepare and present to the Board strategic options 
for growth in shareholder value;
– set the operating plans and budgets required to 
deliver the agreed strategy;
– ensure that the Group has in place appropriate risk
management and control mechanisms.

Other Board matters
Policy on external appointments
Recognising that external appointments can broaden their
knowledge and so be of benefit to the Company, Executive
Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to 
accept a limited number of such appointments and retain 
the fees received for such appointments. Chris Girling is a 
Non-Executive Director of Elementis plc.
Nomination and remuneration of Directors
The appointment of a Director is a matter for resolution by 
the Board as a whole, taking advice from the Nominations
Committee.
For the Board appointments made in 2006, the Nominations
Committee used the services of two executive recruitment
consultants, Odgers Ray & Berndtson and JCA. Details of
potential candidates were provided by both Odgers Ray &
Berndtson and JCA and initially reviewed by a sub-committee 
of the Nominations Committee. Meetings with selected
candidates were then held with Directors. Subsequently, the
Nominations Committee met to recommend appointments
which were then approved by the Board.
In the case of Non-Executive Directors, initial appointments 
are normally for three years; reappointment is subject to 
review and is not automatic. 
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the
Board as a whole, taking into account the commitment 
required and participation in the work of committees and other
advisory services in relation to the business of the Group. In
advising the Board on such fees, it is the policy of the Executive
Directors to seek independent external advice concerning the
appropriateness of the amounts by comparison with general
practice. The level of fees currently payable to the Non-
Executive Directors is based on independent external advice.
The remuneration of the Directors is dealt with in the
Remuneration Report on pages 31 to 38.
Retirement of Directors by rotation
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election 
at least every three years. The Director retiring and seeking 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on
9 May 2007 is John McDonough.
Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by
shareholders at the first opportunity following their
appointment. Accordingly, Donald Kenny and Steven Mogford
will seek election at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.

and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
are available for inspection at the registered office of the
Company during normal business hours on any weekday 
(bank holidays excepted) and at the Annual General Meeting.
Induction and development of Directors
Directors are provided with a comprehensive information 
pack on joining the Company and are advised of their legal 
and other duties and obligations as a director of a listed
company. In addition, all new Directors receive an induction on
their appointment covering such matters as the operation and
activities of the Group, the role of the Board and the Company’s
corporate governance procedures. Directors are also briefed by
the Company’s external advisors, where appropriate, on
changes to legislation or regulation or market practice as well 
as receiving briefings from business groups throughout the year.
At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and in
November 2006 the Directors visited the Group’s operations in
Dubai and Oman. Directors also visit other operations and staff. 
The regular updating of Directors’ skills and knowledge is
encouraged and a procedure has been established whereby 
the Company Secretary is notified by Directors of their
requirements in this respect.
Relations with shareholders
In addition to communicating with shareholders generally from
time to time, the Executive Directors and the Director of Group
Corporate Affairs meet regularly with representatives of major
shareholders in order to foster the mutual understanding of
objectives. The details of these meetings are reported to the
Board. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director are available for meetings with representatives of 
major shareholders as required.
Private and institutional shareholders are encouraged 
to attend the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Company complies fully with the provisions of the
Combined Code in respect of the notice, content of agenda 
and conduct of its Annual General Meetings. The Chairmen 
of the Remuneration and Audit Committees will be present 
at the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2007 to respond 
to shareholders’ questions.

28 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Vanda Murray is Non-Executive Chairman of Eazyfone 
Group and a Non-Executive Director of both the North West
Development Agency and The Manufacturing Institute. 
She was a Director of Ultraframe plc until its takeover in 2006.
Vanda was appointed to the Audit Committee in July 2005.
Steve Mogford is a Director of BAE Systems plc and was
appointed to the Audit Committee in September 2006.
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board.
The Audit Committee has in attendance at meetings, by
invitation of the Committee, Executive Directors, representatives
of the external auditors, (KPMG Audit Plc), the Group Head of
Risk and the Head of Internal Audit. It is also able to invite
others as it requires from time to time. The Committee also
meets privately with both the external and internal auditors.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include: 
– the review of the annual and interim financial statements;
– consideration of the impact of changes to accounting
regulations and the financial and accounting policies of the
Carillion Group; 
– compliance with statutory and other external requirements;
– reviewing the role of the internal audit function and the
results of its audit work and the response of management; 
– reviewing the scope and results of the external audit and its
cost-effectiveness;
– ensuring that the internal and external audit functions are
complementary;
– monitoring the independence and objectivity of the external
auditors and ensuring that the services provided (including
non-audit services) provide a proper balance between
objectivity and value for money;
– recommending to the Board the external auditors to be
proposed to shareholders for appointment.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to (i) seek any
information necessary to fulfil its duties (ii) call any member of
staff to be questioned at a meeting of the Committee as and
when required and (iii) obtain external professional advice, at
the Company’s expense, which might be necessary for the
fulfilment of its duties.
The members of the Committee receive fees as Non-Executive
Directors which also reflect their membership of the Audit
Committee and other Board committees. See page 32
for details.
Main activities of the Audit Committee in the year
to 31 December 2006
Financial statements
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management
and the external auditors the annual and interim statements. In
this context, the Committee also reviews the written reports of
KPMG on issues arising from the annual audit and the review 
of the interim results.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal control. This responsibility includes clearly
determining the control environment and reviewing annually
the effectiveness of the internal control system. However, 
such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code,
the Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks (both
financial and non-financial and including Corporate Social
Responsibility risks) faced by the Group (including joint ventures
and overseas businesses). The process has been in place for the
year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts and is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Assurance over the design and operation of internal controls
across the Group is provided through a combination of
techniques:
– Internal Audit carries out audits to assess the adequacy and
effectiveness of internal controls over the key risks faced by
the business and reports its findings to management, the
Executive Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Plan is presented to and approved by the Audit Committee
annually;
– recommendations to improve the system of control are 
made by Internal Audit. The implementation of these
recommendations is followed up and reported on quarterly;
– Internal Audit independently reviews the risk identification
procedures and control processes implemented by
management; 
– a process of Control Risk Self-Assessment is used in the Group
where Directors and senior managers are required to detail
and certify controls in operation to ensure the control
environment in their business areas is appropriate. They also
confirm annually, in writing, that risk management processes
and appropriate controls are in place and are operating
effectively; and
– Internal Audit advises on aspects of the design and
application of internal controls in key business projects 
and on policy and procedure changes.
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on a regular
basis. The Audit Committee reviews the assurance procedures
and ensures that the level of confidence required by the Board
is obtained. It also ensures the financial reporting process is
credible and reliable. The Audit Committee presents its findings
to the Board regularly and the Head of Internal Audit has direct
access to the Audit Committee members. 
As a result of the acquisition of Mowlem plc, Internal Audit
reviewed its role, resourcing, remit and team structure during
2006, to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of its
stakeholders and fulfils its governance role. A high level review
of the function was also carried out by a third party. As a result
the team structure has been revised to meet audit requirements
in the enlarged Group and minor amendments to processes
have been implemented.

Risk management
The Group Head of Risk is responsible for advising on strategic
risk issues across the Group, and for oversight of risk training.
The Group Head of Risk is also responsible for carrying out an
independent appraisal of all projects before submission to the
Major Projects Committee (see below). This appraisal ensures
that the differentiating factors of the Group’s offer have been
properly identified so maximising the opportunities available; 
it also involves ensuring that all inherent and residual risks
associated with the project have been properly identified and
considered.
In addition, the Risk Forum, a committee of risk professionals
from each of the business groups, meets on a quarterly basis 
to assess the strategic risks facing the Carillion Group. The
conclusions of the Risk Forum are reported to the Audit
Committee.
The Major Projects Committee, a committee of the Board, 
acts as the sanctioning body for major commitments and
transactions including capital expenditure, major contracts 
and company and business acquisitions and disposals. This
committee has delegated authority up to specified levels of 
risk as determined by a risk assessment matrix, beyond which
Board approval is required.
Practical guidance for all staff is maintained in Group policy 
and procedure documents regarding the authorisation levels for
commitments, contract selectivity and bidding, the provision of
guarantees and management accounting as well as reporting
and resolution of suspected fraudulent activities. The Board has
a policy to prosecute individuals found to have defrauded the
Company or its subsidiaries. Learning points for management
are identified and action plans implemented to minimise the
recurrence of fraud. 
Employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about
malpractice at the earliest possible stage and a confidential
‘whistle blowing’ hotline provided by an independent third
party is available.
Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation
of significant risks applicable to its areas of business together
with the design, operation and monitoring of suitable internal
controls. These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may
be associated with a variety of internal or external sources,
including control breakdowns, disruption in information
systems, competition, corporate social responsibility, natural
catastrophe and regulatory requirements. Management is also
responsible for timely and accurate reporting of business
performance and for ensuring compliance with the policies set
by the Board in its areas of business. Regular performance
review meetings are held where management reports to the
Executive Directors on business performance, risk and internal
control matters. The results of these meetings are presented to
the Board.
The Executive Directors report to the Board on material changes
in the business and the external environment that affect
significant risks. The Finance Director provides the Board with
regular financial information, which includes key performance
indicators and a summary of risk. These key performance
indicators and risks are listed in the Chief Executive’s Review on
pages 7 and 9. Where areas for improvement are identified, the
Board considers the recommendations made both by the
Executive Directors and by the Audit Committee.
This report is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee and Board place great emphasis on the
objectivity of the Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, in their
reporting to shareholders.
The KPMG audit director and manager are present at Audit
Committee meetings to ensure full communication of matters
relating to the audit.
The overall performance of the auditor is reviewed annually 
by the Audit Committee, taking into account the views of
management, and feedback is provided to senior members of
KPMG unrelated to the audit. This activity also forms part of
KPMG’s own system of quality control. The Audit Committee
also has discussions with the auditor, without management
being present, on the adequacy of controls and on any
judgemental areas. These discussions have proved satisfactory 
to date.
The scope of the forthcoming year’s audit is discussed in
advance by the Audit Committee. Audit fees are reviewed by
the Audit Committee after discussions between the businesses
and the local KPMG offices and are then referred to the Board
for approval. Rotation of audit director’s responsibilities within
KPMG is required by their profession’s ethical standards. The
current audit director responsible for the Carillion engagement
is in his second year of signing the report. There is also rotation
of key members within the audit team. 
Assignments awarded to KPMG and its associates have been
and are subject to controls by management that have been
agreed by the Audit Committee so that audit independence 
is not compromised. In summary, the procedures are:
– audit related services: as auditor this is the main area of 
work of KPMG and its associates. If any additional accounting
support is required then this is considered competitively;
– tax consulting: in cases where they are best suited, Carillion
uses KPMG and its associates but the Group also uses other 
tax consultancies. Significant pieces of tax work are evaluated
competitively;
– general and systems consulting: all significant consulting
projects are subject to competitive tender.
Other than audit, the Group Finance Director is required to give
prior approval of work carried out by KPMG and its associates 
in excess of a predetermined threshold; part of this review is 
to determine that other potential providers of the services have
been adequately considered.
These controls provide the Audit Committee with adequate
confidence in the independence of KPMG in their reporting 
on the audit of the Group.
Health and safety
A review of the Group’s progress on health and safety,
environmental and social performance is contained in the
Corporate and Social Responsibility report on pages 22 to 23.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration Report 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (July 2006). 
The Board is responsible for determining policy for remuneration
of the Directors of Carillion plc and key members of the senior
management team. The Remuneration Committee consists
exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, namely
David Garman (Chairman), David Maloney, Steve Mogford and
Vanda Murray and is responsible for formulating policy and
recommending to the Board the remuneration of the Executive
Directors. The Board determines the fees of the Chairman and
the other Non-Executive Directors based on independent
external advice. It also determines the remuneration of the
Company Secretary.
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in remuneration
decisions by the Group HR Director and by the Chief Executive.
The Chief Executive is consulted on the remuneration of 
his direct reports and other senior executives. No Executive
Director or employee is present when his or her remuneration 
is being discussed.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses Deloitte 
& Touche LLP to provide salary survey and benchmarking
information. Deloitte & Touche LLP , which was appointed in
2005, also advises the Company on pensions investment but
otherwise has no other connections with the Company.
Remuneration policy 
It is the policy of the Company to ensure that remuneration 
and other benefits attract, motivate and retain Executive
Directors and senior managers of the required calibre to achieve
the Board’s objectives, including that of achieving growth in
shareholder value. Remuneration and other benefits are
determined with regard to competitive market practice and,
where considered appropriate, are supported by external
independent surveys. The main elements of remuneration of 
the Executive Directors are basic salary and pension benefits,
together with an annual bonus linked to the Group’s financial
performance and share based incentives linked to both financial
and share price performance to ensure that the interests of the
Executive Directors are aligned to those of shareholders. It is
anticipated that the Company will continue this approach to 
the structure of remuneration for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s remuneration policy is also based upon Carillion’s
strategic objectives, which specifically include achieving high
standards in respect of sustainability, which encompasses
Carillion’s health and safety, environmental and social
performance.
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are terminable
by one year’s notice from the Company. On termination of 
their employment, Executive Directors of the Company have 
no additional entitlement to compensation for loss of their
office as Directors. The service contracts contain provision 
for early termination. In determining compensation for early
termination of a service contract, the Remuneration Committee
will consider the specific circumstances together with the
Company’s commitments under the individual’s contract
(including future bonuses).

John McDonough 1 January 2001 12 months rolling
Chris Girling 13 September 1999 12 months rolling
Roger Robinson 29 July 1999 12 months rolling
Don Kenny 1 July 2006 12 months rolling
Richard Adam has been appointed as Finance Director effective
2 April 2007 on a rolling term contract. His notice period is 
12 months.
Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of
service, but are generally appointed for fixed terms of three
years renewable for further terms of one to three years if both
parties agree. David Garman, David Maloney, Steve Mogford,
Vanda Murray and Philip Rogerson are in their initial three 
year terms.
Basic salary and other benefits
The basic salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors
are set by the Remuneration Committee and are determined
taking into account individual performance and information
provided by independent sources on the rate of salary for
similar posts in comparable companies. The aim is to reward
Directors fairly and competitively.
Other benefits typically include a company car, private
healthcare and salary supplements (or until March 2006,
contributions to a funded unapproved retirement benefit
scheme (FURBS)) in place of approved pension provision for
salary over the internal earnings cap.
Annual performance bonus and deferred bonus plan
Annual bonuses are reviewed each year by the Remuneration
Committee, which sets performance targets geared to key
financial indicators and individual performance objectives. In
2006, the Executive Directors had the potential to earn annual
bonuses up to a maximum of 100% of their basic salary for
outstanding performance. The bonus arrangement for 2006 
set a financial performance target based on earnings per share
and individual, detailed and confidential personal performance
objectives that support the strategic objectives of the Company.
The maximum bonus opportunity of 100% comprises an annual
cash payment limited to 30% of salary with a deferred bonus 
of shares of the Company with a value of up to 70% of salary
vesting after two years. The number of shares allocated is
determined by the price prevailing at the date the Annual
Report and Accounts are published and the amount by which
the bonus earned exceeds 30% of basic salary at the end of the
bonus year in question. The shares are released on the condition
that the recipient makes funds available to the Company at the
point of transfer to allow the Company to meet its tax and
national insurance obligations on the value of the shares
transferred. The potential bonus available in 2007 will be 100%
of basic salary comprised of a cash payment of up to 30% of
basic salary with a deferred bonus of shares with Company up
to the value of 70% of salary vesting after two years. Richard
Adam will participate in these bonus arrangements from the
date of his employment and, for 2007 only, will be guaranteed
to receive a minimum bonus of 33% of his annual salary
(with no pro-ration for the part year).

In relation to the 2005 bonus arrangement, the Executive
Directors, on 7 April 2006 received a deferred bonus of shares
as follows:
Number of shares
John McDonough 44,778
Chris Girling 26,549
Roger Robinson 27,839
Don Kenny 6,400
These shares will be held in Trust for two years for John
McDonough and Roger Robinson and then transferred in 
April 2008 following payment of the tax and national insurance
obligations. Don Kenny’s shares were held in Trust for one 
year and will be transferred to him in April 2007. The deferred
shares held for Chris Girling in respect of the 2005 bonus will
transfer to him on leaving employment in accordance with the
arrangements agreed for his retirement.
A similar arrangement will apply to the 2006 bonus in excess 
of 30% of basic salary and the amount of shares awarded will
be calculated on 3 April 2007. Shares will be held in trust for
two years. The bonus awarded to Chris Girling in respect 
of 2006 will be paid in cash with no requirement to defer 
any element. He will not participate in the 2007 bonus
arrangements.
Pension benefits 
With the exception of Richard Adam, the Group makes
contributions to an Inland Revenue approved defined benefit
scheme and, where applicable and where the individual
has so elected, to FURBS on behalf of the Executive Directors.
Alternatively, a payment equal to the contribution the Group
would have made to the funded unapproved arrangement 
is paid to the Executive Director as a salary supplement.
Contributions to the funded unapproved arrangements 
are reported as a benefit in kind on an annual basis. Salary
supplements are taxed at source. Contributions to FURBS 
were discontinued in March 2006 following the change in 
tax treatment and replaced with salary supplements for those
Executive Directors concerned. For Richard Adam, the Company
will make contributions to an approved defined contribution
pension plan (up to the internal earnings cap) and a salary
supplement in respect of earnings in excess of the internal cap.

The above table reports the bonus earned in 2006 as opposed to the bonus paid during the year as reported in prior years. 
The 2005 total earnings have been restated to reflect this.
Included in ‘Other benefits’ is a salary supplement for John McDonough of £117,970 (2005: £109,300) in respect of salary over 
the Inland Revenue pensions earnings cap for the period to 31 March and over the internal scheme cap for the balance of the 
year. Contributions were payable to FURBS in respect of Chris Girling of £15,070 (2005: £55,540) for the period to 31 March 
and a salary supplement of £44,100 (2005: nil) in respect of earnings over the internal scheme cap for the balance of the year.
Contributions were paid to FURBS in respect of Roger Robinson of £15,489 (2005: £57,220) for the period to 31 March and 
a salary supplement of £45,360 (2005: nil) in respect of earnings over the internal scheme cap for the balance of the year.
Included in ‘Other benefits’ for Don Kenny is £34,809 (2005: nil) in respect of a salary supplement over the internal scheme
cap. Don Kenny’s remuneration in respect of the period after his appointment as an Executive Director was £75,000 basic salary,
£53,333 bonus (of which £22,500 was paid in cash) and other benefits of £19,346 including £12,872 by way of pension
supplement. The bonus figures shown above are paid in two elements; up to
30% of basic salary is paid in cash and the balance in the form
of deferred shares in the Company vesting after two years. The
amounts shown above were therefore split as follows:

Chris Girling retains the fees of £35,000 per year that he is paid
as a non-executive Director of Elementis plc.
Executive pensions
Until April 2003, it was the Company’s policy to offer
membership of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme to Executive
Directors and other senior employees. This scheme was
operational from 1 October 1999. The scheme is a funded,
Inland Revenue approved, defined benefit scheme to which
members contribute 7% of pensionable earnings. The main
features are:
– pension payable at the normal retirement age of 60 
(save in cases of ill health or early retirement)
– pension accrual rate for Executive Directors of 1/30th of final
pensionable salary for each year of service targeting a pension
(at normal retirement age) of two thirds of final pensionable
salary (subject to twenty years’ service after which employee
contributions cease)
– increases to pensions in payment (in excess of the State
Guaranteed Minimum Pension) in line with price indexation
up to 5% per annum for service to 5 April 2006 and 2.5%
per annum for service after that date
– life assurance of four times pensionable salary
– pensions payable in the event of ill health, and
– on death (in service or after retirement), spouse’s 
and/or dependant’s pension at two thirds of member’s
prospective pension.
Maximum pension benefits of two thirds of pensionable salary
are offset by any pension benefits accruing from earlier pension
arrangements.
The Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants
with effect from 1 April 2003. Pension provision for senior
managers and Executives is now through their existing Carillion
scheme (for current employees) or the Carillion Pension Plan 
(for new employees and existing employees who opted for
membership). The Carillion Pension Plan is a defined
contribution pension arrangement that provides members 
with pensions at retirement based on the accumulated value 
of their notional pension account within the plan.
The current Executive Directors are subject to the Inland
Revenue earnings cap and their pensionable salary is limited
accordingly. They are provided with additional benefits by 
way of individual FURBS or a salary supplement equal to the
contribution the Group would have made to a FURBS and with
unapproved life cover of four times salary over the earnings cap.
In all cases, any contributions made to these arrangements in
respect of the year are disclosed separately above. As these
additional arrangements are limited to the balance of basic
salary in excess of the earnings cap, bonus paid to Executive
Directors does not count towards pension benefits. The
Company does not contribute to any pension arrangements 
for Non-Executive Directors. The Company agreed with the
Trustees of the Carillion pension schemes to continue to 
operate an earnings cap after April 2006 when the external 
cap was removed. The Carillion cap commenced at the level 
of £110,000 for the tax year 2006-07 and rises in line with 
the published increases in the Life Time Allowance up until
2010-11 in line with the table below.
Year Cap
2006-07 £110,000
2007-08 £117,400
2008-09 £121,300
2009-10 £129,000
2010-11 £132,700
All the Executive Directors will be subject to this cap on salary
pensioned through the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme, or in the
case of Richard Adam, the Carillion Pension Plan but they will
be provided with a salary supplement on the same basis as
currently or equal to the funding previously made to FURBS.
FURBS funding ceased in March 2006. 
The following additional changes have been made to the
provisions of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme:
– In respect of benefits arising from service after 6 April 2006,
increases to pensions in payment (in excess of the State
Guaranteed Minimum Pension) will be in line with price
indexation up to 2.5% per annum
– life assurance of four times basic salary will be made 
through the scheme (subject to the Life Time Allowance)
– The twenty year limit on contributory service is removed 
and replaced with an overall benefit limit of 2/3rds of
pensionable salary (subject to the Carillion cap).
These changes closely replicate the current position while using
the available efficiencies regarding life assurance and reducing
the Company’s liabilities in respect of pension increases.

On appointment, Don Kenny’s entitlement under the Carillion

1/30th with retrospective effect. The figures in this table reflect
that and consequently are full year figures.
Share incentive schemes
Following a review of share incentives, the Remuneration
Committee recommended the implementation of a new long
term incentive plan for senior executives, the Carillion plc 2006
Long Term Incentive Plan. Shareholder approval of this plan
was given at the Annual General Meeting in 2006. Following
approval of the Carillion plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, no
further share awards have been made under the existing Long
Term Incentive Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme.
The objective of the Carillion plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan 
is to motivate employees and to encourage them to invest
in the future success of the Group. It has a challenging
performance criterion which applies similarly to all participants. 
A Sharesave Scheme also operates to give UK employees the
opportunity to have a financial stake in the Company.
Carillion plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2006
The Carillion plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 (which is known
internally as the Leadership Equity Award Plan (LEAP)) provides
key persons in the Company with the opportunity to earn
a potentially higher level of reward but only where there is
commitment by those individuals and stretching performance
targets are met. 
Executive Directors may receive an award under the LEAP in
any financial year over shares worth 150% of their basic annual
salary (excluding bonuses, commissions and benefits in kind),
other senior executives may receive an award under the Plan in
any financial year over shares worth up to 100% of their basic
annual salary. The extra 50% awarded to Executive Directors
will only vest if exceptional performance is achieved.
The rules allow for higher awards, but only if exceptional
circumstances exist which justify a first award of up to 200% 
of salary will such an award be made. Richard Adam will
participate at this level in the 2007 scheme. For subsequent
years, the maximum opportunity will be 150% of basic salary.
Under the terms of the Plan, awards of ordinary shares in 
the Company or grants of options over ordinary shares can 
be made.
No payment will be required for the grant of an award. The
Committee will determine the exercise price of an option which 
shall be zero or 0.01 pence per share, provided that where new
issue shares are involved, the exercise price is not less than the
nominal value of a share. 
The participants will not be entitled to receive the shares for
a period determined by the Committee which is generally no
earlier than three years from the date of award. 
The vesting of awards at the end of the performance period will
be subject to the relevant participant remaining in employment
and the achievement of specified stretching performance
conditions. Each Executive Director will be required to hold any
shares acquired through this Plan until the value of their total
shareholding is at least equal to the value of their annual salary
(with the exception of shares sold to meet the tax liability on
the shares acquired through the Plan).
The first awards will be subject to achievement of a
performance target based on annual average growth in
earnings per share above the Retail Price index. The progression
is linear between each of the target levels specified.
Growth in earnings per share:
Growth in earnings per share:
Level 1 RPI + 3% pa 30% vests
Level 2 RPI + 7% pa 50% vests 
Level 3 RPI + 12% pa 100% vests 
Level 4 RPI + 25% pa Extra 50% vests
Levels 1 to 3 apply to all participants, level 4 applies to the
Executive Directors.
The first awards were made in July 2006 and at 31 December
2006 a total of 920,817 shares were outstanding under the LEAP .
Executive Share Option Scheme 
Share options have been granted to the Executive Directors
and certain senior managers under the Executive Share Option
Scheme. The options were granted at an exercise price equal to
the market value of the Company’s shares on the three business
days immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share
Option Scheme 1999 (which carries certain tax advantages for
UK employees) and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999
are exercisable normally between three and ten years after the
date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance
condition. For options granted in 2001 and 2002, the
performance condition requires that the earnings per share of
Carillion over a rolling three year period must increase by a
percentage that is not less than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period, expressed as a percentage,
plus four percentage points per annum. This performance
condition was selected in order to provide an incentive which
aligns the interests of executives with those of shareholders in
growing the Company’s earnings per share. However, as this
performance condition no longer complied with best practice,
at the 2003 AGM, shareholders resolved that future options
granted under both schemes become exercisable in accordance
with the following table:
Average compound annual earnings Percentage of option
per share growth (before that becomes exercisable
exceptional items) in excess of 
RPI over the three year period 
following grant
Less than 4% 0%
4% 30%
Above 4% and below 10% 30% to 100% 
(straight-line basis)
10% or more 100%
To the extent that this performance condition is not met in full
at the end of the three year period following grant, there is the
opportunity for no more than one re-test of performance (from
a fixed base) at the end of the following year.
Grants of options using this new performance condition were
made in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under
the Executive Share Option Schemes cannot normally exceed
their basic salary in any year without the prior approval of the
Remuneration Committee.
With regard to the options granted on 1 July 2003, Carillion
met the performance target such that 80% of the shares under
option are now exercisable.
At 31 December 2006, Executive Share Options were
outstanding over 2,705,579 shares (2005: 3,391,236 shares)
under both schemes at exercise prices ranging from 125.2
pence to 242.75 pence.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan were
made to the Executive Directors and key members of senior
management, in recognition of the contribution that these
individuals can make to the Group’s success.
There is no subscription price for the shares, the award of which
is conditional on the Company’s performance during a three
year period in delivering Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against
a comparator group of companies in the Construction and
Building Materials and Support Services sectors or, in respect
of the awards made in 2005, the FTSE 250 index.
The companies comprising the comparator group for Long Term
Incentive Plan awards made in January 2002 were Amec plc, 
WS Atkins plc, Balfour Beatty plc, Interserve plc, Jarvis plc, Kier
Group plc, Alfred McAlpine plc, Mowlem plc and Taylor Woodrow
plc. (Amey plc was in the comparator group but was removed as 
it delisted from the London Stock Exchange in June 2003).
Carillion subsequently came second in this comparator group 
at the end of the three year performance period for these 2002
awards with the result that 85% of the awards vested and a total
of 172,913 shares transferred to two participants in March 2005.
Following review in 2003, the Remuneration Committee
considered that with a comparator group of ten companies, 
the removal of one company (through take-over or otherwise)
would have a proportionately greater impact on the extent of
the vesting of awards than if the comparator group was larger.
Consequently, shareholders at the 2003 AGM approved that
future awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan
would be subject to Carillion’s TSR performance against an
expanded group of companies as follows: 
Carillion ranking at Percentage of 
end of three years award that will vest
First place 100%
Between the median and first place Straight-line vesting 
between 30% at the 
median and 100% 
for first place
Median 30%
Below the median No award
The comparator group for awards made in accordance with
this 2003 shareholder approval were Amec plc, WS Atkins plc,
Balfour Beatty plc, Interserve plc, Jarvis plc, Kier Group plc,
Alfred McAlpine plc, Mowlem plc, Morgan Sindall plc, John
Laing plc and Serco Group plc. (Again, Amey plc was in this
comparator group until it was delisted, as were Mowlem plc
and John Laing plc until they were taken over).
To date awards with this performance condition have been
made on 1 July 2003 and 31 March 2004. 
With regard to the awards made on 1 July 2003, Carillion came
fourth in the comparator group at the end of the three year
performance period with the result that 61.8% of the awards
vested. A total of 324,727 shares vested to nine participants 
on 12 September 2006. The Carillion plc share price on 
12 September 2006 was 326.5 pence.
Awards equivalent to 100% of annual salary were also made 
to Executive Directors on 15 March 2005: the Remuneration
Committee resolved that these 2005 awards will have a
performance condition based on Carillion’s TSR performance
against the FTSE 250. 
The performance conditions were chosen in order to align
the interests of Directors and senior managers with those
of shareholders in growing total shareholder return against
comparator companies and sectors.
At 31 December 2006, Long Term Incentive Plan awards were
outstanding over a total of 1,696,417 shares (2005: 2,221,874
shares).
Conditional awards made to Executive Directors under the Long
Term Incentive Plan are set out in the table of share incentives
on page 36. The awards represent the maximum number of
shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under the
performance periods commencing on 1 July 2003, 1 January
2004 and 1 January 2005. The monetary value of the
conditional awards attributed to each Director was based on
their annual basic salary at the date of award and the number
of shares was calculated using the share prices of 162.1 pence,
143 pence and 225 pence, the average share prices over the six
weeks immediately before the commencement of the respective
performance periods.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance Graph
The following graph shows the TSR of Carillion plc compared
with the TSR of the FTSE 350 Index for the period from 
1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006. 
The FTSE 350 was chosen as the comparator group in order 
to illustrate the Company’s TSR performance against a broad
equity market index of the UK’s leading companies.
Subject to the schemes meeting their minimum performance
requirements, Chris Girling will receive shares under the 2004
Executive Share Option Scheme, the 2004 and 2005 Long Term
Incentive Plan and the 2006 Leadership Equity Award Plan on a
pro rata basis based on the period of his employment relative to
the grant date of each scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme
The Company operates a Sharesave Scheme which provides a
savings and investment opportunity for employees in the UK.
The options may normally be exercised on completion of a three
or five year savings contract, at a price equivalent to not less
than 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of
grant. Options were granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194
shares, in October 2002 over 3,995,803 shares and in
November 2006 over 2,580,461 shares. 
The five year options granted in November 1999 became
exercisable for a six month period commencing 1 January 2005
at an option price 109.1 pence. A total of 983,369 shares were
issued following maturity.
The three year options granted in October 2002 became
exercisable for a six month period commencing 1 January 2006
at an option price 126.6 pence. A total of 1,829,888 shares
were issued following maturity.
At 31 December 2006, options over 2,580,181 ordinary shares
of 50 pence each were outstanding under the Sharesave
Scheme (2005: 1,895,908 ordinary shares of 50 pence each).
The Carillion share option and share incentive schemes comply
with the share dilution guidelines.

The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the above table.
*The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7 pence granted to John McDonough in March 2002 under the
Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 was made later in the year than had been specified at the time of his appointment which
resulted in an increased option price of 67.3 pence. Therefore, in order to ensure that he will be in no worse nor better a position 
as a result of the delay in the grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 67.3 pence per share (less tax) will be made when and if the
option is exercised.
There have been no changes to the interests of Executive Directors in share incentives and options in the period 1 January to 
7 March 2007. The performance conditions for the options shown in the table are as detailed in this Remuneration Report in the
summaries of the relevant schemes.
Employee Benefit Trusts
An employee benefit trust has been established to acquire shares in Carillion plc and hold them for the benefit of participants in 
the share incentive and share option schemes. At 31 December 2006, the Trust held 1,137,177 Carillion shares (2005: 3,715,612
shares) (0.4% of the issued share capital and a nominal value of £0.6 million) (2005: 1.73% and £1.9 million) acquired over a
period in the open market and which have a carrying value of £1.6 million. The market value of the shares held at 31 December
2006 was £4.5 million (2005: £11.4 million).
Additionally, a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST) operates in conjunction with Carillion in providing shares to

ranging from 115.5 pence to 296.25 pence per share, to enable it to satisfy, as and when required, options granted under the
Sharesave Scheme. The market value of the shares held by the QUEST at 31 December 2006 was £0.9 million (2005: £1.2 million).

the changing working practices required to succeed in an
environment where partnership and integrated solutions are
becoming the norm. 
Section 06

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Report of the Directors

It is Carillion’s aim to foster a working environment in which 
all employees are treated with courtesy, dignity and respect.
Carillion continually strives to eliminate all bias and unlawful
discrimination in relation to job applicants, employees, business
partners and members of the public. Employees who become
disabled are, wherever possible, retrained or provided with
equipment so that they can continue their employment. 
The objectives of Carillion’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity
Policy are:
– to have a workforce that represents and responds to the
diversity of customers and today’s society;
– improved safety and quality provided by a balanced and
productive workforce;
– better public image and market position, leading to 
improved links with the community in which Carillion works;
– adherence to legal requirements;
– lower staff turnover, absenteeism and sickness levels leading
to cost savings;
– to provide a fair working environment in which discrimination
will not be tolerated;
– to create a working environment free from discrimination,
harassment, victimisation and bullying;
– to work towards finding ways for under-represented groups 
to fully realise their potential within the Carillion organisation
and to take reasonable steps to help such groups; 
– to ensure that all employees are aware of the Group Equal
Opportunities and Diversity Policy and to provide any
necessary ongoing training to enable them to meet their
responsibilities under it; and
– Carillion plc also recognises the merit of developing a
workforce that incorporates the many diverse skills and
backgrounds available from within the total population and
accordingly, will strive to become an organisation that will
recognise, value and understand diversity and to provide 
its employees with genuine opportunities to improve and
reach their full potential.
Carillion places great importance on open and regular
communication with employees through both formal and
informal processes. As part of this commitment, a Group
newspaper, ‘Spectrum’, is produced on a regular basis for 
all employees. 
The views of employees on matters affecting their interests are
also sought through ‘The Great Debate’. This is a major exercise
which was undertaken by the Group in 2003, 2004, 2005 and
2006 to capture the feelings and views of as wide a range of
employees as possible. These views are then taken into account
in the development of work related initiatives as part of
Carillion’s strategy to become an employer of choice. In 2006,
2,600 UK employees attended ‘The Great Debate’ sessions.
Carillion stages ‘The Great Debate’ as part of the ongoing 
quest for cultural change and to produce step changes which:
– raise understanding of what drives motivation, morale,
engagement and performance;
– allows employees to take ownership and be empowered 
to build and implement solutions; and
– demonstrates Carillion’s desire to change attitudes and
behaviours based on listening to the views of its employees.
Additionally, ‘Team Talk’ which is held monthly provides Carillion
employees with a face-to-face communication with their line
managers and facilitates two-way communication, discussion
and feedback. It focuses on local issues and key corporate
messages and information. 
One-to-one meetings between individual employees and their
line managers are also held to discuss performance and progress.
Employees can also exchange best practice information on 
a Knowledge Management Forum on the Group intranet.
Carillion seeks to involve all employees in its leading edge
programmes to integrate safety into everything it does and 
to improve its environmental performance, including the
understanding and application of the principles of sustainability.
Further information on Health and Safety, the Environment 
and Community is given in the Corporate Social Responsibility
report on pages 22 and 23.
Carillion also involves, engages and consults with employees
through ‘People Forums’ across the Group which give
employees the opportunity to express their views on business
issues. Specifically, the objectives of the ‘People Forums’ are:
– to improve employee information and consultation;
– to help employees feel more involved and valued;
– to support the continued education and development 
of employees;
– improve business performance by enabling employees to be
better aware of the business climate in which they operate; 
and
– to help employees to be responsive to and better prepared 
for change.

Under the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules, shareholders have until 
20 March 2007 to inform companies of interests of 3% and at each 1%
increment above that level: as the above table is at 7 March 2007, this may 
not be a complete list of substantial share interests.
Policy for payment of suppliers
It is the policy of the Group that each business agrees terms 
and conditions for transactions with its suppliers and for
payment to be made on these terms providing the suppliers
meet their obligations to the businesses’ satisfaction. The 
Group as a whole does not apply a general recognised code
with regard to the payment of all suppliers. The Company 
does not have any trade creditors.
The number of days credit outstanding for the Group averaged 
80 days at 31 December 2006 (62 days at 31 December 2005).
Charitable and political contributions
Payments for charitable purposes made by the Group 
during the year ended 31 December 2006 amounted to
£145,000 (2005: £84,000). The primary beneficiaries of these
charitable donations were The Wildlife Trust, Business in the
Community, the British Heart Foundation and CRASH, the
construction and property industry charity for the homeless.
The Carillion Group also contributes more than one per cent of
profits per annum in cash or in-kind (staff time on community
projects) to community activities and is a member of the
Business in the Community PerCent Club.
The Company and its subsidiaries made no political donations
during the period under review.
Financial Instruments
Information on the Carillion Group’s use of financial
instruments, financial risk management objectives and policies
and exposure is given in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect 
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Group
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and applicable law.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS 
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides 
in relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair
presentation.
The Parent Company financial statements are required by law
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent
Company and of the profit or loss of the Parent Company
for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent
Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
– for the Group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
– for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company financial statements; and
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the
Parent Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Section 06

Independent auditors’ report to
the members of Carillion plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Carillion plc for
the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the Group
Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance
Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information
in the Director’s Remuneration Report that is described as
having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we may
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Parent
Company financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration
Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting
Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 42.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that
specific information presented in the Operating and Financial
Review and the Chief Executive’s Statement that is cross referred
from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for audit, or
information specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions
of the 2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures,
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the International
Standards for Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors
in preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of
the Group’s affairs at 31 December 2006 and of its profit
of the year then ended;
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation; 
– the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2006;
– the parent company financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and
– the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the financial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1. Significant accounting policies
Carillion plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the
United Kingdom (UK). The consolidated financial statements of
the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprise
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities. 
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for
issuance on 7 March 2007.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and
approved by the Directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted
IFRS’s’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent
company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 82 to 88.
Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied
consistently in dealing with items which are considered material
in relation to the Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. 
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the
following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value:
derivative financial instruments, pension scheme assets, cash
and cash equivalents and financial instruments classified as
available-for-sale.
The following standards and interpretations have been endorsed
by the EU by the year end but are not yet effective for the year
ending 31 December 2006:
– IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’
– IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29
‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’
– IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’
– IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’.
The Group has considered the impact of these new
standards and interpretations in future periods on the financial
statements and no significant impact is expected. The Group
has chosen not to early adopt any of the above standards
and interpretations.
In respect of IFRIC 12, ‘Service concessions’, which has not yet
been endorsed by the EU, the Group has continued to
recognise the FRS 5 ‘Reporting the substance of transactions’
finance debtors relating to concession arrangements held by
PPP jointly controlled entities at amortised cost as defined by
IAS 39. FRS 5 fixed assets relating to concession arrangements
are accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, plant
and equipment’. The effect of adopting this policy is to
maintain the accounting within PPP jointly controlled entities in
line with existing UK GAAP (with the exception of the treatment
of interest rate derivatives under IAS 39), whilst ensuring that
the accounting treatment complies with existing IFRS. The
Group does not expect the change in accounting policy to have
a significant effect when the interpretation becomes mandatory
in 2008.
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the
Company drawn up to 31 December 2006. Control exists when
the Group has direct or indirect power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic
benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date that control
transfers to the Group until the date that control ceases. 
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control
with third parties. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled
entities are accounted for using the equity method. Under this
method the Group’s share of the profits less losses of jointly
controlled entities is included in the consolidated income
statement and its interest in their net assets is included in
investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the share
of losses exceeds the interest in the entity the carrying amount
is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is
discontinued. Interest in the entity is the carrying amount of 
the investment together with any long-term interests that, 
in substance, form part of the net investment in the entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled
operation, that company accounts for the assets it controls, the
liabilities and expenses it incurs and its share of the income.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial
statements on the same basis.
Other non-current asset investments
Other non-current asset investments are classified as available
for sale financial assets and are recognised at fair value.
Changes in fair value in the year are recognised directly in the
statement of recognised income and expense. Dividend income
from investments is recognised when the right to receive
payment is established.
Section 07
Financial Statements
48 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have occurred since 
1 January 2004 represents the difference between the fair value
of the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquired entity.
Consideration includes the attributable costs of the acquisition.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 goodwill is
included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the
amount recorded under previous GAAP. 
Positive goodwill is recognised as an asset in the consolidated
balance sheet and is subject to an annual impairment review.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised
separately as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance
sheet. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of jointly controlled
entities is included within the carrying value of the investment.
Negative goodwill is recognised in the income statement
immediately.
Under previous UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior
to 1 January 1998 was written off to reserves. In accordance
with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 ‘Business
combinations’, this treatment has continued to be applied for
those years. Any goodwill previously written off to reserves
remains in reserves.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is based on
the useful economic lives of the assets concerned, which are
principally as follows:
Computer software and licences 
Straight line over 3-5 years
Customer contracts and lists
– Planned Maintenance Group
Consumption of economic benefits over 6 years
– Mowlem plc
Consumption of economic benefits over 35 years
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested for impairment at each balance
sheet date. Assets subject to depreciation and amortisation 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement 
based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds
the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher
of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Construction contracts
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated
reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised by reference
to the degree of completion of each contract, as measured by
the proportion of total costs at the balance sheet date to the
estimated total cost of the contract. 
Insurance claims and incentive payments arising from
construction contracts are included where they have been
agreed with the client. Variations and other claims are included
where there is reasonable certainty that the amount will be
settled. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot
be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the
extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable those
costs will be recoverable.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in
which they are incurred.
Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised
losses exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due
from customers on construction contracts within trade and
other receivables. Where progress billings exceed costs incurred
plus recognised profits less recognised losses, the balance is
shown as due to customers on construction contracts within
trade and other payables.
Pre-contract costs 
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is
appointed preferred bidder. Provided the contract is expected 
to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and
the award of the contract is probable, pre-contract costs
incurred post the appointment as preferred bidder are included
in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts.
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at financial close,
the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in
amounts owed by customers on construction contracts. Any
excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income and
released to profit over the period of the contract.
Section 07
Financial Statements
49 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable,
excluding value added tax, for services supplied to external
customers. It also includes the Group’s proportion of work
carried out under jointly controlled operations during the year.
Revenue from service contracts is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion, as measured by reference to services
performed to date as a percentage of total services to be
performed. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on
construction contracts.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is based on historical cost, less the estimated
residual values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets
concerned. Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, plant and
equipment is depreciated in equal annual instalments over the
period of their estimated economic lives, which are principally 
as follows:
Freehold buildings 40-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles 3-10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the
shorter of the term of the lease or the expected useful life 
of the asset.
Leasing
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant
and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of
acquisition or present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases is included 
in financial liabilities. The finance charge element of rentals is
charged to the income statement at a constant periodic rate 
of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and land for development
and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in
respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability
method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of
the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax
benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the
balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are
included in the income statement.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Income statements and cash flows of
overseas entities are translated into sterling at rates
approximating to the foreign exchange rates at the date of 
the transaction. Gains or losses arising from the consolidation 
of overseas entities are recognised in the translation reserve. 
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign
currencies. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion 
of the hedges are recognised in equity and ineffective portions
are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the
Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement
as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the IAS 19 cost of
providing benefits is calculated annually by independent
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The charge 
to the income statement reflects the current service cost of 
such obligations, and where applicable, past service cost. 
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost on
scheme liabilities are included within financial income and
expenses in the income statement. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance
sheet represents the excess of the present value of scheme
liabilities over the fair value of scheme assets. Differences
between the actual and expected returns on assets and
experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities during
the year, together with differences arising from changes in
assumptions, are recognised in the statement of recognised
income and expense in the year. 
The Group’s contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance
with the scheme rules and the recommendations of the actuary.

Financial Statements
50 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Other post-retirement benefit obligations
Certain Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare
benefits to their employees. The expected costs of providing
these benefits are accrued over the period of employment and
are calculated by independent actuaries based on the present
value of the expected liability.
(c) Share-based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled
to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Leadership Equity Award
Plan (LEAP). In addition, UK employees are able to participate in
the Sharesave scheme.
The fair values of the ESOS, LEAP and Sharesave schemes at 
the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using 
a bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions. For all
schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs
qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off 
to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled
entities relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects 
are capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into
operational use.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental
issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are deducted from
the retained earnings reserve. Where such shares subsequently
vest in the employees under the terms of the Group’s share
option schemes or are sold, any consideration received is
included in the retained earnings reserve.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a
past event, and where it is probable that an outflow will be
required to settle the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has
an approved restructuring plan that has either commenced or
been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not
provided for.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The
principal financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as
follows:
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then
are stated at amortised cost.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at
fair value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash
and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand,
including bank deposits with original maturities of three months
or less. Bank overdrafts are also included as they are an integral
part of the Group’s cash management.
(c) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are
stated at amortised cost.
(d) Bank and other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
All borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with
the difference between initial net proceeds and redemption
value recognised in the income statement over the period to
redemption.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that
the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in
future periods at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting change in fair value is dependant on whether the
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
A number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have
entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging
interest rate risk. The effective part of the change in fair value 
of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity. Any
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the
income statement in the periods when the hedged items will
affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the
estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge
against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency
exposures. In cases where these derivative instruments are
significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above.
Where hedge accounting is not applied movements in fair value
are recognised in the income statement. Fair values are based 
on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.

The impairment reversal relating to land and buildings of £1.1m in 2006, included within administrative expenses, arises from market
improvements since the date of the original impairment in 2001.
Land and buildings include land with a cost of £3.4m (2005: £1.0m) that is not being depreciated.
The net book value of plant, equipment and vehicles includes £23.1m (2005: £11.4m) of costs associated with the development of
new computer systems for the Group’s human resources and finance functions. Depreciation of these costs over a period of between

Goodwill of £430.8m and customer contracts and lists of £119.0m arose in 2006 on the acquisition of Mowlem plc, as disclosed in
note 30. Goodwill arises on the acquisition of Mowlem plc due to consideration paid, over and above the fair value of net liabilities
acquired, representing the present value of future income streams expected to be generated from margin growth in the construction
and support services businesses of Mowlem plc, together with identifiable cost savings within the enlarged Group. Customer
contracts and lists identified on the acquisition of Mowlem plc relates principally to the present value of future income streams
expected to arise from secured and unsecured contracts with customers.

12. Intangible assets (continued)
Goodwill of £34.5m and customer contracts and lists of £6.2m arose in 2005 on the acquisition of Planned Maintenance Group
Limited (PMG).
The net book value of computer software and licences includes £2.0m (2005: £1.6m) of costs associated with the development of
new computer systems for the Group’s human resources and finance functions. Depreciation of these costs over a period of five
years will commence when the computer systems are brought into operational use during 2007.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The following units have significant amounts of goodwill:
2006 2005
£m £m
Rail Projects 12.1 12.1
Citex Management Services contracts 7.0 7.0
Planned Maintenance Group Limited 34.5 34.5

Facilities Management 97.8 –
Facilities Services 42.0 –
Rail 40.0 –
National Building 41.0 –
Pall Mall 18.0 –
484.4 53.6
In 2006, as in each year or whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, in accordance
with IAS 36, Carillion plc has reviewed the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units. In the absence of any
identified impairment risk, tests were performed by Carillion plc based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit. 
The recoverable amount of the goodwill attaching to cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations using discounted
cash flows. Those calculations use cash flows based on three year business plans and forecasts and a perpetual growth rate of 5%
thereafter, discounted at the Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9.5%. 
As at 31 December 2006, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash
generating units tested significantly exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge
The amortisation charge of £17.8m (2005: £4.0m) is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement. Amortisation 
of the intangible asset of £119.0m arising on the acquisition of Mowlem plc will be 79% complete by 2016. The remaining
amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.

27. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed
primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk
management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the
Board of Directors. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In order to protect the
Group’s balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets of overseas
operations that exceed £10m equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, at least 50% of the net asset value. Net investment hedging is
achieved through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the
effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution. Such distributions are then
treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures that are hedged using forward contracts as 
described above.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowings to finance the acquisition of Mowlem plc and short term
working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of overseas operations. Such
borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR. No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Group’s
subsidiaries. However, a number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry
significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship
banks in the form of syndicated and bi-lateral loans and short-term overdraft facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing
facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging. Policies
and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history. Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency
hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major 
rating agencies. Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are 
within predetermined limits.

In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a 
means of hedging interest rate risk. Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly
controlled entities are without recourse to the Group. At 31 December 2006 the Group’s share of the total net fair value liability 
of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to £27.8m (2005: £45.1m) of which £13.7m (2005: £15.5m)
(and the related deferred tax asset of £4.1m (2005: £4.7m)) has been recognised in the hedging reserve.

The Group’s interest bearing borrowings were subject to effective interest rates at the balance sheet date as follows:

Of the total foreign currency borrowings of £67.1m (2005: £71.9m), the amount of borrowings used for hedging overseas
operations amounts to £29.9m (2005: £34.0m). The foreign exchange gain of £4.1m (2005: £4.0m loss) on translation of the
borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.

Disposals in 2006
During the acquisition of Mowlem plc, certain businesses were identified as being non-core operations for disposal. In addition, 
there were a number of businesses which had been identified as available for sale by Mowlem plc prior to acquisition.
In the post acquisition period the Group disposed of the following Mowlem plc businesses:
Edgar Allen Limited
Charter Builders Ltd
Mowlem Environmental Sciences Group
Barclay Mowlem Limited
Carillion Energy Limited (formerly Mowlem Energy Limited)
Carillion Utility Services Limited (formerly Mowlem Utility Services Limited)
These businesses were included in the acquisition balance sheet of Mowlem plc as assets and liabilities held for sale and were
therefore carried at fair value, which represents proceeds on disposal less costs to sell. These fair values were realised on subsequent
disposal and consequently no profit or loss has arisen.
The cash effect has been reflected in the Group cash flow statement as follows:
£m
Consideration received (net of disposal costs paid) 53.5
Cash in businesses disposed of (23.1)
Cash inflow from disposal of businesses 30.4
In September 2006, the Group disposed of a portfolio of equity investments in Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities.
The disposal generated cash consideration of £46.7m (after deducting disposal costs of £0.4m) and a non operating profit of
£25.6m. The Group also disposed of equity interests in two small non-PPP jointly controlled entities for a total consideration of
£0.6m, generating a profit of £0.4m.

31. Retirement benefit obligations
Carillion operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below:
Principal defined benefit schemes
Carillion Staff and ‘B’ Pension Schemes
Both schemes are defined benefit schemes and were closed to new entrants on 1 April 2003. Existing members continue to accrue
benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2005
using the projected unit credit method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date were £485.0m and £106.4m respectively,
which represented approximately 90% and 94% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after
allowing for future increases in salaries. The regular on-going contributions paid during the year were £10.8m (2005: £11.7m) in
respect of the Carillion Staff Pension Scheme and £1.4m (2005: £1.4m) in respect of the Carillion ‘B’ Pension Scheme. 
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees of the Staff and ‘B’ schemes, payments were made to the schemes
during 2006 of £15.0m and £2.0m respectively. Further payments are due to the Staff and ‘B’ schemes in 2007 of £18.0m and
£2.0m respectively and payments of £16.0m and £2.0m respectively are due in 2008. These payments are secured by a Letter of
Credit to the Trustees. Recovery payments of £1.9m per annum to the Staff scheme are scheduled to commence from January 2010
and cease at the end of 2015. The next actuarial valuations are due normally at 31 December 2008.
The Group expects to pay regular ongoing contributions of approximately £11.0m to the Staff scheme and £1.0m to the ‘B’ scheme
during 2007 representing contribution rates of 20.1% and 36.5% of payroll respectively. 
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the above. The PPF levies for the year ended 31 March 2006 were
£0.4m for the Staff scheme and £16,000 for the ‘B’ scheme.
Mowlem Staff Pension and Life Assurance and Mowlem (1993) Pension Schemes
The Mowlem Staff Pension and Life Assurance and Mowlem (1993) Pension schemes were part of Mowlem plc, which was acquired
on 23 February 2006.
The majority of employees who participate in these schemes are in defined benefit arrangements. The defined benefit section of the
Mowlem Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme closed to new entrants on 1 January 2003. 
A defined contribution section was opened for new employees from 1 April 2003. Existing final salary members could opt to
continue on that basis from 1 April 2003 if they agreed to pay a higher member contribution or could pay the same rate and accrue
benefits on a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) basis from that date.
An actuarial valuation of the Mowlem Staff and (1993) schemes was undertaken by independent actuaries as at 31 December 2004
using the attained age method. The market value of the schemes assets at that date were £323.1m and £30.3m respectively,
representing approximately 78% and 71% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after
allowing for future increases in salaries. The regular ongoing contributions paid during the period since acquisition were £7.7m in
respect of the Mowlem Staff scheme and £1.9m in respect of the Mowlem (1993) scheme.
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, payments were made to the Mowlem Staff and Mowlem (1993)
schemes in the period since acquisition of £9.5m and £1.3m respectively. Recovery payments of £11.4m per annum in respect of 
the Mowlem Staff scheme and £1.6m per annum in respect of the Mowlem (1993) scheme are scheduled to continue until 2016.
The Group expects to pay regular ongoing contributions of approximately £8.0m and £2.0m to the Mowlem Staff and Mowlem
(1993) schemes during 2007 representing contribution rates of 15.3% and 24.6% of payroll respectively. The next actuarial
valuations of the schemes is due at 31 December 2007.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan. The PPF levies for the year ended 31 March 2006
were £0.5m for the Mowlem Staff scheme and £0.25m for the Mowlem (1993) scheme.
Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme. The Scheme remains open to eligible employees transferring from the public sector as part
of the commercial obligations under PFI, PPP and Best Value contracts with public sector employers.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 December 2004 using the
attained age method. The market value of the schemes’ assets at that date was £74.9m, which represented approximately 82% 
of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries. 
The regular ongoing employer contributions paid during the year were £2.7m (2005: £3.9m).

As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, a payment of £2.0m was made during 2006 and further payments 
of £2.0m per annum are due in 2007 and 2008. These payments have been secured by a Letter of Credit to the Trustee. Additional
recovery payments totalling £2.3m per annum will commence in 2007 and are scheduled to be paid until 2015.
The Group expects to pay regular ongoing contributions of approximately £3.0m during 2007 representing 23.2% of pensionable
salaries at the end of 2006. If any employees are admitted into the Scheme through PFI, PPP or Best Value contracts during 2007 
the level of contributions will increase. The next actuarial valuation is due at 31 December 2007.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan. The PPF levy for the year ended 31 March 2006
was £0.06m.
Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS)
Employees of GTRM and Centrac, and former employees of British Rail transferred to these businesses, have pension provision 
via Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme. Both the GTRM and Centrac Sections are closed to new entrants. 
Shared cost arrangements are such that the employer and members share the cost of future service liabilities on a 60/40 split
respectively and any surplus or deficit emerging over time is dealt with on a similar basis. 
Independent actuaries appointed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited carried out a formal valuation of the Railways
Pension Scheme at 31 December 2004 using the projected unit credit method for GTRM and the attained age method for Centrac.
The market values of the scheme assets of the GTRM Section and Centrac Section at 31 December 2004 were £195.4m and £27.4m
respectively, which represented approximately 94% and 102% of benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing
basis, after taking account of future increases in salaries, contributions payable and reserves. The regular ongoing contributions paid
by the employer during the year were £3.9m (2005: £4.5m) for GTRM and £0.3m (2005: £0.2m) for Centrac.
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, a payment of £2.0m was made during 2006. Further payments of £2.0m
per annum are due in 2007 and 2008. An additional payment of £1.1m was also paid during 2006 to cover the cost of premium
restructuring under the Scheme Rules.
The Group expects to pay regular on-going contributions in 2007 of £4.0m in total for both sections representing 16.02% and
16.56% of pensionable salaries for GTRM and Centrac respectively. The next actuarial valuations are due at 31 December 2007.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan. The PPF levy for the year ended 31 March 2006
for both sections totalled £0.1m.
Other defined benefit schemes
The PME Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
The PME Staff Pension Scheme is a defined benefit pension scheme and is closed to new entrants. Existing members continue to
accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees’ independent actuaries as at 31 August 2004 using the
attained age method. The market value of the scheme’s assets at that date was £27.4m, which represented approximately 73% of
the benefits that had accrued to members at that date on an ongoing basis, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The deficit
in the scheme at 31 December 2006, calculated in accordance with IAS 19, is £2.5m (2005: £4.3m deficit). The regular ongoing
contributions paid during the year were £1.2m (2005: £1.2m).
As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, a payment of £1.0m per annum is due in 2007 and 2008. These
payments have been secured by a Letter of Credit to the Trustees.
The Group expects to pay regular ongoing contributions of approximately £1.0m during 2007 representing 16.5% of pensionable
salaries. The next actuarial valuation is due at 31 December 2006.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the funding plan and was £0.02m for the year ended
31 March 2006.
Carillion Canada Inc.
The Carillion Group operates a defined benefit scheme for employees of Carillion Canada Inc managed locally and supplemental
arrangements in respect of certain executives, the Senior Executive Retirement Plan and a health care plan, the Post Retirement
Benefit Plan. The net surplus in total for these 3 schemes at 31 December 2006, calculated in accordance with IAS 19, is £0.5m
(2005: £1.1m deficit).
Contributions during the year were £nil (2005: £nil) in respect of the Carillion Canada Inc defined benefit scheme and £0.2m 
(2005: £0.1m) in respect of other post-retirement benefits for senior Canadian employees. Contributions for 2007 are estimated 
to be £0.2m.

Bower Group Retirement Benefit Scheme
The Bower Group Retirement Benefit Scheme was part of Mowlem plc, which was acquired on 23 February 2006. The scheme is 
a defined benefit arrangement and is closed to future accrual.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by independent actuaries as at 29 February 2004. The deficit in the scheme at
31 December 2006 calculated in accordance with IAS 19 is £2.1m. The Group has not made any contributions to the scheme in the
period since acquisition. As part of the deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, £0.3m is scheduled to be paid to the scheme
in February 2007. Following the next actuarial valuation due as at 28 February 2007, the Group’s contributions to the scheme will 
be reviewed. 
Other UK and overseas schemes
The Group operates four UK defined contribution schemes, the Carillion Pension Plan, The Mowlem Staff Scheme (defined
contribution section), the PME Defined Contribution Plan and the Carillion Retirement Plan (closed to new entrants since 2001). 
In addition, the Group operates a Stakeholder Plan (‘Stakeholder Plus’).
The Carillion Pension Plan commenced on 1 April 2003. The majority of new employees across the Group are eligible to join this Plan.
Employees contribute a minimum of 5.0% and the employer a minimum of 7.0% of basic salaries. Up to 3.0% of any additional
voluntary contributions paid by employees is matched by the employer resulting in a maximum employer contribution of 10.0% 
of basic salary. The employer meets the cost of administration and managing the Plan equivalent to a further 2.0% of basic pay.
Contributions during the year were £2.0m (2005: £1.4m).
The defined contribution section of the Mowlem Staff Scheme commenced on 1 April 2003. The plan is principally only open to 
late entrants on application. Employees contribute between 3.0% and 5.0% depending upon their age and the employer between
4.5% and 8.0%. The employer meets the cost of the administration and managing the Plan in addition to the cost of the life
assurance premiums. Contributions during the period since acquisition were £1.5m.
Employees of Carillion Services Limited who are not eligible for the Carillion Pension Plan are invited to participate in the Carillion
Stakeholder Plus managed by BlackRock Pensions Limited. Employees contribute 5.0% and the employer 6.5% of basic salary. Death 
in service lump sum benefits are provided in addition. Contributions during the year were £0.5m (2005: £0.5m). 
The PME Defined Contribution Plan commenced in April 1999. All new PME employees are offered membership of the Plan.
Employees contribute 4.0% of basic pay and the company pays 5.0% of basic pay (inclusive of a 1.0% allowance for insurance
premiums and audit fees). Contributions during the year were £1.2m (2005: £1.0m).
Contributions to the Carillion Retirement Plan during the year were £0.1m (2005: £0.1m).
Stakeholder pensions are also provided by B&CE Insurance and Scottish Widows where required by Working Rule Agreements and
defined contribution pensions provided where required by the Joint Industries Board Working Rules Agreements.
Various companies within the Group participate in admission agreements with local authorities in order to allow former public sector
employees to continue membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme. Contributions during the year, which have been
accounted for on a defined contribution basis, were £0.2m (2005: £0.4m).
The Group also operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for employees of Carillion Rail Sverige AB again 
managed locally.

The market values of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant
change before they are realised. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return 
on Grade AA corporate bonds. The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation. All the schemes, 
except the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme
Actuary. The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specific assumptions based on industry experience.
The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme and the Mowlem (1993) Scheme adopted
the ‘PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 years’ table for non-retired members’ mortality and the ‘PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 years’ for retired
members’ mortality at the last valuation. The previous bases were ‘PA92(Base) – 3 years and ‘PA92(Base) – 1 year’ respectively.
The life expectancies for a male aged 65 are shown below.
2006 2005
PA92(YOB=1965)mc + 2 yrs PA92(Base) – 3 yrs
Non-retired members 21.3 years 19.4 years
PA92(YOB=1935)mc + 2 yrs PA92(Base) – 1 yr
Retired members 19.7 years 17.8 years
The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefits
under the local GAAP, CICA 3461. The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation
to the Post Retirement Benefit Plan. The immediate trend rate is 8.0% per annum with an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% per annum
(2010). An increase of 1.0% in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by £0.6m and the total service cost by £0.06m.
A decrease of 1.0% in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by £0.5m and total service cost by £0.04m.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or 
Treasury stock and the Actuary’s recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities. 
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and
Expense as permitted under IAS 19.
The IAS 19 position for the schemes is as follows:

32. Accounting estimates and judgements
Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting
policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, 
are discussed below:
Construction contracts
In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made 
in relation to final out turn on each contract. Management continually review estimated final out turn on contracts and make
adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets 
In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in
relation to final out turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached. Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:
–Expected return on plan assets
–Inflation rate
–Mortality
–Discount rate
–Salary and pensions increases
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Principal accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Company’s financial statements. 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK
accounting standards and law.
Taxation
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences
between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements and their recognition in the tax computation that
have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except
as otherwise required by FRS 19. Liabilities are calculated on a
non-discounted full provision basis. Assets are calculated on the
same basis, but are recognised only to the extent that is it
probable that they will be recovered.
Fixed asset investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary
undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision
for any impairment.
Leasing
The Company enters into finance lease arrangements on behalf
of subsidiary companies. As permitted by SSAP 21 ‘Accounting
for leases and hire purchase contracts’, the assets relating to the
finance leases are included in the financial statements of the
subsidiaries concerned. The capital element of outstanding
finance leases is included within borrowings. The finance charge
element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account at a
constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Own Shares
Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan
(ESOP) trust are presented within the profit and loss account
reserve until such time as the interest in the shares is transferred
unconditionally to the employees. Costs of administering the
trust are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The ESOP trust is regarded as a quasi subsidiary under FRS 5
‘Reporting the substance of transactions’ and its assets, liabilities
and results are consolidated into the financial statements of the
Company.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into sterling and recorded using the contracted exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the
relevant balance sheet date and the gains and losses on
translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by
FRS 1 (revised) “Cash flow statements”.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash 
at bank and in hand and borrowings. Cash at bank and in hand
is carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Borrowings are
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs
and subsequently at amortised cost. In addition, the Company
enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small
and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures. The
forward contracts are measured initially at fair value, with
changes in fair value during the year recognised in the profit
and loss account. Fair values are based on quoted market prices
at the balance sheet date.
Share based payments
Members of the Group’s senior management team are entitled
to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Leadership Equity Award
Plan (LEAP). In addition, UK employees are able to participate in
the Sharesave scheme.
The fair values of the ESOS, LEAP and Sharesave schemes at 
the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a
bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions. For all
schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiary companies, the
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and
accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as
it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make
a payment under the guarantee.
Retirement benefit obligations 
Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in
accordance with the requirements of FRS 17. Employees of the
Company participate in the Carillion ‘Staff’ and ‘B’ schemes
which provide pensions on a defined benefit basis. The assets
and liabilities of these schemes relating to the Company cannot
be readily ascertained on a reasonable and consistent basis as
the schemes are operated for the benefit of the Carillion Group
as a whole. Consequently, the Company accounts for these
schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes. Details 
of the Group’s pension schemes are disclosed in note 31 of the
consolidated financial statements. Section 07

11. Pension arrangements
As the Staff and ‘B’ defined benefit schemes are run for the Carillion Group as a whole, the Company is unable to identify its share
of the schemes’ assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes are
accounted for by the Company separately as if the schemes were defined contribution schemes. Details of the Group’s pension
schemes are disclosed in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
12. Share-based payments
The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to purchase
shares in the entity. Details of the Group’s share option programme are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements
and in the Remuneration Report on page 31.

Shareholder Information
Dividends 
Dividends are normally paid twice a year. The proposed final
dividend in respect of the year to 31 December 2006 will be
payable on 22 June 2007 to those shareholders on the register 
on 27 April 2007. 
A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) will also be offered.
For those shareholders who prefer not to participate in the DRIP ,
arrangements can be made to pay your dividends automatically
into your bank or building society account. This service has a
number of benefits:
– there is no chance of the dividend cheque going missing 
in the post;
– the dividend payment is received more quickly as the cash is 
paid directly into your account on the payment date without 
the need to wait for the cheque to clear; and
– you will help Carillion to improve its efficiency by reducing
printing and cheque clearing costs.
If you wish to register for this service please call Lloyds TSB
Registrars on the number detailed below to request a dividend
mandate form.

ShareGift
ShareGift is a charity share donation scheme for shareholders,
administered by the Orr Mackintosh Foundation. It is especially for
those who may wish to dispose of a small parcel of shares whose
value makes it uneconomic to sell on a commission basis. Further
information can be obtained at www.sharegift.org or from Lloyds
TSB Registrars.
Warning to Shareholders
Over the last year many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically
from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering
to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares
in US or UK investments. They can be very persistent and extremely
persuasive and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) has reported that the average amount lost by investors is
around £20,000. It is not just the novice investors that has been
duped in this way; many of the victims had been successfully
investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very 
wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
– Make sure you get the correct name of the person and
organisation; 
– Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before
getting involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register; 
– The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised
overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK
investors and any approach from such organisations should 
be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date
and any other appropriate action can be considered. If you
deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online
form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/
overseas.shtml;
– Inform Lloyds TSB Registrars on 0870 600 3953 who will 
record the details and pass them to Carillion who will liaise 
with the FSA.
Details of any shareholding facilities that the Company endorses
will be included in company mailings.

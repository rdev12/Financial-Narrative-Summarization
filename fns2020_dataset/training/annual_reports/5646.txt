Directors’	 Report
The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 9 Business	 Review	|	What	 We	 Do Vision 2015
Delivering	 balanced,	
profitable	 growth	
from	 the	 manufacture	
of	 millions	 of	 plastic,	
fibre	 and	 foam	
components
site	 in	 Albany,	 US.	 And	 in	 Filter	 Products	 we	 relocated	 the	 divisional	 	
head	 office	 to	 Singapore	 from	 the	 UK	 to	 be	 closer	 to	 its	 main	 markets.
Combined	 with	 rigorous	 control	 of	 our	 cost	 base,	 we	 are	 looking	 to	 	
this	 volume-driven	 revenue	 growth	 to	 fuel	 gross	 margin	 expansion.	 	
This	 will	 provide	 us	 with	 the	 capability	 to	 re-invest	 in	 sales,	 marketing	 &	
innovation	 to	 drive	 future	 revenue	 growth,	 as	 well	 as	 delivering	 continued	
improvement	 in	 profitability.	 With	 an	 equally	 keen	 eye	 on	 the	 Company’s	
financing	 and	 fiscal	 positions,	 we	 intend	 that	 our	 earnings	 growth	 is	
supported	 on	 all	 fronts.
Focusing	 on	 cash	 flow
A	 key	 measure	 of	 the	 success	 of	 Vision	 2015	 will	 be	 our	 ability	 to	 translate	
profitability	 into	 cash,	 and	 the	 strategy	 targets	 conversion	 in	 excess	 of	
100%.	 While	 we	 look	 to	 the	 underlying	 profitability	 of	 the	 Company	 to	 	
be	 the	 key	 driver	 of	 cash	 generation,	 the	 objective	 is	 to	 supplement	 that	
with	 further	 improvements	 in	 our	 net	 working	 capital	 position.	
Our	 strong	 cash	 generation	 continues	 to	 enable	 us	 to	 invest	 in	 the	 	
business.	 In	 2011,	 we	 completed	 a	 number	 of	 successful	 projects	 	
including:	 the	 expansion	 of	 taggant	 manufacturing	 at	 our	 Coated	 	
&	 Security	 Products	 site	 at	 Banbury,	 UK;	 the	 move	 to	 a	 new	 custom-	
built	 facility	 in	 Bangkok,	 Thailand	 for	 our	 Filthai	 Filter	 Products	 operation;	
ongoing	 construction	 of	 a	 new	 facility	 for	 MSI	 in	 Houston,	 US	 which	 is	 	
on	 track	 for	 completion	 by	 the	 second	 quarter	 of	 2012;	 and	 further	
capacity	 expansion	 at	 the	 St.	 Charles,	 US	 foam	 site	 for	 medical	 wound	 	
care	 products.	 We	 have	 similarly	 taken	 the	 opportunity	 to	 invest	 in	
upgrading	 or	 adding	 equipment	 and	 machinery,	 to	 ensure	 that	 our	
manufacturing	 productivity	 and	 efficiency	 supports	 our	 future	 growth	
objectives.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 we	 have	 looked	 to	 streamline	 the	 business	
where	 appropriate,	 including	 the	 divestment	 of	 the	 FractureCode	 track	 	
and	 trace	 business	 from	 Coated	 &	 Security	 Products	 and	 the	 relocation	 	
of	 filter	 manufacturing	 from	 Monterrey,	 Mexico	 to	 our	 expanded	 facility	 	
at	 Greensboro,	 US.	 Over	 and	 above	 these	 capital	 investments,	 we	 are	
committed	 to	 returning	 cash	 to	 our	 shareholders	 through	 a	 progressive	
dividend	 policy.	
Following	 my	 appointment	 as	 Chief	 Executive	 of	 Filtrona	 on	 1	 April	 2011,	 	
I	 undertook	 a	 detailed	 review	 of	 the	 entire	 Company	 and	 its	 operations	
over	 the	 following	 months.	 What	 I	 found	 was	 a	 business	 that	 was	 essentially	 	
in	 good	 shape	 and	 doing	 many	 good	 things,	 with	 an	 international	 footprint,	 	
leading	 market	 positions	 and	 a	 loyal,	 experienced	 workforce:	 in	 essence,	
a	 business	 that	 was	 solid,	 steady	 and	 stable.	 This	 was	 a	 position	 on	 which	 	
I	 believed	 we	 could	 build.	 As	 a	 result,	 at	 the	 time	 of	 our	 half	 year	 results	
in	 August,	 we	 set	 out	 a	 more	 ambitious	 strategy	 for	 the	 Company	 for	
the	 next	 three	 financial	 years.	 It	 looks	 to	 build	 on	 the	 positive	 features	
and	 values	 which	 I	 inherited,	 while	 rekindling	 an	 appetite	 for	 growth	
behind	 key	 objectives	 and	 targets,	 and	 creating	 a	 more	 unified	 culture	
across	 the	 organisation.	 We	 have	 called	 this	 strategy	 Vision	 2015.	
Creating	 a	 virtuous	 circle	 financial	 model
From	 a	 financial	 perspective,	 Vision	 2015	 calls	 for	 balanced,	 profitable	
organic	 growth:	 a	 top-down	 model	 with	 an	 emphasis	 on	 strong	
performance	 across	 the	 board,	 rather	 than	 placing	 undue	 reliance	 	
on	 one	 particular	 metric	 to	 drive	 the	 Company’s	 results.
Filtrona	 is	 a	 high	 volume	 manufacturer,	 supplier	 and	 distributor	 of	 	
essential	 components,	 producing	 millions	 of	 units	 every	 day.	 As	 such	 	
we	 have	 looked	 to	 re-position	 the	 business	 to	 focus	 on	 revenue	 growth,	
with	 volume	 as	 the	 key	 driver.	 And	 we	 are	 already	 delivering	 against	 this	
objective,	 with	 like-for-like	 revenue	 ahead	 8%	 in	 2011	 of	 which	 volume	
growth	 represented	 6%.	 This	 revenue	 growth	 has	 come	 from	 both	 	
a	 product	 and	 a	 geographic	 perspective.	 In	 terms	 of	 products,	 we	 are	
broadening	 our	 offering	 to	 reach	 new	 end-markets	 and	 have	 stepped	 	
up	 our	 innovations	 to	 our	 customers:	 for	 example,	 in	 2011	 our	 Coated	 	
&	 Security	 Products	 division	 introduced	 a	 new	 opening	 solution	 in	 the	 	
US	 food	 market,	 while	 Porous	 Technologies	 launched	 a	 new	 range	 of	
hydrophilic	 polyurethane	 foams	 for	 advanced	 wound	 care	 applications.	
And	 in	 terms	 of	 geography,	 we	 have	 continued	 to	 increase	 our	 penetration	
in	 existing	 markets,	 while	 there	 was	 further	 investment	 with	 a	 particular	
focus	 on	 faster-growing	 economies.	 Growth	 in	 the	 Protection	 &	 Finishing

Directors’	 Report
The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 11 Business	 Review	|	Chief	 Executive’s	 Review
Our	 vision A	 measured	 approach	 to	 acquisition	 opportunities
Vision	 2015	 seeks	 to	 complement	 balanced,	 organic	 growth	 with	 value-	
adding	 acquisitions	 across	 the	 Company	 and	 in	 2011	 we	 announced	 	
two	 transactions,	 both	 in	 our	 Protection	 &	 Finishing	 Products	 division.	 	
In	 September,	 we	 completed	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Reid	 Supply	 Company	 for	
up	 to	 US$32m,	 a	 leading	 distributor	 of	 standard	 industrial	 components,	
including	 hardware,	 handles,	 clamps	 and	 fasteners	 to	 a	 wide	 range	 of	
markets	 and	 customers.	 And	 then	 in	 late	 December,	 we	 completed	 the	
acquisition	 of	 Richco,	 Inc.	 for	 US$110m,	 a	 leading	 international	 designer,	
manufacturer	 and	 distributor	 of	 engineered	 plastic	 and	 elastomeric	
solutions	 for	 fastening	 and	 cable	 management	 applications	 in	 diverse	 	
and	 growing	 end-markets.	 In	 order	 to	 support	 our	 growth	 strategy	 	
we	 successfully	 refinanced	 our	 bank	 facilities	 during	 the	 year,	 and	 put	 	
in	 place	 competitively-priced	 £330m	 sterling	 and	 euro-denominated	 	
five-year	 revolving	 credit	 facilities.
Subsequent	 to	 the	 year	 end,	 we	 announced	 the	 acquisition	 of	 100%	 	
of	 the	 share	 capital	 of	 Securit	 World	 Ltd	 for	 a	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £6m.	
UK-based	 Securit	 distributes	 desktop	 personal	 identification	 card	 systems,	
and	 will	 be	 reported	 under	 our	 Coated	 &	 Security	 Products	 division.
We	 seek	 to	 balance	 our	 measured	 approach	 to	 acquisition	 opportunities	
with	 a	 continued	 strong	 return	 on	 average	 invested	 capital.
Developing	 the	 right	 organisational	 structure
Key	 to	 delivering	 long-term	 value	 to	 our	 shareholders	 is	 the	 continued	
development,	 skills	 and	 commitment	 of	 Filtrona	 employees	 across	 the	
world.	 It	 is	 also	 essential	 that	 we	 have	 the	 appropriate	 leadership	 across	 	
the	 Company	 to	 drive	 our	 Vision	 2015	 strategic	 objectives.	 With	 that	 	
in	 mind,	 we	 established	 the	 Group	 Management	 Committee	 (“GMC”)	 	
to	 replace	 the	 previous	 Executive	 and	 Group	 Operating	 Committees,	 	
to	 promote	 a	 more	 streamlined	 and	 co-ordinated	 decision-making	 	
process.	 In	 addition,	 in	 order	 to	 strengthen	 the	 organisational	 structure,	 	
we	 created	 three	 new	 GMC	 roles:	 the	 positions	 of	 Corporate	 Development	
Director,	 Corporate	 Affairs	 Director	 and	 Group	 Commercial	 Director.	 We	
also	 established	 a	 Group	 Leadership	 Team	 (“GLT”),	 being	 the	 Company’s	
most	 senior	 executives	 and	 drawn	 from	 our	 four	 business	 divisions	 and	 	
the	 corporate	 head	 office,	 as	 well	 as	 comprising	 members	 of	 the	 GMC.
During	 the	 year,	 we	 also	 re-aligned	 and	 simplified	 the	 organisational	
structure	 within	 each	 of	 our	 four	 divisions,	 to	 focus	 and	 improve	 	
our	 go-to-market	 strategy,	 to	 optimise	 operational	 benefits	 and	 	
potential	 synergies	 from	 the	 integration	 of	 certain	 processes,	 and	 	
to	 improve	 accountability.	
We	 are	 committed	 to	 ensuring	 Filtrona	 is	 viewed	 as	 an	 employer	 	
of	 choice,	 in	 order	 to	 ensure	 the	 attraction	 and	 retention	 of	 suitably	
motivated,	 experienced	 and	 skilled	 personnel.	 As	 an	 international	
organisation,	 it	 is	 important	 that	 we	 attract	 an	 appropriate	 level	 	
of	 local	 talent,	 and	 to	 support	 both	 our	 recruitment	 efforts	 and	 	
the	 career	 development	 of	 our	 employees,	 we	 are	 establishing	 	
a	 divisional	 human	 resources	 infrastructure	 including	 investing	 	
in	 a	 dedicated	 IT	 system.	
Taken	 together,	 these	 two	 developments	 are	 aimed	 at	 better	 identifying	
talent	 and	 employment	 opportunities	 within	 the	 Company,	 facilitating	
mobility	 both	 geographically	 and	 between	 divisions,	 and	 improving	
succession	 planning	 at	 all	 levels.	 In	 2011,	 we	 also	 expanded	 the	 Filtrona	
Graduate	 Development	 Programme	 and	 the	 Group	 Management	
Development	 Programme	 from	 Anglo-American	 schemes,	 to	 include	
participants	 from	 our	 other	 international	 sites.	 It	 is	 anticipated	 that	 	
these	 programmes	 will	 be	 broadened	 further	 in	 2012.
Our	 overriding	 commitment	 remains	 the	 health,	 safety	 and	 welfare	 of	 our	
employees	 and	 all	 those	 who	 visit	 our	 operations.	 And	 notwithstanding	 	
the	 progress	 we	 have	 made	 in	 previous	 years,	 we	 continued	 to	 see	 further	
improvement	 in	 2011:	 the	 total	 accident	 trend	 declined	 and	 we	 saw	 a	
reduction	 in	 lost-time	 accidents	 in	 all	 four	 divisions.	 Indeed,	 against	 more	
stringent	 requirements	 in	 2011	 versus	 2010,	 seven	 of	 our	 sites	 received	 a	
Gold	 ranking	 in	 the	 Filtrona	 Health	 &	 Safety	 Awards,	 with	 a	 further	 nine	
achieving	 Silver	 status;	 had	 the	 criteria	 remained	 unchanged	 year-on-year,	
some	 50	 per	 cent	 of	 our	 facilities	 would	 have	 been	 received	 Gold	 awards.
Our	 responsibilities
At	 the	 heart	 of	 our	 Vision	 2015	 strategy	 is	 a	 commitment	 to	 the	 highest	
standards	 of	 corporate	 governance	 and	 responsibility,	 to	 ensure	 that	 	
the	 way	 in	 which	 we	 manage	 our	 activities	 reflects	 the	 expectations	 of	 	
all	 the	 Company’s	 stakeholders.	 As	 a	 member	 of	 both	 the	 FTSE4Good	
Index	 and	 the	 Carbon	 Trust,	 we	 recognise	 that	 our	 interaction	 with	 	
the	 environment	 and	 local	 communities	 is	 a	 critical	 component	 of	 the	
international	 reputation	 of	 Filtrona’s	 businesses	 and	 the	 quality	 of	 the	
Company’s	 respective	 brands,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 cornerstone	 of	 developing	 	
a	 responsible,	 progressive	 and	 winning	 culture.
All	 our	 principal	 manufacturing	 facilities	 hold	 the	 ISO	 14001	 environmental	
accreditation	 and,	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 recently-acquired	 sites	 (which,	 	
per	 Filtrona	 policy,	 have	 a	 period	 of	 24	 months	 to	 reach	 the	 required	
standard),	 they	 have	 also	 achieved	 the	 Occupational	 Health	 &	 Safety	
Management	 Systems	 OHSAS	 18001.	 In	 respect	 of	 the	 latter,	 our	 	
Jarrow	 site	 attained	 the	 standard	 in	 2011	 as	 targeted,	 while	 the	 BP	 Labels	
(rebranded	 as	 Payne	 Cardiff)	 and	 Stera	 Tape	 sites	 acquired	 in	 2010	 are	 	
both	 making	 progress	 towards	 its	 achievement.	 The	 Company	 also	 	
applies	 a	 standardised	 process	 to	 review	 its	 distribution	 sites	 and	 	
to	 award	 certificates	 of	 Compliance,	 Merit	 or	 Excellence.	 During	 the	 	
year,	 14 sites	 were	 assessed,	 all	 of	 which	 achieved	 an	 Excellent	 rating.
During	 the	 year,	 Filtrona	 was	 ranked	 equal	 first	 by	 the	 UK’s	 Environment	
Agency	 in	 the	 first	 Carbon	 Reduction	 Commitment	 Performance	 League	
Table.	 This	 league	 table	 is	 based	 on	 early	 actions	 that	 participating	
companies	 have	 taken	 to	 demonstrate	 their	 commitment	 to	 energy	
efficiency	 within	 their	 organisations,	 and	 is	 a	 direct	 result	 of	 the	 early	 	
action	 we	 began	 in	 2010	 under	 the	 auspices	 of	 our	 Health,	 Safety	 &	
Environment	 Council,	 including	 achieving	 the	 Carbon	 Trust	 Standard	 	
at	 all	 of	 our	 principal	 UK	 manufacturing	 sites.	
Over	 and	 above	 the	 Company’s	 carbon	 emissions,	 we	 have	 made	 further	
progress	 on	 reducing	 the	 environmental	 impact	 of	 our	 business	 in	 other	
aspects,	 with	 our	 water	 use	 and	 the	 amount	 of	 waste	 sent	 to	 landfill	
showing	 reductions	 versus	 2010	 levels.
12 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011
Chief	 Executive’s	 Review	 continued This	 year	 the	 Group	 environmental	 award	 was	 given	 to	 Payne	 India,	 whose	
submission	 demonstrated	 a	 commitment	 to	 energy	 and	 carbon	 reduction	
which,	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 strongly	 supported	 the	 local	 community.	 And	 	
I	 was	 likewise	 very	 pleased	 to	 present	 the	 2011	 Chief	 Executive’s	 Special	
Award	 to	 the	 Porous	 Technologies’	 Richmond,	 US	 site	 for	 its	 development	
of	 a	 recycle	 extruder.	 The	 extruder	 converts	 manufacturing	 waste	 into	
usable	 material	 for	 writing	 instrument	 reservoirs,	 and	 allows	 the	 production	
of	 an	 eco	 cartridge	 made	 from	 100%	 recycled	 materials.	
In	 summary
2011	 was	 a	 strong	 year	 for	 Filtrona,	 and	 one	 in	 which	 we	 have	 already	
started	 to	 make	 good	 progress	 towards	 our	 Vision	 2015	 objectives.	 And	 I	
would	 like	 to	 thank	 all	 our	 employees	 for	 their	 continued	 commitment	 and	
diligent	 efforts	 to	 deliver	 these	 results	 during	 a	 period	 of	 leadership	 change.
Our	 international	 footprint,	 combined	 with	 the	 diversity	 of	 our	 products	
and	 end-markets,	 provides	 Filtrona	 with	 a	 degree	 of	 defensiveness	 in	 	
what	 remains	 an	 uncertain	 economic	 backdrop.	 So,	 consistent	 with	 the	
more	 ambitious	 initiatives	 which	 underpin	 our	 Vision	 2015	 strategy,	 we	 	
are	 well	 positioned	 to	 deliver	 further	 balanced,	 profitable	 growth	 in	 2012,	 	
and	 anticipate	 that	 each	 of	 our	 four	 operating	 divisions	 will	 contribute	 	
to	 the	 overall	 performance	 of	 the	 Company.
As	 a	 result,	 we	 are	 aiming	 to	 continue	 to	 make	 progress	 towards	 our	 	
Vision 2015	 objectives	 of	 at	 least	 mid	 single-digit	 like-for-like	 revenue	
growth	 and	 double-digit	 adjusted	 earnings	 per	 share	 growth	 at	 	
constant	 exchange	 rates.

Foreign exchange rates 
Movements	 in	 exchange	 rates	 relative	 to	 sterling	 affect	 actual	 results	 as	
reported.	 The	 constant	 exchange	 rate	 basis	 adjusts	 the	 comparative	 to	
exclude	 such	 movements,	 to	 show	 the	 underlying	 growth	 of	 the	 Company.
For	 the	 principal	 exchange	 rates	 for	 Filtrona	 for	 the	 year	 ended	
31 December	 2011	 (“FY	 2011”),	 see	 the	 table	 opposite.	 Re-translating	 	
at	 FY	 2011	 average	 exchange	 rates	 reduces	 the	 prior	 year	 revenue	 	
and	 adjusted	 operating	 profit	 by	 £2.9m	 and	 £0.8m	 respectively.
Like-for-like basis
The	 term	 “like-for-like”	 describes	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 business	 	
on	 a	 comparable	 basis,	 adjusting	 for	 the	 impact	 of	 acquisitions,	 	
disposals	 and	 foreign	 exchange.	 The	 FY	 2011	 results	 include	 the	 results	 	
of	 BP	 Labels	 (acquired	 on	 26	 February	 2010),	 Stera	 Tape	 (acquired	 on	
22 November	 2010),	 Reid	 Supply	 Company	 (acquired	 on	 6	 September	
2011),	 Richco,	 Inc.	 (acquired	 on	 21	 December	 2011)	 and	 FractureCode	
(divested	 on	 28	 July	 2011).
Adjusted basis
The	 term	 “adjusted”	 excludes	 the	 impact	 of	 intangible	 amortisation	 and	
exceptional	 operating	 items,	 less	 any	 associated	 tax	 relief.	 In	 FY	 2011,	
intangible	 amortisation	 was	 £3.7m	 (2010:	 £3.0m),	 and	 there	 was	 an	
exceptional	 pre-tax	 charge	 of	 £8.2m	 (2010:	 £nil)	 mainly	 relating	 to	
integration	 costs	 and	 fees	 arising	 from	 the	 acquisitions	 of	 Reid	 Supply	
Company	 and	 Richco,	 Inc.,	 and	 other	 net	 costs	 arising	 from	 further	
reconfiguration	 of	 the	 Company.
Trading performance
Full	 year	 revenue	 was	 10.4%	 ahead	 of	 the	 prior	 year	 (+11.1%	 at	 constant	
exchange	 rates)	 at	 £540.7m,	 with	 like-for-like	 growth	 of	 8.0%.	 The	 gross	
margin	 rose	 80bps	 (at	 both	 constant	 and	 actual	 exchange)	 to	 35.7%,	
benefiting	 from	 successful	 pricing	 programmes	 to	 mitigate	 input	 cost	
increases,	 ongoing	 operational	 improvement	 initiatives	 and	 a	 positive	
product	 mix.
On	 an	 adjusted	 basis,	 operating	 profit	 was	 ahead	 12.7%	 (+13.9%	 at	
constant	 exchange	 rates)	 at	 £84.5m,	 equating	 to	 a	 30bps	 uplift	 in	 the	
margin	 to	 15.6%	 (+40bps	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates).	 Operating	 profit	 	
as	 reported	 was	 £72.6m,	 0.8%	 higher	 than	 last	 year	 (+2.0%	 at	 constant	
exchange	 rates).
Net finance expense
Net	 finance	 expense	 was	 £8.3m,	 a	 £2.1m	 decrease	 versus	 FY	 2010.
The	 net	 interest	 charge	 on	 net	 debt	 decreased	 to	 £8.6m	 (2010:	 £9.1m),	
primarily	 as	 a	 result	 of	 lower	 average	 debt	 levels	 during	 the	 year.	 The	
amortisation	 of	 bank	 fees	 decreased	 to	 £0.8m	 (2010:	 £2.5m),	 the	 IAS 19	
(Revised)	 pension	 finance	 credit	 of	 £1.2m	 was	 higher	 (2010:	 £0.6m),	 	
while	 other	 interest	 expense	 was	 £0.1m	 (2010:	 income	 of	 £0.6m).
Tax
The	 effective	 tax	 rate	 on	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 and	 tax	 was	 	
30.4%	 (2010:	 31.0%).
Net income
Adjusted	 net	 income	 was	 up	 18.8%	 (+20.4%	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates)	
to	 £53.0m.	 On	 a	 reported	 basis,	 net	 income	 of	 £42.4m	 decreased	 0.2%	
(increased	 1.2%	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates).
Earnings per share
On	 an	 adjusted	 basis,	 earnings	 per	 share	 from	 continuing	 operations	
increased	 19.5%	 (+21.3%	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates)	 to	 25.1p.	 	
Basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 from	 continuing	 operations,	 as	 reported,	 	
was	 20.0p,	 level	 with	 last	 year	 (+1.5%	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates).

objective	 of	 balanced,	 profitable	
growth,	 complemented

Fully	 diluted	 adjusted	 earnings	 per	 share	 of	 24.3p	 was	 up	 18.0%	 	
(+19.7%	 ahead	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates).
Dividends
The	 Board	 of	 Directors	 recommends	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 7.2p	 per	 share	
(2010:	 6.0p),	 an	 increase	 of	 20.0%.	 This	 takes	 the	 FY	 2011	 dividend	 	
to	 10.5p	 per	 share	 (+16.7%	 versus	 FY	 2010).
Net working capital
Net	 working	 capital	 is	 defined	 as	 “inventories	 plus	 trade	 &	 other	 	
receivables	 less	 trade	 &	 other	 payables,	 adjusted	 to	 exclude	 deferred	
consideration	 receivable	 /	 payable,	 interest	 accruals	 /	 capital	 payables	 	
and	 other	 normalising	 items”.
Net	 working	 capital	 of	 £71.1m	 was	 marginally	 higher	 than	 the	
31 December	 2010	 level	 of	 £70.0m.	 The	 net	 working	 capital	 /	 	
revenue	 ratio	 was	 13.1%	 (2010:	 14.2%	 at	 constant	 exchange).
Cash flow
Operating	 cash	 flow	 increased	 23.8%	 to	 £92.7m	 (2010:	 £74.9m).	 	
This	 included	 an	 inflow	 of	 working	 capital	 for	 the	 year	 of	 £7.9m	 	
(2010:	 outflow	 of	 £5.1m)	 and	 gross	 capital	 expenditure	 of	 £27.0m	 	
(2010:	 £20.1m),	 with	 net	 capital	 expenditure	 at	 £26.8m	 (2010:	 	
£18.8m).	 Net	 capital	 expenditure	 equated	 to	 129%	 (2010:	 92%)	 	
of	 the	 depreciation	 charge	 for	 the	 year	 of	 £20.7m	 (2010:	 £20.4m).	
Net	 interest	 paid	 was	 £9.1m	 (2010:	 £8.0m)	 and	 tax	 payments	 increased	 	
by	 £5.3m	 to	 £21.6m	 (2010:	 £16.3m).	 The	 outflow	 in	 respect	 of	 pension	
obligations	 decreased	 to	 £8.3m	 (2010:	 £10.1m).	 Free	 cash	 flow	 of	 	
£53.7m	 (2010:	 £40.5m)	 was	 up	 32.6%.	
Net debt
Net	 debt	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 period	 was	 £144.9m,	 an	 increase	 of	 £54.1m	
from	 1	 January	 2011.	 This	 reflected	 free	 cash	 flow	 of	 £53.7m,	 offset	 	
by	 dividends	 totalling	 £19.1m,	 net	 acquisitions	 of	 £86.6m	 and	 foreign	
exchange	 and	 other	 inflows.
The	 Company’s	 financial	 ratios	 remain	 strong.	 The	 ratio	 of	 net	 debt	 	
to	 EBITDA	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2011	 was	 1.4x	 (31	 December	 2010:	 	
0.9x)	 and	 interest	 cover	 was	 9.3x	 (31	 December	 2010:	 7.1x).
Balance sheet 
At	 the	 end	 of	 2011,	 the	 Company	 had	 shareholders’	 funds	 of	 £207.0m	
(2010:	 £187.8m),	 an	 increase	 of	 10.2%.	 Net	 debt	 was	 £144.9m	 (2010:	
£90.8m)	 and	 total	 capital	 employed	 in	 the	 business	 was	 £358.3m	 	
(2010:	 £288.2m).
This	 finances	 non-current	 assets	 of	 £362.5m	 (2010:	 £267.7m),	 of	 which	
£168.1m	 (2010:	 £156.1m)	 is	 tangible	 fixed	 assets,	 the	 remainder	 being	
intangible	 assets,	 deferred	 tax	 assets	 and	 other	 receivables.	 The	 Company	
has	 net	 working	 capital	 of	 £71.1m	 (2010:	 £70.0m),	 current	 provisions	 of	
£12.8m	 (2010:	 £2.9m)	 and	 long-term	 liabilities	 other	 than	 borrowings	 of	
£41.3m	 (2010:	 £33.3m).	 The	 return	 on	 average	 invested	 capital	 (including	
intangibles)	 was	 23.6%	 (2010:	 21.6%),	 driven	 by	 higher	 profits	 in	 the	 year.
Pensions
As	 at	 31	 December	 2011,	 the	 Company’s	 IAS	 19	 (Revised)	 gross	 pension	
liability	 was	 £24.0m	 (2010:	 £17.6m)	 with	 a	 net	 liability	 of	 £16.6m	 (2010:	
£12.4m)	 after	 accounting	 for	 a	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 of	 £7.4m	 (2010:	 £5.2m).	
The	 deficit	 has	 been	 calculated	 after	 updating	 the	 asset	 values	 and	 certain	
assumptions	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2011.
Treasury policy and controls
Filtrona	 has	 a	 centralised	 treasury	 department	 to	 control	 external	
borrowings	 and	 manage	 exchange	 rate	 risk.	 Treasury	 policies	 are	 	
approved	 by	 the	 Board	 and	 cover	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 exposure	 to	 be	 	
hedged,	 the	 types	 of	 financial	 investments	 that	 may	 be	 employed	 	
and	 the	 criteria	 for	 investing	 and	 borrowing	 cash.	 The	 Company	 	
uses	 derivatives	 only	 to	 manage	 foreign	 currency	 and	 interest	 rate	 	
risk	 arising	 from	 underlying	 business	 activities.	 No	 transactions	 of	 	
a	 speculative	 nature	 are	 undertaken.	 The	 department	 is	 subject	 to	
independent	 reviews	 by	 the	 Group	 Assurance	 department.	 Underlying	
policy	 assumptions	 and	 activities	 are	 reviewed	 by	 the	 Executive	 Directors.
Controls	 over	 exposure	 changes	 and	 transaction	 authenticity	 are	 in	 	
place,	 and	 dealings	 are	 restricted	 to	 those	 banks	 with	 the	 relevant	
combination	 of	 geographical	 presence	 and	 suitable	 credit	 rating.	 	
Filtrona	 monitors	 the	 credit	 ratings	 of	 its	 counterparties	 and	 credit	 	
exposure	 to	 each	 counterparty.	
Foreign exchange risk
The	 majority	 of	 Filtrona’s	 net	 assets	 are	 in	 currencies	 other	 than	 	
sterling.	 The	 Company’s	 normal	 policy	 is	 to	 limit	 the	 transaction	 	
exposure	 and	 the	 resulting	 impact	 on	 shareholders’	 funds	 by	 borrowing	 	
in	 those	 currencies	 in	 which	 the	 Company	 has	 significant	 net	 assets.	 	
As	 at	 31 December	 2011,	 Filtrona’s	 US	 dollar-denominated	 assets	 were	
approximately	 59%	 hedged	 by	 its	 US	 dollar-denominated	 borrowings,	
while	 its	 euro-denominated	 assets	 were	 approximately	 92%	 hedged	 	
by	 its	 euro-denominated	 borrowings.
The	 Company	 does	 not	 hedge	 the	 translation	 effect	 of	 exchange	 rate	
movements	 on	 the	 income	 statement.
The	 majority	 of	 Filtrona’s	 transactions	 are	 carried	 out	 in	 the	 functional	
currencies	 of	 its	 operations,	 and	 so	 transaction	 exposure	 is	 limited.	 	
However,	 where	 they	 do	 occur,	 the	 Company’s	 policy	 is	 to	 hedge	 	
the	 exposures	 as	 soon	 as	 they	 are	 committed	 using	 forward	 foreign	
exchange	 contracts.

How	 we	 do	 it
Our	 objective	 is	 to	 leverage	 our	 extensive	
product	 range	 and	 geographic	 distribution	
capability,	 using	 our	 efficient	 sourcing	 and	
manufacturing	 operations	 and	 sophisticated	 	
IT	 platform,	 to	 respond	 to	 the	 demands	 	
of	 our	 diverse	 international	 customer	 base.	 	
Our	 tool	 library	 and	 production	 experience,	 	
along	 with	 our	 inventory	 logistics	 structure,	 	
is	 a	 unique	 asset.	 We	 have	 strong	 business	 to	
business	 marketing	 expertise	 –	 electronic,	 web	
based	 and	 physical	 –	 and	 support	 this	 with	 a	
number	 of	 comprehensive	 product	 catalogues	
available	 in	 many	 languages	 and	 online.	
We	 target	 organic	 growth	 opportunities	 	
through	 increasing	 the	 range	 and	 availability	 	
of	 our	 products,	 and	 by	 network	 expansion	 	
into	 new	 international	 territories	 and	 growing	
density	 within	 existing	 territories.	 Driving	 	
an	 increased	 number	 of	 transactions	 from	 	
a	 growing	 customer	 and	 product	 base,	 while	
focusing	 on	 the	 further	 reduction	 of	 transaction	
costs,	 is	 a	 key	 objective	 for	 our	 continued	
success.	 The	 division	 continues	 to	 seek	 out	
acquisition	 opportunities,	 which	 can	 move	 	
us	 into	 complementary	 product	 categories	 	
or	 further	 our	 distribution	 capability.

over	 an	 area	 of	
37,200	 square	 feet	
which	 maximises	
distribution	 and	
service	 requirements
How	 we	 performed	 in	 2011
Revenue	 increased	 27.5%	 (at	 constant	 exchange)
to	 £163.0m,	 with	 like-for-like	 growth	 of	 16.4%	
driven	 by	 range	 development,	 new	 customer	 	
wins	 and	 continued	 improvement	 in	 marketing	
effectiveness.	 The	 results	 were	 boosted	 by	 the	
inclusion	 of	 a	 full	 year	 contribution	 from	 Stera	
Tape,	 as	 well	 as	 four	 months	 from	 Reid	 Supply.
The	 component	 distribution	 businesses	 of	 	
Moss,	 Skiffy	 and	 Alliance	 each	 delivered	 record	
levels	 of	 revenue,	 and	 broad-based	 growth	
across	 geographies	 and	 key	 end-market	 sectors.	 	
The	 move	 to	 larger	 distribution	 warehousing	
operations	 in	 Brazil	 and	 Poland	 supported	 the	
performance	 and	 presence	 in	 these	 growing	
markets,	 while	 revenue	 from	 Moss	 China	 more	
than	 doubled	 during	 the	 year.	 Alliance	 Express	
Albany	 was	 opened	 in	 the	 second	 half	 of	 2011,	
and	 the	 Duraco	 operations	 established	 in	 China	
and	 Los	 Angeles	 both	 performed	 well.	 The	
integration	 of	 Stera	 Tape	 proceeded	 in	 line	 with	
expectations,	 and	 the	 launch	 of	 Stera	 Tape	
products	 in	 the	 US	 has	 been	 completed.
Following	 a	 strong	 performance	 in	 2010,	 	
MSI	 delivered	 another	 record	 result	 in	 2011.	
During	 the	 year,	 we	 also	 progressed	 with	 	
the	 construction	 of	 a	 new	 130,000	 sq.	 ft.	 	
factory	 at	 MSI	 in	 Houston,	 US,	 to	 increase	 	
our	 capacity	 and	 to	 build	 on	 our	 excellent	
positioning	 in	 the	 oil	 country	 tubular	 goods	
market.	 Construction	 of	 this	 facility	 remains	 	
on	 track	 to	 be	 operational	 by	 the	 second	 	
quarter	 of	 2012.
Continued	 focus	 on	 efficient	 marketing	
investment	 and	 activity,	 particularly	 the	
increasing	 use	 of	 electronic	 marketing	 media,	
delivered	 strong	 lead	 indicators	 versus	 the	 	
prior	 year:	 marketing	 responses	 were	 up	 	
12.4%,	 and	 the	 number	 of	 live	 accounts	 	
at	 the	 end	 of	 2011	 increased	 to	 over	 120,000,	
partially	 boosted	 by	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Reid	 	
and	 Richco.	 Revenue	 from	 higher	 margin	
proprietary	 products	 increased	 to	 74%	 (on	 a	
comparable	 basis,	 excluding	 Reid)	 from	 71%.	 	
To	 support	 the	 future	 growth	 of	 the	 division,	 	
the	 focus	 on	 driving	 the	 e-commerce	 strategy	
was	 successfully	 reinforced	 during	 the	 year.	
During	 the	 year,	 we	 merged	 our	 Moss,	 Skiffy	 	
and	 Alliance	 businesses	 –	 together	 with	 the	
newly	 acquired	 Reid	 and	 Richco	 –	 into	 a	 single	
component	 distribution	 segment.	 Alongside	 	
MSI	 in	 oil	 and	 gas,	 and	 Duraco	 in	 tapes,	 	
this	 organisational	 structure	 allows	 an	 even	
greater	 focus	 on	 our	 key	 end-markets.
Adjusted	 operating	 profit	 grew	 32.6%	 	
(at	 constant	 exchange)	 to	 £37.8m,	 for	 a	 	
90bps	 uplift	 in	 the	 margin.	 This	 improvement	 	
reflected	 both	 operational	 leverage	 from	 the	
strong	 revenue	 growth,	 as	 well	 as	 operating	 	
and	 process	 efficiencies	 and	 a	 continued	 	
positive	 mix	 effect	 from	 moving	 the	 business	
further	 into	 higher	 margin	 standard	 parts,	
partially	 offset	 by	 the	 dilutive	 impact	 of	 Reid	 	
and	 Stera	 Tape.	
In	 2011,	 we	 made	 two	 exciting	 strategic	
acquisitions:	 Reid	 Supply	 for	 up	 to	 US$32m,	 	
and	 Richco,	 Inc.	 for	 US$110m.	 Reid’s	 excellent	
management	 team	 is	 already	 rapidly	 integrating	
the	 business	 into	 the	 division,	 and	 while	 much	
remains	 to	 be	 done	 we	 are	 excited	 about	 the	
future	 business	 opportunities,	 with	 a	 new	 	
Reid	 catalogue	 launched	 in	 January	 2012.
The	 acquisition	 of	 Richco	 brings	 significant	
benefit	 to	 the	 division,	 both	 in	 product	 	
terms	 and	 from	 a	 geographical	 perspective.	
Richco	 has	 an	 excellent	 range	 of	 proprietary	
products	 in	 diverse	 and	 growing	 end-markets,	
including	 consumer	 electronics,	 industrial	 	
and	 white	 goods	 /	 appliances.	 In	 addition,	 	
with	 over	 60%	 of	 its	 revenue	 generated	 	
in	 Europe	 and	 nearly	 15%	 in	 Asia,	 Richco	 	
provides	 an	 excellent	 opportunity	 to	 	
accelerate	 our	 development,	 particularly	 	
in	 Asia.	 Richco	 also	 takes	 the	 division	 into	 	
Italy	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 a	 traditional	 gap	 in	
our geographic	 footprint.
The	 acquisition	 of	 Reid	 was	 completed	 	
on	 6 September,	 since	 when	 the	 trading	 	
performance	 and	 the	 integration	 of	 the	 	
business	 have	 both	 progressed	 in	 line	 	
with	 expectations.	 The	 acquisition	 of	 	
Richco	 was	 completed	 on	 21 December:	 	
there	 was	 no	 impact	 from	 Richco	 on	 the	 	
trading	 result	 of	 the	 division	 in	 FY	 2011.

Our	 responsibilities
Over	 and	 above	 compliance	 with	 environmental	
standards	 and	 a	 commitment	 to	 reducing	 	
our	 impact	 on	 the	 environment,	 all	 our	 	
divisional	 businesses	 are	 increasingly	 focused	 	
on	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 new	 environmentally-
friendly	 products	 and	 processes	 present	 new	
opportunities	 to	 add	 value	 in	 response	 to	
customer	 demands,	 as	 well	 as	 potentially	
reducing	 costs.	 Indeed,	 notwithstanding	 	
our	 strong	 revenue	 growth	 in	 2011,	 we	 made	 	
further	 significant	 environmental	 improvements	
during	 the	 year,	 with	 a	 double-digit	 percentage	
reduction	 in	 CO
2
	 emissions,	 energy	 use,	 general	
waste	 and	 water	 consumption.
Our	 focus	 is	 on	 the	 fundamental	 objective	 	
of	 securing	 the	 health	 and	 safety	 of	 all	 our	
employees.	 During	 the	 year,	 our	 MSI	 site	 	
in	 Houston,	 US	 again	 achieved	 Gold	 status	 	
in	 the	 Company’s	 Health	 &	 Safety	 Awards	 	
with	 a	 further	 three	 sites	 receiving	 Silver	
accreditation,	 showing	 successful	 achievement	 	
in	 providing	 a	 safer	 and	 healthier	 workplace.	
In	 addition,	 the	 recently-acquired	 Stera	 Tape	
business	 delivered	 significant	 improvement	 	
in	 its	 health	 and	 safety	 metrics	 towards	 our	
divisional	 standards.	 In	 conjunction	 with	 	
our	 comprehensive	 policies	 in	 this	 area,	 	
the	 division	 has	 achieved	 key	 international	
accreditations	 across	 its	 facilities,	 which	 	
are	 detailed	 on	 page 19.

Key	 financial	 highlights
What	 we	 measure Technologies for everyday life
From	 plug-in	 air	 fresheners	 to	 make-up	
applicators,	 office	 supplies	 to	 school	 	
products,	 our	 components	 are	 found	 	
in	 a	 range	 of	 consumer	 products
Who	 we	 are	 and	 what	 we	 do
The	 Porous	 Technologies	 division	 is	 a	 world	
leader	 in	 the	 development	 and	 production	 	
of	 customised	 liquid	 and	 vapour	 handling	
components,	 engineered	 from	 three	 material	
technologies:	 bonded	 fibre,	 polyurethane	 	
foam	 and	 porous	 plastic.
We	 manufacture	 components	 which	 	
serve	 as	 a	 critical	 part	 of	 a	 variety	 	
of	 end-products,	 including	 medical	 	
diagnostic	 devices,	 wound	 care	 products,	 	
writing	 instruments,	 printer	 cartridges,	 	
air	 fresheners	 and	 cosmetic	 applicators.
We	 serve	 customers	 in	 over	 56	 countries	 	
from	 four	 manufacturing	 facilities	 in	 three	
countries,	 each	 of	 which	 houses	 its	 own	 	
product	 development	 and	 commercial	 	
teams.	 Supporting	 the	 division	 globally	 are	 	
two	 R&D	 facilities	 in	 the	 US,	 with	 regional	 	
teams	 supporting	 product	 development	 in	 	
other	 geographies.
How	 we	 do	 it
Our	 objective	 is	 to	 leverage	 our	 technical	
expertise	 in	 collaboration	 with	 our	 customers,	 	
to	 provide	 them	 with	 innovative,	 high	 quality,	
reliable,	 quick-to-market	 solutions	 to	 their	
respective	 fluid	 handling	 challenges.	 The	
division’s	 R&D	 teams	 focus	 on	 each	 of	 our	 	
three	 material	 technologies,	 and	 constantly	
develop	 new	 intellectual	 property	 regarding	
materials,	 processes	 and	 applications,	 with	 a	
view	 to	 providing	 new	 and	 existing	 customers	
with	 unique	 solutions.	 Our	 orientation	 towards	 	
R&D	 further	 enables	 us	 to	 offer	 prototypes	 	
and	 modifications,	 to	 ensure	 components	 	
fit	 perfectly	 to	 our	 customers’	 application.
We	 seek	 to	 use	 our	 global	 footprint	 to	 provide	
our	 customers	 with	 shorter	 lead	 times	 and	
supply	 security.	 As	 our	 multiple	 locations	 utilise	
identical	 proprietary	 processes	 and	 independent	
supply	 chains,	 we	 are	 able	 to	 provide	 a	 reliable	
source	 of	 back-up	 supply	 capability	 around	 the	
world.	 In	 addition,	 our	 global	 outlook	 allows	 	
us	 to	 respond	 to	 the	 differing	 needs	 of	 our	
customers	 in	 differing	 geographies	 and	 cultures.

Quality	 is	 at	 the	 forefront	 of	 the	 division’s

play	 in	 our	 customers’	 end	 products.	 Each	 	
of	 our	 production	 sites	 is	 ISO	 9000:2008	
certified,	 and	 our	 facility	 in	 St.	 Charles,	 US	 	
is	 also	 ISO	 13485:2003	 certified.	 Quality	
laboratories	 at	 each	 of	 our	 facilities	 provide	
consistent	 checks	 throughout	 the	 production	
process,	 to	 assure	 reliability	 and	 satisfaction	 	
to	 our	 customers.	
How	 we	 performed	 in	 2011
Revenue	 increased	 5.6%	 (at	 constant

with	 the	 operating	 margin	 unchanged.	
Revenue	 growth	 of	 40%	 in	 printer	 systems

2012	 key	 initiatives
Revenue	 by	 end-market	 (%)
Revenue	 by	 destination	 (%) The	 remaining	 c.10%	 of	 divisional	 revenue	
comprises	 a	 number	 of	 other	 markets,	 plus	 	
the	 supply	 of	 a	 sophisticated	 filter	 product,	
manufactured	 at	 the	 Porous	 Technologies	
Reinbek,	 Germany	 facility	 and	 sold	 internally	 	
to	 the	 Filter	 Products	 division.	 Excluding	 revenue	
from	 this	 line	 of	 business,	 revenue	 from	 the	 	
core	 technologies,	 products	 and	 markets	 of	 	
the	 Porous	 Technologies	 division	 was	 up	 7%.	
Higher	 raw	 materials	 costs	 were	 successfully	
offset	 through	 waste	 reduction,	 efficiency	
projects	 and	 process	 /	 automation	 conversions.
In	 2011,	 the	 division	 continued	 its	 successful	
track	 record	 of	 converting	 its	 intellectual	
property	 and	 manufacturing	 know-how	 into	
commercial	 success.	 We	 introduced	 a	 range	 of	
next	 generation	 printer	 system	 products	 with	
improved	 designs	 and	 performance.	 We	 also	
commercialised	 next	 generation	 technology	 	
for	 both	 anti-flood	 hCG	 wicks,	 and	 for	 	
trocar	 surgical	 equipment	 which	 is	 used	 in	
keyhole	 procedures	 and	 where	 our	 product	 	
is	 a	 component	 of	 the	 device	 used	 to	 improve	
camera	 optics.	 Additionally,	 we	 developed	 	
and	 commercialised	 new	 wick	 technologies	 	
for	 liquid-based	 insecticide	 repellent	 devices	 	
and	 synthetic	 bamboo	 air	 freshener	 devices	 	
both	 of	 which	 are	 established	 markets,	 but	
where	 our	 replacement	 technology	 provides	 	
a	 number	 of	 customer	 benefits.	 In	 the	 former,	 	
our	 polymer-based	 product	 replaces	 typical	 	
clay	 wicks,	 being	 not	 only	 resilient	 to	 high	
temperatures	 but	 also	 providing	 superior	
performance	 versus	 competing	 technologies.	
And	 in	 the	 latter,	 our	 product	 provides	 more	
consistent	 evaporation	 when	 compared	 to	
bamboo,	 while	 at	 the	 same	 time	 being	 able	 	
to	 be	 manufactured	 in	 a	 variety	 of	 shapes	 	
and	 colours	 to	 accommodate	 customers’	
specifications.	 And	 towards	 the	 end	 of	 the	 	
year,	 we	 introduced	 a	 new	 range	 of	 hydrophilic	
polyurethane	 foams	 for	 advanced	 wound	 	
care,	 including	 ultra-soft,	 highly	 absorbent	
Medisponge
®
	 SuperSoft	 foams	 and	 ultra-
durable,	 fibre-reinforced	 Medisponge
®
	
composite	 foams.	
The	 commercial	 expansion	 of	 products	 using	
porous	 plastics	 is	 ahead	 of	 expectations.	 Similar	
in	 nature	 to	 our	 other	 technologies,	 porous	
plastic	 components	 are	 engineered	 from	 a	
variety	 of	 raw	 materials,	 each	 with	 differing	
properties	 (such	 as	 pore	 size,	 density,	 chemical	
resistance,	 rigidity	 and	 hydrophobicity).	 This	
technology	 allows	 us	 to	 increase	 our	 reach	 	
in	 the	 fluid	 handling	 space,	 accelerating	 our	 	
entry	 into	 new	 markets	 and	 further	 expansion	 	
in	 existing	 markets.	
Research & 
Development
Dedicated	 R&D	
equipment	 and	 a	
quality	 control	 lab	
enable	 the	 delivery	 	
of	 reliable	 solutions	
that	 are	 critical	 to	
end	 products
High performance 
Depth	 filters	 create	
high	 performing	
pipette	 tip	 filters	 with

and	 uniform	 air	 flow
A	 number	 of	 operational	 initiatives	 were	
successfully	 completed	 during	 the	 year,	 	
including	 initiating	 a	 new	 commercial	 site	 	
in	 Singapore	 and	 the	 transfer	 of	 production	
capacity	 and	 equipment	 for	 pregnancy	 test	 	
wicks	 to	 China.	 Our	 new	 office	 in	 Singapore	 	
will	 act	 as	 the	 regional	 headquarters	 for	 the	
growth	 businesses	 in	 the	 Asia	 Pacific	 region,	
providing	 dedicated	 local	 support	 to	 the	 	
growing	 needs	 of	 our	 Asian	 customer	 base,	 	
and	 allowing	 a	 more	 timely	 and	 tailored	 	
reponse	 to	 their	 technical	 and	 development	
requirements.	 There	 was	 also	 further	 capacity	
expansion	 at	 the	 St.	 Charles	 foam	 site	 for	
medical	 wound	 care	 products,	 at	 Reinbek	 	
to	 enable	 European	 manufacture	 of	 printer	
systems	 products	 for	 the	 global	 customer	 	
base,	 and	 at	 Richmond	 for	 porous	 plastics.	
Our	 responsibilities
We	 are	 focused	 on	 the	 delivery	 of	 the	 highest	
standards	 of	 safety,	 quality	 and	 performance	
across	 all	 our	 international	 operations.	 Our	 	
global	 initiatives	 continue	 to	 keep	 our	 employees	
focused	 on	 driving	 to	 zero	 lost	 time	 accidents	
and	 zero	 environmental	 accidents.	 As	 evidence	
of	 this	 commitment,	 the	 division’s	 largest	 facility	
at	 Richmond	 now	 has	 a	 track	 record	 of	 over	
three	 years	 without	 a	 lost	 time	 accident.

How	 we	 do	 it
Our	 objective	 is	 to	 use	 our	 business	 	
development	 philosophy	 and	 resource	 to	 	
identify	 innovation	 opportunities	 and	 translate	
these	 into	 novel,	 workable	 solutions	 for	 new	 	
and	 existing	 customers.	 We	 seek	 to	 leverage	 	
our	 well-invested,	 developing	 international	
footprint	 to	 provide	 market-leading	 quality	 	
and	 service	 on	 a	 global	 basis,	 underpinned	 	
by	 our	 motivated	 and	 well-trained	 employees.	
Payne	 manufactures	 a	 range	 of	 tapes,	 labels,	
closures	 and	 seals	 which	 offer	 functional	 	
benefits	 to	 the	 principal	 packaging	 for	 consumer	
products,	 such	 as	 easy	 opening	 or	 resealability.	
Our	 products	 are	 also	 the	 ideal	 medium	 to	 carry	
sophisticated	 branding	 and	 communication	
messages,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 printed	 images,	 text	 or	
data.	 Additionally,	 we	 look	 to	 add	 value	 to	 our	
customers’	 packaging	 through	 providing	 brand	
protection	 technology	 from	 Payne	 Security.
Payne	 Security	 provides	 security	 technologies	
and	 innovations	 to	 governments	 and	 brand	
owners	 worldwide,	 to	 enable	 them	 to	 identify	
valuable	 documents	 and	 products	 in	 the	 fight	
against	 counterfeiting.	 Our	 offering	 comprises	
overt,	 covert	 and	 forensic	 technologies,	 including	
inks,	 lacquers,	 laminates,	 labels,	 tear	 tapes	 and	
thread.	 These	 products	 have	 a	 wide	 application	
including:	 national	 identity	 documents	 (such	 	
as	 passports,	 identity	 cards	 and	 visas);	 card-

(to	 provide	 data	 protection	 or	 to	 prove	 identity	 	
or	 entitlement	 to	 services);	 banknotes	 and	 	
bonds;	 and	 branded	 consumer	 goods.	
How	 we	 performed	 in	 2011
Revenue	 increased	 6.5%	 (at	 constant	 exchange)	
to	 £98.2m.	 Adjusting	 for	 the	 contribution	 	
from	 the	 BP	 Labels	 business	 acquired	 in	 February	
2010	 and	 the	 divestment	 of	 FractureCode	 	
in	 July	 2011,	 like-for-like	 growth	 was	 5.5%.	
Adjusted	 operating	 profit	 increased	 5.5%	 	
(at	 constant	 exchange)	 to	 £15.4m.
Tear	 tape	 revenue	 increased	 8%,	 behind	 	
the	 continued	 success	 of	 sales	 of	 tapes	 	
for	 consumer	 messaging,	 promotions	 and	
competitions	 across	 a	 range	 of	 categories	
including	 tobacco,	 confectionery	 and	 savoury	
snacks.	 In	 particular,	 we	 delivered	 a	 strong	
performance	 from	 wide-width	 message	 	
tapes	 and	 a	 new	 opening	 solution	 in	 the	 US	 	
food	 market.	 Growth	 in	 Labels	 (+23%)	 came	
particularly	 in	 tobacco,	 and	 included	 the	
incremental	 impact	 of	 the	 BP	 Labels	 business	
(now	 known	 as	 Payne	 Cardiff).	 Further	 	
progress	 was	 made	 in	 building	 the	 pipeline	 	
of	 2012	 prospects	 for	 new	 packaging	 	
solutions	 based	 on	 our	 tape	 and	 label	
manufacturing	 and	 application	 capability.	
Revenue	 from	 the	 Payne	 authentication	 system	
was	 ahead	 29%	 and,	 in	 our	 centenary	 year,	 	
the	 business	 gained	 the	 Queen’s	 Award	 for	
Enterprise	 in	 the	 Innovation	 category	 for	 the	
successful	 development	 and	 commercialisation	
of	 this	 proprietary	 technology.	 This	 new	 security	
technology	 delivers	 a	 robust	 and	 cost-effective	
solution	 to	 governments	 and	 industry	 for	
protecting	 against	 fraudulent	 and	 counterfeit	
activity,	 by	 differentiating	 between	 genuine	 	
and	 fake	 products	 or	 documents.	 The	 system	
integrates	 an	 invisible	 chemical	 marker,	 usually	
incorporated	 into	 inks	 and	 lacquers	 used	 to	 	
print	 product	 packaging,	 security	 documents	
and	 fiscal	 stamps,	 which	 can	 only	 be	 identified	
using	 a	 uniquely-programmable	 reader	 device.	
Enitor	 delivered	 an	 improved	 result,	 boosted	 	
by	 successful	 new	 business	 development,	 with	
revenue	 growth	 and	 operating	 margin	 expansion.	
During	 the	 year	 we	 re-focused	 our	 go-to-market	
efforts	 on	 packaging	 solutions	 and	 authentication	 	
and	 identity	 solutions,	 so	 as	 to	 leverage	 our	
capabilities	 better	 and	 provide	 our	 customers	
with	 even	 greater	 value-added	 propositions.
A	 continued	 focus	 on	 efficiency	 improvements,	
including	 waste	 reduction	 from	 product	 	
and	 process	 redesign	 in	 tear	 tape,	 helped	 to	 	
mitigate	 the	 margin	 impact	 of	 the	 loss	 of	 the	 	
UK	 Passport	 contract.
Driven	 by	 investment	 in	 machinery	 and	 	
capability	 for	 volume	 badge	 production,	 	
we	 succeeded	 in	 securing	 the	 opportunity	 	
to	 provide	 the	 next	 generation	 Blue	 Badge	 	
in	 the	 UK.	 As	 part	 of	 the	 new	 scheme,	 a	 	
secure	 card	 is	 printed	 and	 mailed	 to	 registered	 	
disabled	 users,	 to	 evidence	 their	 entitlement	 	
to	 free	 parking.	 In	 addition,	 further	 investments	
were	 made	 at	 the	 Banbury	 site	 during	 2011,	
expanding	 the	 authentication	 technologies’	
manufacturing	 capability.
	
Following	 the	 year	 end,	 we	 announced	 the	
acquisition	 of	 100%	 of	 the	 share	 capital	 	
of	 Securit	 World	 Ltd	 (“Securit”)	 for	 a	 cash	
consideration	 of	 £6m.	 Securit	 distributes	 	
desktop	 personal	 identification	 card	 systems,	
providing	 printers,	 software	 and	 associated	
accessories	 across	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 growing	
end-markets,	 including	 trade	 distribution,	
education,	 government,	 health	 and	 general	
industry.	 The	 acquisition	 of	 UK-based	 Securit	
adds	 to	 the	 existing	 capabilities	 of	 our	 Payne	
Security	 personal	 identification	 products	 	
business	 and	 provides	 new	 opportunities	 	
in	 adjacent	 attractive	 growth	 sectors,	 	
such	 as	 access	 control	 and	 membership.
Further	 to	 a	 strategic	 review	 of	 the	 division’s	
track	 and	 trace	 activities,	 the	 FractureCode	
business	 was	 divested.
Our	 responsibilities
As	 a	 business	 we	 believe	 in	 careful	 stewardship	
of	 the	 environment	 in	 which	 we	 operate	 	
and	 embody	 this	 philosophy	 in	 our	 business	
strategy.	 During	 the	 year,	 we	 continued	 to

2012	 key	 initiatives
Sales	 volume	 by	 type	 (%)
Revenue	 by	 destination	 (%) How	 we	 performed	 in	 2011
Revenue	 increased	 4.2%	 (at	 constant	 	
exchange)	 to	 £208.0m	 and	 operating	 	
profit	 was	 up	 3.8%	 (at	 constant	 exchange)	 	
to	 £24.5m,	 with	 the	 operating	 margin	
unchanged	 at	 11.8%.	 Underlying	 volumes	
increased	 2%	 versus	 the	 prior	 year,	 with	 	
growth	 coming	 particularly	 in	 Asia	 and	 	
Europe,	 and	 with	 both	 the	 multinational	 	
and	 independent	 customers.	
Revenue	 growth	 was	 supported	 by	 	
an	 increased	 number	 of	 successful	 	
new	 product	 launches,	 development	 	
initiatives	 and	 wider	 service	 offerings	 versus	
2010.	 In	 filters,	 a	 number	 of	 premium	 	
variants	 were	 introduced	 including	 flavour	
capsules	 and	 super	 slim	 combinations,	 as	 	
well	 as	 three	 new	 RYO	 products.	 There	 	
was	 also	 a	 strong	 increase	 in	 the	 level	 of	 	
sample	 and	 joint	 development	 activities	 	
and	 intellectual	 property	 commercialisation,	 	
with	 a	 positive	 contribution	 from	 all	 three	
development	 sites.	 Overall,	 the	 division	
performed	 well,	 increasing	 its	 customers	 	
and	 the	 number	 of	 laboratory	 accreditations	
during	 the	 year,	 as	 well	 as	 further	 extending	
packaging	 services	 for	 the	 RYO	 market.	 	
This	 improvement	 was	 supported	 by	 the	
re-focusing	 of	 the	 division	 during	 the	 year	
behind	 three	 go-to-market	 units:	 filters,	
innovation	 and	 scientific	 services.
Higher	 raw	 material	 and	 other	 input	 	
costs	 were	 successfully	 mitigated	 by	 	
continued	 productivity	 improvements,	 	
quality	 enhancement,	 and	 cost	 reduction	
initiatives	 implemented	 in	 2010.	
In	 order	 to	 be	 better-positioned	 to	 service	 	
the	 growing	 Asian	 market	 and	 to	 take	 	
advantage	 of	 new	 business	 opportunities,	 	
the	 Filter	 Products’	 head	 office	 was	 relocated	 	
to	 Singapore.	 In	 addition,	 our	 Filthai	 operation	 	
in	 Thailand	 moved	 to	 a	 new	 custom-built	 	
facility	 in	 Bangkok.	 These	 larger	 premises,	 	
which	 allow	 for	 increased	 production	 and	 	
future	 expansion,	 have	 been	 designed	 	
for	 optimum	 machine	 layout	 and	 material	 	
storage.	 In	 2011,	 Asia	 accounted	 for	 54%	 	
of	 volumes	 (FY	 2010:	 52%).	
Following	 a	 strategic	 review,	 and	 in	 order	 	
to	 continue	 to	 improve	 our	 service	 to	 our	 	
North	 American	 customers,	 we	 expanded	 	
our	 Greensboro,	 US	 factory.	 This	 investment	
programme	 was	 completed	 in	 three	 months,	 	
and	 Greensboro	 now	 offers	 high	 speed	
machines	 for	 complex	 filter	 products	 as	 	
well	 as	 a	 development	 and	 innovation	 centre.	 	
The	 expansion	 at	 Greensboro	 will	 also	 allow	 	
us	 to	 respond	 more	 rapidly	 to	 regulatory	 	
changes	 in	 the	 US	 tobacco	 industry.	 As	 a	 	
result	 of	 this	 expansion	 in	 North	 America,	 	
the	 facility	 in	 Monterrey,	 Mexico	 was	 closed.	
In	 addition,	 we	 delivered	 positive	 	
operational	 improvements	 at	 our	 site	 	
in	 Hungary	 in	 line	 with	 expectations,	 	
as	 well	 as	 realising	 the	 targeted	 benefits	 	
from	 a	 general	 restructuring	 of	 our	 	
European	 activities.	
During	 the	 year,	 there	 was	 a	 fire	 at	 the	 	
Paraguay	 facility,	 but	 no	 disruption	 in	 the	 	
supply	 to	 customers	 was	 incurred.	 This	 	
seamless	 supply	 capability	 reflects	 the	 	
benefits	 of	 our	 contingency	 planning	 and	 	
the	 alternative	 sources	 with	 which	 we	 are	 	
able	 to	 provide	 our	 customers	 as	 a	 result	 	
of	 our	 flexible	 manufacturing	 footprint.
Our	 responsibilities
We	 are	 committed	 to	 the	 environment	 and	 	
its	 sustainability	 and,	 in	 seeking	 to	 secure	
operational	 efficiencies	 and	 cost	 reductions,	 	
the	 division	 focuses	 on	 the	 optimisation	 	
of	 energy	 usage	 and	 the	 development	 of	 	
new	 sustainable	 solutions.

Key	 financial	 highlights
What	 we	 measure Vision	 2015
The	 management	 of	 risk	 underpins	 the	 Company’s	 	
Vision	 2015	 strategy,	 focusing	 on	 the	 challenges	
which	 arise	 in	 the	 international	 environment	 in	
which	 Filtrona	 conducts	 business	 and	 reflecting	
the	 Company’s	 appetite	 for	 risk	 in	 the	 delivery	 	
of	 its	 business	 objectives.	 As	 such,	 risks	 are	
continuously	 monitored,	 associated	 action	 plans	
are	 reviewed,	 appropriate	 contingencies	 are	
provisioned	 and	 information	 is	 reported	 through	
established	 management	 control	 procedures.	
The	 Company	 seeks	 to	 continuously	 improve	 	
its	 risk	 management	 processes	 and	 developed	
new	 systems	 during	 2011	 which	 serve	 to	
enhance	 the	 Company’s	 response	 to	 the	 risks	
inherent	 in	 its	 international	 business	 activities.	
Further	 details	 on	 the	 systems	 can	 be	 found	 	
on	 page	 50.
Filtrona	 recognises	 that	 the	 ability	 to	 monitor,	
assess	 and	 respond	 to	 business	 risks	 may	 provide	
a	 competitive	 advantage.	 Reporting	 within	 the	
Company	 is	 structured	 so	 that	 key	 issues	 are	
escalated	 through	 the	 management	 team,	 and	
ultimately	 to	 the	 Board	 if	 appropriate.	 Each	 area	
of	 the	 business	 is	 required	 to	 review	 its	 principal	
areas	 of	 risk	 and	 uncertainty	 formally	 and	
regularly.	 This	 is	 an	 ongoing	 process,	 to	 ensure	
that	 there	 are	 clear	 and	 consistent	 procedures	 	
for	 monitoring,	 updating	 and	 implementing	
appropriate	 controls	 to	 manage	 identified	 risks.	
Filtrona’s	 short-	 and	 long-term	 performance	 can	
be	 impacted	 by	 many	 risks	 and	 uncertainties,	 not	
all	 of	 which	 are	 within	 the	 Company’s	 control.	
The	 Company	 is	 subject	 to	 the	 general	 risks	 and	
uncertainties	 which	 impact	 other	 international	
businesses,	 including	 political	 instability	 in	 the	
countries	 in	 which	 it	 operates	 and	 sources	 	
raw	 materials,	 the	 impact	 of	 natural	 disasters	 	
and	 changes	 in	 general	 economic	 conditions,	
including	 currency	 and	 interest	 rate	 fluctuations,	
tax	 regimes	 and	 raw	 material	 costs.
Detailed	 opposite	 are	 the	 principal	 risks	 and	
uncertainties	 which	 the	 Board	 believes	 are	
specific	 to	 Filtrona,	 together	 with	 the	 associated	
risk	 management	 response.	 The	 details	 provided	
are	 not	 exhaustive	 and	 do	 not	 purport	 to	 be	 a	
complete	 explanation	 of	 all	 potentially	 relevant	
issues.	 There	 may	 be	 other	 risks	 and	 uncertainties	 	
which	 are	 unknown	 to	 the	 Board,	 or	 which	 	
may	 not	 be	 deemed	 by	 the	 Board	 to	 be	 material	
at	 present	 but	 which	 could	 prove	 to	 be	 so	 	
in	 the	 future.

Some	 of	 the	 assets	 maintained	 by	 the	 	
Company,	 such	 as	 tooling	 and	 IT	 systems,	 	
are	 critical	 to	 the	 manufacture	 and	 	
delivery	 of	 particular	 products.
Filtrona	 seeks	 to	 manage	 the	 risk	 of	 potential	
disruption	 to	 the	 supply	 of	 its	 customers	 by:
•	 Operating	 within	 a	 flexible	 global	
infrastructure	
•	 Installing	 fire	 and	 other	 risk	 prevention	
systems	
•	 Implementing	 disaster	 recovery	 and	 	
business	 continuity	 plans
•	 Assessing	 operational	 risks
•	 Maintaining	 comprehensive	 insurance
A	 material	 disruption	 to	 operational

Filtrona	 faces	 pressure	 from	 direct	 	
competitors,	 as	 well	 as	 competition	 	
from	 alternative	 technologies.	 Some	 	
of	 the	 Company’s	 competitors	 may	 	
derive	 competitive	 advantage	 from	 	
greater	 financial	 resources,	 economies	 	
of	 scale,	 additional	 purchasing	 power	 	
or	 a	 lower	 cost	 base,	 and	 Filtrona	 	
may	 face	 aggressive	 pricing	 practices.
Filtrona	 seeks	 to	 mitigate	 the	 risk	 	
of	 competitive	 pressure	 by:
•	 Sustained	 investment	 in	 research	 and	
development	 to	 develop	 the	 quality	 and	
breadth	 of	 its	 product	 and	 service	 offering
•	 Exploiting	 its	 innovative	 and	 manufacturing	
capabilities	 in	 new	 technologies,	 products

•	 Developing	 long-term	 relationships	 with

•	 Protecting	 its	 intellectual	 property	 rights
•	 Expanding	 its	 international	 distribution,	 	
sales	 and	 marketing	 expertise
•	 Investing	 in	 both	 organic	 and	 acquisition	
growth	 opportunities
Demand	 for	 competitors’	 products	 	
and	 the	 development	 of	 competing

•	 Loss	 of	 market	 positions	
•	 Intellectual	 property	 challenges
•	 Decline	 in	 revenue
•	 Decline	 in	 profitability
•	 Erosion	 of	 margins	
•	 Deterioration	 in	 financial	 condition
Competitive	 pressures
Filtrona’s	 development	 and	 growth	 has	 	
benefited	 from	 acquisitions	 and	 the	 success	 	
of	 start-up	 operations.	 The	 rate	 of	 any	 	
future	 business	 development	 may	 in	 part	 	
be	 dependent	 on	 the	 success	 of	 additional	
acquisitions	 and	 new	 start-up	 operations.	 	
There	 can	 be	 no	 assurance	 that	 the	 	
Company	 will	 be	 successful	 in	 completing	 	
and	 integrating	 suitable	 acquisitions	 	
or	 developing	 and	 expanding	 further

Challenges	 of	 business	 development
Directors’	 Report
The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 35 Business	 Review	|	Management	 of	 Principal	 Risks In	 some	 of	 Filtrona’s	 businesses,	 particularly	 	
filter	 products	 and	 tear	 tape,	 the	 customer	 	
base	 is	 relatively	 concentrated.	 In	 addition,	 	
trends	 in	 certain	 markets,	 particularly	 in	 the	 	
oil	 and	 gas	 industry,	 may	 reduce	 the	 demands	
for	 the	 Company’s	 products.	 Should	 Filtrona’s	
customers	 decide	 to	 satisfy	 their	 requirements	
internally	 or	 from	 other	 suppliers,	 and	 if	 	
Filtrona	 were	 unable	 to	 secure	 new	 business,	 	
this	 could	 result	 in	 a	 significant	 loss	 of	 business.	
To	 counteract	 the	 Company’s	 exposure	 	
to	 a	 number	 of	 key	 customers,	 Filtrona:
•	 Invests	 in	 innovative,	 high	 quality,	 	
value-added	 products	 and	 services
•	 Develops	 long-term	 relationships	 	
with	 customers	 at	 a	 senior	 level
•	 Seeks	 new	 markets	 and	 growth	 	
opportunities	 to	 expand	 the	 	
customer	 base
The	 loss	 of	 certain	 of	 Filtrona’s	 key	 	
customers	 exposes	 the	 Company	 to:
•	 Reduced	 revenue
•	 Restructuring	 costs
•	 Profit	 decline
•	 Deterioration	 in	 financial	 condition
•	 Reputational	 damage

The	 Company	 uses	 significant	 quantities	 of	
plastic	 resins.	 These	 may	 be	 subject	 to	 price	
fluctuations	 arising	 from	 supply	 shortages	 and	
changes	 in	 the	 prices	 of	 natural	 gas,	 crude	 oil	
and	 other	 petrochemical	 intermediaries	 from	
which	 resins	 are	 produced.	 Some	 of	 Filtrona’s	
businesses	 are	 dependent	 on	 the	 availability	 	
of	 specialist	 raw	 materials	 or	 components	 	
which	 are	 incorporated	 into	 the	 Company’s	
products.	 If	 there	 are	 supply	 shortages	 or	 	
rapid	 increases	 in	 the	 price	 of	 resin	 or	 other	 	
raw	 materials,	 including	 energy	 costs,	 the	
Company’s	 revenue	 and	 profitability	 may	 	
be	 materially	 and	 adversely	 affected.	
To	 counteract	 the	 Company’s	 exposure	 	
to	 increases	 in	 raw	 material	 costs	 or	 	
supply	 shortages,	 Filtrona	 seeks	 to:
•	 Adopt	 appropriate	 procurement	 practices
•	 Secure	 longer	 term	 supply	 agreements
•	 Implement	 cost	 recovery	 programmes
•	 Ensure	 the	 availability	 of	 alternative	 	
supply	 options
If	 Filtrona	 is	 exposed	 to	 raw	 material	 	
price	 increases	 or	 supply	 shortages,	 	
the	 Company	 may	 suffer:
•	 Disruption	 to	 supply
•	 Increased	 costs
•	 Profit	 decline
•	 Reduced	 revenue
Raw	 material	 supply
A	 key	 component	 of	 Filtrona’s	 future	 success	 	
is	 the	 ability	 to	 develop	 new	 and	 innovative	
products	 and	 services.	 In	 addition	 to	 seeking	
internationally	 applied	 patent	 and	 trademark	
rights,	 the	 Company	 relies	 on	 unpatented	
proprietary	 know-how	 and	 trade	 secrets.	 In	 	
the	 event	 that	 Filtrona	 is	 unable	 to	 respond	 	
to	 competitive	 technological	 advances	 or	 	
to	 protect	 its	 intellectual	 property	 portfolio,	 	
the	 future	 performance	 of	 the	 Company	 	
may	 be	 adversely	 affected.	
To	 counteract	 the	 Company’s	 risk	 of	 erosion	 	
of	 its	 intellectual	 property	 portfolio,	 Filtrona:
•	 Invests	 in	 R&D
•	 Secures	 formal	 registrations	 of	 patent

relevant	 authorities.	 As	 the	 Company	 moves	 	
into	 new	 markets	 and	 territories	 in	 pursuit	 	
of	 its	 strategic	 priorities,	 Filtrona	 is	 exposed	 	
to	 new	 and	 additional	 compliance	 risk.
In	 order	 to	 manage	 compliance	 risk,	 Filtrona:
•	 Establishes	 a	 clear	 compliance	 	
culture	 from	 the	 top	 down
•	 Conducts	 risk	 assessments	 and	 	
ongoing	 compliance	 reviews
•	 Implements	 policies	 and	 procedures
•	 Provides	 behavioural	 guidance	 	
and	 training	 to	 all	 employees
•	 Monitors	 compliance	 through	 	
verification	 procedures	
Failure	 by	 the	 Company	 or	 its	 employees	 	
or	 others	 acting	 on	 its	 behalf	 to	 abide	 by	 	
the	 laws	 and	 regulations	 could	 result	 in:
•	 Administrative,	 civil	 or	 criminal	 liability
•	 Significant	 fines	 and	 penalties
•	 Suspension	 or	 debarment	 of	 	
the	 Company	 from	 trading
•	 Reputational	 damage
•	 Loss	 of	 commercial	 relationships

MITIGATION
A	 significant	 part	 of	 Filtrona’s	 business	 relates	 	
to	 the	 supply	 of	 filter	 products	 and	 tear	 tape	 	
to	 manufacturers	 in	 the	 tobacco	 industry.	 	
Future	 performance	 may	 be	 affected	 by	 	
changes	 in	 the	 tobacco	 industry,	 such	 as	 	
changes	 in	 the	 consumption	 of	 filter	 products,	
self	 manufacture	 and	 increasingly	 restrictive	
regulations.	 Tobacco-related	 litigation	 could	 	
also	 adversely	 affect	 Filtrona,	 although	 there	 	
is	 no	 history	 of	 the	 Company	 being	 involved	 	
in	 such	 claims.
In	 seeking	 to	 minimise	 the	 potential	 impact	 of	
its	 exposure	 to	 the	 tobacco	 industry,	 Filtrona:
•	 Invests	 in	 the	 research	 and	 development	 	
of	 innovative	 value-added	 products	 	
and	 services
•	 Targets	 growth	 opportunities	 outside	 	
the	 manufacture	 of	 filter	 products
•	 Focuses	 on	 low	 cost	 filter	 production
•	 Takes	 internal	 and	 external	 legal	 advice	 	
to	 manage	 litigation	 risk
Filtrona’s	 relationship	 with	 the	 tobacco	 	
industry	 may	 lead	 to:
•	 Reduced	 revenue	
•	 Restructuring	 costs
•	 Profit	 decline
•	 Reputational	 damage
•	 Deterioration	 in	 financial	 condition

Corporate	 Responsibility	 encompasses	 a	 broad

Filtrona	 considers	 the	 issues	 that	 are	 material	 to	 its	
business	 and	 seeks	 to	 respond	 to	 them	 in	 a	 manner	
appropriate	 to	 the	 interests	 of	 all	 its	 stakeholders
38 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011
Corporate	 Responsibility Filtrona	 recognises	 the	 significance	 and	 importance	 of	 being	 a	 	
responsible	 corporate	 citizen	 in	 the	 workplace,	 marketplace,	 environment	
and	 community.	 The	 Company’s	 international	 operations	 fulfil	 their	
responsibility	 to	 record,	 monitor	 and	 make	 publicly	 available	 the	 potential	
impact	 of	 its	 activities.	 In	 pursuing	 its	 corporate	 strategy,	 Filtrona’s	 aim	 is	 to	
adopt	 business	 practices	 that	 are	 economically,	 socially	 and	 environmentally	
sustainable,	 and	 to	 promote	 these	 to	 its	 stakeholders	 in	 order	 to	 strengthen	
relationships,	 share	 knowledge	 and	 encourage	 best	 practice.	
The	 Company’s	 risk	 management	 processes	 include	 consideration	 of	 	
the	 potential	 impact	 of	 corporate	 responsibility	 issues	 on	 Filtrona’s	
performance.	 The	 Company’s	 investment	 decisions	 take	 into	 account	
appropriate	 evaluations	 of	 the	 potential	 consequences	 for	 its	 employees,	
customers	 and	 suppliers	 and	 the environment.	
The	 Filtrona	 Values	 form	 the	 core	 of	 the	 Company’s	 adoption	 of	 the	 	
highest	 standards	 of	 business	 ethics	 and	 integrity	 that	 underpin	 its	
relationships	 with	 both	 internal	 and	 external stakeholders.
The	 Values	 can	 be	 found	 on	 the	 Company's	 website	 www.filtrona.com.
Workplace
Health and safety
Filtrona’s	 overriding	 commitment	 in	 the	 workplace	 continues	 to	 be	 the	
health,	 safety	 and	 welfare	 of	 its	 employees	 and	 all	 those	 who	 visit	 the	
Company’s	 operations.	 The	 Board	 provides	 health	 and	 safety	 leadership	
and	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 has	 primary	 responsibility	 for	 setting	 the	 overriding	
health	 and	 safety	 objectives	 within	 which	 the	 detailed	 policies	 operate,	 	
and	 for	 reviewing	 progress	 against	 those objectives.
The	 Company	 has	 designed	 procedures	 and	 developed	 a	 culture	 which	
aims	 for	 continuous	 improvement	 with	 the	 sharing	 of	 best	 practice	 	
in	 all	 areas	 of	 health	 and	 safety,	 in	 addition	 to	 strict	 compliance	 with	
applicable	 laws	 and	 regulations.	 The	 degree	 of	 autonomy	 afforded	 	
to	 local	 management	 allows	 them	 to	 set	 the	 agenda	 best	 suited	 to	 the	
requirements	 of	 individual	 businesses,	 but	 subject	 always	 to	 the	 proper	
implementation	 of	 the	 core	 health	 and	 safety	 policies	 and	 principles	 	
which	 Filtrona	 has	 adopted.	
Ongoing	 initiatives	 are	 designed	 to	 monitor,	 assess	 and	 drive	 performance.	
Investigations	 are	 carried	 out	 into	 all	 circumstances	 that	 may	 have	 resulted	 	
in	 injury	 or	 near	 miss	 incidents.	 Continued	 reporting	 of	 near	 miss	 incidents	
and	 “non	 work”	 related	 injuries	 has	 enhanced	 the	 Company’s	 ability	 to	
learn	 from	 potentially	 hazardous	 conditions	 and	 prevent	 their	 reoccurrence	
or	 escalation	 into	 more	 serious incidents.
The	 Group-wide	 intranet-based	 management	 reporting	 system	 facilitates	
an	 extensive	 live	 programme	 of	 active	 monitoring,	 that	 measures	 in	 detail	
exactly	 how	 successful	 the	 Company	 is	 in	 managing	 the	 safety	 of	 its	
workplaces	 at	 individual	 site	 level.	 During	 the	 year	 a	 complete	 suite	 of	
training	 videos	 was	 introduced	 via	 the	 intranet	 reporting	 system	 which	
covers	 all	 aspects	 of	 health	 and	 safety	 in	 the	 workplace.	 These	 training	
videos,	 which	 are	 becoming	 part	 of	 employee	 induction	 programmes	 	
and	 annual	 training,	 will	 be	 updated	 for	 revised	 and	 new	 legislation	 	
as	 it	 comes	 into	 force.
Filtrona	 has	 an	 established	 Group	 Health,	 Safety	 &	 Environmental	 	
Council	 (“the	 FHSEC”)	 which	 is	 an	 international	 group	 and	 includes	 senior	
operating	 management	 from	 all	 divisions.	 The	 FHSEC’s	 primary	 task	 is	 to	
review	 progress	 with	 the	 implementation	 of	 HS&E	 policy	 and	 performance	
and	 set	 objectives	 and	 standards	 for	 the	 Group	 worldwide.	 The	 FHSEC	
meets	 bi-annually	 and	 discusses	 the	 physical,	 regulatory	 and	 financial	 	
risks	 associated	 with	 all	 HS&E	 issues	 including	 climate	 change.	 There	 is	 a	
mechanism	 for	 identifying	 and	 allocating	 suitable	 resources	 to	 specifically	
identify	 risks,	 and	 for	 reporting	 to	 the Board.	
The	 Company	 manages	 occupational	 health	 by	 identifying	 key	 risk	
activities,	 undertaking	 health	 assessments	 and,	 where	 appropriate,	
implementing	 health	 surveillance	 programmes.	 The	 Company	 has	 	
achieved	 the	 Occupational	 Health	 and	 Safety	 Management	 Systems	
OHSAS	 18001	 for	 all	 of	 its	 principal	 manufacturing	 sites.	 The	 recently	
acquired	 sites	 are	 given	 a	 period	 of	 two	 years	 to	 reach	 the	 required	
standard	 in	 accordance	 with	 Filtrona	 policy.	
As	 part	 of	 their	 integration	 all	 businesses	 which	 join	 the	 Filtrona	 Group	 	
have	 to	 ensure	 that	 they	 achieve	 the	 Company’s	 health	 and	 safety	 	
reporting	 requirements	 within	 a	 suitable	 timescale.
Businesses	 undertake	 extensive	 training	 programmes	 which	 are	 particularly	
focused	 on	 the	 key,	 or	 most	 frequent,	 risks	 in	 their	 operations.	 Training	 in	
risk	 assessment	 and	 root-cause	 analysis	 features	 strongly	 in	 the	 Company’s	
health	 and	 safety	 management.	
Details	 of	 the	 Company’s	 health	 and	 safety	 performance	 for	 2011	 and	
subsequent	 progress	 throughout	 2012	 can	 be	 viewed	 on	 page	 41	 and	 	
on	 the	 Company’s	 website	 www.filtrona.com.
The	 Company	 has	 implemented	 the	 Filtrona	 Group	 Safety	 Awards	 which	
reward	 manufacturing	 sites	 with	 Gold,	 Silver	 or	 Bronze	 status	 on	 the	 basis	 	
of	 their	 annual	 performance	 assessed	 against	 increasingly	 stringent	 criteria	
set	 by	 the	 FHSEC.	 The	 criteria	 governing	 these	 awards	 are	 based	 upon:	
achieving	 a	 high	 Filtrona	 audit	 score;	 OHSAS	 standard	 accreditation;	 	
regular	 health	 and	 safety	 meetings;	 availability	 of	 suitably	 trained	 employees	 	
on	 site;	 completion	 of	 all	 critical	 risk	 assessments	 and	 achieving	 accident	
reduction	 targets.

The	 figures	 in	 brackets	 represent	 the	 awards	 which	 would	 have	 been	 made	 	
if	 the	 2010	 criteria	 had	 been	 applied
The	 Filtrona	 Chief	 Executive’s	 Special	 Award	 for	 health,	 safety	 and	
environment	 recognises	 the	 achievements	 of	 the	 division	 or	 site	 that	 	
best	 meets	 the	 following	 criteria:	
•	 Demonstrates	 a	 significant	 impact	 on	 work	 methods	 or	 behaviours	
resulting	 in	 improvements	 to	 employee	 perception	 of	 health,	 	
safety	 and	 environmental	 standards
•	 Involves	 the	 majority	 of	 employees
•	 Utilises	 novel	 or	 interactive	 media	 or	 methods
In	 2011,	 the	 award	 was	 won	 by	 the	 Porous	 Technologies	 division	 	
due	 to	 the	 strong	 impact	 of	 the	 ECO	 Reservoir	 recycling	 project.	 The	
development	 of	 a	 recycle	 extruder	 allows	 the	 conversion	 of	 manufacturing	
waste	 into	 usable	 material	 for	 writing	 instrument	 reservoirs.	 This	 new	
product	 offering	 has	 reduced	 the	 Richmond	 plant’s	 waste	 to	 landfill.	 	
This	 achievement	 reflects	 the	 long-term	 commitment	 of	 the	 management	
team	 and	 employees	 to	 environmental	 excellence.
Employees
Filtrona’s	 employees	 are	 a	 vital	 resource	 in	 the	 pursuit	 of	 operational	
excellence	 and	 the	 provision	 of	 quality	 products	 and	 service	 to	 its	
customers.	 The	 skills	 and	 expertise	 of	 Filtrona’s	 employees	 drive	 the	
innovation	 which	 enables	 the	 Company	 to	 provide	 added	 value	 to	 its	
customers,	 enhance	 supply	 chain	 logistics	 with	 its	 suppliers	 and	 reduce	 	
the	 environmental	 impact	 of	 its	 operations.	
Directors’	 Report
The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 39 Business	 Review	|	Corporate	 Responsibility The	 Company	 regularly	 reviews	 its	 organisational	 structure	 to	 ensure	 that	 	
the	 business	 has	 the	 necessary	 personnel	 to	 deliver	 its	 strategic priorities.	
Filtrona	 understands	 the	 importance	 of	 having	 the	 right	 people	 with	 	
the	 right	 skills	 now	 and	 in	 the	 future,	 to	 deliver	 the	 exceptional	 service	 	
and	 expertise	 which	 is	 the	 bedrock	 of	 the	 Company's	 long-term	
relationships	 with	 its	 customers.	 To	 deliver	 that	 service	 and	 expertise,	
Filtrona	 is	 continually	 improving	 its	 comprehensive	 talent	 pool,	 from	
graduates	 to	 senior	 management.	 Since	 its	 formation	 Filtrona	 has	 run	 	
a	 very	 successful	 graduate	 training	 programme	 which	 has	 historically	
recruited	 from	 Europe	 and	 the	 Americas.	 During	 2011	 this	 scheme	 was	
introduced	 to	 candidates	 in	 Asia	 and	 it	 will	 be	 further	 expanded	 in	 2012.
Key	 strategic	 aspects	 of	 recruitment,	 training	 and	 development	 are	 	
overseen	 or	 co-ordinated	 at	 a	 Group	 level	 to	 ensure	 consistency	 	
of	 approach,	 to	 identify	 strategic	 threats	 and	 opportunities	 and	 	
to	 open	 up	 a	 wider	 range	 of	 opportunities	 for	 employees.
Filtrona	 encourages	 its	 employees	 to	 develop	 and	 manage	 their	 own	
careers.	 It	 facilitates	 this	 by	 providing	 relevant	 job	 training	 and,	 where	
appropriate,	 aims	 to	 fill	 vacancies	 with	 existing	 staff	 where	 employees	 	
are	 suitably	 qualified	 and experienced.
Filtrona	 is	 committed	 to	 improving	 employee	 engagement	 and	 learning	
more	 about	 the	 needs	 of	 its	 workforce.	 In	 addition	 to	 the	 impact	 of	 	
the	 training	 and	 development	 programmes,	 employee	 engagement	 is	
enhanced	 by	 the	 communication	 practices	 which	 have	 been	 adopted	
across	 the	 businesses.	
Filtrona	 values	 highly	 the	 commitment	 of	 its	 employees	 and	 recognises	 	
the	 importance	 of	 communication	 to	 good	 working	 relationships	 and	
practices.	 The	 Company	 seeks	 to	 ensure	 that	 employees	 are	 informed	 	
on	 matters	 relating	 to	 their	 employment	 and	 on	 financial	 and	 economic	
factors	 affecting	 the	 businesses.	 The	 Company	 actively	 seeks	 feedback	 	
and	 ideas	 from	 employees	 to	 improve	 its	 operations,	 and	 forums	
appropriate	 to	 Filtrona’s	 local	 businesses	 have	 been	 established	 to	 allow	
employees	 to	 voice	 their	 views	 on	 how	 the	 Company	 should	 fulfil	 the	
demands	 of	 all	 its	 local	 and	 international	 stakeholders.	 The	 Company’s	
European	 Information	 and	 Consultation	 Forum	 facilitates	 the	 discussion	 	
of	 issues	 across	 all	 of	 its	 operations	 in	 the	 European Union.
The	 Company	 recognises	 the	 importance	 of,	 and	 the	 benefits	 to	 be	 	
derived	 from,	 diversity	 across	 its	 international	 operations	 and	 is	 committed	
to	 offering	 equal	 opportunities	 to	 all	 people	 without	 discrimination	 of	 	
any	 form.	 Filtrona	 remunerates	 fairly	 with	 respect	 to	 skills,	 performance	 	
and	 local	 market	 conditions.	
The	 Company	 gives	 full	 and	 fair	 consideration	 to	 employment	 applications	
by	 disabled	 persons.	 In	 the	 event	 of	 employees	 becoming	 disabled,	 	
every	 effort	 is	 made	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 training,	 career	 development	 	
and	 promotion	 opportunities	 enjoyed	 by	 disabled	 persons	 are	 as	 far	 	
as	 possible	 identical	 to	 those	 of	 non-disabled	 employees.
Throughout	 its	 global	 activities	 Filtrona	 supports	 human	 rights	 as	 set	 	
down	 by	 the	 United	 Nations	 Declaration	 and	 its	 applicable	 International	
Labour	 Organisation	 conventions.	 Operations	 based	 in	 India,	 Indonesia,	
Jordan	 and	 Thailand	 are	 also	 accredited	 to	 SA	 8000	 which	 details	
fundamental	 principles	 of	 human	 rights.
Marketplace
Filtrona’s	 reputation	 with	 its	 customers	 and	 suppliers	 and	 in	 the	
communities	 where	 it	 operates	 is	 based	 not	 only	 on	 the	 quality	 of	 	
its	 performance,	 but	 also	 on	 the	 integrity	 in	 its	 management	 of	 the	
workplace	 and	 the	 environment	 and	 its	 ethical	 and	 responsible	 conduct	 	
in	 the	 marketplace.	 The	 development	 and	 continuation	 of	 long-term	
business	 relationships	 reflects	 the	 trust	 placed	 in	 the	 Company	 and	 such	
commitments	 are	 an	 important	 component	 in	 the	 ongoing	 success	 of	 	
the	 Company.
Filtrona’s	 Code	 of	 Business	 Ethics	 policy	 is	 applicable	 to	 all	 its	 businesses	
around	 the	 world.	 The	 policy	 details	 the	 standards	 expected	 by	 Filtrona	 	
in	 the	 conduct	 of	 its	 business	 and	 its	 relationships	 with	 third	 parties,	
including	 free	 and	 fair	 competition,	 and	 the	 prohibition	 of	 bribery	 and	
political	 donations,	 and	 provides	 general	 guidance	 on	 honest	 and	 fair	
dealings	 with	 suppliers,	 customers	 and	 local	 and	 national authorities.	
Filtrona	 is	 committed	 to	 working	 with	 its	 suppliers	 to	 ensure	 the	 welfare	 	
of	 workers	 and	 employment	 conditions	 in	 its	 supply	 chain	 meet	 or	 exceed	
internationally	 recognised standards.
Environment
Filtrona	 applies	 a	 structured	 approach	 to	 minimising	 its	 environmental	
impact	 by:
•	 Implementing	 and	 maintaining	 formal	 environmental	 systems	 	
accredited	 to	 ISO 14001	 on	 a	 global	 basis
•	 Measuring	 consumption	 and	 emissions	 and	 setting	 targets	 	
to	 improve	 performance
•	 Carrying	 out	 environmental	 impact	 assessments	 and	 developing	 	
site	 management	 plans
•	 Providing	 training	 to	 employees	 and	 engaging	 with	 customers	 	
and	 suppliers	 to	 raise	 environmental	 awareness
•	 Providing	 facilities	 to	 segregate	 and	 reuse	 or	 recycle	 waste
Filtrona	 is	 listed	 in	 the	 FTSE4Good	 Index	 which	 is	 designed	 to	 measure	 	
the	 performance	 of	 companies	 striving	 to	 meet	 globally	 recognised	
corporate	 responsibility	 standards,	 and	 facilitates	 investment	 in	 those	
companies	 where	 corporate	 responsibility	 issues	 are	 an	 influencing	 	
factor	 in	 an	 investor’s	 decision-making	 process.
Filtrona	 supports	 the	 activities	 of	 the	 Carbon	 Trust	 and	 participated	 in	 	
the	 9th	 annual	 Carbon	 Disclosure	 Project	 (“CDP”)	 environmental	 impact	
survey	 in	 2011.	 It	 is	 the	 Company’s	 intention	 to	 participate	 in	 the	 CDP	
survey	 during 2012.
During	 the	 year	 the	 FTSE	 CDP	 Carbon	 Strategy	 350	 Index	 Series	 (the	
“Series”)	 was	 introduced	 which	 aims	 to	 support	 investors	 in	 incorporating	
climate	 change	 risks	 into	 their	 investment	 strategy.	 It	 features	 future-
orientated	 criteria	 that	 assess	 the	 exposure	 of	 individual	 companies	 to	
higher	 future	 costs	 associated	 with	 greenhouse	 gas	 emissions.	 The	 FTSE	
CDP	 Carbon	 Strategy	 350	 Index	 is	 a	 carbon-risk	 biased	 version	 of	 the	
FTSE 350	 Index	 with	 the	 constituent	 companies	 weighted	 according	 to	
their	 carbon	 exposure	 relative	 to	 their	 sector	 peers.	 In	 the	 2010	 Series,	
Filtrona	 was	 ranked	 number	 30.
The	 UK	 Carbon	 Reduction	 Commitment	 (“CRC”)	 legislation	 became	
effective	 during	 2010,	 and	 Filtrona	 achieved	 the	 Carbon	 Trust	 Standard	 	
at	 all	 its	 UK	 manufacturing	 sites	 during	 2011.	 This	 standard	 ensures	
commitment	 to	 improved	 carbon	 footprint	 and	 enhanced	 reputation.	 	
The	 CRC	 is	 designed	 to	 drive	 energy	 efficiency	 and	 carbon	 reduction	 	
by	 giving	 organisations	 a	 financial	 incentive	 through	 emissions	 trading.	
Filtrona	 continues	 to	 apply	 the	 principles	 of	 the	 Carbon	 Trust	 Standard	 	
to	 its	 global	 operations	 and	 will	 be	 well	 placed	 to	 address	 future	 	
anticipated	 legislative	 changes	 in	 its	 operating	 regions.

The	 first	 CRC	 Performance	 League	 Table	 (PLT)	 was	 published	 during	 	
2011	 by	 the	 UK’s	 Environment	 Agency	 and	 ranked	 Filtrona	 equal	 first.	 	
The	 2010-11	 PLT	 is	 based	 on	 early	 actions	 that	 participants	 have	 taken	 	
to	 show	 that	 they	 are	 committed	 to	 energy	 efficiency	 within	 their	
organisations.	 Participants	 get	 credit	 for	 early	 action	 where	 they:
•	 Have	 a	 proportion	 of	 their	 CRC	 emissions	 certified	 under	 one	 of	 	
the	 seven	 carbon	 management	 schemes	 which	 the	 Environment	 	
Agency	 has	 accredited
•	 Have	 a	 proportion	 of	 their	 CRC	 electricity	 and	 gas	 supplies	 measured	
through	 voluntarily	 installed	 automatic	 meter	 reading	 devices,	 	
dynamic	 un-metered	 supply	 and	 daily	 read	 gas	 meters	 in	 year	 one
Filtrona’s	 position	 as	 joint	 first	 is	 a	 direct	 result	 of	 the	 early	 action	
undertaken	 under	 the	 auspices	 of	 the	 Group	 FHSEC.
Given	 the	 diversity	 of	 Filtrona’s	 international	 operations,	 local	 	
management	 drive	 environmental	 performance	 based	 on	 divisional	
objectives	 set	 in	 accordance	 with	 Filtrona’s	 environmental	 policy.	 	
Copies	 of	 the	 policy	 can	 be	 found	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	
www.filtrona.com.
Filtrona	 uses	 a	 variety	 of	 indicators	 relevant	 to	 each	 of	 the	 operating	
divisions	 to	 monitor	 environmental	 performance,	 but	 the	 following	 	
core	 impacts	 are	 identified	 for	 the	 Group	 as	 a whole:
•	 Greenhouse	 gas	 emission	 from	 energy	 use,	 including	 electricity,	 	
natural	 gas,	 heating	 fuel,	 transport	 and	 travel
•	 Use	 of	 resources	 including	 water
•	 Generation	 and	 disposal	 of	 waste
Filtrona	 is	 continually	 seeking	 to	 ensure	 reduction	 in	 the	 use	 of	 natural	
resources	 and	 has	 established	 research	 and	 development	 facilities	 in	 the	
UK,	 Asia	 and	 the	 US	 to	 investigate	 the	 use	 of	 renewable	 resources	 and	
recyclable	 /	 bio-degradable	 versions	 of	 products.

Filtrona	 is	 committed	 to	 ensuring	 good	 environmental	 practice	 at	 all	 	
its	 locations	 and	 in	 its	 operational	 processes	 and	 investment	 decisions.	
Filtrona’s	 principal	 manufacturing	 sites	 are	 ISO	 14001	 accredited	 and	 all	 	
of	 the	 Company’s	 European	 businesses	 comply	 with	 EU	 and	 domestic	
waste	 management	 regulations.	
Due	 to	 the	 scale	 of	 Filtrona’s	 international	 operations,	 the	 use	 of	 energy	 	
has	 both	 environmental	 and	 commercial	 importance.	 Where	 possible,	 	
and	 financially	 viable,	 energy	 from	 renewable	 resources	 is	 utilised	 to	 	
limit	 environmental	 impact,	 commercial	 risk	 and costs.
Filtrona	 actively	 engages	 with	 its	 employees,	 customers,	 and	 suppliers

The	 FHSEC	 provides	 an	 opportunity	 to	 share	 best	 environmental	 practices

to	 the	 support	 for	 appropriate	 non-political	 and	 non-sectarian	 projects	
across	 a	 range	 of	 organisations	 and	 charities.	 Regardless	 of	 regional	 	
or	 national	 boundaries,	 the	 Company	 aims	 to	 support	 the	 creation	 	
of	 prosperous,	 educated,	 sustainable	 and	 healthy	 communities	 in	 the	
countries	 and	 cultures	 in	 which	 it	 operates.	 In	 its	 attempts	 to	 bring	 	
benefits	 back	 to	 those	 communities	 whose	 support	 provides	 a	 basis	 	
for	 Filtrona’s	 success,	 the	 Company	 has	 focused	 on	 education	 and	
enterprise,	 health	 and	 welfare	 and	 the	 environment.	 Filtrona’s	 support	 	
is	 driven	 at	 a	 local	 rather	 than	 a	 corporate	 level.	 The	 approach	 is	 to	 	
support	 and	 enhance	 employee	 efforts	 in	 their	 communities	 through	 	
the	 application	 of	 the	 Company's	 resources.	 In	 pursuit	 of	 its	 aims	 within	 	
the	 community,	 Filtrona	 has	 developed	 targeted	 programmes	 for	 local	
communities,	 often	 involving	 commercial	 sponsorship	 and	 significant	
employee	 engagement	 through	 direct	 involvement	 or	 secondment.

Directors’	 Report
45 The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 Corporate	 Governance	|	Board	 of	 Directors On	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 I	 am	 pleased	 	
to	 present	 the	 Corporate	 Governance	
Report	 for	 2011
Review	 of	 2011
With	 the	 appointment	 of	 Colin	 Day	 as	 Chief	 Executive	 in	 April	 2011,	 	
there	 has	 been	 a	 clear	 acceleration	 in	 the	 pace	 of	 change	 within	 Filtrona	 	
as	 the	 Company	 focuses	 on	 the	 delivery	 of	 the	 growth	 objectives	 outlined	
in	 the	 Vision	 2015	 strategy	 initiated	 by	 Colin.	 The	 Board	 has	 continued	 to	
devote	 time	 to	 its	 usual	 responsibilities	 such	 as	 the	 monitoring	 of	 financial	
and	 operational	 performance	 and	 approving	 the	 plan	 and	 targets	 for	 	
the	 year	 ahead.	 However,	 a	 significant	 amount	 of	 the	 Board’s	 discussions	
during	 2011	 centred	 on	 the	 development	 of	 the	 Vision	 2015	 strategy,	 	
which	 was	 introduced	 to	 shareholders	 with	 the	 half	 year	 results	 in	 	
August	 2011.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Board	 reviewed	 other	 key	 initiatives,	 such	 	
as	 the	 acquisitions	 of	 Reid	 Supply	 and	 Richco,	 Inc.	 and	 the	 development	 	
of	 and	 investment	 in	 growth	 opportunities	 across	 new	 markets	 and	 	
in	 new geographies.	
Corporate	 governance	 development
Good	 governance,	 based	 on	 an	 effective	 Board,	 supports	 the	 delivery	 of	
sustainable	 long-term	 value	 for	 Filtrona	 shareholders.	 This	 includes	 proper	
internal	 controls	 and	 processes,	 a	 comprehensive	 understanding	 of	 risk	 	
and	 opportunity,	 a	 rigorous	 approach	 to	 performance	 management	 and	
strict	 commitment	 to	 transparency	 and	 integrity.
I	 am	 satisfied	 that	 the	 Board	 is	 well	 balanced	 in	 its	 mix	 of	 skills,	 experience	
and	 knowledge,	 to	 manage	 the Company	 and	 lead	 it	 through	 to	 the	
Vision 2015	 objectives.	 However,	 we	 shall	 pay	 close	 attention	 to	 the	 Lord	
Davies'	 Report	 which	 encourages	 Board	 diversity	 and	 we	 shall	 look	 	
to	 work	 towards	 those	 objectives	 as	 Board	 rotation	 occurs.
JEFF	 HARRIS	
Chairman
•	 Focused on the development  
of the Vision 2015 strategy
•	 Approved the acquisition of Reid Supply
•	 Approved the acquisition of Richco, Inc.
•	 Approved new five-year revolving  
credit banking facilities
•	 Reviewed senior management  
succession planning
•	 Approved a new Group Risk Policy
•	 Endorsed the establishment of the  
Group Management Committee
•	 Documented the responsibilities of the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director
The	 Board	 has	 taken	 steps	 to	 facilitate	 the	 better	 use	 of	 its	 time,	 	
avoiding	 the	 default	 to	 lengthy	 formal	 presentations	 which	 restrict	 	
the	 opportunity	 for	 challenge	 and	 discussion,	 while	 Board	 papers	 are	 	
kept	 increasingly	 concise	 and	 clearly	 focused	 on	 key	 points.	 There	 is	 	
an	 increased	 onus	 on	 Board	 members	 to	 be	 well	 prepared	 and	 ready	 	
to	 contribute	 positively	 and	 challenge	 constructively,	 during	 the	 	
increased	 opportunities	 for	 strategic	 debate.
In	 response	 to	 the	 new	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	 during	 the	 	
year	 there	 was	 a	 formal	 documented	 clarification	 of	 the	 division	 of	
responsibilities	 for	 the	 key	 Board	 positions	 of	 Chairman,	 Chief	 Executive	 	
and	 Senior	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Director	 and	 these	 can	 be	 	
found	 on	 the	 Company	 website	 www.filtrona.com.
Board	 evaluation
Given	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 transition	 during	 the	 first	 half	 of	 the	 year,	 it	 was	
decided	 to	 proceed	 with	 an	 internal	 Board	 review	 during	 2011	 as	 opposed	
to	 the	 external	 exercise	 originally	 intended.	 The	 review	 consisted	 of	 the	
Directors	 responding	 to	 questionnaires	 relating	 to	 the	 performance	 of	 the	
Board	 as	 a	 whole	 and	 its	 various	 Committees.	 The	 positive	 feedback	 from	
the	 questionnaires	 was	 the	 subject	 of	 detailed	 discussion	 both	 within	 the	
formality	 of	 the	 Boardroom	 and	 in	 separate	 informal	 meetings.	 An	 external	
review	 will	 be	 conducted	 during	 2012	 as	 we	 seek	 to	 further	 enhance	 the	
effectiveness	 of	 the	 Filtrona	 Board	 performance.
Talent,	 succession	 planning	 and	 diversity
While	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 primarily	 focuses	 on	 Board	 succession,	
the	 Board’s	 role	 includes	 reviewing	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 executive	 management	 	
and	 the	 processes	 for	 finding	 and	 developing	 future	 talent.	 Filtrona	 has	 	
an	 experienced	 management	 team,	 but	 securing	 sustained	 future	 growth	
of	 the	 Company	 will	 be	 dependent	 in	 part	 on	 the	 creation	 of	 a	 mobile	
international	 talent	 base.	 It	 is	 the	 responsibility	 of	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 	
to	 ensure	 the	 best	 senior	 executives	 are	 appointed	 to	 support	 him	 in	 the	
management	 of	 the	 Company,	 but	 the	 oversight	 of	 the	 management	
succession	 plans	 is	 an	 important	 part	 of	 the	 Board’s	 remit.	
46 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011
Chairman’s	 Letter
2011	 Board	 key	 activities legal	 and	 regulatory	 developments,	 the	 Board	 evaluation	 identified	 that	 	
the	 increasing	 levels	 of	 compliance	 risk	 impacting	 any	 international	 	
business	 such	 as	 Filtrona	 necessitate	 the	 Board	 having	 a	 clear	
understanding	 of	 the	 potential	 issues	 impacting	 the	 Company.	 	
Accordingly,	 it	 is	 intended	 that	 during	 2012	 Board	 agendas	 will	 	
include	 further	 detailed	 presentations	 from	 specialist	 external	 advisers.	
The	 work	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 has	 continued	 to	 focus	 on	 the	 	
integrity	 of	 financial	 reporting	 and	 the	 oversight	 of	 risk	 management	 	
and	 internal	 controls	 across	 the	 Group.	 During	 the	 year	 the	 Company	
continued	 to	 develop	 a	 new	 Assurance	 function,	 covering	 internal	 audit,	
risk	 management	 and	 compliance	 activities,	 and	 it	 is	 anticipated	 that	 	
the	 benefits	 of	 the	 new	 structure	 will	 emerge	 strongly	 during	 2012.	
As	 the	 Board	 seeks	 to	 drive	 opportunities	 for	 the	 long-term	 growth	 	
of	 Filtrona,	 including	 the	 development	 of	 innovative	 new	 products	 for	
introduction	 into	 new	 markets	 in	 new	 geographies,	 the	 requirements	 	
for	 sound	 risk	 management,	 including	 a	 well-defined	 risk	 appetite,	 	
and	 the	 clarity	 of	 risk	 reporting	 take	 on	 ever-increasing	 importance.	 	
The	 strength	 of	 the	 Company’s	 corporate	 values,	 its	 reputation	 and	 	
its	 ability	 to	 deliver	 the	 Vision	 2015	 strategy	 and	 provide	 sustainable	 	
value	 in	 the	 longer	 term,	 all	 depend	 in	 part	 on	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 	
Filtrona’s	 corporate	 governance	 and	 the	 Board	 is	 committed	 to	 	
achieving	 the	 highest	 standards.	
Jeff	 Harris
Chairman
22	 February	 2012
In	 seeking	 to	 further	 develop	 the	 roles	 and	 responsibilities	 of	 senior	
executives	 within	 the	 Company,	 during	 the	 year	 the	 Board	 approved	 	
the	 Chief	 Executive’s	 initiative	 to	 adopt	 a	 new	 executive	 management	
structure	 which	 took	 effect	 from	 1	 January	 2012.	 The	 Executive	 Committee	
and	 the	 Group	 Operating	 Committee	 have	 been	 superseded	 by	 the	 	
Group	 Management	 Committee	 which	 has	 agreed	 levels	 of	 authority	
delegated	 to	 it	 by	 the	 Board.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Company	 has	 developed	 	
the	 Group	 Leadership	 Team	 which	 comprises	 the	 most	 senior	 managers	
from	 across	 the	 Group	 who	 are	 collectively	 charged	 with	 driving	 the	
achievement	 of	 Vision	 2015.
An	 effective	 relationship	 between	 the	 Board	 and	 members	 of	 the	 Group	
Leadership	 Team	 is	 important	 in	 assisting	 the	 Board	 in	 managing	 risk	 	
and	 formulating	 strategy,	 and	 such	 engagement	 also	 serves	 to	 improve	
succession	 planning	 and	 the	 oversight	 of	 human	 resource	 issues.	 The	 	
Board	 evaluation	 reiterated	 the	 benefits	 of	 ensuring	 the	 visibility	 of	 the	
Board	 and	 the	 communication	 of	 its	 work	 throughout	 the	 Company	 as	 	
well	 as	 improving	 the	 development	 of	 management.	 As	 a	 result,	 further	 	
site	 visits	 by	 the	 Board	 including	 opportunities	 to	 engage	 directly	 with	 	
the	 next	 generation	 of	 internal	 talent	 are	 planned	 for	 2012	 and	 beyond.	
Supporting	 the	 motivation,	 attraction	 and	 retention	 of	 the	 key	 talent	 base,	
the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 continued	 to	 balance	 the	 interests	 	
of	 shareholders	 with	 the	 adoption	 of	 appropriate	 incentives	 designed	 	
to	 drive	 the	 sustained	 creation	 of	 value.	 The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 	
has	 focused	 on	 the	 appropriate	 management	 of	 remuneration	 policy	 	
risk	 and	 the	 alignment	 of	 management	 and	 shareholder	 interests	 with	 	
the	 development	 of	 proposals	 based	 on	 an	 increased	 commitment	 to	
individual	 shareholdings	 by	 members	 of	 the	 Group	 Leadership	 Team	 	
and	 the	 adoption	 of	 increasingly	 stretching	 performance	 conditions.	
Assurance
The	 implementation	 of	 the	 Bribery	 Act	 in	 the	 UK	 provided	 further	 focus	 	
on	 all	 areas	 of	 compliance	 across	 the	 Group,	 with	 policy	 and	 guidance	
materials	 being	 supported	 by	 training	 programmes	 and	 externally	 	
facilitated	 reviews.	 Whilst	 the	 Board	 receives	 regular	 briefings	 on	 key

47 The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 Corporate	 Governance	|	Chairman’s	 Letter
2012	 Board	 objectives The	 Filtrona	 Board	 is	 accountable	 to	 all	 the	 	
Company’s	 stakeholders	 for	 the	 standards	 	
of	 governance	 which	 are	 maintained	 across	 	
Filtrona’s	 diverse	 range	 of	 global	 businesses
Filtrona	 confirms	 that	 throughout	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2011	 	
the	 Company	 has	 complied	 with	 the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	
published	 by	 the	 Financial	 Reporting	 Council	 in	 June	 2010	 (the	 “Code”).	 	
A	 copy	 of	 the	 Code	 can	 be	 viewed	 on	 the	 Financial	 Reporting	 Council's	
website	 www.frc.org.uk.
The	 Company	 applies	 the	 Code’s	 principles	 of	 openness,	 integrity	 	
and	 accountability	 through	 its	 own	 behaviour,	 corporate	 governance	 	
best	 practice	 and	 by	 adopting,	 as	 appropriate	 and	 proportionate	 for	 	
a	 company	 of	 the	 size	 and	 nature	 of	 Filtrona,	 recommendations	 of	 	
relevant	 professional	 bodies.
The	 Company’s	 governance	 structure,	 based	 on	 the	 leadership	 principles	 	
of	 the	 Code,	 were	 reviewed	 and	 clarified	 during	 the	 year.	 The	 Board	 is	
collectively	 responsible	 for	 the	 long-term	 success	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 	
its	 role	 is	 to	 provide	 entrepreneurial	 leadership	 of	 the	 Company	 within	 	
a	 framework	 of	 prudent	 and	 effective	 controls	 which	 enables	 risk	 to	 be	
assessed	 and	 managed	 in	 the	 pursuit	 of	 the	 Company’s	 strategic	 objectives.	
Board	 composition	 and	 independence
During	 2011,	 the	 Filtrona	 Board	 continued	 to	 comprise	 a	 Non-Executive	
Chairman,	 two	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 three	 Non-Executive	 Directors.	 	
The	 Board	 is	 of	 the	 view	 that	 it	 has	 a	 highly	 competent	 Chairman	 and	 that	
the	 members	 of	 the	 Board	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 senior	 executive	 teams	
are	 well	 equipped	 to	 drive,	 and	 are	 capable	 of	 delivering,	 the	 Company’s	
Vision	 2015	 strategy.	 The	 Chairman	 and	 each	 of	 the	 other	 Non-Executive	
Directors	 have	 considerable	 international	 experience	 at	 a	 senior	 level	 in	 the	
management	 of	 activities	 broadly	 similar	 to	 those	 carried	 out	 by	 Filtrona	
and	 the	 material	 issues	 likely	 to	 arise	 for	 the	 Company.
Biographical	 details	 of	 all	 the	 current	 Directors	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 44	 to	 45.
The	 roles	 of	 the	 Chairman	 and	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 are	 separately	 held	 and	
are	 so	 defined	 as	 to	 ensure	 a	 clear	 separation	 of	 responsibilities.	 Details	 are	
available	 on	 the	 Company	 website	 www.filtrona.com.	 The	 Chairman	 leads	
the	 Board	 and	 ensures	 its	 effectiveness.	 The	 Chief	 Executive	 is	 responsible	
for	 the	 executive	 management	 and	 performance	 of	 Filtrona’s	 operations.
The	 Senior	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Director	 can	 be	 contacted	 	
via	 the	 Company’s	 registered	 office.	 In	 that	 role	 he	 is	 available	 to	
shareholders	 to	 discuss	 and	 develop	 an	 understanding	 of	 their	 issues	 	
and	 any	 concerns	 which	 cannot	 be	 resolved	 by	 discussions	 with	 the	
Chairman,	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 or	 the	 Group	 Finance	 Director	 or	 where	 	
such	 contact	 is	 inappropriate.	
In	 the	 opinion	 of	 the	 Board,	 Paul	 Drechsler,	 Lars Emilson	 and	 Terry	 Twigger	
are	 each	 considered	 to	 be	 independent	 of	 management	 as	 detailed	 in	 	
the	 Code,	 and	 there	 are	 no	 relationships	 or	 circumstances	 which	 would	
materially	 interfere	 with	 the	 exercise	 of	 their	 independent	 judgement.	
The	 Board	 considers	 that	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 provide	 an	
independent	 view	 in	 Board	 discussions	 and	 in	 the	 development	 of	 the	
Company’s	 strategy.	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 also	 ensure	 a	 sound	 basis	 for	
good	 corporate	 governance	 for	 the	 Company,	 challenging	 management’s	
performance	 and,	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 Executive	 Directors,	 ensuring	
that	 rigorous	 financial	 controls	 and	 systems	 of	 risk	 management	 are	
maintained	 as	 appropriate	 to	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 businesses	 within	 Filtrona.	
The	 Board	 is	 content	 that	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 devote	 sufficient	
time	 to	 the	 business	 of	 Filtrona.	
The	 letters	 of	 appointment	 for	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 are	 available	 	
for	 review	 at	 the	 Company’s	 registered	 office	 and	 prior	 to	 the	 Annual	
General	 Meeting	 (“AGM”).
The	 Company’s	 Articles	 of	 Association	 require	 that	 all	 new	 Directors	 	
seek	 re-election	 to	 the	 Board	 at	 the	 following	 AGM.	 In	 addition,	 	
the	 Board	 has	 agreed	 that,	 in	 compliance	 with	 the	 Code,	 all	 Directors	 	
will	 be	 putting	 themselves	 forward	 for	 re-election	 on	 an	 annual	 basis.	
Following	 the	 Board	 performance	 evaluation	 undertaken	 during	 the	
financial	 year,	 the	 Board	 is	 satisfied	 that	 each	 of	 the	 Directors	 being	 	
put	 forward	 for	 re-election,	 continues	 to	 be	 effective	 and	 that	 their	
ongoing	 commitment	 to	 the	 role	 is	 undiminished.
The	 responsibilities	 of	 the	 Audit,	 Nomination	 and	 Remuneration	
Committees	 are	 defined	 within	 the	 Committees’	 Terms	 of	 Reference,	 	
copies	 of	 which	 are	 available	 at	 www.filtrona.com.
The	 conduct	 of	 Board	 matters
In	 managing	 the	 affairs	 of	 the	 Company,	 the	 Board	 has	 adopted	 	
a	 schedule	 of	 reserved	 matters	 which	 are	 required	 to	 be	 reviewed	 	
by	 it	 including:
•	 Strategy	 and	 resources
•	 Annual	 plan
•	 Treasury	 policies
•	 Major	 capital	 and	 operating	 expenditure	 proposals
•	 Acquisitions	 and	 disposals
•	 Debt	 facilities
•	 Key	 Group	 policies
•	 Appointments	 to	 the	 Board
•	 Systems	 of	 internal	 control
•	 Dividend	 payments
•	 Categories	 of	 public	 announcements
The	 detailed	 implementation	 of	 all	 these	 matters	 and	 general	 operational	
matters	 are	 the	 responsibility	 of	 executive	 senior	 management	 and	 	
regular	 formal	 management	 reports,	 including	 the	 detailed	 monitoring	 	
of	 performance,	 are	 provided	 to	 the	 Board.	
During	 2011,	 the	 Board	 was	 closely	 engaged	 in	 the	 detailed	 monitoring	 	
of	 performance	 and	 the	 actions	 necessary	 to	 maintain	 the	 profitability	 	
of	 the	 Company.	 It	 also	 remained	 focused	 on	 the	 longer-term	 strategic	
objectives	 which	 it	 has	 defined	 and	 the	 appropriate	 management	 of	
particular	 risks	 impacting	 the	 Group.

Non-Executive	 Director
3	
Resigned	 from	 the	 Board	 on	 14	 April	 2011
During	 the	 year	 the	 structure	 of	 the	 executive	 management	 framework	 	
was	 reviewed	 and	 the	 Board	 approved	 the	 replacement	 of	 the	 Executive	
Committee	 and	 the	 Group	 Operating	 Committee	 with	 the	 Group	
Management	 Committee	 (the	 “GMC”).	 The	 roles	 and	 responsibilities	 	
of	 the	 Executive	 Committee	 and	 the	 Group	 Operating	 Committee	 have	 	
been	 combined	 and	 expanded	 with	 the	 endorsement	 of	 the Board.
The	 Board	 believes	 that	 this	 revised	 management	 structure	 will	 ensure	 	
a	 strong	 link	 between	 Filtrona’s	 overall	 corporate	 strategy	 and	 its	
implementation	 within	 an	 effective	 internal	 control	 environment.
Engagement	 with	 management
The	 Board	 receives	 detailed	 reports	 at	 each	 scheduled	 Board	 meeting	 	
on	 the	 operational	 and	 financial	 performance	 of	 the	 businesses	 from	 	
the	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 the	 Group	 Finance	 Director,	 together	 with	 	
regular	 updates	 on	 any	 material	 issues	 which	 may	 impact	 on	 the	 Group.
The	 Board	 receives	 detailed	 presentations	 from	 each	 of	 the	 Managing	
Directors	 or	 Presidents	 of	 the	 divisions	 during	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 	
in	 addition	 to	 reviewing	 their	 respective	 strategic	 plans	 and	 budgets.	 	
The	 Board	 also	 considers	 reports	 from	 senior	 management	 about	 matters	
of	 material	 importance	 to	 the	 Company	 which	 arise	 from	 time	 to	 time.
There	 is	 a	 programme	 of	 meetings,	 both	 formal	 and	 informal,	 with	
members	 of	 the	 senior	 executive	 management	 and	 the	 Board	 has	 the	
opportunity	 to	 engage	 with	 local	 management	 during	 site	 visits.	 The	 	
Board	 derives	 a	 better	 understanding	 of	 the	 Company’s	 operations	 	
and	 business	 model	 as	 a	 result	 of	 such	 contact.
Applying	 Filtrona’s	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 principles
The	 Chief	 Executive	 is	 the	 Director	 with	 primary	 responsibility	 for	 the	
implementation	 and	 integration	 of	 Filtrona’s	 Corporate	 Responsibility	
principles	 across	 the	 Company.	 The	 Group	 Human	 Resources	 Director,	
supported	 by	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 &	 General	 Counsel,	 is	 responsible	 	
for	 co-ordinating	 the	 operation	 of	 the	 detailed	 policies	 on	 human	
resources,	 health	 and	 safety,	 ethics	 and	 the	 environment	 which	 support	
Filtrona’s	 commitment	 to	 its	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 principles.	 Further	
details	 of	 those	 policies	 can	 be	 viewed	 via	 the	 Corporate	 Responsibility	
page	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	 at	 www.filtrona.com.	
Internal	 controls
In	 accordance	 with	 the	 Code,	 the	 Board	 acknowledges	 its	 responsibility	 	
to	 ensure	 that	 an	 adequate	 system	 of	 internal	 controls	 is	 in	 place	 which	 	
is	 essential	 for	 reliable	 financial	 reporting	 and	 also	 for	 the	 effective	
management	 of	 the	 Group.
During	 the	 year	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 completed	 a	 review	 of	 the	
effectiveness	 of	 the	 Group’s	 system	 of	 risk	 management	 and	 internal	
control	 processes	 in	 conjunction	 with	 external	 advisors.	 Following	 	
that	 review	 a	 number	 of	 improvements	 are	 being	 implemented.
The	 Audit	 Committee	 assesses	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 control	 environment	 when	
monitoring	 and	 reviewing	 the	 integrity	 of	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 statements	
and	 any	 significant	 judgements	 that	 were	 made	 in	 their	 preparation.
Filtrona’s	 internal	 controls	 are	 designed	 to	 safeguard	 the	 Company’s	 	
assets	 and	 to	 ensure	 the	 integrity	 and	 reliability	 of	 information	 used	 both	
within	 the	 businesses	 and	 for	 public	 announcements.	 The	 Board	 has	 	
overall	 responsibility	 for	 the	 Company’s	 system	 of	 internal	 control	 and	 	
risk	 management	 and	 for	 reviewing	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 this	 system.	 	
During	 the	 year	 there	 were	 eight	 scheduled	 Board	 meetings,	 one	 of	 	
which	 was	 held	 at	 the	 Coated	 &	 Security	 Products	 facility	 in	 Nottingham,	
UK.	 In	 addition	 to	 the	 scheduled	 formal	 meetings,	 the	 Board	 met	 on	 a	
number	 of	 other	 occasions	 as	 required	 and	 in	 particular,	 reviewed	 in	 detail,	
the	 further	 development	 and	 delivery	 of	 the	 Group	 strategy	 in	 conjunction	
with	 outside	 advisors.	 The	 Chairman	 and	 Chief	 Executive	 maintain	 regular	
contact	 with	 the	 Directors,	 and	 the	 Chairman	 also	 holds	 periodic	 informal	
discussions	 with	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors,	 without	 any	 of	 the	 Executive	
Directors	 being	 present,	 to	 review	 performance,	 discuss	 succession	 issues,	
and	 to	 monitor	 corporate	 control	 mechanisms.	 Plans	 to	 hold	 a	 Board	
meeting	 overseas	 were	 revised	 due	 to	 the	 changing	 components	 of	 the	
Board	 agenda	 at	 that	 time.	 Plans	 are	 in	 place	 for	 a	 Board	 meeting	 to	 be	
held	 overseas	 during 2012.
The	 Chairman,	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 &	 General	
Counsel,	 sets	 the	 programme	 for	 the	 Board	 during	 the	 year.	 The	 Board	
considers	 reports	 from	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 the	 Group	 Finance	 Director	
covering	 operational,	 financial	 performance	 and	 other	 significant	 business	
issues.	 Board	 meetings	 are	 structured	 to	 allow	 open	 discussion,	 and	 all	
Directors	 participate	 in	 determining	 the	 Group’s	 strategy	 and	 regularly	
reviewing	 the	 trading	 and	 financial	 performance	 of	 the	 Company.
The	 internal	 procedures	 implemented	 by	 the	 Company	 to	 ensure	 	
the	 Board	 maintains	 overall	 control	 for	 all	 material	 strategic,	 financial,	
operational	 and	 compliance	 matters	 affecting	 the	 Company	 are	 included	
within	 the	 internal	 control	 section	 of	 this	 Report.
The	 Board	 establishes	 the	 standards	 and	 values	 that	 govern	 the	 Group	 	
and	 agrees	 the	 structure	 of	 the	 Group’s	 internal	 controls.	 The	 Board	 	
looks	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 to	 undertake	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 work	
involved	 in	 monitoring	 and	 seeking	 assurance	 as	 to	 compliance	 with	 	
the	 controls	 within	 this	 framework.	 However,	 the	 Board	 as	 a	 whole	
maintains	 oversight	 of	 such	 important	 matters	 and	 after	 each	 committee	
meeting	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 reports	 on	 the	 matters	
which	 have	 been	 reviewed.
Other	 specific	 responsibilities	 are	 delegated	 to	 the	 Nomination	 and	
Remuneration	 Committees.	 These	 Committees	 report	 as	 appropriate	 	
to	 the	 Board.	
Operational	 matters	 and	 the	 responsibility	 for	 the	 day-to-day	 management	
of	 the	 businesses	 are	 delegated	 to	 the	 Chief	 Executive,	 supported	 by	
members	 of	 senior	 executive	 management	 and	 the	 respective	 divisional	
Managing	 Directors	 or	 Presidents	 as	 appropriate,	 within	 delegated	 authority	 	
limits	 and	 in	 accordance	 with	 clearly	 defined	 systems	 of	 internal	 control.
50 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011
Corporate	 Governance	 Report	 continued Such	 a	 system	 can	 only	 be	 designed	 to	 manage,	 rather	 than	 eliminate,	 	
the	 risk	 of	 failure	 to	 achieve	 business	 objectives	 and	 can	 therefore	 	
only	 provide	 reasonable,	 and	 not	 absolute,	 assurance	 against	 material	
misstatement	 or	 loss.
The	 following	 procedures	 are	 in	 place	 which	 enable	 the	 Board	 	
to	 review	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 system	 of	 internal	 control:
•	 The	 Audit	 Committee	 meets	 regularly	 and	 reviews	 the	 effectiveness	 	
of	 the	 internal	 control	 environment	 of	 the	 Group
•	 The	 Audit	 Committee	 is	 supported	 by	 the	 Internal	 Audit	 function	 	
which	 was	 relaunched	 as	 the	 new	 Group	 Assurance	 function	 in	
January 2012
•	 Risk	 management	 reports	 are	 presented	 which	 detail	 an	 analysis	 of	 the	
key	 risks	 at	 a	 Group	 level,	 summarise	 developments	 potentially	 impacting	
the	 Group	 from	 a	 risk,	 governance	 or	 compliance	 perspective	 and	
propose	 actions	 for	 the	 Company	 in	 response	 to	 such	 developments
•	 The	 Board	 has	 the	 opportunity	 to	 review	 the	 internal	 control	 	
environment	 at	 local	 sites	 when	 Board	 meetings	 are	 held	 away	 	
from	 the	 Company’s	 head	 office
•	 Every	 month	 each	 division	 submits	 detailed	 operating	 and	 financial	
reports	 covering	 all	 aspects	 of	 performance.	 These	 are	 reviewed	 	
within	 the	 Group’s	 central	 finance	 function	 and	 summary	 reports	 	
are	 communicated	 to	 the	 GMC	 and	 the	 Board
•	 Certificates	 are	 required	 from	 the	 businesses	 to	 confirm	 compliance	 	
with	 the	 Group’s	 policies	 and	 procedures
•	 Self-certification	 is	 required	 from	 all	 businesses	 and	 divisions	 at	 	
both	 the	 half	 year	 and	 year	 end	 to	 confirm	 compliance	 with	 Group	
financial	 policies	 and	 procedures
The	 external	 auditor	 is	 engaged	 to	 express	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 financial	
statements.	 The	 audit	 includes	 the	 review	 and	 test	 of	 the	 system	 of	 internal	
financial	 control	 and	 the	 data	 contained	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 to	 the	
extent	 necessary	 for	 expressing	 an	 audit	 opinion	 on	 the	 truth	 and	 fairness	
of	 the	 financial	 statements.
Policies	 and	 procedures,	 which	 are	 subject	 to	 ongoing	 review	 and	 updated	
as	 required	 in	 response	 to	 strategic,	 operational,	 business,	 legal	 or	 regulatory	 	
developments,	 with	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 Board	 or	 its	 respective	 Committees	
as	 appropriate,	 are	 communicated	 across	 the	 Group.	 Filtrona's	 internal	
controls	 are	 designed	 to	 ensure	 significant	 risks,	 investment	 decisions	 and	
management	 issues	 are	 identified,	 considered	 and	 escalated	 as	 necessary	 	
at	 the	 earliest	 opportunity.	 Divisional	 Managing	 Directors	 and	 Presidents	
are	 responsible	 for	 ensuring	 the	 communication	 of	 and	 compliance	 with	
Filtrona’s	 internal	 controls	 across	 their	 respective	 divisions.	
The	 Board	 considers	 that	 there	 is	 considerable	 comfort	 in	 the	 fact	 that	 	
the	 Group’s	 cash	 flow	 from	 operating	 activities	 represented	 in	 excess	 of	
100%	 of	 adjusted	 operating	 profit	 in	 2011,	 reflecting	 what	 it	 believes	 	
to	 be	 a	 robust	 control	 environment.
Control	 of	 significant	 risks
The	 Board	 has	 two	 main	 responsibilities	 in	 relation	 to	 risk.	 One	 is	 to	
determine	 the	 risk	 appetite	 and	 communicate	 to	 the	 organisation	 what	
constitutes	 acceptable	 risk-taking.	 The	 second	 responsibility	 which	 is	
delegated	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 is	 to	 oversee	 the	 management	 process	
for	 the	 identification,	 assessment	 and	 mitigation	 of	 risk	 across	 the	 Group.
A	 Group	 Risk	 policy,	 which	 was	 reviewed	 during	 the	 year	 to	 take	 	
into	 consideration	 the	 changes	 to	 the	 Group	 operational	 structure	 	
and	 the	 revised	 Group	 strategy,	 supports	 the	 Board	 in	 fulfilling	 those	
responsibilities	 and	 serves	 to	 reinforce	 the	 risk	 review	 processes	 embedded	
within	 the businesses.	
The	 Board	 is	 of	 the	 view	 that	 a	 rigorous	 ongoing	 process	 for	 identifying,	
evaluating	 and	 managing	 significant	 risks	 faced	 by	 the	 Company	 was	 	
in	 place	 throughout	 2011	 and	 up	 to	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 the	 Annual	
Report	 for	 2011.	
Details	 of	 the	 processes	 the	 Company	 has	 put	 in	 place	 to	 manage	 risk	 	
can	 be	 found	 on	 page	 34	 of	 this	 Report.
Conflict	 of	 interests
The	 Company’s	 Articles	 of	 Association	 permit	 the	 Board	 to	 consider	 and,	 	
if	 it	 sees	 fit,	 to	 authorise	 situations	 where	 a	 Director	 has	 an	 interest	 that	
conflicts,	 or	 may	 possibly	 conflict,	 with	 the	 interests	 of	 the	 Company.	 	
In	 addition,	 the	 Company	 has	 a	 conflict	 of	 interests’	 policy	 governing	 	
the	 responsibilities	 of	 Directors	 in	 such	 situations.	 The	 decision	 to	 authorise	 	
a	 conflict	 of	 interest	 can	 only	 be	 made	 by	 non-conflicted	 Directors	 (those	
who	 have	 no	 interest	 in	 the	 matter	 being	 considered)	 and	 in	 making	 such	 	
a	 decision	 the	 Directors	 must	 act	 honestly	 and	 in	 good	 faith	 when	 giving	
authorisation	 where	 they	 think	 this	 is	 appropriate,	 and	 will	 be	 most	 likely	 	
to	 promote	 the	 Company’s	 success.	 The	 Company	 Secretary	 &	 General	
Counsel	 maintains	 a	 register	 of	 Directors’	 interests	 so	 that	 any	 potential	
concerns	 are	 addressed	 before	 any	 material	 concerns	 may	 arise.	 During	 	
the	 course	 of	 the	 year,	 there	 were	 no	 material	 conflicts	 of	 interest	
impacting	 on	 the	 conduct	 of	 the	 Board’s	 activities.
Information	 and	 professional	 development
The	 Chairman,	 supported	 by	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 &	 General	 Counsel,	
takes	 responsibility	 for	 ensuring	 that	 the	 Directors	 receive	 accurate,	 timely	
and	 clear	 information.
On	 appointment	 an	 induction	 programme	 tailored	 to	 their	 individual	 	
needs	 is	 available	 to	 Directors	 and	 designed	 to	 assist	 them	 in	 their	
understanding	 of	 Filtrona	 and	 its	 operations.	 Throughout	 a	 Director’s	
tenure	 they	 are	 encouraged	 to	 develop	 their	 knowledge	 of	 the	 Group	
through	 meetings	 with	 senior	 management	 and	 site	 visits.	 Directors	 are	
also	 provided	 with	 updates,	 as	 appropriate,	 on	 matters	 such	 as	 fiduciary	
duties,	 Companies	 Act	 requirements,	 share	 dealing	 restrictions	 and	
corporate	 governance	 matters.	
All	 Directors	 have	 access	 to	 the	 advice	 and	 services	 of	 the	 Company	
Secretary	 &	 General	 Counsel	 who	 is	 responsible	 to	 the	 Chairman	 for	
ensuring	 that	 Board	 procedures	 are	 complied	 with	 and	 that	 applicable	 	
rules	 and	 regulations	 are	 followed.	 During	 the	 year	 under	 review	 the	
Company	 Secretary	 &	 General	 Counsel’s	 advice	 was	 sought	 in	 relation	 to	
share	 dealings.	 In	 furtherance	 of	 their	 duties,	 there	 are	 agreed	 procedures	
for	 the	 Directors	 to	 take	 independent	 professional	 advice,	 if	 necessary,	 	
at	 the	 Company’s	 expense.	 No	 Director	 took	 independent	 professional	
advice	 during	 the	 year.
Performance	 evaluation	
An	 internal	 Board	 review	 was	 held	 during	 2011.	 The	 review	 consisted	 of	 	
the	 Directors	 responding	 to	 questionnaires	 relating	 to	 the	 performance	 	
of	 the	 Board	 as	 a	 whole	 and	 its	 various	 Committees.	 The	 positive	 feedback	
from	 the	 questionnaires	 was	 the	 subject	 of	 detailed	 discussion	 both	 	
within	 the	 formality	 of	 the	 Boardroom	 and	 in	 separate	 informal	 meetings.	 	
An	 external	 review	 will	 be	 conducted	 during	 2012	 as	 the	 Company	 seeks	 	
to	 further	 enhance	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Filtrona	 Board	 performance.
The	 performance	 of	 individual	 Directors	 was	 also	 the	 subject	 of	 discussion	
led	 by	 the	 Chairman.
Directors’	 Report
51 The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 Corporate	 Governance	|	Corporate	 Governance	 Report Shareholder	 communications
Filtrona	 seeks	 to	 maintain	 open	 and	 transparent	 relationships	 with	 	
its	 shareholders	 and	 other	 stakeholders,	 including	 providers	 of	 finance,	
customers	 and	 suppliers.	 This	 is	 achieved	 by	 regular	 updates	 through	 press	
announcements,	 the	 corporate	 website	 and	 other	 published	 material.
The	 Company	 also	 communicates	 regularly	 with	 its	 major	 institutional	
shareholders	 and	 ensures	 that	 all	 the	 Directors,	 including	 the	 Non-Executive	
Directors,	 have	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 views	 and	 concerns	 of	 major	
shareholders	 and	 are	 able	 to	 explain	 business	 developments	 and	 financial	
results	 as	 appropriate.	 The	 Chief	 Executive,	 the	 Group	 Finance	 Director	 	
and	 the	 Corporate	 Affairs	 Director	 have	 primary	 responsibility	 for	 investor	
relations.	 Presentations	 for	 analysts	 and	 institutional	 shareholders	 were	 	
held	 during	 the	 year	 and	 meetings	 were	 also	 held	 with	 key	 institutional	
investors	 to	 discuss	 strategy,	 financial	 performance	 and	 investment	
activities.	 Slide	 presentations	 are	 made	 immediately	 available	 after	 the	 	
full	 year	 and	 half	 year	 results	 and	 are	 also	 available	 on	 the	 Company’s	
website	 to	 view	 and	 download.
All	 shareholders	 have	 the	 opportunity	 to	 meet	 any	 of	 the	 Directors	 	
of	 the	 Company	 should	 they	 so	 wish.	 Feedback	 from	 meetings	 with	
shareholders	 is	 provided	 to	 the	 Board	 so	 they	 are	 aware	 of	 any	 issues	 	
or	 concerns.	 Additionally,	 the	 Board	 uses	 the	 AGM	 as	 an	 occasion	 to	
communicate	 with	 all	 shareholders,	 including	 private	 investors,	 who	 are	
provided	 with	 the	 opportunity	 to	 question	 the	 Directors.	
At	 the	 AGM	 the	 level	 of	 proxy	 votes	 lodged	 on	 each	 resolution	 will	 be	
made	 available,	 both	 at	 the	 meeting	 and	 subsequently	 on	 the	 Company’s	
website.	 Each	 substantially	 separate	 issue	 is	 presented	 as	 a	 separate	
resolution	 and	 the	 Chairmen	 of	 the	 Audit,	 Nomination	 and	 Remuneration	
Committees	 are	 available	 to	 answer	 questions	 from	 shareholders.
The	 Notice	 of	 the	 AGM	 and	 related	 papers	 will	 be	 posted	 to	 shareholders	
more	 than	 20	 working	 days	 before	 the	 AGM.
Financial	 reporting
The	 Directors	 have	 acknowledged,	 in	 the	 Statement	 of	 Directors’	
Responsibilities	 set	 out	 on	 page	 67,	 their	 responsibility	 for	 preparing	 	
the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Group.	 The	 external	
auditor	 has	 included,	 in	 the	 Independent	 Auditor’s	 Report	 set	 out	 on

•	 Reviewed	 the	 succession	 planning	 for	 the	 Board	 and	 senior	 executives
•	 Reviewed	 in	 detail	 the	 key	 issues	 arising	 out	 of	 the	 Lord	 Davies’	 Report	 	
having	 regard	 in	 particular	 to	 the	 composition	 of	 the	 Company’s	 Board	
and	 the	 benefits	 of	 diversity
•	 Reviewed	 the	 Group	 Conflict	 of	 Interests	 policy	 and	 register	 and	 was

The	 Nomination	 Committee	 is	 responsible	 for	 selecting	 and	 recommending	
candidates	 for	 appointment	 as	 Executive	 and	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 	
of	 the	 Company.	 In	 furtherance	 of	 these	 duties	 and	 when	 considering	
succession	 planning,	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 looks	 at	 the	 balance,	
structure	 and	 composition	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 takes	 into	 account	 the	 future	
challenges	 and	 opportunities	 facing	 the	 Company.	
While	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 and	 the	 Board	 as	 a	 whole	 supports	 	
the	 spirit	 of	 the	 recommendations	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Lord	 Davies'	 Report	
“Women	 on	 Boards”	 in	 securing	 the	 right	 combination	 of	 skills,	 	
experience	 and	 expertise	 on	 the	 Board	 to	 effectively	 lead	 the	 sustainable	
growth	 and	 success	 of	 the	 Company	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 all	 stakeholders,	 	
the	 fundamental	 objective	 must	 be	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 best	 people	 are	
appointed	 to	 do	 the	 best	 job	 for	 Filtrona.	 Appointing	 people	 on	 merit	
without	 any	 form	 of	 discrimination	 is	 a	 key	 component	 of	 Filtrona	 policies	
across	 all	 its	 international	 operations	 at	 all	 levels.	
In	 recognising	 the	 benefits	 of	 diversity	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 development	
of	 any	 robust	 succession	 planning	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 has	
concluded	 that	 any	 future	 engagement	 of	 executive	 search	 agents	 in	
relation	 to	 potential	 appointments	 to	 the	 Board	 should	 include	 a	 specific	
instruction	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 widest	 possible	 field	 of	 female	 candidates	 	
is	 identified	 for	 consideration.	 A	 copy	 of	 the	 Company’s	 statement	 on	
Diversity	 is	 available	 on	 the	 website	 www.filtrona.com.
The	 Audit	 Committee	 supports	 the	 Board	 in	 establishing	 formal	 and	
transparent	 arrangements	 for	 considering	 how	 it	 should	 apply	 the	 required	
financial	 reporting,	 internal	 control	 principles	 and	 risk	 management	
processes	 and	 the	 audit	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company.	
The	 Audit	 Committee	 reports	 to	 the	 full	 Board	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	 but	 	
no	 less	 frequently	 than	 at	 every	 Board	 meeting	 following	 a	 Committee	
meeting.	 There	 is	 an	 annual	 cycle	 of	 items	 that	 are	 to	 be	 considered	 by	 the	
Audit	 Committee.	 The	 timetable	 of	 these	 items	 is	 scheduled	 in	 accordance	
with	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 annual	 audit	 cycle.	 The	 responsibilities	 of	 the	
Audit	 Committee	 are	 defined	 in	 its	 terms	 of	 reference,	 which	 are	 reviewed	
annually,	 copies	 of	 which	 are	 available	 at	 www.filtrona.com.
Engagement of the external auditor
The	 Audit	 Committee	 considers	 annually	 the	 engagement	 of	 the	 external	
auditor	 to	 supply	 non-audit	 services.	 The	 importance	 of	 maintaining	 the	
objectivity	 and	 independence	 of	 the	 external	 auditor,	 by	 minimising	 its	
involvement	 in	 projects	 of	 a	 non-audit	 nature,	 is	 of	 concern	 to	 the	 Audit	
Committee.	 It	 is,	 however,	 also	 acknowledged	 that,	 due	 to	 its	 detailed	
understanding	 of	 the	 Company’s	 business,	 it	 may	 sometimes	 be	 necessary	
to	 involve	 the	 external	 auditor	 in	 non-audit	 related	 work,	 principally	
comprising	 further	 assurance	 services	 relating	 to	 due	 diligence	 and	 other	
duties	 carried	 out	 in	 respect	 of	 acquisitions,	 disposals	 and	 tax	 services.	
The	 Audit	 Committee	 reviews	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 external	 auditor	
on	 an	 annual	 basis.	 There	 are	 no	 contractual	 obligations	 restricting	 the	
Company’s	 choice	 of	 auditor	 and	 no	 auditor	 liability	 agreement	 has	 been	
entered	 into	 by	 the	 Company.	 The	 external	 auditor	 is	 required	 to	 rotate	 the	
audit	 partner	 responsible	 for	 the	 Group	 audit	 every	 five	 years.	 The	 current	
lead	 audit	 partner	 has	 been	 in	 place	 for	 one	 year.	
In	 addition	 to	 the	 annual	 review	 of	 the	 service	 provided	 by	 the	 external	
auditor,	 the	 Company	 considers	 formally	 at	 least	 every	 three	 years	 	
whether	 the	 audit	 might	 be	 provided	 more	 efficiently	 or	 effectively	 	
by	 an	 alternative	 audit	 firm.	 However,	 the	 Company	 may	 put	 the	 	
audit	 out	 to	 tender	 at	 any	 time.

54 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011
Report	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee Advice
During	 the	 year,	 Filtrona’s	 Group	 Human	 Resources	 Director	 was	 	
invited	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 to	 provide	 views	 and	 advice.	 	
In	 addition,	 with	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee,	 the	
Company	 received	 services	 and	 advice	 from	 the	 following	 independent	 	
and	 expert	 consultants:
•	 New	 Bridge	 Street,	 a	 part	 of	 Aon	 Hewitt,	 who	 provided	 advice	 	
on	 the	 Company’s	 long-term	 share	 incentive	 plans	 and	 on	 the	
remuneration	 of	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 other	 senior	 executives	
within	 the	 Company
•	 Mercers	 Human	 Resource	 Consulting	 (“Mercers”)	 who	 provided	 	
advice	 and	 information	 on	 pension	 matters
Punter	 Southall	 provided	 investment	 consulting	 services	 to	 the	 	
Trustees	 of	 the	 UK	 pension	 schemes	 and	 Aon	 Hewitt	 provided	 	
actuarial	 advice	 to	 the	 Company	 for	 the	 US	 pension	 schemes.
In	 addition,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 took	 account	 of	 the	 advice	
provided	 to	 the	 Company	 by	 PricewaterhouseCoopers	 in	 relation	 to	 	
the	 actuarial	 valuation	 of	 the	 UK	 pension	 schemes	 and	 the	 actions	 	
taken	 to	 manage	 the	 liabilities	 of	 those	 schemes.	
Remuneration	 policy
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 determines	 and	 recommends	 to	 the	 	
Board	 the	 framework	 for	 the	 remuneration	 of	 the	 Executive	 Directors.	 	
The	 Chief	 Executive’s	 remuneration	 proposals	 for	 the	 members	 of	 the	
Group	 Management	 Committee	 are	 reviewed	 by	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee	 and	 recommendations	 are	 made	 to	 the	 Board.	
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 also	 takes	 note	 of	 the	 remuneration	 	
policy	 as	 detailed	 by	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 in	 respect	 of	 other	 levels	 of	
management	 in	 the	 Company	 and	 makes	 such	 recommendations	 to	 	
the	 Chief	 Executive	 as	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 deems	 appropriate.	 	
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 regard	 to	 the	 proposed	 remuneration	
policy	 for	 other	 management	 and	 employees	 across	 the	 Group,	 when	
determining	 recommendations	 on	 remuneration	 for	 the	 Executive	 	
Directors	 and	 other	 senior	 executives.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 reviewed	 the	 risks	 surrounding	 	
the	 Company’s	 existing	 remuneration	 policies	 and	 the	 proposed	 	
new	 incentive	 arrangements	 in	 seeking	 to	 ensure	 that	 an	 appropriate	
balance	 was	 maintained	 in	 aligning	 the	 interests	 of	 the	 Company’s	 	
senior	 executives	 and	 shareholders.
The	 remuneration	 of	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	
Board	 is	 the	 responsibility	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee,	 and	 the	
remuneration	 of	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 is	 the	 responsibility	 of	 	
the	 Board	 as	 a	 whole.	 No	 Director	 is	 involved	 in	 determining	 or	 voting	 	
on	 his	 own	 remuneration.
In	 determining	 the	 policy	 for	 the	 Executive	 Directors,	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee’s	 objective	 is	 to	 ensure	 that	 those	 individuals	 are	 provided	 	
with	 appropriate	 incentives	 to	 encourage	 enhanced	 performance	 and	 	
are,	 in	 a	 fair	 and	 responsible	 manner	 having	 regard	 to	 the	 long-term	
performance	 of	 the	 Company,	 rewarded	 for	 their	 individual	 contributions	
to	 the	 success	 of	 the	 Company.
Alignment	 with	 Group	 strategy
The	 Board	 as	 a	 whole	 establishes	 the	 remuneration	 policy	 and	 it	 	
considers	 the	 alignment	 of	 Group	 performance	 and	 the	 remuneration	 	
of	 its	 senior	 executives,	 including	 the	 Executive	 Directors,	 to	 be	 of	 the	
utmost	 importance.	 It	 believes	 that	 senior	 management	 should	 be	 	
highly	 rewarded	 (on	 a	 market	 competitive	 basis)	 for	 the	 delivery	 of	
stretching	 goals	 but	 should	 receive	 reduced	 rewards	 when	 the	 business	
does	 not	 perform	 to	 expectations.	 To	 achieve	 this	 alignment,	 Filtrona’s	
remuneration	 package	 is	 leveraged	 with	 a	 high	 percentage	 of	 pay	 	
“at	 risk”	 against	 the	 achievement	 of	 stretching	 goals.	 Furthermore	 	
one	 half	 of	 any	 bonus	 for	 Executive	 Directors	 is	 delivered	 in	 the	 form	 of	 	
Filtrona	 shares	 which	 will	 vest	 after	 a	 three	 year	 period.	 These	 requirements	
closely	 tie	 the	 long-term	 value	 of	 executive	 remuneration	 to	 the	 long-term	
interests	 of	 shareholders.
As	 set	 out	 on	 page	 10	 to	 13,	 Filtrona's	 Vision 2015	 strategy	 seeks	 to	 create	
sustainable	 shareholder	 value	 through	 the	 delivery	 of	 balanced,	 profitable	
growth	 in	 its	 existing	 and	 future	 opportunity	 markets	 and	 technologies.	
The	 strategy	 also	 calls	 for	 strong	 conversion	 of	 profit	 into	 cash.	 Those	
priorities	 are	 reflected	 closely	 in	 the	 design	 of	 the	 remuneration	 packages	
which	 seek	 to	 drive	 their	 delivery	 through	 a	 combination	 of	 financially	
driven	 targets,	 key	 personal	 objectives	 based	 around	 operational	 issues	 	
and	 relative	 shareholder	 return.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 believes	 that	 the	 remuneration	 packages	 	
for	 senior	 executives	 including	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 for	 2012	 should	
consist	 of:
•	 Basic	 salary	 –	 Internal	 and	 external	 parity	 in	 basic	 salary	 positioning	 	
is	 an	 important	 contributor	 to	 a	 motivational	 remuneration	 package.	 	
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 takes	 into	 account	 a	 range	 of	 factors,	
including	 individual	 and	 corporate	 performance,	 and	 pay	 and	
employment	 conditions	 elsewhere	 across	 the	 Group	 when	 undertaking	
base	 salary reviews
•	 Annual	 bonus	 plan	 (delivered	 through	 a	 mixture	 of	 cash	 and	 shares)	 –	
Bonus	 structures	 are	 effective	 if	 they	 help	 drive	 the	 achievement	 of	
targets,	 while	 respecting	 the	 Company’s	 appetite	 for	 risk	 and	 allowing	
for	 sustained	 profitable	 growth.	 The	 targets	 set	 should	 not	 provide	 an	
incentive	 to	 promote	 behaviours	 which	 would	 be	 detrimental	 to	 the	
Company’s	 long-term	 interests.	 As	 such,	 management	 must	 provide	
robust	 justification	 for	 the	 targets	 it	 recommends.	 The	 Remuneration	
Committee	 assures	 itself	 that	 the	 targets	 provide	 appropriate	 incentives	
and	 are	 sufficiently	 challenging,	 but	 remain	 achievable
•	 Long-term	 incentive	 plan	 –	 Performance	 shares	 granted	 under	 the	 	
LTIP	 encourage	 a	 longer-term	 focus	 on	 both	 Earnings	 per	 Share	 (“EPS”)	
and	 relative	 Total	 Shareholder	 Return	 (“TSR”).	 These	 metrics	 measure	
how	 the	 Company	 is	 performing	 for	 shareholders
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 considers	 all	 these	 elements,	 plus	 pension	
and	 other	 benefits,	 as	 a	 whole.	 It	 looks	 to	 ensure	 that	 an	 appropriate	
balance	 is	 maintained	 between	 them	 so	 that	 the	 need	 for	 both	 short-term	
success	 and	 long-term	 sustainable	 growth	 is	 recognised.	 The	 Remuneration	
Committee	 also	 ensures	 that	 the	 non-financial	 business	 measures	 and	
individual	 objectives	 reflect	 adequately	 the	 Company’s	 environmental,	 	
social	 and	 governance	 responsibilities.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 been	 consulting	 with	 leading	
shareholders	 and	 their	 representative	 bodies	 on	 changes	 to	 packages	 	
for	 senior	 management	 (including	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 and	 the	 Group	
Finance	 Director)	 for	 2012.	 The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 considered	 	
Directors’	 Report
55 The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 Corporate	 Governance	|	Report	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee at	 length	 the	 development	 of	 the	 strategy	 to	 deliver	 future	 growth	 	
for	 Filtrona	 and	 the	 timing	 of	 any	 changes	 to	 the	 existing	 executive	
reward	 structure.	 The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 felt	 that	 it	 was	 right	 	
to	 wait	 until	 the	 strategy,	 that	 Colin	 Day	 initiated	 following	 his	 arrival	 	
at	 the	 company	 in	 April	 2011,	 had	 started	 to	 bear	 fruit	 before	 bringing	
the	 proposals	 to	 shareholders	 for	 consideration.
The	 fundamental	 principles	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 followed	 	
in	 redesigning	 reward	 structures	 for	 senior	 management	 are:
•	 To	 reflect	 the	 Company’s	 Vision	 2015	 strategy	 (as	 set	 out	 	
in	 the	 Company’s	 results	 presentations	 for	 2011)
•	 To	 ensure	 that	 annual	 bonus	 metrics	 and	 targets	 provide	 	
executives	 reward	 for	 delivering	 the	 business	 objectives	 of:
	 – Above	 industry	 average	 revenue	 growth
	 – Continued	 margin	 improvement
	 – Strong	 cash	 flow	 generation	 and	 disciplined	 use	 of	 capital
•	 Delivery	 of	 performance	 annually,	 across	 a	 broad	 foundation	 	
of	 business	 fundamentals	 which	 should	 lead	 to	 growth	 in	 EPS,	 	
a	 key	 metric	 for	 shareholders
•	 Focus	 rewards	 so	 they	 deliver	 if	 the	 Company	 delivers	 EPS	 growth	 	
in	 line	 with	 stretching	 targets
•	 Create	 more	 stretching	 financial	 targets	 for	 incentives	 that	 reflect	 	
a	 step	 change	 in	 business	 performance
•	 Reward	 executives	 well	 if	 they	 deliver	 outstanding	 performance	 	
and	 create	 significant	 sustainable	 shareholder	 value
•	 Provide	 no	 additional	 reward	 for	 the	 same	 financial	 performance
•	 Change	 the	 culture	 of	 Filtrona	 by	 requiring	 executives	 to	 hold	 	
significant	 shareholdings	 in	 the	 Company
•	 Reward	 executives	 for	 organic	 growth,	 and	 adjust	 targets	 	
for	 M&A	 activity
•	 Adopt	 clawback	 provisions	 to	 safeguard	 shareholders’	 interests
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 met	 on	 several	 occasions	 to	 	
consider	 all	 the	 feedback	 from	 shareholders	 and	 settled	 on	 proposals	 	
(“the	 Proposals”)	 which	 maintain	 a	 straightforward	 structure,	 utilising	
existing	 plans	 and	 performance	 measures	 rather	 than	 introducing	 	
new	 ones.	 The	 changes	 create	 increased	 share	 ownership	 with	 more	
stretching	 targets	 linked	 with	 higher	 potential	 incentive	 reward	 in	 	
order	 to	 secure	 greater	 alignment	 with	 shareholder	 interests.
These	 changes	 maintain	 the	 structure	 and	 focus	 of	 pay	 set	 out	 above.	
The	 specific	 changes	 are:
•	 Salary	 increases	 –	 Intended	 to	 be	 no	 higher	 than	 the	 rate	 applying	 	
to	 other	 executives	 and	 the	 workforce	 in	 general,	 unless	 there	 has	 	
been	 a	 significant	 increase	 in	 the	 size	 of	 the	 Company	 or	 role	 of	 the	
individual.	 The	 increase	 applying	 from	 1	 January	 2012	 is	 2.5%	 for	 	
both	 Executive	 Directors
•	 Annual	 bonus	 plan	 –	 The	 maximum	 bonus	 entitlement	 will	 be	 	
increased	 by	 25%	 of	 salary	 for	 each	 Executive	 Director,	 taking	 	
Colin	 Day	 to	 150%	 of	 salary	 and	 Steve Crummett	 to	 125%	 of	 salary
	 – The	 bonus	 should	 reward	 executives	 for	 above	 industry	 average	
revenue	 growth,	 continued	 margin	 improvement	 and	 strong	 	
cash	 flow	 generation	 and	 disciplined	 use	 of	 cash.	 To	 achieve	 this,	
tougher	 more	 balanced	 measures	 and	 targets	 will	 be	 introduced	 	
with	 80%	 based	 on	 a	 matrix	 of	 revenue	 and	 profit	 targets	 	
(such	 that	 strong	 performance	 on	 both	 measures	 will	 be	 needed).	 	
The	 remaining	 20%	 will	 be	 based	 equally	 on	 cash	 targets	 and	
personal	 goals.	 This	 portfolio	 of	 measures	 and	 targets	 means	 	
that	 it	 will	 be	 significantly	 harder	 for	 high	 levels	 of	 bonus	 to	 	
be	 paid	 to	 executives	 than	 in	 the	 past,	 since	 all	 of	 the	 targets	 	
spread	 across	 different	 measures	 will	 need	 to	 be	 met	 at	 the	 	
same	 time	 for	 a	 full	 bonus	 to	 be	 earned
	 – The	 targets	 set	 will	 be	 disclosed	 retrospectively	 alongside	 the	
performance	 achieved	 and	 levels	 of	 payout.	 Half	 of	 the	 annual	
bonus	 will	 continue	 to	 be	 payable	 in	 cash	 and	 the	 other	 half

Share	 ownership	 guidelines
In	 order	 to	 align	 the	 interests	 of	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 other	 senior	
executives	 with	 those	 of	 the	 shareholders,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	
has	 established	 guidelines	 recommending	 that	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 	
and	 other	 senior	 executives	 should	 build	 a	 minimum	 shareholding	 in	 the	
Company	 over	 a	 five	 year	 period.	 For	 Executive	 Directors,	 if	 changes	 are	
made	 to	 remuneration	 packages	 for	 2012,	 then	 the	 guideline	 limit	 will	 	
be	 increased	 from	 100%	 to	 300%	 of	 basic	 salary	 for	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 	
and	 to	 200%	 for	 the	 Group	 Finance	 Director.	 Shares	 held	 in	 unvested	 LTIPs	
are	 not	 taken	 into	 account	 in	 assessing	 compliance	 with	 this guideline.
The	 current	 requirement	 is	 100%	 of	 salary	 to	 be	 built	 up	 over	 five	 years.
As	 at	 31	 December	 2011	 Colin	 Day	 held	 shares	 to	 the	 value	 of	 175%	 	
of	 basic	 salary	 and	 Steve	 Crummett	 held	 shares	 to	 the	 value	 of	 more	 	
than	 200%	 of	 basic	 salary.
Non-Executive	 Directors	 are	 encouraged,	 under	 their	 letters	 	
of	 appointment,	 to	 own	 a	 minimum	 of	 7,500	 shares.
Details	 of	 the	 Directors’	 shareholdings	 can	 be	 found	 on	 page	 63.
Summary	 of	 components	 of	 Executive	 Directors’	
remuneration	 for	 2012
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 structures	 senior	 executive	 remuneration	 in	
two	 distinct	 parts	 (i)	 fixed	 remuneration	 of	 basic	 salary,	 pension	 and	 benefits	 	
and	 (ii)	 variable	 performance-related	 remuneration	 in	 the	 form	 of	 cash	
bonuses,	 deferred	 share	 bonuses	 and	 long-term	 incentive arrangements.
Remuneration	 for	 Executive	 Directors	 is	 structured	 so	 that	 the	 variable	
(performance-related)	 pay	 element	 forms	 a	 significant	 portion	 of	 each	
package.	 The	 majority	 of	 total	 remuneration	 at	 the	 maximum	 performance	
level	 will	 derive	 from	 the	 Company’s	 long-term	 incentive	 arrangements,	
which	 are	 strongly	 aligned	 to	 the	 Company’s	 strategic	 objective	 to	 secure	
long-term	 shareholder	 value.

58 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011
Report	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 continued Annual bonuses
Under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 annual	 bonus	 arrangements	 for	 2011,	 Colin	 Day	
was	 potentially	 entitled	 to	 a	 maximum	 bonus	 of	 up	 to	 125%	 of	 basic	 	
salary,	 pro	 rata	 from	 the	 date	 of	 his	 appointment.	 Mark	 Harper	 and	 	
Steve	 Crummett	 were	 each	 potentially	 entitled	 to	 a	 maximum	 bonus	 	
of	 up	 to	 100%	 of	 basic	 salary	 pro	 rata	 according	 to	 the	 period	 of	
employment.	 Bonus	 payments	 are	 normally	 made	 50%	 in	 cash	 and	 	
50%	 in	 shares	 in	 the	 Company,	 the	 entitlement	 to	 such	 shares	 being	
deferred	 for	 three	 years,	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 DASB.	 	
Mark	 Harper	 will	 have	 his	 total	 bonus	 for	 2011	 paid	 in	 cash,	 in	 	
accordance	 with	 the	 terms	 agreed	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 	
in	 relation	 to	 his	 retirement	 from	 the	 Company	 in	 May 2011.
For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2011,	 the	 financial	 performance	 targets,	
accounting	 for	 80%	 of	 the	 bonus	 opportunity,	 were	 approved	 by	 the	
Remuneration	 Committee.	 These	 were	 based	 upon	 Filtrona’s	 adjusted	
operating	 profit	 and,	 with	 reference	 to	 continuing	 operations,	 adjusted	
earnings	 per	 share	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates	 relative	 to	 the	 prior	 year.	
Company	 performance	 was	 required	 to	 reach	 a	 minimum	 threshold	
operating	 profit	 of	 £76.5m	 for	 a	 cash	 bonus	 of	 12%	 of	 basic	 salary	 	
to	 be payable.
In	 addition	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 had	 the	 opportunity,	 subject	 to	 the	
achievement	 of	 personal	 objectives	 to	 be	 entitled	 to	 a	 bonus	 of	 up	 to	 	
20%	 of	 salary.	 These	 objectives	 were	 met.
For	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2011,	 the	 Company	 exceeded	 the	 	
stretch	 performance	 of	 adjusted	 operating	 profit	 of	 £86.0m,	 at	 budgeted	
exchange	 rates.	 As	 a	 result,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 approved	 a	 	
total	 bonus	 of	 125%	 of	 basic	 salary	 for	 Colin	 Day,	 100%	 of	 basic	 salary	 	
for	 Steve Crummett	 and	 100%	 of	 basic	 salary	 for	 Mark	 Harper	 pro-rated	
for	 service	 in	 the	 year.
Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan 
The	 DASB	 provides	 for	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 other	 senior	 executives	 	
to	 receive	 existing	 issued	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 for	 nil	 payment.	
The	 number	 of	 shares	 subject	 to	 an	 award	 is	 determined	 at	 the	 time	 the	
award	 is	 granted,	 based	 upon	 the	 performance	 in	 Filtrona’s	 preceding	
financial	 year	 of	 the	 participant	 and	 /	 or	 the	 Company	 and	 /	 or	 the	 division	 	
in	 which	 the	 participant	 worked.
Under	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 DASB	 the	 aggregate	 value	 of	 shares	 made	 subject	 	
to	 awards	 granted	 to	 a	 participant	 in	 any	 one	 financial	 year	 may	 not	 	
exceed	 100%	 of	 their	 basic	 salary	 as	 at	 the	 award	 date.	 The	 Remuneration	
Committee	 has	 determined	 that,	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Company’s	 bonus	
arrangements,	 awards	 under	 DASB	 will	 not	 normally	 exceed	 one	 half	 of	 	
the	 total	 annual	 bonus.
Shares	 awarded	 under	 the	 DASB	 are	 held	 in	 trust	 until	 1	 March	 in	 the	 	
third	 calendar	 year	 after	 the	 year	 in	 which	 the	 award	 was	 made	 or	 any	 	
such	 other	 later	 date	 as	 the	 Company	 may	 determine	 is	 reasonably	
practicable,	 at	 which	 point	 they	 are	 transferred	 to	 the	 participant	 	
subject	 to	 the	 participant’s	 continued	 employment	 within	 the	 Group.	
From	 2010	 awards	 onwards,	 the	 Committee	 has	 retained	 the	 discretion	 to	
reduce	 the	 size	 of	 unvested	 DASB	 awards	 if	 it	 is	 found	 that	 the	 performance	 	
on	 which	 the	 original	 award	 was	 determined	 was	 materially	 misstated.
Executive share-based incentive plans
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 strongly	 believes	 that	 offering	 Executive	
Directors	 and	 nominated	 senior	 executives	 the	 opportunity	 to	 be	 awarded	
shares	 in	 the	 Company	 is	 an	 important	 part	 of	 motivating,	 rewarding	 	
and	 retaining	 key	 employees	 so	 that	 they	 may	 drive	 and	 participate	 in	 	
the	 future	 growth	 of	 the	 Company.	 It	 is	 also	 of	 the	 view	 that	 the	 Executive	
Directors	 and	 nominated	 senior	 executives	 should	 be	 encouraged	 to	 invest	
directly	 in	 the	 Company	 through	 the	 purchase	 of	 shares.	 The	 Company’s	
DASB	 is	 intended	 to	 support	 these	 objectives.
The	 award	 of	 shares	 or	 options	 under	 the	 executive	 share-based	 incentive	
plans	 is	 determined	 by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 taking	 into	 account	
the	 role	 of	 the	 individual	 and	 other	 such	 criteria	 as	 they	 may	 determine	
from	 time	 to	 time.	
Awards	 under	 the	 Company’s	 share-based	 incentive	 plans	 will	 be	 satisfied	
using	 market	 purchases,	 new	 issue	 shares	 and	 /	 or	 shares	 held	 in	 treasury.
Long-Term Incentive Plan – Part A – Share Options
The	 LTIP	 Part	 A	 provides	 for	 participants	 to	 receive	 share	 option	 awards	
over	 shares	 worth	 up	 to	 two	 times	 basic	 salary	 or	 £250,000	 (whichever	 	
is	 the	 greater)	 in	 any	 financial	 year,	 subject	 to	 performance	 conditions.	 	
Since	 2008,	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 other	 nominated	 senior	 executives	
have	 not	 been	 eligible	 to	 receive	 awards	 under	 LTIP	 Part	 A	 and	 participation	
in	 LTIP	 Part	 A	 has	 been	 limited	 to	 other	 designated	 employees.
Long-Term Incentive Plan – Part B – Performance Shares
A	 performance	 share	 award	 under	 LTIP	 Part	 B	 consists	 of	 a	 conditional	 	
right	 to	 receive	 shares	 in	 the	 Company,	 subject	 to	 performance	 conditions,	
on	 the	 basis	 described	 below.	 Participants	 make	 no	 payment	 for	 the	 grant	
and	 exercise	 of	 performance	 share	 awards.
Participants	 may	 currently	 receive	 performance	 share	 awards	 over	 	
shares	 worth	 up	 to	 two	 times	 their	 basic	 salary	 in	 any	 financial	 year.	 	
A	 performance	 share	 award	 will	 not	 normally	 be	 exercisable	 before	 	
the	 third	 anniversary	 of	 its	 award	 and	 may	 only	 be	 exercised	 to	 the	 	
extent	 that	 the	 applicable	 performance	 conditions	 have	 been	 satisfied.	 	
The	 awards	 are	 structured	 as	 nil	 cost	 options.	 For	 employees	 based	 	
outside	 the	 US,	 the	 options	 remain	 capable	 of	 being	 exercised	 up	 to	 	
the	 sixth	 anniversary	 of	 grant.	 For	 employees	 based	 in	 the	 US,	 once	 	
the	 performance	 conditions	 have	 been	 satisfied	 the	 options	 must	 be	
exercised	 within	 30 days	 of	 vesting.
For	 awards	 granted	 between	 2008	 and	 2011,	 50%	 of	 the	 awards	 are	
subject	 to	 a	 TSR	 performance	 condition	 and	 50%	 of	 the	 awards	 are	 	
subject	 to	 an	 adjusted	 EPS	 performance	 condition.	
The	 TSR	 performance	 condition	 assesses	 Filtrona’s	 TSR	 performance	 relative	
to	 the	 constituents	 of	 the	 FSTE	 250	 index	 (excluding	 investment	 trusts).	
Performance	 is	 measured	 over	 three	 years	 from	 the	 date	 of	 grant.	 12.5%	 	
of	 the	 award	 vests	 for	 median	 performance,	 increasing	 on	 a	 straight-line	
basis	 to	 50%	 vesting	 for	 upper	 quartile	 performance	 or	 above.
The	 adjusted	 EPS	 performance	 condition	 for	 these	 awards	 requires	 	
the	 Company’s	 earnings	 per	 share	 growth	 (adjusted	 to	 exclude	 items	 	
which	 did	 not	 reflect	 the	 Company’s	 underlying	 financial	 performance	 	
and	 intangible	 amortisation)	 over	 three	 financial	 years	 to	 exceed	 inflation	 	
by	 an	 average	 of	 at	 least	 3%	 per	 annum	 for	 12.5%	 of	 the	 awards	 to	 	
vest.	 The	 proportion	 of	 the	 awards	 vesting	 will	 increase	 on	 a	 straight-line	 	
basis,	 and	 for	 50%	 of	 the	 awards	 to	 vest	 such	 adjusted	 EPS	 growth	 must	 	
exceed	 inflation	 by	 an	 average	 of	 at	 least	 8%	 per	 annum.	 The	 performance	
condition	 will	 be	 tested	 after	 three	 financial	 years	 and	 there	 will	 be	 no	
provision	 for	 retesting.	 To	 the	 extent	 the	 performance	 condition	 has	 	
not	 been	 met	 after	 three	 financial	 years,	 the	 relevant	 awards	 will	 lapse.
It	 is	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee's	 intention	 that	 awards	 granted	 in	
2012 will	 be	 subject	 to	 the	 same	 two	 criteria	 and,	 subject	 to	 shareholder	
approval	 at	 the	 AGM,	 the	 maximum	 potential	 grant	 be	 increased	 	
to	 300%	 of	 salary	 and	 significantly	 more	 demanding	 targets	 for	 EPS	 	
growth	 be	 set.

The	 share	 save	 option	 matured	 in	 May	 2011
A	 total	 of	 1,049,555	 (2010:	 1,342,142)	 share	 incentive	 awards	 were	 	
granted	 to	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 other	 senior	 executives	 under	 the	 	
LTIP	 Part	 B	 and	 the	 DASB	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 31 December 2011.
The	 middle	 market	 price	 of	 an	 ordinary	 share	 in	 the	 Company	 on	
31 December	 2011	 was	 380.4p.	 The	 middle	 market	 price	 of	 an	 ordinary	
share	 in	 the	 Company	 during	 the	 year	 ranged	 from	 248.1p	 to 392.6p.
The	 awards	 granted	 in	 2008	 under	 LTIP	 Part	 B	 were	 subject	 to	 relative	 	
TSR	 performance	 and	 EPS	 targets,	 each	 measure	 accounting	 for	 50%	 of	
the	 award.	 On	 TSR	 performance,	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 respective	 performance	
periods,	 Filtrona	 was	 ranked	 in	 the	 upper	 quartile	 of	 the	 comparator	 group	 	
for	 each	 award.	 The	 EPS	 performance	 targets	 related	 to	 performance	 	
over	 the	 period	 2007	 to	 2010,	 and	 required	 EPS	 growth	 of	 RPI	 +8%	 pa	 	
for	 full	 vesting.	 The	 Company	 achieved	 growth	 in	 adjusted	 EPS	 of	 44%	
over	 this	 period,	 exceeding	 the	 stretch	 target.	 Accordingly,	 both	 awards	
vested	 in full.
The	 awards	 granted	 in	 2009	 and	 2010	 under	 LTIP	 B	 are	 subject	 to	 	
performance	 conditions	 which	 are	 50%	 dependent	 on	 relative	 TSR	
performance	 targets	 and	 50%	 based	 on	 adjusted	 EPS	 performance	 	
targets.	 The	 table	 sets	 out	 the	 potential	 vesting	 for	 these	 awards	 based	 	
on	 Filtrona’s	 TSR	 performance	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2011.	 The	 actual	 level	 	
of	 vesting	 of	 these	 awards	 will	 depend	 on	 the	 Company’s	 performance	 	
as	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 relevant	 performance	 period	 for	 each	 award	 and	
therefore	 may	 differ	 from	 that	 set	 out.
Save As You Earn Scheme 
In	 addition	 to	 the	 LTIP,	 the	 Company	 operates	 a	 Save	 As	 You	 	
Earn	 share	 option	 scheme	 (“SAYE”).	 During	 the	 year	 the	 Company	
launched	 an	 SAYE	 option	 grant	 in March	 2011.
Mark	 Harper	 joined	 the	 SAYE	 in	 2006	 and	 Steve	 Crummett	 joined	 	
the	 SAYE	 in	 2008,	 both	 contributed	 the	 statutory	 maximum	 monthly	
amount	 of £250.	
Details	 of	 the	 awards	 granted	 and	 outstanding	 during	 the	 year	 to	 	
Executive	 Directors	 under	 the	 LTIP	 Part	 A	 and	 SAYE	 are	 shown	 below.

The	 graph	 below	 represents	 the	 comparative	 TSR	 performance	 of	 	
the	 Company	 against	 the	 FTSE	 250	 (excluding	 investment	 trusts)	 Index	 	
for	 the	 last	 five	 years.	 The	 index	 has	 been	 selected	 as	 it	 is	 considered	 	
the	 most	 appropriate	 published	 general	 index	 in	 which	 the	 Company	 	
is	 a	 constituent.
Executive	 Directors’	 service	 contracts
The	 policy	 for	 senior	 executive	 service	 contracts	 is	 that	 notice	 periods	 	
will	 normally	 not	 exceed	 12	 months.	 Colin	 Day	 has	 a	 service	 contract	 	
dated	 1 April	 2011	 and	 Steve	 Crummett	 has	 a	 service	 contract	 dated	
19 March	 2008,	 both	 with	 a	 notice	 period	 of	 12	 months	 from	 either	 	
party.	 The	 service	 contracts	 for	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 are	 available	 	
for	 inspection	 by	 members	 at	 each	 AGM	 and	 during	 normal	 business	 	
hours	 at	 the	 Company’s	 registered	 office.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee’s	 policy	 in	 relation	 to	 termination	 of	 	
service	 contracts	 is	 to	 apply	 an	 appropriate	 level	 of	 mitigation,	 having	
regard	 to	 all	 of	 the	 circumstances	 of	 the	 individual	 and	 the	 termination	 	
of	 employment,	 and	 to	 any	 legal	 advice	 received.	 The	 Company	 has	 the	
right	 to	 make	 a	 payment	 in	 lieu	 of	 notice	 and	 any	 such	 payment	 may	 be	
made	 in	 monthly	 instalments	 at	 the	 Company’s	 discretion	 and	 may	 be	
reduced	 to	 take	 into	 account	 any	 sums	 earned	 during	 the	 payment	
period	 by	 way	 of	 employment elsewhere.
Outside	 appointments
Filtrona	 recognises	 its	 senior	 executives	 can	 benefit	 from	 serving	 in	 	
a	 personal	 capacity	 as	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 of	 non-Filtrona	 Group	
companies.	 It	 is,	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 conscious	 of	 the	 corporate	 governance	
recommendations	 that	 Executive	 Directors	 should	 take	 account	 of	 	
the	 time	 commitment	 required	 by	 a	 non-executive	 position.	 Executive	 	
Directors	 are	 permitted	 to	 accept	 up	 to	 two	 appropriate	 non-executive	
directorships	 offered	 by	 listed	 companies	 and	 other	 organisations,	 which	
provide	 industry	 experience	 or	 public	 service.	 Such	 outside	 appointments	
are	 subject	 to	 prior	 Board	 approval,	 taking	 into	 account	 existing	 duties,	
potential	 conflicts	 of	 interest	 and	 time	 commitments	 outside	 of	 Filtrona's	
responsibilities.	 Colin	 Day	 is	 a	 Non-Executive	 Director	 of	 AMEC	 plc	 and	
WPP	 Group	 plc	 and	 received	 fees	 in	 total	 of	 £136,000	 since	 1 April 2011.
Non-Executive	 Directors
The	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 do	 not	 have	 service	 contracts	 and	 do	 	
not	 participate	 in	 any	 Company	 pension,	 share	 or	 incentive	 scheme.	 	
In	 accordance	 with	 best	 practice,	 letters	 of	 appointment	 have	 been	 	
issued	 for	 all	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 for	 an	 initial	 period	 of	 three	 years.	
These	 letters	 are	 available	 for	 inspection	 by	 members	 at	 each	 AGM	 	
and	 during	 normal	 business	 hours	 at	 the	 Company’s	 registered	 office.
Fees	 for	 Non-Executive	 Directors,	 other	 than	 the	 Chairman,	 are	 approved	
by	 the	 Board	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 policy	 adopted	 by	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee,	 and	 are	 based	 on	 a	 standard	 fee,	 with	 additional	 fees	 payable	
for	 the	 Senior	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Director	 and	 for	 the	 chairing	 	
of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Remuneration	 Committees.	 The	 fees	 are	 set	 taking	 	
into	 account	 current	 market	 practice	 and	 the	 responsibilities	 and	 time	
commitment	 involved	 in	 the	 role.	 The	 fees	 were	 reviewed	 in	 December	
2011.	 The	 fees	 will	 be	 subject	 to	 a	 further	 annual	 review	 in	 December	 2012	
in	 accordance	 with	 the	 policy	 for	 the	 remuneration	 of	 Non-Executive	
Directors	 adopted	 by	 the Board.

The	 accrued	 pension	 reflects	 the	 deferred	 benefit	 that	 Mr	 Harper	 would	 have	 been	 entitled	 to	 as	 at	 5	 May	 2011	 upon	 his	 retirement	 assuming	 that	 he	 had	 become	
a	 deferred	 member	 at	 that	 date

The	 value	 of	 the	 accrued	 pension	 is	 calculated	 on	 the	 current	 transfer	 value	 basis	 and	 is	 based	 on	 the	 value	 of	 the	 deferred	 pension	 entitlement	 assuming	 that	 the	
service	 terminated	 on	 1	 January	 2011.	 The	 current	 transfer	 value	 basis	 was	 updated	 in	 October	 2010	 and	 is	 not	 the	 actual	 cost	 of	 providing	 the	 pension.	 In	 line	 with

Directors’	 indemnities
During	 the	 year	 and	 as	 at	 the	 date	 of	 this	 Report,	 indemnities	 are	 in	 force	
under	 which	 the	 Company	 has	 agreed	 to	 indemnify	 the	 Directors	 and	 	
the	 Company	 Secretary	 &	 General	 Counsel,	 in	 addition	 to	 other	 senior	
executives	 who	 are	 Directors	 of	 subsidiaries	 of	 the	 Company,	 to	 the	 extent	
permitted	 by	 law	 and	 the	 Company’s	 Articles	 of	 Association,	 in	 respect	 	
of	 all	 losses	 arising	 out	 of	 or	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 execution	 of	 their	
powers,	 duties	 and	 responsibilities	 as	 a	 Director	 or	 officer	 of	 the	 Company	
or	 any	 of	 its	 subsidiaries,	 including	 the	 pension	 scheme	 trustee	 companies.	 	
The	 scope	 of	 the	 indemnities	 extends	 to	 include	 liabilities	 to	 third	 parties.
Creditor	 payment	 policy
The	 Company	 policy	 for	 payment	 of	 suppliers	 is	 to	 pay	 according	 to	 the	
terms	 agreed	 with	 suppliers	 from	 time	 to	 time,	 subject	 to	 the	 supplier’s	
performance	 in	 accordance	 with	 those	 agreed	 terms	 and	 conditions.
Since	 the	 Company	 has	 no	 trade	 creditors,	 the	 disclosure	 of	 creditor	 	
days	 does	 not	 apply.
Significant	 agreements
The	 Company	 has	 committed	 bank	 facilities	 consisting	 of	 two	 five	 year	
multi-currency	 revolving	 credit	 facilities	 of	 £165.0m	 and	 €187.7m.	 	
Under	 the	 terms	 of	 these	 facilities,	 the	 banks	 can	 give	 notice	 to	 Filtrona	 	
to	 repay	 outstanding	 amounts	 and	 cancel	 the	 commitments	 where	 	
there	 is	 a	 change	 of	 control	 of	 the	 Company.
Under	 a	 note	 purchase	 agreement	 dated	 29	 April	 2010	 relating	 to	 	
US$80m	 senior	 notes	 due	 29	 April	 2017	 and	 US$80m	 senior	 notes	 	
due	 29 April	 2020,	 on	 a	 change	 of	 control	 the	 Company	 must	 make	 	
an	 offer	 to	 prepay	 all	 the	 notes	 at	 par,	 without	 any	 premium	 of	 any	 	
kind,	 together	 with	 accrued	 and	 unpaid	 interest	 thereon.
All	 of	 the	 Company’s	 share	 schemes	 contain	 provisions	 relating	 to	 a	 	
change	 in	 control.	 Outstanding	 options	 and	 awards	 normally	 vest	 and	
become	 exercisable	 on	 a	 change	 of	 control	 subject	 to	 the	 satisfaction	 	
of	 any	 performance	 conditions	 at	 that	 time.
There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 other	 agreements,	 involving	 the	 Company	 or	 	
its	 subsidiaries,	 that	 take	 effect,	 alter	 or	 terminate	 upon	 a	 change	 of	 	
control	 of	 the	 Company	 following	 a	 takeover	 bid,	 such	 as	 commercial	
contracts	 and	 joint	 venture	 agreements.	 None	 are	 considered	 to	 be	
significant	 in	 terms	 of	 their	 potential	 impact	 on	 the	 business	 of	 the	 	
Group	 as	 a	 whole,	 to	 any	 potential	 bidder	 for	 the	 Company	 or	 Group.
Annual	 General	 Meeting
The	 AGM	 of	 the	 Company	 will	 be	 held	 at	 the	 Holiday	 Inn	 Hotel,	
500 Saxon Gate	 West,	 Milton	 Keynes,	 Buckinghamshire,	 MK9	 2HQ	 	
on	 Tuesday	 24 April	 2012	 at	 12	 noon.
In	 addition	 to	 the	 ordinary	 business	 of	 the	 AGM,	 resolutions	 in	 	
respect	 of	 the	 following	 matters	 of	 special	 business	 are	 included	 	
in	 the	 Notice	 of	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting:
Revised performance award provisions for future  
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards
The	 Directors	 are	 seeking	 approval	 from	 shareholders	 to	 enable	 	
the	 Company	 to	 amend	 the	 maximum	 performance	 award	 provisions	 	
of	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 Filtrona	 Long	 Term	 Incentive	 Plan	 (the	 “Plan”).
	
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 of	 the	 Company’s	 Board	 of	 Directors	 	
(the	 “Committee”)	 has	 undertaken	 a	 review	 of	 the	 existing	 executive	
reward	 structure	 at	 the	 Company,	 focused	 on	 the	 development	 	
of	 a	 remuneration	 policy	 strategy	 aligned	 with	 the	 future	 growth	 	
objectives	 of	 the	 Company.
Further	 to	 that	 review,	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 is	 recommending	
changes	 to	 certain	 aspects	 of	 the	 existing	 remuneration	 arrangements,	
including	 a	 change	 to	 the	 performance	 share	 award	 grant	 level	 available	
under	 the	 Plan.
The	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP	 currently	 provide	 that	 participants	 may	 receive	
performance	 share	 awards	 over	 shares	 worth	 up	 to	 two	 times	 their	 	
basic	 salary	 in	 any	 financial	 year.	
	
It	 is	 proposed	 that	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP	 be	 amended	 to	 increase	 the	 	
limit	 to	 three	 times	 basic	 salary.	 Resolution	 12	 seeks	 shareholders’	 	
approval	 for	 such	 a	 change	 to	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP.
Directors’	 Report
65 The	 Invisible	 Enablers		 |		 Filtrona	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 2011 Corporate	 Governance	|	Other	 Statutory	 Information No	 other	 changes	 are	 proposed	 to	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP	 at	 this	 time,	 	
save	 that	 the	 Committee	 proposes	 to	 introduce	 provisions	 into	 the	 rules	 	
of	 the	 LTIP	 that	 will	 provide	 scope	 for	 the	 Committee	 to	 “claw-back”	 	
value	 delivered	 to	 executives	 under	 the	 LTIP	 in	 the	 event	 of	 financial	
misstatement	 or	 summary	 dismissal.
Authority to allot unissued shares
At	 the	 last	 AGM	 held	 in	 2011,	 the	 Directors	 were	 granted	 authority	 	
to	 allot	 relevant	 securities	 up	 to	 a	 nominal	 amount	 of	 £17,241,428,	 	
which	 expires	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 forthcoming	 AGM.	
At	 this	 year’s	 AGM,	 shareholders	 will	 be	 asked	 to	 grant	 the	 Directors	
authority	 to	 allot	 shares	 or	 grant	 rights	 to	 subscribe	 for	 or	 convert	 any	
security	 into	 shares:	 (i)	 up	 to	 an	 aggregate	 nominal	 amount	 of	 £17,407,715	
representing	 approximately	 one-third	 of	 the	 Company’s	 issued	 share	 capital,	 	
excluding	 treasury	 shares,	 at	 21 February	 2012	 (such	 an	 amount	 to	 be	 reduced	 	
by	 the	 nominal	 amount	 allotted	 or	 granted	 under	 section	 (ii)	 below	 in	
excess	 of	 such	 sum);	 and	 (ii)	 comprising	 equity	 securities	 up	 to	 an	 aggregate	
nominal	 amount	 of	 £34,815,431	 representing	 approximately	 two-thirds	 	
of	 the	 issued	 share	 capital,	 excluding	 treasury	 shares,	 at	 21 February	 2012	
(such	 an	 amount	 to	 be	 reduced	 by	 any	 allotments	 or	 grants	 made	 under	
section	 (i)	 above)	 in	 connection	 with	 an	 offer	 by	 way	 of	 a	 rights	 issue.	
The	 proposal	 conforms	 to	 the	 guidelines	 issued	 by	 the	 institutional	
investment	 protection	 bodies	 to	 ensure	 that	 existing	 shareholders’	 	
interests	 are	 safeguarded.	 The	 Directors	 have	 no	 present	 intention	 of	
exercising	 either	 of	 these	 authorities,	 which	 will	 expire	 at	 the	 end	 of	 	
next	 year’s	 AGM	 (or,	 if	 earlier,	 the	 close	 of	 business	 on	 23	 June	 2013)	 	
except	 in	 relation	 to	 share	 options.
Allotment of shares for cash
At	 the	 last	 AGM	 held	 in	 2011,	 shareholders	 approved	 a	 special	 resolution	 	
to	 enable	 the	 Directors	 to	 allot	 shares	 for	 cash	 without	 first	 offering	 them	
to	 existing	 shareholders	 in	 proportion	 to	 their	 existing	 shareholdings.	 That	
approval	 expires	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 forthcoming	 AGM	 and	 Resolution 13	 	
in	 the	 Notice	 of	 AGM	 seeks	 to	 renew	 it.
The	 resolution	 authorises	 the	 Directors	 to	 allot	 or	 sell	 shares	 for	 cash	
without	 first	 offering	 them	 to	 existing	 shareholders	 in	 proportion	 to	 	
their	 existing	 shareholdings	 up	 to	 an	 aggregate	 nominal	 amount	 of	 	
5%	 of	 the	 issued	 share	 capital	 of	 the	 Company,	 including	 treasury	 	
shares,	 at	 31 December	 2011	 (equivalent	 to	 10,966,340	 ordinary	 shares).
In	 respect	 of	 this	 aggregate	 nominal	 amount,	 the	 Directors	 confirm	 their	
intention	 to	 follow	 the	 provisions	 of	 the	 Pre-Emption	 Group’s	 Statement	 	
of	 Principles	 regarding	 cumulative	 usage	 of	 authorities	 within	 a	 rolling	
three-year	 period	 where	 the	 Principles	 provide	 that	 usage	 in	 excess	 of	 	
7.5%	 should	 not	 take	 place	 without	 prior	 consultation	 with	 shareholders.	
This	 authority	 will	 expire	 at	 the	 conclusion	 of	 the	 following	 AGM	 or,	 if	
earlier,	 on	 23	 June	 2013.	 The	 proposal	 conforms	 to	 the	 guidelines	 issued	 	
by	 the	 institutional	 investment	 protection	 bodies	 to	 ensure	 that	 existing	
shareholders’	 interests	 are	 safeguarded.	
Purchase of own shares
At	 the	 last	 AGM	 held	 in	 2011,	 shareholders	 approved	 a	 special	 	
resolution	 to	 enable	 the	 Company	 to	 purchase	 its	 own	 shares.	 	
That	 approval	 expires	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 forthcoming	 AGM.	
At	 this	 year’s	 AGM,	 the	 Directors	 consider	 it	 expedient	 to	 seek	 shareholders’	 	
approval	 to	 enable	 the	 Company	 to	 purchase,	 in	 the	 market,	 up	 to	 10%	
of	 its	 issued	 share	 capital	 (excluding	 any	 treasury	 shares)	 for	 cancellation,	
or	 to	 be	 held	 in	 Treasury,	 such	 power	 to	 apply	 until	 the	 end	 of	 next	 year’s	
AGM	 (or	 if	 earlier,	 23	 June	 2013).	 In	 accordance	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	
the	 Listing	 Rules	 of	 the	 Financial	 Services	 Authority,	 the	 minimum	 price	
(exclusive	 of	 expenses)	 which	 may	 be	 paid	 for	 a	 share	 is	 its	 nominal	 value	
and	 the	 maximum	 price	 (exclusive	 of	 expenses)	 for	 shares	 which	 may	 	
be	 paid	 is	 the	 highest	 of:	 (i)	 an	 amount	 equal	 to	 105	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 	
average	 market	 value	 for	 a	 share	 for	 the	 five	 business	 days	 immediately	
preceding	 the	 date	 of	 the	 purchase;	 and	 (ii)	 the	 higher	 of	 the	 price	 of	 the	
last	 independent	 trade	 and	 the	 highest	 current	 independent	 bid	 on	 the	
trading	 venues	 where	 the	 purchase	 is	 carried	 out.	
The	 Directors	 have	 no	 present	 intention	 of	 exercising	 the	 authority	 to	 	
make	 market	 purchases.	 However,	 the	 authority	 provides	 the	 flexibility	 	
to	 allow	 them	 to	 do	 so	 in	 the	 future.	 The	 Directors	 will	 only	 utilise	 this	
authority	 if	 satisfied	 that	 to	 do	 so	 would	 be	 in	 the	 best	 interests	 of	 the	
Company	 and	 its	 shareholders	 generally,	 and	 could	 be	 expected	 to	 	
result	 in	 an	 increase	 in	 earnings	 per	 share	 of	 the	 Company.	
During	 the	 financial	 year	 ending	 31	 December	 2011	 3,230,401	 ordinary	
shares	 were	 transferred	 out	 of	 Treasury	 by	 the	 Company	 to	 satisfy	 	
share	 options	 under	 the	 Company’s	 SAYE	 /	 Sharesave	 and	 executive	 	
share	 incentive plans.
No	 dividends	 have	 been	 paid	 on	 shares	 whilst	 held	 in	 Treasury	 and	 	
no	 voting	 rights	 attach	 to	 the	 treasury	 shares.
Auditor
KPMG	 Audit	 Plc	 has	 indicated	 that	 it	 is	 willing	 to	 continue	 in	 office.	
Resolutions	 to	 re-appoint	 them	 and	 to	 authorise	 the	 Board	 to	 set	 	
their	 remuneration	 will	 be	 proposed	 at	 the	 AGM	 (Resolution	 10	 and	 	
11	 respectively	 in	 the	 Notice	 of	 Annual	 General	 Meeting).
Recommendation
The	 Directors	 believe	 that	 the	 resolutions	 in	 the	 Notice	 of	 Annual	 General	
Meeting	 are	 in	 the	 best	 interests	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 shareholders	 as	 	
a	 whole,	 and	 unanimously	 recommend	 that	 shareholders	 vote	 in	 favour	 	
of	 each	 resolution.
Derivatives
Information	 related	 to	 derivatives	 is	 included	 in	 the	 Accounting	 Policies	 	
on	 page	 74,	 and	 in	 note	 15.
Post	 balance	 sheet	 events
On	 17	 February	 2012,	 Filtrona	 acquired	 100%	 of	 the	 share	 capital	 of	 	
Securit	 World	 Ltd	 (“Securit”)	 for	 a	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £6m.	 Securit	
distributes	 desktop	 personal	 identification	 (“ID”)	 card	 systems,	 providing	
printers,	 software	 and	 associated	 accessories.	 The	 acquisition	 of	 UK-based	
Securit	 will	 add	 to	 the	 existing	 capabilities	 of	 Filtrona's	 Payne	 Security	
personal	 ID	 products	 business.
Directors’	 statement	 as	 to	 disclosure	 	
of	 information	 to	 the	 Auditor
As	 required	 by	 section	 418(2)	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006,	 the	 Directors	
who	 were	 members	 of	 the	 Board	 at	 the	 time	 of	 approving	 this	 Report,	
having	 made	 enquiries	 of	 fellow	 Directors	 and	 of	 the	 auditor,	 confirm	 that:
•	 As	 far	 as	 each	 Director	 is	 aware,	 there	 is	 no	 relevant	 audit	 information	 	
of	 which	 the	 Company’s	 auditor	 is	 unaware
•	 Each	 Director	 has	 taken	 all	 steps	 that	 he	 ought	 to	 have	 taken	 as	 a	 	
director	 to	 ascertain	 any	 relevant	 audit	 information	 and	 to	 ensure	 	
that	 the	 Company’s	 auditor	 is	 aware	 of	 that	 information

of	 the	 state	 of	 affairs	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 parent	 company	 and	 of	 their	 	
profit	 or	 loss	 for	 that	 period.	 In	 preparing	 each	 of	 the	 Group	 and

Under	 applicable	 law	 and	 regulations,	 the	 Directors	 are	 also	 responsible	 	
for	 preparing	 a	 Directors’	 Report,	 Directors’	 Remuneration	 Report

undertakings	 included	 in	 the	 consolidation	 taken	 as	 a	 whole,	 together	
with	 a	 description	 of	 the	 principal	 risks	 and	 uncertainties	 that	 they	 face

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31 December 2011 a. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) in accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) (“adopted IFRS”) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its individual company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”); these are presented on pages 
106 to 110.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives which are stated at fair value and retirement 
benefit obligations which are valued in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised): Employee benefits. 
The preparation of financial statements that conform with adopted IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting 
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately 
differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised and future periods if relevant.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements are detailed below. These policies have been consistently applied  
to all periods presented. 
The following standards were adopted by the Group during the year with no significant impact on its consolidated results, financial position  
or disclosures: 
Amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of statement of changes in equity
Amendment to IAS 24: Disclosure requirements for government related entities and the definition of a related party
Amendments to IFRIC 14: Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement
Amendments contained in “Improvements to IFRSs” issued in May 2010 
The following standards or interpretations have not yet been adopted by the Group. The Group does not currently believe the adoption  
of these standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group:
IFRS 9: Financial instruments (not yet endorsed by the EU) the primary impact of which is to remove the multiple classification and measurement 
models for financial assets required by IAS 39 and introduce a model that has only two classification categories: amortised cost and fair value. 
IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements (not yet endorsed by the EU) replaces the guidance of control and consolidation in IAS 27 and 
SIC 12: Consolidation – special purpose entities. The core principle that a consolidated entity presents a parent and its subsidiaries as if they 
were a single entity remains unchanged, as do the mechanics of consolidation.
IFRS 11: Joint arrangements (not yet endorsed by the EU) requires joint arrangements to be accounted for as a joint operation or as a joint venture 
depending on the rights and obligations of each party to the arrangement. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will be eliminated and 
equity accounting will be mandatory. It is anticipated that the application of the standard will result in an immaterial decrease in net sales, total 
assets and total liabilities of the Group but have no impact on the Group’s net profit or net assets.
IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other entities (not yet endorsed by the EU) requires enhanced disclosures of the nature, risks and financial 
effects associated with the Group’s interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structured entities.
IFRS 13: Fair value measurement (not yet endorsed by the EU) explains how to measure fair value and aims to enhance fair value disclosures. 
The standard does not change the measurement of fair value but codifies it in one place.
IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IFRS 12 and IFRS 13 are all effective 1 January 2013.
Amendments to IAS 19: Employee benefits (not yet endorsed by the EU) changes a number of disclosure requirements for post-employment 
arrangements and restricts the options currently available on how to account for defined benefit pension plans. The most significant change that 
will impact the Group is that the amendment requires the expected returns on pension plan assets, currently calculated based on management’s 
estimate of expected returns to be replaced by a credit on the pension plan assets calculated at the liability discount rate. The Group expects  
this change will result in an increase in finance costs but will not impact the Group’s net assets.
All other standards and interpretations recently adopted by the EU not discussed above did not have or are not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group.
For the purposes of these financial statements “Filtrona” or ”the Group” means Filtrona plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries.
Financial Statements 73 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Accounting Policies a. Basis of preparation continued
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and accordingly have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further information regarding 
the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 14  
to 15. In addition, note 1 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Cash 
balances and borrowings are included in note 21. This disclosure has been prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: “Guide for Directors of UK Companies 2009”.
b. Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Filtrona. Control exists when Filtrona has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefit from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included  
in the financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expense arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the financial statements. 
c. Foreign currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which the subsidiary operates (“functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are prepared in sterling (functional currency  
of the parent company). 
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and recognised in the income 
statement unless hedge accounting criteria apply (see policy for derivatives). 
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average 
exchange rates. 
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences on retranslation at the closing rate of the opening balances of overseas entities are taken to reserves, as are exchange 
differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as net investment hedges, to the extent that they  
are effective. Other exchange differences are taken to the income statement. Differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 are included in  
retained earnings.
d. Financial instruments
In accordance with IAS 39: Financial instruments: recognition and measurement (“IAS 39”), interest bearing loans and borrowings and other 
financial liabilities (excluding derivatives) are held at amortised cost, unless they are included in a hedge accounting relationship. See note 15  
for separate disclosure of hedge types. 
Derivatives are measured initially at fair value. Subsequent recognition in the financial statements depends on the classification of the derivative  
as follows:
(i) Fair value hedges
Where a derivative is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a monetary asset or liability, any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised 
in the income statement. 
(ii) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge the change in fair value is recognised in equity to the extent  
that it is effective and any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Where the underlying transaction results in a financial asset, 
accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item affects profit or loss. Where the 
hedged item results in a non-financial asset the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial carrying 
value of the asset. 
74 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Accounting Policies continued (iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations
The gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is deemed effective is recognised in equity.  
Any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
e. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Previously revalued properties were 
treated as being held at deemed cost upon transition to adopted IFRS.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment or other assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.  
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and other assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
f. Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives on a straight line basis at the following annual rates: 
Freehold land   Not depreciated
Buildings    2% or life of lease if shorter
Plant and machinery   7-20%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10-33%
The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
g. Leases
Rentals associated with operating leases are expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis. Lease incentives are amortised in the 
income statement over the life of the lease.
h. Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses. 
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. For acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004 goodwill represents the 
difference between the fair value of the assets given in consideration and the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of the acquiree. For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
previously recorded under UK GAAP. 
Since 1 January 2010 the Group has expensed costs attributable to acquisitions in the income statement.
(ii) Research and development
Research costs are expensed to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. 
Development costs relating to new products are capitalised if the new product is technically and commercially feasible. All other development 
costs are recognised in the income statement and expensed as incurred.
(iii) Other intangible assets
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination is recognised at fair value to the extent it is probable that the expected future economic 
benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. Intangible assets principally relate to customer 
relationships which were valued using discounted cash flows based on historical customer attrition rates and developed technology which was 
valued using an income approach. The cost of intangible assets is amortised through the income statement on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful economic life.
i. Impairment
All assets, except intangible assets, deferred tax assets and inventories, are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually. Other intangible assets are tested if there is an indication  
of impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of a non-financial asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount, being the greater of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, and is recognised in the income statement. Value in use is estimated 
based on future cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
Financial Statements 75 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 j. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) and net realisable value. For work-in-progress and finished goods,  
cost includes an appropriate proportion of labour cost and overheads.
k. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and fixed term investments whose maturities are three months or less from the date  
of acquisition. Bank overdrafts repayable on demand form an integral part of Filtrona’s cash management and are included as part of cash  
and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
l. Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal to fair value at inception) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowings.
m. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables carrying value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows less impairment losses.
n. Trade and other payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
o. Catalogue costs
The costs associated with the production and printing of catalogues are expensed to the income statement when access is received to those goods.
p. Income tax
Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date and any adjustment to tax payable in prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases and the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible  
for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset or liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
q. Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement net of expected warranty claims when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
r. Finance income and expense
Finance income and expense is recognised in the income statement as it accrues.
s. Segment reporting
A segment is identified on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Group Management Committee in order to allocate 
resources to the segment and assess its performance. 
t. Pensions
(i) Defined contribution schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
76 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Accounting Policies continued (ii) Defined benefit schemes
The significant pension schemes in Europe and the US have been accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
The net obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of  
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine  
its present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated 
bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of Filtrona’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified independent 
actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses that have arisen are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The amounts charged to operating profit are the current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on settlement and curtailments.  
The expected increase in the present value of scheme liabilities is included within finance expense and the expected return on scheme assets  
is included within finance income.
u. Share-based payments
Filtrona operates equity-settled, share-based incentive plans. A charge is made in the income statement based on the fair value of option awards 
using the Monte Carlo or binomial valuation models as appropriate with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the period between grant and vesting date of the options. The amount recognised as an expense will be adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share options that vest with the exception of options that fail to vest because market-based conditions are not met.
v.  One-off items in the consolidated income statement
The exceptional operating costs below are separated from other costs by virtue of their size and incidence. They are shown as a separate line item 
within operating profit on the face of the income statement in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information 
and performance. These costs exclude amortisation of acquired intangible assets which are also presented separately in the income statement.
(i) Acquisition fees
In 2011, Filtrona incurred significant one-off costs in professional fees as a result of the acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of Richco, 
Inc. and the assets and business of Reid Supply Company.
(ii) Acquisition integration costs
These costs represent assets written off as part of the integration of the acquired businesses into the Group’s Protection & Finishing  
Products division.
(iii) Other exceptional costs
This represents insurance proceeds received net of associated costs, the loss on disposal of the Group’s shares in FractureCode Corporation  
ApS and reorganisation costs within certain of the Group’s divisions.
w. Investment in own shares
The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Benefit Trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of share option plans are treated  
as belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings. The cost of shares held directly (treasury shares) are also  
deducted from retained earnings. 
x. Provisions
A provision is recognised when there is a probable legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and a reliable estimate can  
be made of the outflow of resources that will be required to settle the obligation. The outflow is the present value of management’s best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
y. Net debt
Net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, net of interest bearing loans and borrowings.
z. Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders of the Company (final dividend)  
or paid (interim dividend).
Financial Statements 77 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation 
required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated. The Directors believe that  
the financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of Filtrona’s performance and  
financial position. 
(i) Pensions
Filtrona accounts for its defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised). The application of IAS 19 (Revised) requires  
the exercise of judgement in relation to the assumptions used (see note 18) and for each assumption there is a range of possible outcomes.  
In consultation with Filtrona’s actuaries, management decides the point within those ranges that most appropriately reflects Filtrona’s 
circumstances. Small changes to these assumptions can have a significant impact on valuations.
(ii) Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such intangible  
assets require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful  
lives would result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions 
(including discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective.
(iii) Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require management judgements and estimates in respect of tax audit issues and exposures in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. Management is also required to make an estimate of the current tax liability together with an assessment  
of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
(iv) Provisions 
Filtrona’s provisions are management’s best estimate of exposure, in cases where there is a probable legal or constructive obligation as a  
result of a past event, based on currently available information. By their nature these provisions are judgemental.
78 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates 1. Risk management
Filtrona’s activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Filtrona’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness  
of this system. Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives  
and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.  
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be  
employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash. Filtrona uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising  
from underlying business activities. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. The treasury department is subject to periodic 
independent reviews by the internal audit department. Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant  
combination of geographic presence, expertise and suitable credit rating. 
The following describes Filtrona’s financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations,  
and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Filtrona has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.  
The following is an overview of how Filtrona manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables
Filtrona’s exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers. This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base,  
including the industry and country in which customers operate. Filtrona monitors significant customers’ credit limits and there is an allowance  
for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The components of this allowance  
are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective 
allowance takes account of historical experience and the profile of customers.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business. 
The following table provides information on the trade and other receivables’ credit risk exposure.
2011 
£m
2010 
£m
Not impaired or past due:
New customers (less than one year) 4.6 5.0
Existing customers (more than one year) with no defaults in the past 58.6 44.8
Past due not impaired 16.4 15.5
Impaired 3.6 2.4
Gross trade and other receivables 83.2 67.7
Impairment (6.7) (2.4)
76.5 65.3
Trade and other receivables carried at £85.4m (2010: £76.0m) include prepayments and accrued income of £6.1m (2010: £4.7m) which are not 
financial assets. Therefore, these amounts are excluded from the above analysis. Trade and other receivables also include deferred consideration 
of £2.8m (2010: £6.0m) due from the Itavema Group for the purchase of the Globalpack business. This amount is also excluded as it is included  
in the credit ratings analysis below.
Occasionally disputes arise that result in accounts becoming past due. These are generally recovered in due course and the impairment allowance 
reflects management’s best estimate of recovery. During the year net impairment losses on trade and other receivables of £4.6m (2010: £0.1m) 
have been recognised within net operating expense and £0.3m (2010: £1.5m) of the impairment provision has been utilised. 
Financial Statements 79 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Notes 1. Risk management continued
Derivative assets
Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed  
standard form documentation exists. The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents
Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis. The credit limits imposed specify  
the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty. These limits are determined by geographic presence, 
expertise and credit rating. Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, derivative 
assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties. AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets  
are neither impaired nor past due.

Filtrona’s maximum credit risk exposure is £116.3m (2010: £111.7m) and no collateral is held against this amount (2010: £nil).
(ii) Market price risk
Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and 
liabilities. Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or  
10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points (“bps”), 100bps and  
200bps in market interest rates. The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may  
materially differ. 
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a) Currency risk
Filtrona publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies. Therefore it is subject  
to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their 
transaction costs. 
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The majority of Filtrona’s net assets are in currencies other than sterling. The Company’s normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and  
the resulting impact on shareholders’ funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets. At 31 December 2011, 
Filtrona’s euro-denominated assets were 92% hedged by its euro-denominated borrowings (2010: 47%), whilst its US dollar-denominated assets 
were approximately 59% (2010: 88%) hedged by the US dollar-denominated borrowings.
80 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Notes Transaction exposure hedging
The majority of Filtrona’s transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited.  
However, where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates  
on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 12 months.
Filtrona does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate  
percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Group’s risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.  
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. To the extent that cash flow hedges  
are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled  
either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Filtrona’s sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.  
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies’ average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%,  
5% or 10%. The translational effect on equity is limited as most US dollar and euro exposure is hedged. Accordingly the effect on equity  
is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.  
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will be 100% effective.

b) Interest rate risk
Filtrona’s strategy is to ensure with a reasonable degree of certainty that at least 50% of the overall net finance expense is protected against 
material adverse movements in interest rates using fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps and caps. 
The following table shows Filtrona’s sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.  
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year the interest rates on all external floating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings 
have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted 
for the effect of Filtrona’s interest rate derivatives. The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of  
a 50bps, 100bps or 200bps decrease or increase in interest rates on the market values of Filtrona’s interest rate derivatives.

Financial Statements 81 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 1. Risk management continued
(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that  
are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
On 16 August 2011 Filtrona signed an agreement with a syndicate of relationship banks to provide new banking facilities until August 2016.  
This facility replaced its existing facilities which would have expired in April 2012. Fees of £3.1m paid in respect of these facilities have  
been capitalised and are being expensed in the income statement over the expected life of the facilities in accordance with the effective  
interest method. 
Filtrona’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility. Filtrona is mostly funded by two series of US$80m  
Loan Notes from various financial institutions and syndicated five-year revolving credit facilities of £165.6m and €187.7m from its bankers.  
The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have maturities of seven and ten years and the revolving credit facilities mature in August 2016.  
At 31 December 2011 the available bank and non-bank facilities totalled £425.2m (2010: £223.4m) of which £181.1m (2010: £131.8m) was  
drawn down. In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility. 
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtrona’s available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were:

2010

Expiring after one but within two years – 91.6
Expiring after two years 244.1 –

Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.

All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.

0.7 115.1 (236.9) (121.1) (2.1) 111.3 (167.9) (58.7)
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared 
to contracted rates. Fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by discounting cash flows at forward rates. 
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes. The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost 
with a carrying value of £102.1m (2010: £100.6m). The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes is £117.6m (2010: £108.1m).
All other financial assets, classified as “loans and receivables”, and trade and other payables, classified as “amortised cost”, are held at amortised 
cost and have short terms to maturity. For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values. Interest bearing 
loans and borrowings incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate fair values at the reporting date.  
The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities fall within level one in the fair value hierarchy as they have been calculated using quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
(iv) Capital structure
Filtrona defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings and aims to manage this to safeguard  
its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light  
of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure,  
Filtrona may return capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy-backs, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio. EBITDA is defined as operating profit before 
depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional 
operating items. Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees. During 2011, Filtrona’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2010,  
was to maintain the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5. The net debt to EBITDA ratios at 31 December were:

The Company believes that, given their detailed knowledge of Filtrona’s operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out 
detailed due diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for certain audit-related work to be carried out by the Company’s auditor rather than 
another firm of accountants. The Audit Committee, which consists of independent Non-Executive Directors, reviews and approves the level and nature of non-audit 
work which the auditor performs, including the fees paid for such work, thus ensuring that the auditor’s objectivity and independence is not compromised

The impairments during 2011 and 2010 related to plant and machinery and land and buildings that have been assessed as non-recoverable through  
ongoing use in the Group and are expected to have no value on disposal. The impairment charge of £5.8m made during 2011 has been recognised  
within exceptional operating items, and relates to the integration of aquisitions and reorganisation within certain of the Group’s segments.
Included within land and buildings and plant and machinery are assets in the course of construction of £11.2m (2010: £3.5m) which were not 
depreciated during the year.

The weighted average useful economic life of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year was 17.9 years and 
15.2 years (2010: 21.8 years and 11.7 years) respectively.
Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. A discounted cash flow  
analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other 
intangible assets for each operating segment or business as appropriate.

The tests are based on the following assumptions:
• Cash flows for the next two years are based upon the Group’s annual budget
•  Cash flows beyond the budget period are based on year two’s budget cash flows with growth rates specific to each business  
which range from nil to 3%
•  The estimated cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discounted rate based upon Filtrona’s estimated weighted average cost of capital  
of 8.5% (2010: 8.5%) adjusted for the risk applicable to each operating segment. The pre-tax discount rates used ranged from 11.6% to  
13.8% (2010: 11.6% to 13.8%)
Any impairments identified as a result of the analysis are expensed to the income statement. The test is dependent on management estimates  
and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved reducing future cash flows by up to 25%, reducing terminal growth rates  
by up to eight percentage points or increasing pre-tax discount rates by up to 100 bps. The results of these analyses showed that, despite 
significantly lower post-tax operating cash flows or increased pre-tax discount rates, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible  
assets continued to exceed their value in use.

Fair value derivatives protect the Group from currency risk exposure from changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities  
or a previously unrecognised firm commitment to buy or sell assets at a fixed price. 
Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows. 
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments  
in foreign operations. 
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and  
purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur. All of the hedged transactions  
are expected to occur over the next 15 months and all derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.
Financial Statements 93 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 15. Derivatives continued
During 2011 Filtrona had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary

18. Employee benefits 
Post-retirement benefits
Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.  
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2009 and annual actuarial 
valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes. The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been 
updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the  
schemes and the level of contributions.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices. Defined benefit contributions  
in 2012 are expected to be £10.0m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit  
in respect of past service.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considers the current level of expected returns on risk-free 
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio  
is invested and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on  
the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Notes 20. Reserves
Within retained earnings the Company has deducted the value of own shares purchased for an employee trust and treasury shares held  
by the Company with a total cost of £30.3m (2010: £35.2m). 
Employee trust shares are ordinary shares of the Company held in an employee benefit trust. The purpose of this trust is to hold shares in  
the Company for subsequent transfer to Executive Directors and employees relating to deferred share awards and options granted under the 
Company’s share-based incentive plans. Full details are set out in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 54 to 63. The assets, 
liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in these financial statements. At 31 December 2011 the trust held 2,011,206  
(2010: 1,004,490) shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of £0.5m (2010: £0.3m) and market  
value of £7.7m (2010: £2.4m). 
The Company holds 10,434,203 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £2.6m in Treasury. This represents 4.8% of the number of ordinary  
shares in issue.
The other reserve relates to the Group reorganisation which took place as part of the demerger from Bunzl plc and represents the difference 
between Filtrona plc’s share capital and Filtrona International Ltd’s share capital and share premium on 6 June 2005 and is not distributable.

Financial Statements 101 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 23. Acquisitions
On 6 September 2011, Filtrona acquired the assets and business of Reid Supply Company (“Reid Supply”). Reid Supply, based in Michigan, US,  
is a leading distributor of standard industrial components, including hardware, handles, clamps and fasteners, to a vast range of markets and 
customers via a catalogue. The business is highly complementary to Filtrona’s Protection & Finishing Products division.
Reid Supply contributed £7.7m to revenue and £0.5m to operating profit before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition  
to 31 December 2011. Related acquisition expenses of £0.7m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items. 
On 21 December 2011, Filtrona acquired the entire issued share capital of Richco, Inc. (“Richco”) from family and employee shareholders  
of the acquired company. Richco, based in Illinois, US, is a leading international designer, manufacturer and distributor of engineered plastic  
and elastomeric solutions for fastening and cable management applications in diverse and growing end markets and will be reported within 
Filtrona’s Protection & Finishing Products division. 
Richco has been incorporated into Filtrona’s results based upon its balance sheet as at 21 December 2011 and accordingly contributed £nil  
to revenue and an operating profit of £nil in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2011. Related acquisition expenses of £2.1m were 
recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items. 
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of both businesses were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value adjustments are 
provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
A summary of the acquisition of Reid Supply is detailed below.

Property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, provisions and payables were all reassessed to their fair value. 
The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of the fair value adjustments above. 
Deferred contingent consideration of £1.2m is payable by the Group if Reid Supply exceeds a target revenue during the 12 months  
to 31 December 2012.
The book value of trade recievables aquired is stated net of impairment losses of £0.1m. 
Included in the £2.7m of goodwill recognised above is the value of the unique revenue and cost synergies and an assembled workforce.  
Due to its nature this asset cannot be individually identified or measured. It is expected that most of the goodwill and other intangible  
assets acquired will be allowable for tax deduction in future years.
102 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011
Notes It is estimated that if the acquisition of Reid Supply had been completed on 1 January 2011 the contribution to 2011 Group revenue would  
have been £24.1m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been £2.2m.

The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of recognising customer relationships and other intangibles and the tax effect of the fair value 
adjustments below. 
Property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, provisions and payables were all reassessed to their fair value. 
The book value of trade receivables acquired is stated net of impairment losses of £0.3m.
Included in the £24.2m of goodwill recognised above is the value of the unique revenue and cost synergies including entry into new geographic 
and end markets where previously Protection & Finishing Products was not present and an assembled workforce. Due to its nature this asset 
cannot be individually identified or measured. It is expected that approximately 35% of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets will  
be allowable for tax deductions in future years.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Richco had been completed on 1 January 2011 the contribution to 2011 Group revenue would have  
been £47.2m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been £6.3m.
During 2011, Filtrona reassessed the fair value adjustments made in respect of Steratape, which was acquired in 2010, and increased certain 
accruals by £0.5m. Goodwill was increased accordingly.
The revenue and gross profit margin targets set in 2010 in respect of the acquisition of BP Labels were not met and as a result £0.3m was  
released to the income statement during the year.
Financial Statements 103 The Invisible Enablers  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 23. Acquisitions continued
In 2010, Filtrona acquired BP Labels and Stera Tape. Net cash outflow in respect of these acquisitions was £12.0m.

The reclassification adjustment to property, plant and equipment, receivables and payables reflects the impact of reclassifying a government  
grant used to purchase machinery and a receivable balance due from a Filtrona group company.
The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of recognising customer relationships and other intangibles.
Payables and inventories were reassessed to their fair value.
Deferred contingent consideration of £0.3m was payable by the Group if BP Labels exceeded a targeted revenue and gross profit margin  
in the period of 12 months to 30 April 2011. 
Included in the £5.8m of goodwill recognised above is the value of the unique revenue and cost synergies and an assembled workforce.  
Due to its nature this asset cannot be individually identified or measured.
24. Disposals and discontinued operations
In July 2011, Filtrona disposed of its shares in FractureCode Corporation ApS (“FractureCode”) to ITO Technologies ApS for consideration  
of £0.3m payable in two instalments in January and July 2012. The disposal resulted in a loss after tax of £1.9m and has been treated as  
an exceptional operating item. Cash disposed and disposal expenses were in total £0.1m.
In September 2011, Filtrona received £2.7m (2010: £2.7m) from the Itavema Group which represented a further instalment due in relation  
to the deferred consideration for the disposal on 29 June 2007 of Globalpack, its Brazilian consumer packaging business. During 2011, Filtrona 
released tax warranty provisions of £1.9m in respect of Globalpack and this was recognised as discontinued operations in the income statement.
On 22 June 2010, Filtrona received further consideration of £8.7m from Saw Mill Capital LLC for the settlement of an earn-out in relation to  
the disposal of its North American Plastic Profile and Sheet business on 27 March 2009. The consideration was reduced by associated expenses  
of £0.5m. The settlement resulted in a profit after tax of £6.8m which was recognised as discontinued operations in the income statement.

26. Transactions with related parties
Other than the disposal of FractureCode, the acquisition of further shares in Filthai (see below) and the compensation of key management 
disclosed in note 6, Filtrona has not entered into any material transactions with related parties. Furthermore, throughout 2011 and 2010,  
no Director had a personal interest in any significant transaction of Filtrona.
On 18 January 2011, Filtrona acquired 9.9% of the share capital of Filthai Company Limited (“Filthai”) from non-controlling interests.  
Following the purchase of the share capital, Filtrona has increased its interest in the Filthai Company Limited to 70.9% of the issued  
share capital. The cash consideration was £1.1m which was recorded directly to equity as acquisition of non-controlling interests.
27. Parent company
Filtrona plc is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It operates as the ultimate 
parent company of the Filtrona Group. Its registered office is Avebury House, 201–249 Avebury Boulevard, Milton Keynes, MK9 1AU.
28. Post balance sheet events
On 17 February 2012, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of Securit World Ltd (“Securit”) for a cash consideration of £6.0m.  
Securit distributes desktop personal identification (“ID”) card systems, providing printers, software and associated accessories.  
The acquisition of UK-based Securit will add to the existing capabilities of Filtrona’s Payne Security personal ID products business.
29. Non-GAAP measures
Management reviews the adjusted operating profit and operating cash flow as measures of the performance of the business. Adjusted operating 
profit is stated before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items which are considered not relevant to measuring the performance 
of the business. Operating cash flow is adjusted operating profit before depreciation, share option expense and other non-cash items, less 
working capital movements and net capital expenditure as shown below:

at 31 December 2011 a. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and  
applicable UK accounting standards. 
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Filtrona plc is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss account  
and cash flow statement. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, because the published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group include disclosures which comply with the Standard. 
The following principal accounting policies have been consistently applied.
b. Investment in subsidiary undertaking
Investment in subsidiary undertaking is held at cost less any provision for impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date  
whether the investment in its subsidiary has been impaired.
c. Share-based payments
The fair value of share options is measured at grant date. It is recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which  
the relevant employees work over the expected period between grant and vesting date of the options, with a corresponding adjustment  
to reserves. 
d. Own shares
The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Benefit Trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of share incentive plans are treated  
as belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings. The cost of shares held directly (treasury shares) is also deducted  
from retained earnings.
e. Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders of the Company (final dividend) or paid 
(interim dividend).
f. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and  
the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. Exchange differences arising from movements in spot rates  
are included in the profit and loss account as exchange gains or losses, while those arising from the interest differential elements of forward  
currency contracts are included in external interest income or expense.
g. Financial instruments
Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value. The subsequent measurement depends on the classification of the financial  
instrument. Interest bearing loans and borrowings and other financial liabilities (excluding derivatives) are held at amortised cost. 
(i) Financial instruments which hedge net investment in foreign operations of the parent undertaking
The Company holds financial instruments which hedge the net investments in the foreign operations of its subsidiary undertakings. Since  
the Company does not hold the underlying investments, gains and losses on these instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account.

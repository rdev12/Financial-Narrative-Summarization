Gaming Realms  
creates and publishes  
innovative real money

mobile, with operations  
in the UK, the US and Canada. 
Through its market-leading mobile 
platform and unique IP and brands, 
Gaming Realms is bringing together 
media, entertainment and gaming 
assets in new game formats.
The Group is deploying its IP and creative 
content through both its real money 
gambling operations in the UK and social 
free to play Slingo and casino apps for 
territories where it doesn’t hold a 
gambling license (through its Blastworks 
publishing brand). Whilst we utilise 
Original game content 
and IP development
We build original content from our own 
London, Seattle and Vancouver Island 
based games studios incorporating social 
metagames and real money mechanics 
with well-known brands.
Global audience creation 
and monetisation
With the latest digital acquisition methods, 
we concentrate on delivering a lower cost 
per acquisition of user by leveraging the 
mass appeal of branded content coupled 
with CRM specific to the individual user. 
This has expanded our audience well 
beyond the traditional gaming market.
Advanced gaming 
platform
We have invested heavily in mobile-based 
gambling and social platforms powered 
by algorithmic CRM and personalised 
content. The real money gambling is run 
from Guernsey and is fully licensed by 
the UK Gambling Commission for both 
development and operation.

internationally and to reach broader 
audiences.  03 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

The acquisition of  
Slingo IP and games  
perfectly fits our strategy 
for delivering mobile 
based entertainment 
content. The results 
speak for themselves in 
so far as we have higher 
margin games, lower 
CPAs and a great pipeline 
of licensing deals.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased  
to report that significant progress was 
made in 2015. We have developed and 
published real money and free to play 
original content on our new proprietary 
gaming platform, with positive business 
intelligence, growth and results 
supporting our strategy. This has 
continued into the current year.
In August 2015, Gaming Realms 
completed the acquisition of the 
GameHouse social and mobile assets 
and Slingo brand from RealNetworks, 
Inc. With this came the IP for Slingo, 
a new social games platform, a portfolio 
of mobile games, two games studios 
and highly experienced teams in Seattle 
and Vancouver Island.
During the year, two original Slingo real 
money games were developed and 
published on the Grizzly platform, and 
have quickly become amongst our best 
performing games in the UK. In our 
social business we launched two free to 
play mobile apps during the year (Slingo 
Blast and Lucky Streak Slots), as well as 
continuing to publish and monetise 
several acquired games including 
Hidden Artifacts.
Since the acquisition from RealNetworks, 
we have signed new strategic 
partnership agreements with Zynga and 
Scientific Games to distribute Slingo into 
adjacent gaming markets currently 
outside our strategic focus. This clearly 
highlights the strength of our IP and 
ability to extend its reach into massive 
markets such as national and state 
lotteries as well as the global gaming 
machine market with leading providers.
Chairman’s Statement 05 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Our strategic focus has been further 
underlined by streamlining our 
operational focus on our own proprietary 
technology and game publishing.  
We have therefore sold our third-party 
platform gaming assets as we believed 
we could achieve superior economics 
from selling these assets, as well as 
increasing management focus in the 
areas of highest shareholder return.
Financial review
As indicated in the trading update in 
January, I am pleased to report that the 
Group has delivered full year 2015 
revenue of £21.2m and an adjusted 
EBITDA loss of £4.1m, which is in line 
with market expectations. The 2015 
performance has seen an increase of 
revenue of 116% versus the comparable 
12 months to 31 December 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA loss has also decreased 
by 30% in the same period.
People
During 2015 the Group deepened its 
talent pool in critical areas related to our 
platform and content development, and 
the social gaming acquisition brought 
a further 57 experienced professionals 
into Gaming Realms. At year end we 
employed 169 people (2014: 84). 
It is the view of the Board that this 
expansion in multiple territories continues 
to have a very positive impact on both 
culture and performance. 
Outlook for 2016
The first quarter of 2016 has seen further 
increase in like-for-like revenues of 7%  
to £7.5m from the previous quarter  
(Q4 2015: £7.0m).

Our strategy of investing in content,

licensing partnerships into global lottery 
and land-based casino markets, our 
ability to attract highly complementary 
media brands such as Britain’s Got 
Talent, the X Factor and Deal or No Deal 
into our own B2C business offers us 
potential for further growth in the 
remainder of 2016.
The Board is excited by the progress 
of the Group in the year under review, 
encouraged by the developments 
already achieved in the current year, and 
believes that shareholders should share 
their enthusiasm and confidence in the 
future of Gaming Realms.

Chief Executive’s Review
Overview
Our second full year of trading  
has delivered tangible success as  
we have transitioned to a broader based 
developer, publisher and licensor of  
next generation mobile gaming content. 
It was the first full year of operation 
for our Grizzly platform, which we have 
been able to scale rapidly with both 
content and audience. Additionally, 
the platform has lowered cost per 
acquisition (“CPA”) and shortened 
our investment payback periods.
The acquisition of the GameHouse 
social mobile gaming business and 
Slingo IP and games, has enabled 
this transition to occur in not just 
the UK regulated gaming market, 
but also into a new global mobile 
market across multiple channels. 
This has been clearly evidenced by a 
growing number of strategic lottery, 
media and platform partnerships.
Our platform investment has also paid 
off, allowing a single focus on core 
content development usable across 
real money and social audiences as 
well as through the above mentioned 
distribution partnerships.
Platform and content development
During the year Grizzly was significantly 
enhanced following our beta launch 
of SpinGenie in Q4 2014, which scaled 
over £24m in deposits and £403m in 
wagers in 2015. We added new third-
party branded games and migrated 
PocketFruity casino onto Grizzly in  
Q1 2015. This allowed efficiency within 
the development team and also 
increased scalability for the brand. 
We also built our first real money 
Slingo games, Slingo Riches and Slingo 
Extreme – they quickly became the top 
performing games in 2015, accounting 
for 21% of the GGR in Q4 and were 
the most popular games played by 
over 47% of the funded players. 
We are most excited  
by the unified roadmap  
of new developments  
for both social and  
real money products  
and platform, which is 
only made possible by 
owning the value chain 
from end to end. 07 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
With the Group’s continued focus on 
mobile in terms of both platform and 
the content, 80% of our players gamble 
on mobile devices, accounting for 73% 
of our Gross Gaming Revenue in the UK.
In our social business, we grew our 
active development to five games in  
the portfolio by the end of 2015. Both 
Slingo Adventure and Slingo Shuffle 
mobile apps were launched in 2015 and 
together with the existing apps, scaled 
to approximately 964,000 monthly 
average users (“MAU”). We also 
completed the beta version of Slingo 
Blast for iOS and Android, and our new 
social version of our platform from which 
we beta launched our new social casino, 
Lucky Streak Slots in December.
Social games and Slingo IP acquisition
The acquisition of the Social Gaming  
and Slingo assets has enhanced each 
area of our content development,  
mobile audience scaling and platform 
leverage capability. Acquiring two games 
studios, rebranded as Blastworks, with 
their associated mobile marketing  
and publishing teams in Seattle and 
Vancouver Island, together with 
experienced leadership, operating  
under the name Blastworks, has opened 
up several new revenue streams and 
content opportunities for the Group.
It has brought revenues through its free 
to play apps in the US (65%), the UK (5%) 
and rest of the world (30%). The revenue 
is derived from the in-game sale of 
virtual goods and advertising services. 
We engage with our users on our free 
to play platform which is delivered 
through mobile platforms such as iOS, 
Android and Amazon as well as social 
networking sites such as Facebook.
In just over four months since acquisition 
the assets delivered £2.5m in revenue 
to 31 December 2015 and we acquired 
36,835 in new depositing players.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy during the year 
was to continue to target growth on 
the Grizzly platform. We added new 
features to the platform to allow for 
multiple offers by different channels 
which yielded improved returns and 
lower CPAs. The result has been an 
overall CPA on the Grizzly platform 
of £79 with 78,198 new depositing 
players in the year. We believe this is 
the lowest CPA across the industry for a 
UK casino. Our revenue per depositing 
player was £125 which is reflective 
of the new player base in 2015.
Marketing for our social gaming apps 
followed a similar strategy in order to get 
scale on the platforms. With new app 
releases in the year and constant release 
cycles, we were able to continuously 
improve acquisition and retention 
campaigns during the year. The cost 
of a new depositing player was £21.
Our cross device marketing capability 
continues to be a significant asset of the 
Group. In addition to marketing our own 
UK regulated gaming properties, our 
team integrated and complimented our 
social marketing activities immediately 
following the acquisition. With the 
sale of our third-party platform driven 
websites in 2016, our team will further 
focus on our B2C in both the real 
money and social markets leveraging 
a single BI and data platform.
Our player acquisition and CRM programs 
continue to leverage cutting edge 
technology, data science algorithms and 
proven talent in both the UK and the US.
Licensing and content innovation
In line with the Group strategy of 
developing, publishing and licensing 
next generation mobile content, 
we made great progress in 2015. As 
we have moved into 2016, we have 
seen the benefit of this with licensing 
deals with Zynga and Scientific 
Games. We are also delighted to have 
obtained a transactional waiver for 
New Jersey to provide a new bingo 
game into that market through a 
partnership with Pala Interactive. 
We have also looked to partner with 
market-leading content providers, 
integrating games from Ainsworth 
Technology, Instant Win Gaming, 
NetEnt and IGT. On top of this we 
have more recently signed licenses 
with Fremantle Media and Endemol 
to build unique branded Slingo games 
to widen our marketing appeal. 
Outlook
Our strategy for 2016 is to consolidate 
and focus on our core products. By 
disposing of our third-party platform 
driven websites, we are in a stronger 
position to streamline operations on our 
proprietary platforms. We continue to 
develop unique content which will bring 
exciting licensing opportunities in 2016 
and deliver growth and new potential 
for the Group. This content will also 
be delivered on our core platforms to 
enable greater product differentiation 
and player engagement. With the 
proven success of our marketing 
strategy, the new platform and the 
acquisition of Slingo, we are in a strong 
position for significant progress.

PLAYER DEMOGRAPHICS  
FOR REAL MONEY
With our focus on mobile delivery and original 
game IP, we are able to acquire a younger audience 
than the traditional online bingo industry. 25 to 34 
year olds account for nearly double the new users 
of any other age group and is reflective of the 
Group’s digital mobile acquisition methods. Whilst 
the products male/female split is roughly 50/50 in 
terms of acquisition, women as a group are near 
50% more profitable than their male counterparts 
which we believe is due to the paucity of female 
focused games as opposed to male dominated 
sportsbooks and represents a key opportunity for 
the Group moving forward.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Case study
Data driven and content rich for 
real money and social games  
with our new Grizzly platform
During 2015, Gaming Realms realigned its strategy to focus 
on its sites operating on the Grizzly proprietary platform, as 
well as creating and publishing innovative mobile content 
for real money and social gaming. 
The Group’s differentiated mobile offering on Grizzly which 
includes Slingo games, has led to significant revenue 
growth, as reflected in the Group’s updated trading 
statement announced on 27 January 2016. The Group has 
decided to continue to build on this success and focus 
investment in new games given the significantly superior 
marketing returns generated on the Grizzly platform.  
As a result, the Group has agreed to divest of the  
third-party platform driven website properties.
 
The Group intends to use the proceeds from the  
disposals for the development of new gaming content  
and marketing campaigns.

The Group delivered 
revenue growth of 116%  
to £21.2m (12M 2014: 
£9.8m) as a result of the 
addition of the GameHouse 
social mobile business

(£2.5m) and strong organic 
growth on real money 
gaming which increased 
362% to £10.8m  
(12M 2014: £2.3m).
Financial Review
Overview
Gaming Realms has delivered growth  
of 116% year-on-year to £21.2m  
(12M 2014: £9.8m, 15M 2014: £11.2m). 
Real money gambling on the Grizzly 
platform has grown 362% to £10.8m 
(12M 2014: £2.3m, 15M 2014: £2.7m). 
With investment in marketing and 
development of the platform we had 
an adjusted EBITDA loss of £4.1m (12M 
2014: £5.9m, 15M 2014: £7.8m).
Marketing for the year was £11.5m  
(12M 2014: £8.1m, 15M 2014: £10.2m) 
as the Group continued to acquire players 
to grow its platform and revenues.
During the year, Gaming Realms acquired 
the free to play Slingo assets and games 
studios from RealNetworks, Inc. The 
attributable revenue from acquisition 
was £2.5m with adjusted EBITDA loss 
attributed to these assets of £1.4m. 
Following the acquisition of the trade and 
assets of the Slingo free to play apps and 
game studios from RealNetworks, Inc.,  
we have introduced a new segment, 
social gaming and licensing, for the US 
business. The integration of the social free 
to play business has been integrated well 
into the Group and we are pleased with 
the initial contribution from this operation.
Income statement items
Revenue is made up of £10.8m  
(2014: £2.7m) from real money  
gambling on our Grizzly platform,  
£7.8m (2014: £7.4m) from marketing 
services and £2.5m from the Slingo 
assets acquired from RealNetworks,  
Inc. on 10 August 2015.
The increase in revenue in real money 
gambling is a reflection of the continuing 
investment into development, 
£1.8m (2014: £0.6m) and marketing 
£6.2m. The marketing has been very 
successful in the year delivering 
78,198 new depositing players at a 
cost per acquisition of £79. We have 
also seen positive ROI on marketing 
within six months after paying point 
of consumption tax, third-party 
licences, and ID and transaction fees. 11 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Point of consumption tax was introduced 
in December 2014 and accounted  
for £1.5m (2014: £0.4m) cost for real 
money gambling.
Operating expenses, including point  
of consumption tax, transaction fees  
and third-party licences totalled £5.7m  
(2014: £2.5m). The increase is a result of 
the introduction of point of consumption 
tax, and also driven by increased 
revenues and player deposits. The 
addition of the Slingo business also 
accounted for £0.6m of operating costs. 
The costs are in line with management 
expectations. 
Social games, Slingo IP acquisition and 
placing of £12.5m
On 10 August 2015, the Group 
acquired the following assets from 
RealNetworks, Inc.: GameHouse US; 
social and mobile freemium portfolio 
games and publishing network; Slingo 
brand and patents; certain game 
domains including sudoku.com and 
mahjong.com; an IP licence relating to 
the GameHouse Promotion Network 
and the entire issued share capital 
of Backstage Technologies Inc which 
includes the Canadian Game studio and 
collectively have organised these under 
a new division called Blastworks. The 
acquisition is in line with the Group’s 
strategy to build an international 
portfolio of engaging casual gaming 
brands. This operation is reported in the 
social gaming and licensing segment. 
The segment generated revenue of 
£2.5m and an adjusted EBITDA loss of 
£1.4m in the period between 10 August 
2015 and 31 December 2015.
Total consideration for the acquisition 
was £12m ($18m) of which £6.9m 
($10.7m) was paid in cash on completion 
with $4m payable on the first 
anniversary of completion and the 
remaining $4m payable on the second 
anniversary. The Group incurred 
acquisition related costs of £0.3m which 
have been disclosed in note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of the acquisition, the 
Group raised £12.5m for the issue 
of approximately 50m new ordinary 
shares as a placing completed on 
10 August 2015. Costs incurred in 
relation to the placing totalled £0.5m.
Details of the fair value of identifiable 
assets and liabilities acquired, and 
purchase consideration and goodwill are 
disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
To make year-on-year comparison easier, certain comparatives have been adjusted to 12 months to 31 December 2014 on an

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Board constantly monitors and assesses risks and uncertainties within the Group’s trading activities. Unfortunately, there will 
always be a level of risk which needs to be evaluated against the Group’s potential returns in any activity.
Risk Description of risk How this risk is managed
REGULATORY 
AND 
LEGISLATION
Online gambling and gaming is subject to  
a dynamic and complex regulatory regime.
The Group now holds licences from the 
Alderney Gambling Control Commission, the 
UK Gambling Commission and a transactional 
waiver for New Jersey Division for Gaming 
Enforcement.
It is key to the Group to maintain compliance 
with all licences and any new ones that are 
required. These are critical to the continuing 
operation of the Group’s gambling activities 
and also the production and supply of its 
unique content into both its operations and 
other third parties.
The Group has a compliance team to ensure that 
all regulatory guidelines are maintained in its 
gambling operations. The Group also maintains 
close legal counsel to advise on any changes to 
the regulatory framework, as well as updates on 
territories currently outside the Group’s activities.
TAXATION
From the end of 2014, the Group was subject 
to point of consumption tax in relation  
to its gambling activities within the UK.  
Any changes to the tax rate or the point it is 
incurred may adversely affect duty payable.
The Group has legal entities in several 
jurisdictions, including US, Canada and 
Alderney. Its real money gambling operations 
are based in Alderney where there is a zero 
rate for corporation tax and is outside the 
scope of VAT. If there was a change to the 
rate of corporate tax or VAT in Alderney, it 
would have an adverse effect on the amount 
of tax payable within the Group.
The Group continues to take advice and be 
prepared for any adverse changes in the 
gambling tax regime.
The Group has undertaken a detailed transfer 
pricing exercise to ensure that revenue and  
profits are attributed correctly between the 
operating locations. Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Risk Description of risk How this risk is managed
COMPETITION
The online and free to play gaming markets 
are highly competitive in North America 
and the UK. Failure to be able to hold a 
competitive advantage would result in 
attracting less players and have lower 
engagement on our apps and sites.
In following the Group’s strategy of developing 
new unique IP and content, the Group feels well 
placed to be able to compete in the markets it 
operates in. It invests significant resource to be 
able to improve its development and operations.
Diverse products and geographies also helps to 
diversify the risk.
TIME TO 
MARKET
The Group invests highly in technology and 
bringing new products and games to market. 
A delay in time to market will result in a loss 
of competitive advantage, a loss in potential 
revenue and also increasing cost of 
development.
The Group has invested highly in having a dual 
product track to allow its products and games  
to be ready for both licensing and publishing 
exploitation in the same release.
Extensive work is undergone on the planning 
stage to ensure that timeframes can be met  
and products go live at the highest standard.
THE TEAM
During the year the team has expanded 
across multiple locations. The ability to carry 
out the Group’s strategy is dependent on 
the engagement of its senior management 
team, its technology, marketing and 
operations teams.
The Group continues to invest in its employees to 
ensure that it can attract, recruit and maintain a 
high quality team.
To ensure this happens, the Group has taken on a 
management and engagement course during the 
year for all roles within the business.
The 2015 Strategic Report on pages 1 to 13, has been approved by the Board of Directors.

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2015 17 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union and the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and UK accounting standards 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice “GAAP”), including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock 
Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative 
Investment Market (“AIM”).
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 › select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 › make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 › state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
 › prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual 
Report and the financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are published on 
the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements, which may vary from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. 
The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing 
integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 18 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate governance
Although companies traded on AIM are not required to provide 
corporate governance disclosure, or follow guidelines in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”), the Directors recognise 
the value and importance of high standards of corporate 
governance. 
 
Given the Company’s size and the constitution of the Board, 
the following is a brief summary of the main aspects of 
corporate governance currently in place. 
 
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a 
Remuneration Committee with formally delegated 
responsibilities. 
 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mark Wilson. 
Its other members are currently Michael Buckley and  
Jim Ryan. This Committee reviews the performance of the 
Executive Directors and makes recommendations to the 
Board on matters relating to their remuneration and terms 
of employment. The Remuneration Committee also makes 
recommendations to the Board on proposals for the granting 
of share options and other equity incentives. The Board sets 
the remuneration, and terms and conditions of appointment 
of the non-executive Directors. 
 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jim Ryan. Its other 
members are Mark Wilson and Michael Buckley. The 
Committee determines the terms of engagement of the 
Company’s auditors and, in consultation with them, the 
scope of the audit. It receives and reviews reports from 
management and the Company’s auditors relating to the 
interim and annual financial statements and the accounting 
and internal control systems in use by the Group. The Audit 
Committee has unrestricted access to the Company’s auditors. 
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee monitors, 
amongst other matters, the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements. The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the re-
appointment of the external auditors. It is responsible 
for ensuring that an appropriate business relationship is 
maintained between the Group and the external auditors, 
including reviewing non-audit services and fees. The 
Committee meets with the Executive Directors and 
management as well as meeting privately with the external 
auditors. 
 
Corporate Governance
As the Board is small, there is not a separate Nominations 
Committee and the Board as a whole considers 
recommendations for appointments to the Board. 
 
The Directors follow the guidance set out by Rule 21 of AIM 
Rules relating to dealings by Directors in the Company’s 
securities and, to this end, the Company has adopted an 
appropriate share dealing code. 
 
Going concern 
Under company law, the Company’s Directors are required 
to consider whether it is appropriate to prepare financial 
statements on the basis that the Group and Company are 
a going concern. As part of the normal business practice the 
Group prepares annual and three-year plans and, in reviewing 
this information, the Company’s Directors are satisfied that the 
Group and the Company have reasonable resources and future 
cash flows to enable them to continue in business for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the Company and Group 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.  19 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Consolidated Statement of Changes  
in Equity 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 24 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
1. Accounting policies
General information
Gaming Realms plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”).
The Company is admitted to trading on AIM of the London Stock Exchange. It is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The 
address of its registered office is One Valentine Place, London, SE1 8QH.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively “IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU. 
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
where significant estimates and judgements have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effects are 
disclosed in note 2.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 31 December 
2015 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. 
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of 
the following elements are present: power over the investee; exposure to variable returns from the investee; and the ability of the 
investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that 
there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the 
statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their 
fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
Revenue
Revenue comprises net gaming revenue derived from real money gambling, commissions on marketing services, licensing, 
advertising and social gaming.
Net gaming revenue derived from real money gambling
Net gaming revenue derives from online gambling operations and is defined as the difference between the amounts of bets placed 
by the players less amounts won by players. It is stated after deduction of certain bonuses, jackpots and prizes granted to players.
Net gaming revenue is recognised to the extent that its probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Marketing services
Revenue is derived from marketing services provided in relation to online bingo and casino products. The commission revenue 
is calculated either as a percentage of net gaming revenue from the operators or in line with contracts (typically based on fixed 
price per player). Commission revenue is recognised to the extent that the probable economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Revenue is also derived from digital marketing services provided to both gaming and non-gaming clients. The revenue is 
calculated as a percentage of marketing spend and is recognised as a percentage of completion.

Statements

1. Accounting policies continued
Advertising revenue
Advertising revenue derives from contractual relationships with agencies, advertising brokers and certain advertisers for 
advertisements within our social games. Advertising revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the 
transactions occur.
Social gaming revenue
Social gaming revenue derives from the purchase of credits and awards on the social gaming sites. Social gaming revenue is 
recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occur.
Licensing revenue
Licensing revenue derives from contractual relationships for the use of intellectual property. License fees are recognised over the 
estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee. Revenue is recognised where substantially all risk and rewards have 
been transferred and there are no further monetary or financial obligations to be fulfilled by the licensor. 
Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA is a non-GAAP, company specific measure. Adjusted EBITDA excludes adjusting items from EBITDA. Adjusting items  
are non-recurring material items which are outside the normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities. These items are 
separately disclosed in order to enhance the reader’s understanding of the Group’s profitability and cash flow generation. 
Adjusting items include costs arising from a fundamental restructuring of the Group’s operations, acquisition costs and share-
based payment charges. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. 
Cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity 
interest in the acquiree. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and in the case of contingent 
consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of 
consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.
Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding inventories, investment properties and deferred tax assets)
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the 
financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount (ie the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, its cash generating units 
(“CGUs”). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from a business 
combination that gives rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate (their “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 26 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
1. Accounting policies continued
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the 
transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those 
operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net 
assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.
Exchange differences recognised as profit or loss in Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of long-term 
monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to 
that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group has not classified 
any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group’s accounting policies for financial assets are as follows:
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (eg trade receivables), but also incorporate other 
types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less 
provision for impairment. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the 
terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value 
of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such 
provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross 
carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of deferred and contingent consideration, customer funds, trade payables and other 
short-term monetary liabilities. 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument and with the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, subsequently recognised at amortised cost. 
Contingent consideration arising from business combinations that is classified as liability is subsequently measured at fair value 
through profit and loss. Deferred consideration arising from business combinations is recognised at present value and unwound 
over the period until settlement.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a 
financial liability or financial asset.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.

Share-based payments
Where equity-settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged 
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken 
into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the 
cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Non-vesting 
conditions and market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting 
conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative 
expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
is charged with the fair value of goods and services received.
The fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting conditions is measured by the application of the Black-
Scholes option pricing model by reference to the grant date of the options. The fair value of share options issued with market-
based vesting conditions is measured by use of the Monte Carlo method.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives. 
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or arise from other 
contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see 
section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
In-process research and development programmes acquired in such combinations are recognised as an asset even if subsequent 
expenditure is written off because the criteria specified in the policy for development costs below are not met.
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:
 › it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold;
 › adequate resources are available to complete the development;
 › there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
 › the Group is able to sell the product;
 › sale of the product will generate future economic benefits; and
 › expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from selling the products developed. 
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of 
intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful economic life
Customer databases 1–2 years
Development costs 3 years
IP 8 years
Domain name 2–3 years
Software 3 years 28 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
1. Accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement 
of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
 › The initial recognition of goodwill.
 › The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit.
 › Investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly 
attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The 
corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual 
value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Office, furniture and equipment 20% per annum straight-line
Computer equipment 33% per annum straight-line
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
Player liabilities
Liabilities to players comprise the amounts that are credited to customers’ accounts including provision for bonuses granted by 
the Group. These amounts are repayable in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is 
probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefit that can be reasonably estimated. The provision is measured at the 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax rate reflecting 
current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific the liability. 
Standards and interpretations
Management are considering the potential impact of IFRS 15 Contracts with customers and IFRS 16 Leases, but do not expect 
the new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2016 and which 
have not been adopted early, to have a material effect on the Group’s future financial information. 
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and 
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimates
(a) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and their values are written-down on the basis of the Group’s 
expectations of future economic benefits expected to be received by the Group. Any process which attempts to estimate future 
outcomes is subject to uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation uncertainty can give rise to material differences in 
asset carrying values, this will be stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements.

Statements continued

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
(b) Amortisation of development costs
Capitalised development costs are subject to amortisation over its useful life and reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Group amortises the assets over the 
life of the product. The estimated useful life of these assets at period end is three years.
(c) Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences and for tax loss carry-forwards. The assessment of 
temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards is based on management’s estimates of future taxable profits against which 
the temporary differences and loss carry-forwards may be utilised.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of their losses given that this is the Group’s third period of operation 
and there is no track record of taxable profits at this time. Deferred tax assets will be recognised when the Group has established 
a track record of expected future taxable profit.
(d) Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration
The fair value of contingent consideration is based on the probability of expected cash flow outcomes and the assessment of 
present values using appropriate discount rates. Further details in relation to key estimates and judgements are set out in note 26.
Judgements
(a) Revenue recognition
Social gaming revenue is recognised as the service is delivered. This is considered to be when the player buys credits to play the 
game on the basis that there is no further service to be delivered. In addition, revenue generated from in app ads are recognised 
when the advertisement is displayed or offer has been completed by the customer and confirmed by third-party reports.
Net gaming revenue is derived from real money gambling and is recognised as the total wagers less wins less promotional 
money to players.
Other revenue comprises of affiliate services and marketing services.
(b) Capitalisation and amortisation of development costs
The identification of development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation is dependent on management’s judgement and 
knowledge of the work done. Development costs of gaming software platforms are separately identified. Judgements are based 
on the information available at each period end. Economic success of any development is assessed on a reasonable basis but 
remains uncertain at the time of recognition. 
(c) Valuation of assets acquired on business combinations 
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at 
their fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are capitalised if they are separable from the acquired entity or 
arise from other contractual or legal rights. The amounts ascribed to these assets are arrived at by using appropriate valuation 
techniques to determine the fair value. Capitalised intangible assets are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets. 
This has ranged between 1 to 8 years for acquisitions to date.

1  On 1 August 2013, the Company granted options to B shares under the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI plan. The B share value will be 20 pence less than the prevailing 
price of the ordinary shares and will therefore have no value unless the value of the new ordinary shares exceeds 20 pence. EMI options can only be granted to 
employees who meet the statutory working time requirement, and cannot normally be exercised before 15 July 2015. All options granted under the New Share 
Option Scheme on Admission will be exercisable over B shares at their nominal value of £0.01 and will be capable of exercise, subject to certain exceptions, after 
two years of the date of grant.
2  On 1 August 2013, the Company granted Unapproved Options which have the same rights as the options granted over the B shares under the Gaming Realms 2013 
EMI plan, save that the exercise price will be 13 pence per ordinary share.
3  On 17 June 2014, the Company granted Unapproved Options which have the same rights as the options granted over the B shares under the Gaming Realms 2013

9. Segment information
The Board is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the 
information reviewed by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Group has two 
reportable segments. The social gaming provides freemium gaming and licensing services to the US and Europe. The real money 
gambling products and marketing services operates our brands and provides other digital marketing services to both gaming 
and non-gaming clients in the UK.

marketing services, in the year were £1,296,670 (2014: £1,338,882). This major customer receives marketing services from the Group.
Geographical information
The Group considers that its primary geographic regions are the UK, including the Channel Islands, US and the rest of the world. 
No revenue is derived from real money gambling in the US. Revenues from customers outside the UK (including the Channel Islands) 
and the US are not considered sufficiently significant to warrant separate reporting. All non-current assets are based in the UK.

Changes in tax rates and factors affecting the future tax charge
On 26 March 2015, the Finance Act received Royal Assent and so the previously announced reduced rate of corporation tax 
of 20% from 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted. Accordingly, deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2015 have been 
recognised at 20% (2014: 20%). There are unused tax losses carried forward as at the balance sheet date of £27,278,988 (2014: 
£21,695,023) equating to an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £5,455,798 (2014: £4,339,005). No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of these losses, as the recoverability of any asset is dependent upon sufficient profits being achieved in 
future years to utilise this asset. The timings of such profits are uncertain.  34 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
12. Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year. For fully diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is 
adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group’s potentially dilutive securities consist of share 
options and performance shares. As the Group is loss-making, none of the potentially dilutive securities are currently dilutive.

Goodwill
During the year, the Group acquired various gaming assets and Backstage Technologies Inc from RealNetworks, Inc. (see note 25) 
resulting in addition to goodwill of £4,300,671. A summary of the acquisitions and the goodwill acquired are listed below:
Acquisitions £

AlchemyBet Limited 1,344,118
QuickThink Media Limited 1,904,028
Blueburra Holdings Limited 6,829,690
Slingo assets and Backstage Technologies Inc. 4,548,211
Total goodwill 18,092,116
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets. A detailed review was 
undertaken at 31 December 2015 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by net present value of future cash 
flows derived from those assets. The Group has three CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated. The recoverable 
amounts to which the goodwill is allocated has been determined using a value in use calculation. The calculation of value in use 
is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player lifetime values and experience.
Cash flow projections have been prepared for a five-year period following which a long-term growth rate of 2% has been 
assumed. A discount rate of 25% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows, which is based on the Group’s specific 
risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital. 36 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
14. Intangible assets continued
The key assumptions of the forecasts were as follows:
 › number of new player depositing registrations;
 › rate of retention of existing players;
 › spending patterns of players; and
 › CPA or installs from different acquisition sources.
The above assumptions are based on the trends noted to date, industry standard measurements and management’s experience. 
The Directors do not believe any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would lead to an impairment of the carrying 
amount of the CGUs. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the CGUs as follows:

Financial assets of the Group are classified as loans and receivables and all financial liabilities are held at amortised cost except 
contingent consideration which is recognised at fair value through profit and loss. In the Directors’ opinion, there is no material 
difference between the book value and the fair value of any of the financial instruments.
The Group has some exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. There has been no material change to the financial instruments 
used within the business during the year except for contingent consideration and therefore no material changes to the risk 
management policies put in place by the Board which are now discussed below.
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies. Whilst 
acknowledging this responsibility, it has delegated the authority and day-to-day responsibility for designing and operating 
systems and controls which meet these risk management objectives to the finance and administration function. The Board 
regularly reviews the effectiveness of these processes in meeting its objectives and considers any necessary changes in response 
to changes within the business or the environment in which it operates.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on translation and on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than 
pounds sterling (GBP). The currency in which these transactions are primarily denominated is US dollars (USD).
The Group’s policy is, where possible to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the 
cash generated from their own operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other 
than their functional currency cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere in 
the Group. 38 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

The effect of a 20% strengthening of the US dollar against sterling at the reporting date on the US dollar denominated payables 
carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in losses after date and decrease of net 
assets of £844,557 (2014: £463). A 20% weakening in the exchange rate would, on same basis decrease loss after tax and 
increase net assets by £844,557 (2014: £463).

Contingent consideration – – 2,400,000 – – 4,887,648
The fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The inputs are 
categorised into three levels, with the highest level (level 1) given to inputs for which there are unadjusted quoted prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level (level 3) given to unobservable inputs. Level 2 inputs are directly or 
indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices. Contingent consideration is recognised as management’s best estimate of 
the amounts ultimately to be settled, based on probability settlement. Since year end the liability was settled at £2,400,000.
Capital management
The Group is funded entirely through shareholders’ funds.
If financing is required, the Board will consider whether debt or equity financing is more appropriate and proceed accordingly. The

24. Share-based payment 
Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan
On 1 August 2013, the Company adopted the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan to allow, at the discretion of the Board, any eligible 
employee to be granted EMI or non-EMI qualified options at an exercise price to be determined by the Board but not to be less 
than the nominal value of a share and will vest subject to such time based and share price performance based conditions as the 
Board may determine. 
Options to acquire ordinary shares under the EMI plan may be granted up to a maximum of £3,000,000 (based on the market 
value of the shares placed under option at the date of the grant).
No consideration is payable for the grant to of the option and the options are not transferable or assignable. Cash consideration is 
paid to the Company by the employee at the point that the share options are exercised. 
In 2013, the Company granted options for B shares under the Gaming Realms 2013 EMI Plan. B share value will be 20 pence less 
than the prevailing price of the ordinary shares and will therefore have no value unless the value of the new ordinary shares exceeds 
20 pence. EMI options can only be granted to employees who meet the statutory working time requirement, and cannot normally 
be exercised before 15 July 2015. All options granted under the New Share Option Scheme on Admission will be exercisable over 
B shares at their nominal value of £0.01 and will be capable of exercise, subject to certain exceptions, after two years of the date 
of grant.
Options are not exercisable later than midnight on the day before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options were fair valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, or where there are market-based performance conditions, 
a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s competitors in the sector.

Consideration of £2,500,000 and 7,575,758 shares with a total value of £2,500,000 were settled on 5 September 2014. The Group 
has agreed to pay additional consideration of up to £2,750,000 in cash and £2,750,000 in shares dependent on the achievement 
of set performance targets in the periods ending 31 December 2014, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016. The 
consideration will be settled in cash and ordinary shares of Gaming Realms plc on their payment dates on achieving the relevant 
targets. The Group has recognised £4,840,328 being the present value of contingent consideration having made a probability 
based assessment of the amount payable related to the additional consideration, which represents the fair value at acquisition 
date. Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Group’s expectation of what it will pay in relation to earn out 
agreement. The earn out targets are based on the EBITDA multiple of the annual results of the acquired business. The fair value 
of the contingent consideration is calculated by weighting the probability of achieving these targets to give an estimate of the 
final obligation.
Goodwill recognised in the acquisition of Blueburra Holdings Limited relates to the presence of certain intangible assets, such as 
experienced workforce and material cost savings, which do not qualify for separate recognition. The net cash acquired was an 
outflow of £1,847,946. Prior to acquisition for the period 1 October 2013 to 5 September 2014, the revenues generated was 
£3,797,695 and the consolidated profit after tax was £1,580,400. Since acquisition, Blueburra Holdings Limited generated

Parent Company Statement of Changes  
in Equity
For the year ended 31 December 2015 48 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
1. Principal accounting policies
These financial statements present the results of Gaming Realms plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: 1 October 
2013 to 31 December 2014).
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(“FRS 101”). 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. No profit and loss account is presented by the 
Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements are prepared in sterling. 
Basis of preparation
The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for all periods 
presented. Transition tables showing all material adjustments are disclosed in note 10. The accounting policies which follow set 
out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
(a) IFRS 2 Share-based Payment disclosure, the share-based payment arrangement concerns its own equity instruments and its 
separate financial statements are presented alongside the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
(b) IFRS 7 Financial Instruments disclosures, given that equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated. 
(c) IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement disclosures. 
(d) Certain disclosures required by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, including certain comparative information in 
respect of share capital movements.
(e) IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and related notes. 
(f) IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures relating to key management personnel compensation. 
(g) IAS 24 Disclosure of related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, given that any 
subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value, except for investments acquired before 
1 October 2013 where shares issued to effect business combinations and the conditions of the Companies Act 2006 are met, 
merger relief was applied and the resulting investment is recorded at the nominal value of the shares issued.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have 
occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it 
can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax 
losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the initial transaction is included as an 
exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account, except where financing of a foreign subsidiary through long-term loans is 
intended to be as permanent as equity. Such balances are treated as part of the net investment and any exchange differences 
are recorded in reserves.

Financial Statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2015 49 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of deferred and contingent consideration, customer funds, trade payables and other 
short-term monetary liabilities. 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument and with the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, subsequently recognised at amortised cost. 
Contingent consideration arising from business combinations that is classified as liability is subsequently measured at fair value 
through profit and loss. Deferred consideration arising from business combinations is recognised at present value and unwound 
over the period until settlement.

relevant notes.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2013, the 
Company’s date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the 
first time adoption of FRS 101. As such, this note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating the 
balance sheet at 1 October 2013 prepared under extant UK GAAP and is previously published UK GAAP financial statement for the 
period ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements IFRS 1 para 6–33 “First time adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards”.
There are no transition changes at 1 October 2013 and no changes to the profit and loss for the period ending 31 December 2014. 52 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

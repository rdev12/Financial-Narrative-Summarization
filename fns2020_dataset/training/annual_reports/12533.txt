CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT //
The quality of our producing assets, underpinned by our
financial position, secures our forward cash flows and
allows us to progress our exploration and development
programmes that could bring very significant upside.
Financial and operating performance
Strong oil and gas prices, notably in the first half of the year, generated sales revenues of
US$655.2 million in 2008 (2007: US$578.2 million) supported by high levels of demand from
our gas customers in Singapore and Pakistan. Average production for the year rose 2 per
cent to 36,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2007: 35,750 boepd) with good
production performance across our fields in the UK, Pakistan and Indonesia.
Operating cash flow after tax was US$352.3 million (2007: US$269.5 million), more than
sufficient to fund our investments in exploration and development projects during the year
and repay our bank borrowings. As a result our cash resources at 31 December 2008 were
US$323.7 million (2007: US$332.0 million) and our cash facilities undrawn at US$275.0 million
(2007: US$222.0 million). Operating profit rose for the fourth year running to US$261.7 million
(2007: US$219.4 million). Profit before tax for the year was US$277.6 million, an 89 per cent
increase on the previous year (2007: US$147.0 million), resulting in a 152 per cent increase
in profit after tax to US$98.3 million (2007: US$39.0 million).
Oil and gas proven and probable booked reserves increased to 228 million barrels of oil
equivalent (mmboe) (2007: 212 mmboe). Contingent resources, representing potential
reserves not yet booked, are 154 mmboe, so that total reserves and resources have
increased in the year by 3 per cent to 382 mmboe. Significant reserve additions included
the booking of reserves from the Chim Sáo oil and gas field in Vietnam and an increase in
our Indonesian Anoa field reserves of around 60 billion cubic feet (bcf), net to Premier,
following strong production performance.
Considerable progress was made in advancing our three major development project
approvals in the second half of 2008. Our project teams in Indonesia and Vietnam are now
intensively engaged in the execution phase of these development plans. Together these
three development projects are expected to add 25,000 boepd of production to Premier
over the next two to three years.

Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
“Considerable progress was made in advancing
our three major development project approvals
in the second half of 2008. Together these three
development projects are expected to add
25,000 boepd of production to Premier over
the next two to three years.”
Our exploration programme in 2008 delivered seven successes from 14 exploration and appraisal
wells. Notable successes included appraisal wells on Chim Sáo in Vietnam and on the Banda gas
field in Mauritania. There have also been a series of successful wells on the NW Gemsa permit in
Egypt, where first production of oil commenced during February.
In 2009, we will return to our programmes in Vietnam and Indonesia, drill our first wells in Norway
and Congo and continue to exploit our existing acreage in Pakistan and Egypt.
Our efforts to maintain the highest levels of health, safety and environmental performance standards
have been successful and have seen us exceed expectations in several areas. Judged across a
range of industry accepted metrics, Premier’s 2008 operations recorded our best safety performance
to date, received an HSE Award from Petro Vietnam for operational excellence in Vietnam and had
our environmental compliance performance rating upgraded to ‘Green’ by the Ministry of the
Environment for its operations in Indonesia. We continue our drive for continuous performance
improvement in these areas.
Shareholder returns
In the face of falling stock markets and the sharp decline in the price of oil, Premier's share price
dropped by 25 per cent in 2008, nevertheless outperforming the price of Brent which fell 64 per
cent from US$97 per barrel (bbl) at the beginning of the year to end the year at US$35/bbl. We
continued with our policy of selectively utilising cash resources to buy-back shares where justified
on valuation grounds and where this has a favourable impact on market valuation. During the
second half of the year we acquired a total of 2.8 million shares at an average cost of £9.04 per
share. Over the five year period to 31 December 2008, Premier shares increased in value by
116 per cent.
Outlook
Despite volatile markets and the sharp downturn in economic activity, the group is in a strong
position to maintain its growth profile. Already in 2009 we have progressed a number of critical
contracts which are now at the centre of our development projects. We are about to embark on an
extensive exploration and appraisal campaign, which has the potential to have a material impact on
the group.
The quality of our producing assets, underpinned by our financial position, secures our forward
cash flows and allows us to progress our exploration and development programmes that could
bring very significant upside.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW //
Premier’ s record profits for 2008 reflect strong production
and high oil and gas prices. Despite volatile markets the
group is extremely well placed to fund the forthcoming
capital expenditures and deliver medium-term growth.
Production and reserves
Significant progress has been achieved during 2008 in all our major development projects.
Project approvals at partner and government levels have been secured together with
negotiation of gas and transportation agreements and key supplier contracts. This activity
has positioned the group for success in the completion of our three projects in Indonesia and
Vietnam. These, together with an ongoing programme of infill drilling and de-bottlenecking
on our existing production portfolio, are expected to increase Premier’s production beyond
its stated target of 50,000 boepd.
Average production for the full year 2008 was 36,500 boepd (2007: 35,750 boepd), in line
with previous guidance. In the UK, production performance from the Scott field was
affected by maintenance work in the fourth quarter but the Wytch Farm and Kyle fields
performed strongly. In addition, both Pakistani and Indonesian fields saw strong demand
from gas customers coupled with good production performance.

Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
“As at 31 December 2008 proven and probable
reserves, on a working interest basis, based on
Premier and operator estimates, were 228 mmboe
(2007: 212 mmboe).”
At year-end, reserves comprised 22 per cent liquids and 78 per cent gas. The equivalent volume on
an entitlement basis amounted to 198 mmboe (2007: 188 mmboe) based on a price assumption of
US$60/bbl Brent (2007: US$60/bbl Brent).
Booked reserve additions and revisions include the Vietnamese Chim Sáo field where all joint
venture and government approvals were achieved in late 2008 and construction work on the first
wellhead platform has commenced. This has resulted in the booking of reserves for this asset for
the first time this year. In addition, there has been an increase in the Indonesian Natuna Sea Block
A reserves resulting from a comprehensive subsurface re-evaluation of the strong and consistent
production performance from the Anoa field. Other reserve additions include an increase to our
Pakistan portfolio in response to integrated reservoir studies conducted during the year.
Contingent resources at year-end remained steady at 154 mmboe (2007: 157 mmboe), the
successful commercialisation of the Chim Sáo field being offset mainly by improved definition of
undeveloped assets in Indonesia.
Exploration and appraisal
Premier participated in 14 exploration and appraisal wells in 2008, of which seven were successful.
Successes included: appraising the reserves base in the Chim Sáo discovery (Vietnam); appraising
the gas volumes in the Banda field (Mauritania); step-out drilling adding reserves to the Kadanwari
field (Pakistan); and making a new oil discovery at Al Amir SE (Egypt). We acquired over 4,250km of
new 2D seismic and 600km² of 3D to advance our exploration interpretations in preparation for
2009/2010 drilling. We have also acquired new licences in Vietnam and Norway.
Our exploration cash spend on drilling and seismic activities in 2008 totalled US$90.5 million on a
pre-tax basis (2007: US$104.7 million). Estimated post-tax expenditure was US$63.9 million.
In Vietnam our Chim Sáo North appraisal well (12W-CS-2X) in the Block 12W Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) confirmed the northern extension of the Chim Sáo field allowing development
sanction to proceed. Further south in the block we drilled two exploration wells and an exploration
sidetrack. The Chim Ung well and the Chim Công well were both oil discoveries, confirming the
southward extension of the exploration play but are currently considered sub-commercial. In
Premier’s adjacent operated block, the Block 07/03 PSC, a 1,525km 2D survey has been acquired
and a rig contracted for 2009 drilling.
Premier also had an active year in Indonesia, acquiring 2D seismic in the Tuna and Buton PSCs
(2,400km and 300km respectively) and reprocessing data in our North Sumatra Block A acreage.
These data are being interpreted and work is progressing towards drilling in all licences.
In Pakistan we started testing in the successful Qadirpur Deep-1 well, flowing 4.5 million standard
cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of high quality gas from hitherto undrilled reservoir zones below the
Qadirpur field. Production from this zone is expected onstream during 2009. In the Kadanwari
licence the K-17 well made a discovery in a fault block to the south west of the main field; the well
is being placed on production at an expected rate of up to 25 mmscfd.
A new discovery, Al Amir SE, in the NW Gemsa licence in Egypt, tested over 3,000 barrels of oil per
day (bopd) from Kareem sandstones and an appraisal well, drilled at year-end, tested 5,785 bopd.
Both wells were completed and production has already commenced.
Premier farmed out part of its licence equity for a full carry of our drilling costs on a high risk
prospect in our UK North Sea 23/22b Block. The well was dry but fulfilled the licence’s exploration
commitment. This allows us to retain the block and evaluate the possibility that the Moth condensate
discovery, made in 2008 in the adjacent 23/21 Block, extends into our licence. We have been
granted the contiguous licence, Block 7/7, across the border in Norway.
PERFORMANCE 06
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) //
Looking ahead to 2009, the exploration focus in South East Asia is in Vietnam, where we
plan to drill in Block 07/03 commencing in the second quarter. If that programme is
successful, it will high-grade a large number of follow-on prospects on this block and on
adjacent acreage held by Premier. In the Indonesian adjacent Tuna Block we are working up
interpretations of the newly acquired 2D, ready for drilling in late 2009 or 2010. We are also
planning to drill a deep Lama sandstone reservoir target beneath the Anoa field in the
Natuna Sea Block A PSC; this follows encouragement from our 2007 Pancing discovery in
this poorly-explored reservoir in the adjacent Kakap Block. In Pakistan, following the success
of the Qadirpur Deep well we are drilling similar deep reservoirs below the Badhra field with
the Bado Jabal well. This has the potential for several trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas. We are
also drilling another new fault block in the Kadanwari licence, where we have drilled similar
opportunities that were successful in the recent past.
A potentially high-impact well is being drilled in West Africa where we have farmed out equity
in the Congo Marine Block IX permit and are spudding a well on the large Frida prospect in
mid-2009. In Norway the delayed appraisal well on the Bream oil discovery is on course to
be drilled in the third quarter of 2009. The Grosbeak North prospect is also scheduled to be
drilled in the second quarter; we have farmed out equity in this licence (PL378) to reduce
financial exposure, but retain a 20 per cent equity interest. Later in the year the Greater
Luno well will target a possible extension of Lundin’s Luno field into our block.
Asia
Indonesia
During 2008, Premier’s operated Natuna Sea Block A gas sales amounted to 142 billion
British thermal units per day (BBtud) (gross), whilst the non-operated Kakap field contributed
a further 60 BBtud (gross). Liquids production from Anoa averaged 2,212 bopd (gross) and
from Kakap 6,000 bopd (gross). Overall, net production from Indonesia amounted to 11,700
boepd (2007: 12,000 boepd).
Following the signing of three Gas Sales Agreements (GSAs) with Sembcorp Gas Pte Ltd
(Sembgas) in Singapore and PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and PT Universal Batam
Energy (UBE) in Batam, Indonesia in April, the gas transportation and associated
agreements required to enable delivery of gas to Sembgas were executed in October 2008.
Negotiation of the associated transportation agreements for Batam sales are ongoing and
are expected to be signed in the second half of 2009. The Government of Indonesia has
approved the Plan of Development for three fields (Gajah Baru, Naga and Iguana). Long
lead item orders for steel, compressors, turbines and other critical equipment were placed
at the year-end. A second tender for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction
contract was completed on 16 March 2009. It resulted in gross cost savings of
approximately US$100 million. With reductions in expected drilling costs, total capex for the
whole project is now forecast at around US$920 million (gross). Maximum routine gas sales
will be in the order of 140 mmscfd and recoverable reserves from the three fields are
expected to exceed 500 bcf. First gas is now expected before October 2011 and is still in
advance of the contractual obligation under the GSA with Sembgas.
On North Sumatra Block A, commercialisation of the Alur Siwah, Alur Rambong and Julu
Rayeu fields continued with signature, in April 2008, of a second GSA with PLN, the state
electricity company, for the long-term supply of 15 BBtud of gas. The PSC terms for
extension are being amended in line with the (new) standard PSC for Indonesia and are
awaiting government approval. To compensate for changes in PSC terms, an amendment to
the first GSA with PT Pupuk Iskandar Muda (PIM) has been signed. The resulting increased
gas sales price will have a floor of US$6.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).

India 07
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Approval for the Plan of Development for the gas fields was received in January and Front End
Engineering Design (FEED) commenced in July and is currently nearing completion. Early gas from
Alur Rambong is targeted for 2010, whilst first gas from the main development of Alur Siwah is
expected in 2011. A Heads of Agreement was signed with ExxonMobil in November for use of
their facilities for transportation and a fully termed agreement is expected to be finalised in the first
half of 2009. Drilling is expected to begin on Alur Rambong by early 2010.
Work on the reactivation of the Tualang and Lee Tabue oil fields started in late 2008 and is
continuing. Up to six wells may be worked over and tested and subsurface studies have indicated
that there is potential to restart production from fields previously abandoned in 2001. Plans for a
larger scale reactivation will be based on the results of this initial programme.
Exploration activities during 2009 will focus on the drilling of the Anoa Deep well, expected in the
third quarter, and maturing of other licences for further exploration in 2010.
On the Buton Block, a 2D seismic programme began in early 2008 and processing is nearing
completion. During 2009 the operator will finalise studies to determine a location to be drilled in 2010.
On the Tuna Block, the acquisition of 2,400km of 2D seismic was completed in October.
Interpretation focused on maturing and high grading the current prospect inventory in parallel with
the work programme in Premier’s Vietnam Block 07/03 immediately to the north. It is now
anticipated that two wells on the Tuna Block will be drilled in early 2010.
In partnership with the government authority (MIGAS), Premier has been awarded joint study
participation for three blocks in North Sumatra (East Asahan), East Kalimantan (East Benjkanai) and
offshore NW Java (North Merak). Studies include reprocessing of seismic data and acquisition of
gravity data.
Vietnam
Following the interpretation of the 2007 3D data over Block 12W, Premier drilled a successful
appraisal well in the Chim Sáo field in 2008, which tested two zones at a combined rate of 4,330
bopd plus 3.5 mmscfd. All joint venture and government approvals for the project were achieved in
late 2008. As a result of the changing cost environment the development plan is being re-engineered
to a single platform development, with resultant cost reductions. Construction work on the wellhead
platform has commenced in Vietnam. Discussions are ongoing with potential providers of a Floating
Production, Storage and Offtake vessel (FPSO) for leasing to the field owners, and final execution
of both the FPSO lease agreement and the EPCI contract await conclusion of this process.
During 2008, Premier drilled three further exploration prospects in Block 12W. The Chim Ung-1
well intersected 15 metres of (net) oil pay in a good quality reservoir. A sidetrack was drilled into
the adjacent Chim Boi fault block, which did not encounter hydrocarbons. The Chim Công-1 well
tested oil at sub-commercial rates with seven metres of (net) oil pay. Premier continues to evaluate
these well results ahead of the expiry of the PSC exploration period late in 2009.
Premier became operator of Block 07/03 in late 2007 and in 2008 we acquired a 2D seismic
programme to define the location of two exploration wells, the first of which is planned for May
2009. The second well will follow at year-end. The exact schedule is dependent on the duration of
intervening wells drilled by the rig-share consortium which Premier is leading. In February 2008,
Premier was awarded Block 104-109/05 and has since begun geological studies and geophysical
reprocessing of seismic data to better understand the exploration potential of this acreage,
offshore northern Vietnam.
PERFORMANCE 08
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) //
Philippines
The Monte Cristo-1 exploration well on the SC43 licence proved to be dry and the well was
plugged and abandoned. Premier’s costs for the well were carried under a farm-out
agreement. Premier and its partners are currently carrying out exploration activities over a
prospective trend in the Panaon Limestone formation found with new seismic data obtained
in early 2008.
India
Premier is maintaining a limited presence in India pending resolution of the signature of the
Ratna licence with the Government of India.
Middle East-Pakistan
Pakistan
Production net to Premier in 2008 was 14,550 boepd, an increase of about 15 per cent as
compared to the 12,700 boepd in 2007, surpassing previous records. This additional
volume was due to increased gas demand, which was primarily met through additional
supplies from the Zamzama and Bhit/Badhra gas fields.
The Qadirpur field produced an average of 4,060 boepd, from Premier’s working interest of
4.75 per cent (2007: 3,980 boepd). The Qadirpur plant capacity enhancement project was
completed in 2008, with first gas achieved by the end of January 2009. A GSA was signed
with Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd, for the supply of 75 mmscfd permeate gas (equivalent
to 40 mmscfd processed gas), with first gas expected in 2010. Six new production wells were
drilled and tied-in to optimise increased processed gas sales. The Qadirpur Deep-1 well
was tested, flowing 4.5 mmscfd of high quality gas from hitherto undrilled reservoir zones
below the Qadirpur field. Production from this zone is expected onstream during 2009.
The Kadanwari field produced an average of 1,225 boepd in 2008 (2007: 1,260 boepd) from
Premier’s 15.79 per cent working interest. Despite natural production decline, field production
was maintained at 2007 levels largely due to tie-in of the new K-18 well. A new production
well K-17 was drilled and tied-in to the gas plant ahead of schedule on 30 December 2008.
To maintain and increase the production levels of the field, K-14ST is currently being drilled,
with further wells planned in 2009.
The Zamzama field produced an average of 6,075 boepd in 2008 (2007: 4,620 boepd), from
Premier’s 9.375 per cent working interest. The Zamzama Phase-2 development project was
commissioned in 2008 for production of High Calorific Value (HCV) gas. This resulted in a
production increase in 2008 of 32 per cent over 2007 levels.
Bhit/Badhra production was 3,190 boepd in 2008 (2007: 2,840 boepd) from Premier’s 6 per
cent working interest, an increase of 12 per cent over last year. The increase was due to the
completion of the Phase 2 development which enhanced plant capacity from 270 mmscfd
to 320 mmscfd, facilitating first gas from the Badhra field and accelerated production from
the Bhit field.
In Zarghun South, FEED is currently in progress and first gas is expected in 2010. Premier’s
costs pertaining to its 3.75 per cent interest in Zarghun South are substantially carried by
the operator.
Egypt
Pakistan 09
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Egypt
The Al Amir SE-1 well, drilled in October 2008, encountered oil in the Kareem formation, opening
up a new play in the area. The well tested over 3,000 bopd and 4.25 mmscfd of associated gas.
An appraisal well was then drilled on the discovery at year-end encountering two Kareem sandstones
with 42ft of net pay. This second well tested 5,785 bopd of 42° API with 7.8 mmscfd of gas from
one of the two 20ft zones – the second zone will be perforated at a later date.
In addition, the 2005 Al Amir discovery was re-evaluated and the original Al Amir-1 well was re-entered
and sidetracked in December in order to re-appraise the well as a potential producer. The sidetrack
confirmed the lateral extension of the original reservoir and also encountered deeper pay. The upper
zone was tested with a sustained rate of 416 bopd of 16° API; the lower pay will be tested at a
future date.
Development plans to bring the Al Amir and Al Amir SE wells into early production were submitted
to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and production on Al Amir SE commenced in
February 2009. Flow rates had risen to over 3,000 bopd (gross) by early March. The oil is being
produced from the discovery well Al Amir SE-1X and the first appraisal well Al Amir SE-2X. A 7km
pipeline has been laid between these two wells and the Gazwarina facilities to which the oil is
being transported. The Al Amir-1 well is intended to be brought onto production shortly.
Abu Dhabi
The joint venture continues to pursue the acquisition of upstream oil and gas assets across the Middle
East and North Africa, with a particular focus on future projects in Abu Dhabi and Iraq. An office has
opened in Abu Dhabi and is staffed by a small team of secondees from Premier and Emirates
International Investment Company LLC (EIIC).
North Sea
UK and Norway
Production in the UK amounted to 9,300 boepd (2007: 9,850 boepd) representing 25 per cent of
the group total (28 per cent in 2007). Operational difficulties on the Scott field, particularly in the
fourth quarter, were offset by successful programmes of infill drilling on other fields.
The Wytch Farm oil field contributed 2,965 boepd production net to Premier, similar to 2007. A strong
underlying production performance was maintained by a proactive well-work campaign and minimal
production interruptions. At the start of the year the M20 injection well was brought on line, and,
together with other water handling improvements, has helped to restore reservoir pressure. The
B41 rig was then mobilised to Furzey Island to drill the K08 and L13 infill wells and three workovers.
A subsequent A12 sidetrack well has exceeded expectations and will be brought on line shortly.
The Wareham field is also back in production and the infield pipeline replacement project has been
completed with testing and commissioning completed in early 2009.
Production from the Scott and Telford fields was lower than expected at 3,525 boepd (net) (2007:
3,700 boepd). Work on facility projects designed to improve reliability and extend facility life was
ongoing during the second half of the year. Two power generator units have now been upgraded.
Modifications to the SAGE export pipeline to import gas have been rescheduled to 2009. In October
2008 a three to four well infill drilling programme commenced.
Net production from Kyle was 2,500 boepd, an increase on 2007 as a consequence of improved
operational performance and a full year under gas lift. Production performance during the second
half of 2008 was more reliable due to facility modifications to the Banff FPSO compressor system
during September. Work continues to optimise the operation of the three producing wells.

Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) //
The Fife Area, where the planned suspension of production occurred on 2 May, accounted
for the remainder of UK net production. Subsea facilities were made safe and the FPSO unit
departed the field in September. Removal of remaining risers is scheduled for 2009 after
which the field will be suspended pending redevelopment or future abandonment.
Discussions have been held with a number of parties interested in participating in further
appraisal and redevelopment of the fields.
On the Frøy field in Norway (PL364), a Plan of Development was submitted to the authorities
in September. Recent events in the banking markets, however, have impacted the planned
contractor financing of the Jack-up Production Unit and development planning is now
progressing for first oil in 2013. The PL364 licence owners have agreed to use the delay to
implement cost reduction measures and to investigate opportunities for third party tie-ins.
In addition to existing discoveries in the area surrounding Frøy, several new wells in the area
are planned by operators during 2009. Having satisfied the initial licence work commitment
the Frøy field partners have been granted a 10-year licence extension by the authorities.
Exploration activities in the North Sea focused on remaining potential in the UK portfolio
and moving towards drilling up the Norwegian acreage.
On Block 23/22b in the UK the Sparrow well was farmed out to Oilexco and BG. The well
was drilled, in March, to a depth of 10,598ft, 50ft into the Ekofisk formation, fulfilling licence
commitments. Good reservoir sands were penetrated but unfortunately these were water
wet. The well was drilled at zero cost to Premier.
Subsequently, Oilexco and BG announced the discovery of oil in the deeper Moth prospect
on the adjacent Block 23/21. This discovery has encouraging implications for the Block 23/22b
licence and the deeper Jurassic prospectivity. BG has farm-in rights to the deeper prospect
on Block 23/22b under which Premier would receive a partial carry whilst reducing equity.
Premier was awarded the operatorship of Block 7/7 on the Norwegian side of the median
line in the APA 2008 licence round. This block adjoins the 23/22b licence and provides
Premier with complete coverage of the Jurassic prospectivity identified adjacent to the
Moth discovery.
In Norway, on PL407, failure by the operator to obtain approval to bring the contracted rig
into Norwegian waters has resulted in the Bream appraisal well slipping to the third quarter
of 2009. This well will now be drilled with an alternative rig. A 12-month extension to the
licence deadline has been granted by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.
On the Premier-operated licence PL406 the 3D seismic acquisition was completed as
planned in April. Processing of the new data commenced and initial fast track volumes were
received ahead of schedule. Site surveys and leg cores for the well are planned for the
second and third quarters of 2009 respectively. A rig has been contracted to drill the
Gardrofa prospect, expected to spud in the third quarter of 2010.
The recent Jordbaer discovery has significantly enhanced the potential of our adjacent
licence PL374S and the decision has been taken to enter the drilling phase of this licence
with an expected well in 2010. In the PL359 licence, immediately south of the 2007 Luno
discovery, a well is planned for the fourth quarter of 2009.
The PL378 licence has been successfully farmed down with Premier retaining an equity
position of 20 per cent in the licence. The carried well is planned on the Grosbeak North
prospect and will spud in the second quarter of 2009.
Premier has exited the PL419 licence, disposing of its 25 per cent interest to Nexen,
the operator. 11

West Africa
Mauritania
In Mauritania, Chinguetti production averaged 11,700 bopd (950 bopd net to Premier) in 2008.
The Chinguetti Phase 2B development programme comprising three workovers and two new
production wells was completed in the fourth quarter of 2008, increasing gross production from
10,000 bopd to 17,100 bopd by year-end. Production performance will be carefully monitored
during 2009. The operator continues to review and assess remaining potential within the field for
a future drilling campaign.
Evaluation of opportunities and development options on PSC A and PSC B are progressing. In 2008
the joint venture drilled the Banda-NW well and sidetrack and the Banda East well, with the objective
of defining the Banda gas and oil resources and commercial viability. Both wells were suspended as
potential future producers. The operator continues working on the Field Development Plan with
target completion by mid-2009 for an investment decision.
The operator is re-evaluating the Tiof field and proposing to reprocess the seismic data to assist in
better defining the subsurface and progressing this discovery to a development decision.
The joint venture partnerships are currently in discussions with the Mauritanian Government to
extend the existing PSCs.
Congo
In Congo, a farm-out of 27 per cent of our equity was completed providing significant funding for a
possible two-well programme on the Marine IX licence. Following the farm-down, Premier retains a
31.5 per cent equity and anticipates spudding the first of the Albian raft prospects, Frida, in July
2009. The Transocean Aleutian Key semi-submersible rig has been contracted to drill the Frida well
and preparations for the drilling operation are well advanced with the environmental impact study
completed and long lead items acquired. Further progress has also been made in the evaluation of
our deep water exploration block focusing on the Tertiary channel sands that have proven
productive in the adjacent blocks.
The Frida prospect is a large untested Albian raft with multiple stacked reservoir seal pairs and
potential reserves of 170 mmboe.

PERFORMANCE 12
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
FINANCIAL REVIEW //
Net cash at 31 December 2008 amounted to US$117.3
million (2007: net cash of US$79.0 million). Together with
our undrawn cash facilities of US$275.0 million, this will
contribute substantially towards the financing of
Premier’s significant development programme over
the next three years.
Economic environment
2008 was a turbulent year for the world economy and for oil and gas prices in particular.
Brent opened the year at US$97/bbl, reached a peak of US$147/bbl in July 2008, before
falling back to end the year at US$35/bbl. The early part of 2009 has seen continued
volatility but prices have recovered to around US$45/bbl on average.
The deterioration in the oil price environment has led to downward pressure on operating
and development costs, which had increased during the recent period of sustained rising
commodity pricing and increasing activity levels. Premier is capturing the benefits of falling
costs in rig rates and development costs.
Income statement
Production levels in 2008, on a working interest basis, averaged 36,500 boepd compared
to 35,750 boepd in 2007. On an entitlement basis, which allows for additional government
take under the terms of our PSCs, production was 31,750 boepd (2007: 31,450 boepd).
Realised oil prices averaged US$94.5/bbl compared with US$72.3/bbl in the previous year.
Gas production averaged 148 mmscfd (25,300 boepd) during the year or approximately
69 per cent of total production. Average gas prices for the group were US$6.57 per
thousand standard cubic feet (mscf) (2007: US$5.60/mscf). Gas prices in Singapore, which
are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) pricing, which in turn is closely linked to crude
oil, averaged US$15.2/mscf (2007: US$11.3/mscf) during the year.
Total sales revenue from all operations was 13 per cent higher than 2007 at US$655.2 million
(2007: US$578.2 million) as a result of higher production and commodity prices. This figure
includes a reduction of US$15.9 million arising from the price ceilings in our hedging contracts.
Cost of sales was US$317.6 million (2007: US$267.5 million). Excluding the effect of inventory
movements, underlying unit operating costs were higher at US$9.5 per barrel of oil equivalent
(boe) (2007: US$9.0/boe) due to a full year of increased production from the Scott field in
the North Sea. Amortisation includes the effect of an impairment charge of US$31.9 million in
respect of the Chinguetti field in Mauritania. Underlying unit amortisation (excluding impairment)
fell marginally to US$8.0/boe (2007: US$8.2/boe). Exploration expense and pre-licence
exploration costs amounted to US$42.9 million (2007: US$65.3 million) and US$15.8 million
(2007: US$8.3 million) respectively, following deferral of the Bream appraisal well in Norway
to 2009. Administrative costs were stable at US$17.2 million (2007: US$17.7 million).
Operating profits were US$261.7 million, a 19 per cent increase over the prior year. Finance
costs net of interest revenue totalled US$12.4 million (2007: US$7.5 million). Pre-tax profits
were US$277.6 million (2007: US$147.0 million). This included a non-cash gain relating to
mark to market revaluation of the group’ s gas hedges totalling US$21.5 million (2007: non-cash

Hedging and risk management
The Board’s policy continues to be to lock in oil and gas price floors for a portion of expected
future production at a level which protects the cash flow of the group and the business plan. Such
floors are purchased for cash or funded by selling calls at a ceiling price when market conditions are
considered favourable. All transactions are matched as closely as possible with expected cash flows
to the group; no speculative transactions are undertaken.
During 2008, oil hedges for 1.8 million barrels (mmbbls) matured for which a payment under the
terms of the hedges arose during the year of US$8.1 million. At the end of 2008 a total of 7.2 mmbbls
was hedged (approximately 1.8 mmbbls per annum) under a physical offtake agreement representing
approximately one half of UK oil production until December 2012 with an average floor price of
US$39/bbl and a cap of US$100/bbl. In early 2009, further hedging was undertaken which for the
same volumes of 1.8 mmbbls a year lifted the floor to US$50/bbl for 2010 and 2011 in return for a
cap reduction to US$80/bbl and a cash premium of US$5.8 million.
During 2008, gas hedges for 120,000 metric tonnes (mt) expired for which payments of US$7.8 million
were made during the year. At the end of 2008 a total of 522,000 mt of HSFO was hedged
(approximately 120,000 mt per annum) representing one third of Indonesian gas production, until
June 2013 with a floor price of US$250/mt and a cap of US$500/mt.
PERFORMANCE 14
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED) //
Premier’ s gas hedging is required to be marked to market at the balance sheet date. The aggregate valuation is a US$2.9 million
liability (2007: US$24.4 million liability) generating a US$21.5 million non-cash gain in the 2008 income statement. From
1 July 2008, oil hedges were incorporated within the pricing terms of physical offtake agreements for the underlying oil
production. Mark to market revaluations are not therefore applied to the new oil hedges at year-end. Liabilities accrued
under the old hedges will be amortised to the income statement over the life of the new hedges and the resulting gain
is included in total gains for the year in respect of oil hedges of US$6.8 million.
As the group reports in US dollars, exchange rate exposures relate only to sterling receipts and expenditures, which are
hedged in dollar terms on a short-term basis. The group recorded a loss of US$2.5 million on such hedging at year-end
(2007: US$0.4 million).
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits, AAA rated liquidity funds and A1/P1 commercial paper subject
to Board approved limits.
The group undertakes an insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with its
exploration and production activities. In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash
flow from producing fields.
Going concern
The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year to ensure that it has sufficient
funds to meet forecast cash requirements. Sensitivities are run to reflect latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil
prices and other factors to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or covenant breaches in order to ensure the group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. Further details of the group funding facilities and liquidity position are included in the
financial statements and related notes.
Although the world economic crisis has created uncertainty at the current time, the directors consider that the headroom
provided by the available borrowing facilities gives them confidence that it has adequate resources, including taking
into account the subsequent event in note 26 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, to continue as a going
concern. As a result they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2008 Annual Report and Financial
Statements.
Business risks
Premier is an international business which has to face a variety of strategic, operational, financial and external risks. Under
these distinct classes, the company has identified certain risks pertinent to its business including: exploration and reserve
risks, loss of key human resources, drilling and operating risks, security risk in area of operations, costs and availability of
materials and services, economic and sovereign risks, market risk, foreign currency risk, loss of or changes to production
sharing or concession agreements, joint venture or related agreements, and volatility of future oil and gas prices.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and
reputation. Premier manages its risks by maintaining a balanced portfolio, through compliance with the terms of its
agreements and application of appropriate policies and procedures, and through the recruitment and retention of skilled
individuals throughout the organisation. Further, the company has focused its activities mainly in known hydrocarbon
basins in jurisdictions that have previously established long-term oil and gas ventures with foreign oil and gas companies,
existing infrastructure of services and oil and gas transportation facilities, and reasonable proximity to markets.
A summary of the principal risks facing the company and the way in which these risks are mitigated is provided in this
report and also on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com).

SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW //
Introduction
Premier is committed to applying the high ethical standards necessary to maintain our reputation
as an employer and operator of choice. To deliver this goal, our investment and operational
decisions take appropriate account of the social, health, safety and environmental impacts that may
arise during our activities. In a year that saw dramatic changes in the global financial and energy
markets, we remained committed to investing in the countries and communities in which we
operate; refused to cut corners on maintaining excellence in HSE management; and stayed on
track in implementing our plans to reach our aspiration of being an industry leader in social
performance. Our project teams in Vietnam and Indonesia have remained committed to safe
design and have shown tenacity in balancing environmental protection considerations with the
economic viability of options in the rapidly changing financial conditions.
Social performance reporting
We publish a Social Performance Report every two years, and in the intermediate years prepare a
Communication on Progress. Our Social Performance Report for 2006/7 was published early in
2008 and can be found on our website (www.premier-oil.com). For 2008 we are publishing a
Communication on Progress in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations Global
Compact principles.
Social responsibility
In 2008, Premier saw success and recognition for health, safety, environmental and social
performance and in many areas we exceeded expectations. In addition to recording our best safety
performance to date, we received an HSE award for operational excellence from Petro Vietnam for
our drilling operations, and in Indonesia were awarded a higher level environmental performance
rating by the Ministry of Environment for our Anoa field production operations. Only seven out of
55 exploration and production companies achieved this.
We remain keenly aware of our responsibilities as a corporate citizen. Backed by a strong Board-
level commitment, this year we have enhanced and implemented a coherent set of policies that lay
down the principles by which we manage human rights, relationships with communities, employment
practices, business ethics, the health and safety of people working in our operations and our
impact on the environment. During 2008, we continued to work closely with local communities,
employee representatives, business partners and regulatory authorities to deliver our policies and
to make a positive difference within the localities where we operate.
Community and society
We continue to actively support social and community projects in the areas in which we work.
Around the world, the nature of our presence varies in terms of size and duration and our
involvement in the community is designed to be consistent with the nature of that work.
In Indonesia, our community development audit by the national upstream oil and gas regulator
BPMIGAS received the ‘Green’ award, the second highest possible certification. We have
maintained our long-term community programmes which are predominantly designed to deliver
sustainable skills within the communities of the Natuna Islands, which are closest to our offshore
activities. Our programmes include support for education, organisational structures, resources and
relationship building for local and village level officials, support for local fishermen and training for
community health services.
Our deepening relationship with local communities was acknowledged by local government
officials in several speeches. We consulted with local communities in order to identify their needs
correctly. We responded by supporting training to improve local maternity, infancy and elderly
health services. Moreover, medicine and medical equipment was also supplied to improve public
health services in Matak.
In the education sector, Premier developed its commitment to early childhood education. We
established a kindergarten in Terbang Village, refurbished Al-Quran and Pertiwi kindergartens in
Terempa Village and revitalised kindergarten playgrounds. We supported 33 kindergarten teachers
of the Anambas District to pursue higher education, focusing on the Open University Early
Childhood Education, supplied books for libraries, and also facilitated a local youth conference.
PERFORMANCE 16
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (CONTINUED) //
In Jakarta, we distributed books to libraries for deprived students in co-operation with
university students who, by distributing these books, are encouraged to start assisting the
less fortunate students.
Premier also assisted an association for fishermen in Putik Village to nurture fisheries.
Ongoing projects include building a public health centre in Candi Village, a public library in
Jemaja, and a kindergarten in Rintis Village.
In Vietnam we have been focusing on education and infrastructure. Our first projects delivered
buildings for the Tan Hung elementary school in Binh Phuoc Province in 2006. We also
supported an upgrade to the elementary school in the Thanh An commune, Can Gio District
of Ho Chi Minh and improved facilities for Tan Nghia elementary school, in Binh Thuan
Province. We provided scholarships to allow 28 of the poorest children in the community
to attend the school.
Premier has invested in the construction of six bridges in the Mekong Delta, providing safe
and reliable access to the nearest town for 28,000 people. Careful consideration is given to
the location of each bridge to ensure that those in the poorest areas benefit.
In Pakistan we worked with our joint venture operators to develop and implement
community development projects in the areas of operation. The main activities are
education and health where the projects are designed to be sustainable and include clinics,
schools and water supply schemes. In addition, to promote higher education in the field of
oil and gas, a Premier Oil Chair is being funded in the Petroleum Engineering Department
of the University of Engineering and Technology.
During 2008 we reduced the scale of our operations in India following our lack of drilling
success in Assam, but were pleased to provide the villagers of Phaneng in the Tinsukia
District with a tourist eco-centre. Silchar town, our restored drilling site, has become an
established island site. It is now protected from the endemic severe flooding and may be
used for the benefit of the community.
Human rights
We support the fundamental rights articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and regularly review our policies and practices. We have updated our human rights policy to
explicitly recognise our responsibility to respect the rights of indigenous peoples in the
countries in which we operate.
Employment practices
Our policy is to ensure equal opportunities in career development, promotion, training and
reward for all of our employees. We continually monitor the skills required to manage our
activities and ensure there is a balance of skilled, experienced expatriate and local employees
in our overseas offices. We seek to avoid discrimination in the workplace. In support of our
aim to attract, develop and retain talented and committed people to deliver our business
goals and objectives, we have instigated a new individual development pathway model
which will make more visible to employees seeking promotion and individual growth the
necessary competence requirements. In late 2008 we also began a programme of specific
training in leadership to enhance communication, relationships, business behaviour,
teamwork, coaching, change management and strategic leadership. All employees in Asia
have participated in the initial foundation phase of this programme.
Following feedback from last year’s employee satisfaction survey, we have embarked on a
programme of actively promoting and revising our key policy statements, procedures and
standards throughout the company, together with enhancing the business management system. 17
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
An ethical approach to business
Integrity, honesty and fairness are fundamental to the way we conduct our business. We recognise
the value in fostering a culture of transparency, honesty and accountability, both internally and in
dealings with third parties. Our objective is to ensure the highest ethical standards and anti-corruption
measures are applied within all of our operated entities and external business relationships.
We are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and have given an undertaking to help
realise the Secretary General’s vision of a more sustainable and inclusive global economy.
Health and safety performance
Premier is committed to providing a safe, healthy and secure working environment for all of our
employees and contractors. In 2008 we delivered the best safety performance in our history,
recording only one lost time injury in 2.4 million man-hours worked. During this period we
maintained our production operations in the Anoa field in Indonesia; conducted offshore drilling
operations in Vietnam and Gabon, onshore drilling in India, offshore seismic surveys in Vietnam and
Indonesia, and project construction work in Vietnam.
We continue to enhance our approach to process safety, requiring that UK-style safety cases are in
place for all our current and future production operations and that our maintenance systems are
independently verified. We introduced asset integrity protocols for assessing new business
opportunities as part of our due diligence process.
Occupational health and safety
In 2008 we incurred only one significant injury (one lost time injury) and recorded a combined
LTI/RWDC frequency of 0.40, down from 1.86 in the previous year.

Premier underwent a number of OHSAS 18001 surveillance audits on our drilling and production
operations around the world. OHSAS 18001 is a standard to which a company’s health and safety
management system may be certified. Certification demonstrates that an accredited body has
independently verified that Premier’s management systems fully comply with the standard.
Successful certification and ongoing surveillance audits confirm that Premier continues to meet the
highest standards wherever we drill or operate. We have held this prestigious award since 2004 for
drilling and 2006 for production. We are pleased to report that both our drilling and production
functions retained their OHSAS 18001 certification in 2008.
We are continuing with our programme to ensure that all employees and long-term consultants
and contractors undertake thorough fitness for work health examinations before working offshore,
or in remote areas. Our travel risk assessment process ensures that business travellers are made
fully aware of the inoculations necessary for their destination, of any specific or new health risks and
of appropriate contingency measures.
PERFORMANCE 18
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (CONTINUED) //
Process safety performance
Premier follows best industry practice wherever we operate. In Indonesia, although not
mandatory, we prepared a ‘Safety Case’ to UK standards for our operated production
facilities and in 2008 conducted a thorough review to ensure that all changes to the
facilities, manning levels, operating procedures and risk assumptions were captured. We are
pleased to report that this exercise has been completed and that risks remain below the
industry average. This process will be continued in our development projects in both
Indonesia and Vietnam.
Our maintenance management system was enhanced to identify and capture safety critical
equipment performance. In 2008 we moved closer to a full verification scheme and are in
the process of contracting an independent verification body to confirm that equipment
performance is meeting the expectations in the safety case.
One area of focus is staff competence. We now have new initiatives to provide international
vocational qualifications using best oil industry training standards. The first stage of this
process is the preparation of training and competency matrices for each job description,
and the identification of training courses and on the job assessment to international
standards. We are committed to the full implementation of these initiatives, recognising that
delivery of the full process will take some time.
In line with our desire for a robust process safety management system for our production
facilities we have revised our drilling management system to include the requirement for a
full independent assessment of the condition, functionality and maintenance regime of all
safety critical equipment on the rigs. This was implemented throughout 2008 and helped us
realise our best ever safety performance.
Environmental performance
Our environmental strategy is to reduce our environmental emissions and discharges to as
low a level as is reasonably practicable (ALARP). This is in line with our corporate HSE policy.
Based on this approach we have been conducting an ALARP assessment for each operated
project as part of its environmental aspects analysis and have also encouraged our non-
operated joint venture partners to adopt this approach.
We have developed a formal Premier Oil environmental monitoring system to capture all
our emissions, discharges and chemical use from source drilling and production report data.
We expect this system to compare data by environmental aspect, thereby enabling us to
demonstrate achievement of ALARP , and helping us with performance improvements. The
pilot system is being trialled before being rolled out to all business units.
We believe formalised and integrated management systems are a key driver in sustaining
operations and reducing environmental impacts. Premier has been ISO 14001 certified since
2004 for drilling operations and we have been working to achieve compliance in production
operations. In 2006 we achieved certification for production but this was suspended in 2007
when we lost a little of our impetus for improvement. We are pleased to report that in 2008
we retained our drilling certification and regained our production certification. 19

Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary
Sustainability Reporting (2005) in the following four core areas as detailed below:
2008 2007
Greenhouse gases (GHG) (tonnes per thousand tonnes of production) 167 171
Oil spills (tonnes) – 13.7
Oil in produced water (parts per million) 23 20
Energy use (gigajoules per tonne of production) 2.0 1.8
Emissions
We calculate our greenhouse gas (CO
2
equivalent) emissions both in tonnes emitted and in tonnes
per thousand tonnes of production for our production and drilling operations across our global
portfolio. In 2008 we emitted approximately 202,755 tonnes of greenhouse gas in total. This
equates to 167 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production, down from 171 in 2007. This shows we
are continuing to improve our performance year on year.
Midway through 2008, we assessed the main impacts on emissions in the Anoa field in Indonesia
and adopted new well management strategies and spare parts availability to improve reliability and
emissions. In 2009 we plan to evaluate options for process and technology enhancements to
reduce emissions in this field.
We benchmark our environmental performance by contributing our data to an industry database
compiled and published by the Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP). Our greenhouse gas
emissions performance has been broadly in line with the OGP average of 162.
Spills and discharges
In 2008 there were no reported environmental incidents worldwide, down from 15 in 2007. This
significant improvement was as a result of our continued focus on pollution prevention and the
implementation of more stringent drilling rig acceptance criteria which now includes containment
surveys.
There was no significant change in the volume of produced water discharged from our Anoa
production facilities from 2007 to 2008. The average concentration of oil in produced water of
23 parts per million remains well within the limits set by the Indonesian government.
Resource use
The main sources of energy that power our facilities are fuel gas and diesel. Our energy use has
been consistent over the last five years and remains within the range of 1.8 to 2.0 gigajoules per
tonne of production.
Additional indicators
We also collate data, categorised by IPIECA as ‘additional’, including solid waste and fresh water
use. We are continuing to refine our data collection and internal auditing procedures for these
additional indicators to improve accuracy.

GOVERNANCE
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
21 22
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT //
Compliance and the role of our Board
The company has established procedures and policies to ensure compliance with the code provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code). As recommended by the Code, we report below on how the main and
supporting principles of the Code have been applied throughout the year and explain any areas where we have not complied with
any of the Code’s provisions. While this is an important exercise, the Board does not believe that good governance can be defined
merely in terms of compliance with a set of rules. The overall purpose of the Board is to represent the company’s owners, ensure that
the company’s strategic objectives are properly pursued and the major business risks are actively monitored and managed. This goes
beyond regulatory compliance and puts the interests of our shareholders as the Board’s primary focus.
The Board considers that the company has complied with the provisions of the Code throughout the year under review (and
subsequently up to the date of this report) except in those areas mentioned below.
The Board
The Board of Directors currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, three other executive directors and five independent
non-executive directors. Brief biographical details of each director and a note of their Board committee memberships are set out in
the Board of Directors section. Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and the non-executive directors’ letters of
appointment are laid out in the Remuneration Report.
Premier is an international business which has to manage a variety of political, technical and commercial risks. It is therefore important
that the Board contains the appropriate mix of skills and experience to meet these challenges. Premier’ s Board has such a mix given the
diverse business backgrounds of the non-executive directors. They are encouraged to have direct contact with the company’ s senior
executives between Board meetings and also encouraged to visit the company’ s operations abroad in order to familiarise themselves
with its activities and to meet local management. The Board visited the company’ s operations in Norway in December 2008.
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects,
the overall group debt and equity structure and consideration of significant financing matters. The Board has continued to focus its
efforts in 2008 on strategic issues which will create shareholder value, monitoring performance against agreed objectives and
discussing future business opportunities.
Matters Reserved for Board Decision are laid down in writing, including the appointment of the Company Secretary who is
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and rules are applied. A copy of the Matters Reserved for Board Decision can be
found on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). Formal procedures are in place to enable individual Board members to take
independent advice where appropriate.
The formal agenda for each Board meeting is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive and the Company
Secretary. Formal Board and Board committee minutes are circulated to all directors at the next Board meeting. Board members
receive a monthly report of the company’s activities which incorporates an update on the annual budget and progress against major
objectives. In accordance with the authority given under the company’s Articles of Association, the company has established a
standing committee of the Board, consisting of any two directors, to carry out routine business. The minutes of all meetings of this
committee are circulated to the Board.
In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association, the Board is allowed to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts of
directors, where appropriate. Formal procedures are in place to ensure the Board’s powers of authorisation of conflicts are operated
effectively and the procedures are followed. The Board determined that during 2008 these procedures were enforced and adhered
to accordingly.
The Chairman
The Chairman’s role is part-time and he is a non-executive director. His key responsibility is the leadership of the Board, ensuring its
effectiveness on all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. Between Board meetings the Chairman is responsible for ensuring the
integrity and effectiveness of the Board/Executive relationship. This requires regular contact with the Chief Executive between Board
meetings, as well as contact with other Board members, shareholders, joint venture partners and host governments. In 2008, the
Chairman visited several of the company’s overseas operations to meet senior industry and government representatives. The
Chairman and the non-executive directors meet periodically without the executive directors present and the non-executive directors
meet once a year without the Chairman.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and their responsibilities are clearly established, set out in writing and agreed
by the Board.
Senior independent director
Mr J R W Orange, who is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, is the company’s senior independent non-executive director.
In this role, he is available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be resolved through discussion with the Chairman or
Chief Executive.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 23
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance and resources, including key
appointments and standards of conduct. Non-executive directors comprise over one half of the Board. Selection of suitable non-
executive directors is a matter for Board approval following recommendations made by the Nomination Committee.
We require that our non-executive directors are free from any relationship or circumstances that could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. The Board has determined that each of the non-executive directors, with the exception
of the Chairman, is independent.
At the time of his original appointment, on 1 March 1998, the Chairman was also considered independent by the Board. However,
in accordance with the Combined Code, the ongoing test of independence for the Chairman is not appropriate. Sir David John
completed 11 years of service in March 2009, and in accordance with Code provisions, he will be considered for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Mr J R W Orange was appointed to the Board in 1997. Whilst his service exceeds the term referred to in the Code, the Board
considers that his experience and long-term perspective of Premier’s business continues to provide a most valuable contribution and
that it benefits from his input to the Board’s deliberations.
The Board is strongly of the view that the important qualities when considering the issue of independence of non-executive directors
are independence of spirit and objectivity of mind, and therefore regards Mr J R W Orange as an independent director. In
accordance with Code provisions, he will be considered for re-election at the AGM.
Induction, training and development
New directors to the company receive a full induction to the company. This consists of a ‘bible’ of information covering such items as
the most recent minutes, terms of reference of Board committees and Matters Reserved for Board Decision, as well as meetings with
the Board, Chief Executive and other executive directors.
The company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place, and details of the policy are given to new directors on appointment.
Re-election of directors
In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association one third of directors retire each year, with their reappointment being
subject to the approval of shareholders. This requires directors to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years. In
addition, any non-executive director having held office for more than nine years will be subject to re-election on an annual basis.
Board performance evaluation
The Board and its directors are subject to regular appraisal. The aim is to improve both individual contributions and group achievement.
The Board carried out a questionnaire-based evaluation process in 2008. While it is not a fixed policy, the current view of the Board
is that alternation between internal and external reviews has significant merits, not least in keeping the exercise fresh amongst
Board members.
The evaluation covered the performance of the Board, its principal committees, the individual non-executive directors and the
Chairman. The results of the evaluation were reviewed by the Chairman and discussed in detail by the Board. The directors have
concluded that, following this evaluation, the Board and its committees operate effectively and also consider that each director is
contributing effectively and demonstrates commitment to the role.
Board committees
The Board has established an Audit and Risk Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee, each of which
has formal terms of reference approved by the Board. The terms of reference for each committee can be found on the company’s
website (www.premier-oil.com). The Company Secretary provides advice and support to the Board and all Board committees. Board
committees are authorised to engage the services of external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the
company’s expense. The Remuneration Report provides details on the role and activities of the Remuneration Committee. An Audit
and Risk Committee Report and a Nomination Committee Report are also provided in this Annual Report.

* By invitation.
Executive Committee
The Board has delegated the day-to-day running of the group to the Chief Executive who has established an Executive Committee
to assist him in this role. The Committee is made up of each of the executive directors and the Company Secretary. The Executive
Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive.
The responsibilities of the Executive Committee include the development of group strategy for approval by the Board, portfolio
management and the monitoring of performance against the targets set by the Board. At its weekly meetings it also reviews health,
safety, environmental and security performance and operational business performance reports. The Executive Committee is also
responsible for reviewing the information provided to the Board.
Three regional business units – North Sea and West Africa; Middle East-Pakistan and Asia – manage the geographical spread of
business in the group. Each business unit is headed by a regional business manager who delivers against specific strategies and
performance targets set by the Executive Committee.
Internal control
The directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining the group’s system of internal control. The internal control system is
regularly reviewed by the Board. Internal control systems in any group are designed to meet the particular needs of that group and
the risks to which it is exposed, and by their nature can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are
described below. These procedures have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report
and Financial Statements.
Management of business risks – This is an ongoing process, in accordance with the Turnbull guidance, and has been established for
identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the group. This is based on each business unit and corporate function producing
a risk matrix which identifies the key business risks – strategic, operational, financial and external – the probability of those risks
occurring, their impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage those risks to the desired level. Risk acceptance and
reduction objectives are defined with particular attention given to safety and environmental factors, and applied to ensure that the
risks are at a level that is as low as reasonably practicable.
The directors receive assurance directly from the business units and functional management through the completion of annual
declarations confirming compliance with the group’s policies, procedures and risk management processes. These processes are
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 25
Internal control (continued)
The company has adopted a framework model for application across the group and an annual report is produced in compliance with
that model and with the group risk management process. The report is presented to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Monitoring – A business management system (BMS) is in force which regulates a wide range of day-to-day activities both in the UK
and overseas offices, including environmental controls, health and safety regulations and political risks. Part of this BMS is a
documented review and assurance activity, which deals with the risk review and audit processes. The purpose of the audit process is
to ensure that the policies and procedures within the BMS are being adhered to. The purpose of the risk review process is to identify
the significant risks to the business, rate them consistently, and ensure we have mitigating measures in place to manage them. The
Group Health, Safety, Environment and Security Manager is accountable for the overall running of the process with the Group
Financial Controller specifically responsible for the financial aspects.
The effective operation of internal control procedures is reviewed during visits to the overseas offices by head office staff. Audits
of joint venture operations are carried out by joint venture partners on a regular basis.
A process of business control reviews has been developed and implemented across the group. This process is designed, inter alia,
to provide assurance to the Board that the company is embedding effective risk management into its operations. The report of each
review is presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. A rolling three-year plan to cover all business units has been put in place.
During 2008 a number of financial control reviews were carried out:
Vietnam: Finance and procurement control gap analysis
Pakistan: Policy and procedures review
Indonesia: Procurement practices review
All recommended actions following these reviews are being implemented.
In addition, a number of operational reviews took place in 2008:
Vietnam: Chim Sáo project safety
Indonesia: Gajah Baru project safety
Anoa production competency assurance
Anoa production safety case
Congo: Frida well environmental impact assessment
These operational reviews all produced satisfactory results.
During 2008, the key business risks and internal control weaknesses identified were formally discussed by the Executive Committee
and the Board on a periodic basis. This process will continue during 2009.
The Board will receive regular reports on any major problems that have occurred and how the risks have changed over the period
under review.
Management structure – The Board has overall responsibility for the group and there is a formal schedule of matters specifically
reserved for decision by the Board. Each executive director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of the group’s affairs.
The executive directors together with the Company Secretary constitute the Executive Committee which normally meets weekly.
Corporate accounting – Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the group as part of corporate accounting and an
authorisation manual which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures.
This manual was updated during the year to reflect the group’s focus on development projects in the medium-term.
Quality and integrity of personnel – The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and
subsequent training.
Budgetary process – There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the Board, covering capital
expenditure, cash flow, the income statement and balance sheet. Monthly results are reported against budget, and revised forecasts
for the year are prepared regularly. Separate approval processes and limits are in place for unbudgeted expenditure items.
Investment appraisal – The group has clearly defined procedures for capital expenditure. These include authority levels, commitment
records and reporting, annual budget and detailed appraisal and review procedures. The authority of the directors is required for key
treasury matters including changes to equity and loan financing, interest rate and foreign currency policy including foreign currency
hedging, oil price hedging, cheque signatories and opening of bank accounts. Comprehensive due diligence work is carried out
if a business or an asset is to be acquired.
During 2008, the Board reviewed the group’s system of internal control and is satisfied that all the controls in place are appropriate
to provide reasonable assurance against any material misstatement or loss. The review is conducted on a regular basis and changes
are made to internal control systems to address any new risks or exposures arising as a result of changes to the business or the
business environment.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED) //
Going concern
After making enquiries and in light of the group’s available loan facilities, the group budget for 2009 and the medium-term plans
(including those described in note 26 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements), the directors have reasonable
expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. The going concern basis for
the financial statements has therefore continued to be adopted. Further details are set out in the Financial Review.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given significant attention. Extensive information about the group’s activities is provided in the
Annual Report and Financial Statements and in the Interim Report which are made available to shareholders. The company has also
produced a summary review document in each of the last six years highlighting Premier’s capabilities and operations. These
documents are available to all shareholders. The company’s website (www.premier-oil.com) also provides detailed information
on the group’s activities.
In accordance with Companies Act 2006 provisions and the company’s Articles of Association, the company uses its website as its
default method of publication for statutory documents. The company operates a process of deemed consent; shareholders are given
28 days to indicate whether they wish to continue receiving hard copies of all statutory documents by post, before being deemed as
consenting to web-based communications. Consenting shareholders are sent notification in the post each time the company places
a statutory document on its website.
The last ‘deemed consent’ process took place in 2007. All new shareholders will receive hard copies of statutory documents until the
next process is undertaken.
Shareholders are reminded that they have the right to request – at any time – all future communications to be sent by post, or to
request a hard copy of a particular document which has been published on the company’s website.
The company believes that the reduction in the number of unwanted communications printed and sent by post, following this
‘deemed consent’ process, not only results in cost savings to the company, but also reduces the impact that the unnecessary printing
and distribution of reports has on the environment.
The company continues to promote the Premier Oil plc Share Portal, at www.premier-oil-shares.com. By registering on the website,
shareholders are able to access their shareholding online, at their convenience, and have the ability to update their shareholding
account (e.g. change their address) and submit queries on their account directly to the company’s Registrars. Shareholders will also
have the ability to vote online prior to the 2009 AGM. The Share Portal also encourages shareholders to register to receive
communications by e-mail, rather than by post, thus further reducing the number of documents printed and distributed. Shareholders
who have registered for this service will receive an e-mail notifying them when the company has added a statutory document to its
website, ensuring the prompt and efficient delivery of information. For each new registration processed, the company will donate
£1 to PURE the Clean Planet Trust, a UK charity dedicated to combating climate change.
The company has posted on its website, guidelines advising shareholders of how to deal with potential Boiler Room scams, where
shareholders may have received unsolicited phone calls concerning investment matters, often where callers have stated they work for
a subsidiary of, or on behalf of, the company. Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at
discount, or offers of free analysis reports, as the company does not retain the services of any such business for these purposes.
There is regular dialogue with institutional investors, and the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, who are the directors
responsible for dealing with shareholders, ensure that other members of the Board receive full reports of shareholder meetings.
Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and the business of the group are welcomed and are dealt with
in a timely manner. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM to discuss the progress of the group.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT //
The Audit and Risk Committee, comprising only non-executive directors, normally meets at least three times a year for a detailed
review of the group’s accounts and its internal controls. The members of the Audit and Risk Committee are Messrs D C Lindsell
(Chairman), J Darby, J R W Orange and M Romieu. Messrs S J Dobbie and R V Emerson retired from the Committee on 6 June 2008.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The Board considers Mr D C Lindsell and the other members of the
Committee to have the relevant commercial, financial and accounting experience to assess effectively the complex financial
reporting, risk and internal control issues relevant to the company. Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings normally
attend, by invitation, all meetings of the Committee.
The Committee is authorised to engage the services of external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties
at the company’s expense. No external advisers materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Minutes of the meetings of the Committee are distributed to all Board members, all of whom are invited to attend meetings of the
Committee (as observers) since the Board believes that the work of the Committee, particularly in the areas of risk management and
internal control, is increasingly important for all Board members. The Committee is satisfied that it receives sufficient, reliable and
timely information from management in order to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities.
The Audit and Risk Committee is mainly responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the company and formal announcements relating to the company’s financial
performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
• reviewing the company’s internal financial and operational control and risk management systems; full details of which are given
in the Corporate Governance Report;
• reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial statements to ensure clarity and completeness;
• overseeing the company’s relationship with its external auditors, including making recommendations as to the appointment or
reappointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement and monitoring their independence; and
• reviewing the company’s whistleblowing procedures and ensuring these are adequately published within the organisation, that
the Committee Chairman is promptly informed of any issues, and that there are arrangements in place for the investigation of any
alleged improprieties.
The Committee met twice in 2008 and has four meetings scheduled for 2009. The March meeting reviewed the full-year results and
the annual corporate governance report for the previous calendar year, and the August meeting reviewed the results for the six-
month period ending on 30 June. The issues which would normally have been covered in the January meeting had been dealt with
in an ad hoc meeting in December 2007.
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were discharged as follows:
• the Committee reviewed the risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing the group and how these risks were
being managed. It also reviewed the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls and disclosures made in the Annual Report and
Financial Statements;
• the Committee reviewed the papers prepared by the external auditor for the 2007 year-end process, the 2008 interim review and
the audit plans and strategy for the 2008 final audit. The fee proposals for the final audit and interim review were also reviewed
and agreed;
• the Committee met with the Finance Director and external auditors as part of the interim and final financial statements approval
process. The Committee considered assumptions about the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty, as well as the most
appropriate treatment and disclosure of any new or judgemental matters that may have a significant effect on amounts in the
financial statements; and
• the performance and effectiveness of the Committee was reviewed as part of the Board performance evaluation process. The
Committee was considered to be operating effectively and in accordance with the Smith Committee guidance within the Combined
Code. The Committee also reviewed and updated its terms of reference.
Internal audit
The Audit and Risk Committee also carried out its annual review into whether it is appropriate for the company to establish an
internal audit function. The Committee places great emphasis on the importance of imbuing a culture of risk management and
control at all operating levels in the business and is confident that this culture is in place. The Committee took account of the fact
that the company obtains independent confirmation of its internal controls from a variety of sources; these include joint venture and
government audits and the use of specific reviews using third-party specialists. The Committee also took account of the business
controls reviews and risk management process, more fully described in the Corporate Governance Report. The Committee
concluded that at this time there was no need for a dedicated internal audit resource but this will be kept under review.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT (CONTINUED) //
External auditor
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed external auditor of the company in 2004. The Audit and Risk Committee monitor the external
auditors’ performance on an ongoing basis, including an assessment following the year-end results carried out by the Finance
Director and other key members of the finance team.
The Audit and Risk Committee regularly reviews the issue of the independence of our external auditors, in light of the fact that they
provide tax advice to the group. In all services tendered, the group aims to select the provider who is best placed to deliver the
service in terms of quality and cost. The Committee does not believe that the provision of tax advice to the group by the external
auditor creates a threat to the independence of the audit process. This is principally because neither the nature, nor the scale of the
non-audit service could, or could be seen to, impair the objectivity of the external auditors’ opinion on the financial statements.
Deloitte are required to confirm to the Committee that they have both the appropriate independence and objectivity to allow them
to continue to serve the members of the company. The Committee also requires the external auditor to confirm that in providing
non-audit services, it complies with Ethical Standards of the UK Auditing Practices Board. This confirmation was received for 2008.
The company will pay US$0.7 million to Deloitte for audit services in 2008 (2007: US$0.6 million), relating to the statutory audit of the
company financial statements and the audit of group subsidiaries and associates pursuant to legislation.
The fees for the provision of other services to the company and its subsidiaries, which include advice on tax planning and accounting
and regulatory matters were US$1.1 million (2007: US$1.1 million), giving a total fee to Deloitte of US$1.8 million (2007: US$1.7 million).
Further details are provided in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

COMPANY RISK FACTORS //
Risk factors
Premier is an international business which has to face a variety of strategic, operational, financial and external risks.
Premier’s business, financial standing, results and reputation may be impacted by various risks. Not all of these risks are within the
company’s control and the company may be affected by risks other than those listed below.
Clear responsibility
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects,
corporate costs and significant financing matters and the management of risks. The Board recognises that risk is inherent across
Premier’s operations, and all activities are subject to an appropriate review to ensure that risks are identified, monitored and if
possible, managed.
Risk management process
Premier has an established business management system which includes an integrated risk management process for identifying,
evaluating and managing risks faced by the group. This is based on each business unit and corporate function producing a risk matrix
which identifies the key business risks – strategic, operational, financial and external – the probability of those risks occurring, their
impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage those risks to the desired level. Risk acceptance and reduction
objectives are defined with particular attention given to reducing them to as low as reasonably practicable. These risk matrices are
updated on a regular basis and made available to the Executive Committee.
Key risks facing Premier, their potential impacts and our responses are outlined below. Effective risk management is critical to
achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and reputation. Premier manages its risks by maintaining
a balanced portfolio, through compliance with the terms of its agreements and application of appropriate policies and procedures
and through the recruitment and retention of skilled individuals throughout the organisation.
Key business risks
Reserve replacement
Future oil and gas production will depend on our access to new reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and
other owners of reserves, and acquisitions. Failures in exploration or in identifying and finalising transactions to access potential
reserves could slow our oil and gas production and replacement of reserves. Premier manages these risks by proactive project
planning and milestone driven performance criteria. For exploration, effective peer reviews and thorough diligence on new areas
allow us to mitigate risk of failure.
Competition
Premier operates in a very challenging business environment and faces competition on access to exploration acreage, gas markets,
oil services and rigs, technology and processes and human resources.
Production
The delivery of Premier’s production depends on the successful development of its key projects. In developing these projects we
face numerous challenges. These include uncertain geology, availability of technology and engineering capacity, availability of skilled
resources, maintaining project schedules and managing costs, as well as technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions.
Such potential obstacles may impair our delivery of these projects and, in turn, our operational performance and financial position
(including the financial impact from failure to fulfil contractual commitments related to project delivery).
Health, safety, environment and security (HSES)
Given the range of Premier’s operated and joint venture production operations globally, our HSES risks cover a wide spectrum. These
risks include major process safety incidents; failure to comply with approved policies; effects of natural disasters and pandemics;
social unrest; civil war and terrorism; exposure to general operational hazards; personal health and safety; and crime. The consequences
of such risks materialising can be injuries, loss of life, environmental harm and disruption to business activities. Depending on their
cause and severity, they can affect Premier’s reputation, operational performance and financial position. Premier has an effective and
comprehensive HSES management system to mitigate this risk and support safe and secure execution of all critical operating activities.
Reputation
Premier strives to be a good corporate citizen globally and has strong and positive relationships with the governments and
communities in the countries where we do business. This is important for maintaining our licence to operate and our ability to secure
new resources. Our business principles govern how Premier conducts its affairs. Failure – real or perceived – to follow these principles,
or any of the risk factors materialising, could harm our reputation, which could impact our licence to operate, financing and access to
new opportunities.
Human resources
Premier’s key human resources are essential for the successful delivery of its projects and continuing operations. Loss of personnel to
competitors or our inability to attract quality human resources could affect our operational performance and growth strategy. Premier
has created salary, bonus and long-term incentive plan processes designed to incentivise loyalty and good performance.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
GOVERNANCE 30
COMPANY RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) //
Commodity prices
Oil and gas prices are affected by global supply of and demand for these commodities. Factors that influence these include
operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability or conflicts and economic conditions or actions by major oil-
exporting countries. Price fluctuations can affect our business assumptions and can impact investment decisions and financial
position. Premier manages this risk with an oil and gas hedging programme to underpin our financial strength and capacity to
fund our future development and operations.
Financial discipline
Premier has established financial policies and processes to ensure that it is able to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and
financial capacity and to manage the level of assessed risk associated with the financial instruments. A financial control framework
and a detailed delegation of authority manual are also in place to reasonably protect against risk of financial fraud in the group.
All major investment decisions taken consider an appropriate financial benchmark to secure against downside risk of such
investments. The group also undertakes an insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with
exploration and production activities. In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from
producing fields. Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits, AAA managed liquidity funds and A1/P1 commercial paper
subject to Board approved limits.
Further information on financial instruments and financial risk factors can be found in note 17 in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
Host government – political and fiscal risks
Premier operates in some countries where political, economic and social transition is taking place. Developments in politics, laws and
regulations can affect our operations and earnings. Potential developments include forced divestment of assets; limits on production;
import and export restrictions; international conflicts, including war; civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe
operation of company facilities; price controls, tax increases and other retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation
of contract rights; and environmental regulations. It is difficult to predict the timing or severity of these occurrences or their potential
effect. If such risks materialise they could affect the employees, reputation, operational performance and financial position of the group.
Joint ventures and partners
Inherently, oil and gas operations globally are conducted in a joint venture environment. Many of our major projects are operated by
our partners. Our ability to influence our partners is sometimes limited, due to our small shares in major non-operated development
and production operations. Non-alignment on various strategic decisions in joint ventures may result in operational or production
inefficiencies or delay. Premier mitigates this risk by continuous and regular engagement of its partners in operated and non-
operated projects.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT //
The Nomination Committee meets as and when required and comprises Sir David John (Chairman), Messrs J Darby, S C Lockett,
J R W Orange and Professor D G Roberts. The Board considers the membership of the Nomination Committee to be in compliance
with the Combined Code.
The Committee met once in 2008. Formal meetings are held to consider standing items of business; there is also a significant level
of ad hoc discussion between members of the Committee, particularly when a recruitment exercise is taking place.
The role of the Nomination Committee includes:
• reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and to make recommendations to the Board with regard to any
adjustments that are deemed necessary. This requires an ongoing assessment of the appropriate skills-mix required at Board level
in light of the strategy of the company in the medium-term;
• responsibility for identifying and nominating candidates, subject to Board approval, to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise
and to prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment; and
• the assessment of time required to fulfil the role of Chairman, senior independent director and non-executive director, ensuring
that current members of the Board have devoted sufficient time to their duties and that any candidates have sufficient time to
undertake the roles.
The Nomination Committee, together with the Board, addresses the company’s succession plans. The Board also considers
succession planning for senior corporate executives, with the Nomination Committee focusing more specifically on succession
planning for members of the Board. The appointment of Messrs D C Lindsell and M Romieu to the Board in January 2008 helped
to maintain the balance of the Board ahead of the retirement of Messrs S J Dobbie and R V Emerson in June.

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The company’s 7th AGM will be held on Friday 29 May 2009 at 11.00am. The Notice of the Meeting accompanies this report.
Share capital
The company’s authorised share capital is £157,612,282 comprising 315,224,564 Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each (representing 100
per cent of the total authorised share capital). The rights attached to the company’s authorised share capital can be found in note 19
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. No person has any special rights of control over the company’s share capital
and all issued shares are fully paid.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general
provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of
the company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
The authority given to the directors to allot shares at the 2008 AGM was granted for a period of one year. There were 66,411 Ordinary
Shares issued under the group’s share option schemes during the year. A resolution will be put to the forthcoming AGM to renew
this authority.
At the 2008 AGM, authority was also given to the directors for one year to allot shares for cash either in connection with a rights issue,
or of up to 5 per cent of the then issued share capital as if statutory pre-emption rights did not apply. A similar resolution will be put
to the impending AGM to renew this authority.
At the end of the year 233,054,104 shares in the authorised Ordinary Share capital of the company were unissued.
The AGM held in 2008 authorised the purchase by the company of up to 12,317,770 shares and the balance of this authority will
remain available until the forthcoming AGM, when the granting of a similar authority will be proposed. During 2008, the company
purchased 2,798,186 Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of £1,399,093.00, and representing 3.4 per cent of the company’s issued
share capital, for a consideration, excluding commission, of £25,308,632.40 (US$46,746,056.52). The shares were held by the company

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS (CONTINUED) //
Subsequent events
Post balance sheet events are disclosed in note 26 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Donations
During the year the company made charitable contributions amounting to US$41,578 (2007: US$66,688). No political contributions
were made during the year (2007: US$nil).
Significant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the company such as commercial
contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the group as a whole.
Furthermore, the directors are not aware of any agreements between the company and its directors or employees that provide for
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Going concern
After making enquiries and in light of the group’s available loan facilities, the group budget for 2009 and the medium-term plans
(including those described in note 26 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements), the directors have reasonable
expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. The going concern basis for
the financial statements has therefore continued to be adopted. Further details are set out in the Financial Review.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

REMUNERATION REPORT //
Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. As required, this report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for an advisory vote.
The sections within this report that have been audited by Deloitte LLP are indicated.
Throughout 2008 the company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) regarding
best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) normally meets at least four times a year and determines the remuneration of the executive
directors and senior employees. The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors and comprises Mr J R W Orange,
who chairs the Committee and is the company’ s senior non-executive independent director, Messrs J Darby, D C Lindsell and Professor
D G Roberts. Messrs S J Dobbie and R V Emerson retired from the Committee on 6 June 2008. The Board considers that the membership
of the Committee is in compliance with the Code recommendation, on the basis that it considers Mr J R W Orange to be independent,
notwithstanding his length of service. Sir David John, the company’ s Chairman, is not a member of the Committee, but attends by
invitation. Mr S C Lockett is not a member of the Committee but usually attends meetings by invitation, except when his own remuneration
is being discussed, as the company considers it important that the Chief Executive is fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration
policy and the remuneration packages of its most senior employees.
No director of the company is involved in determining his own remuneration. The determination of the remuneration of the non-
executive directors is a matter reserved for Board decision.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the Code in
implementing its remuneration policy. The terms of reference are published on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com).
The role of the Committee includes:
• considering and determining the remuneration policy for executive directors;
• within this agreed policy, considering and determining the total compensation package of each executive director of the company;
• considering and advising on the general principles under which remuneration is applied to employees of the company;
• determining the awards to be made under the company’s long-term incentive schemes; and
• determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments to directors.
As in previous years, the principal focus of the Committee in 2008 has been to ensure that the remuneration packages of the senior
executives are set at levels which are sufficient to retain and attract high-quality individuals in what remains a competitive market.
The Committee takes independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is
appointed as an advisor to the Committee. Hewitt New Bridge Street do not provide any other services to the company. No other
person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration policy
The company’s remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are
fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions. The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive
to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the group’s objectives and thereby enhance shareholder
value. The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to executive directors and senior managers of comparable
public companies, as well as pay and conditions throughout the remainder of the group.
The main components of executive directors’ remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance-related cash and share bonus
scheme with a deferred element, benefits, long-term incentives and pension provision. Each element is discussed in detail below.
The remuneration therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance-related remuneration, which links both the short-term
financial performance of the group and the long-term shareholder return with the executive’s total remuneration. The remuneration
package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance-related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committee’s current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2009 and subsequent years although
the Committee will keep the matter under review. The Committee’s current intention with regard to share options is that they will
continue to be awarded only in special circumstances. Shareholders approved the adoption of the Asset and Equity Plan (AEP) at
the AGM in 2004 (together with a matching shares element approved at the AGM in 2006) and awards have continued to be granted
thereunder. However, the AEP expires in May 2009 and so a new Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), based in part on the AEP , will be
proposed at the forthcoming AGM and, subject to shareholder approval being received, future long-term incentive awards will be
granted under that plan. Summary details of the LTIP are set out in the Asset and Equity Plan (Audited) section of this report and full
details of its principal terms are contained in the Notice of AGM, accompanying this document.
The company’s Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the
Board within the limits set by the shareholders.

REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) //
Performance chart
The chart below shows the company’s total shareholder return (TSR), defined as the increase in the value of a share, including
re-invested dividends, over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the FTSE All Share
Oil & Gas Producers Index, which the Committee considers to be the most relevant equity market index.
Total shareholder return
Contracts of service
Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service
contracts and are subject to re-election by shareholders under the company’s Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months’ notice in writing by either side, in accordance with
current market practice. In such event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one year’s
remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme entitlement, benefits in kind and pension rights
during the notice period. There are provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances. If such circumstances
were to arise, the executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in
respect of the termination. There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation
in the event of early termination. The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing
executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis. Messrs S C Lockett and R A Allan have service contracts
dated 9 December 2003. Mr A R C Durrant has a service contract dated 1 July 2005 and Mr N Hawkings’ service contract is dated
23 March 2006.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective for a period of three years (subject to reappointment
by the members in General Meeting), all of which have a notice period of three months. Sir David John and Mr J R W Orange have
letters of appointment issued on 28 July 2006. Professor D G Roberts has a letter of appointment dated 30 June 2006 and Mr J Darby
has a letter of appointment dated 1 September 2007. Messrs D C Lindsell and M Romieu have letters of appointment dated 17 January
2008 following their appointment to the Board on that date.
External appointments
Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Board’s approval is
sought. Mr A R C Durrant currently holds one external non-executive directorship with Clipper Windpower plc and is entitled to retain
the fees earned connected therewith (2008: US$76,300 and 2007: US$43,500).
Remuneration structure
The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, bonus, benefits, entitlement to participate in the
company’s long-term incentive schemes (and all-employee share schemes) and pension.
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil and gas sector and general market data on the basis
of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size. The objective is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with
the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package. The policy of the Committee has
been to position base salaries between the median and upper quartile.

R A Allan 300,000 5.3
A R C Durrant 320,000 10.3
N Hawkings 300,000 15.4
For all the executive directors, these increases, which in some cases are somewhat larger than normal, were determined after
considering a range of factors such as company performance, the development of the executive and the positioning of his salary
in relative terms. In addition, account was taken of the recommendations of Hewitt New Bridge Street that these levels represent
salaries between the median and upper quartile for executives in similar roles, in companies of similar size in the oil and gas sector
and in general industry companies (excluding financial services) also of a similar size.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual,
the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
Annual bonus scheme
The total annual bonus potential, which is non-pensionable, is 100 per cent of base salary. Half of any bonus earned is payable
immediately in cash and the remaining half is payable in shares and deferred for three years. The deferred element of the bonus
is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not
dependent on any further performance-related measures.
Performance measures for 2008 are explained in the table below:
Maximum bonus
Performance measures potential Conditions
Exploration, portfolio management 70% Various milestones identified for the year, to achieve the medium-term

Production 10% To achieve the production number contained in the 2008 budget
approved by the Board.
Operating cost per barrel 10% To achieve the operating cost per barrel number contained in the 2008
budget approved by the Board.
Health, safety, environment and security 10% Combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted work day
cases of or below 1.7 cases per million man-hours worked.
Following a review of the 2008 targets, the Committee agreed that the production and operating cost per barrel targets and the
health, safety, environment and security target had been achieved. The Committee agreed a 25 per cent award out of the maximum
70 per cent in relation to the exploration, portfolio management and strategic development targets. This resulted in a total award of
55 per cent of salary (27.5 per cent paid as cash and 27.5 per cent deferred in shares as indicated above) for performance against the
above targets (2007: 65 per cent of salary, paid as 32.5 per cent cash and 32.5 per cent deferred shares).
The annual bonus scheme for the 2009 financial year has a similar structure and the same maximum award level. The performance
metrics have been changed to include, amongst other things, specific targets relating to funding and management of the exploration
portfolio. This reflects the current difficult market conditions and the priorities of the business. Performance measures for 2009 are
explained in the table below:
Maximum bonus
Performance measures potential Conditions
Finance and organisation 30% To ensure funding is in place to facilitate the investment programme.
To manage hedging and commitments to meet funding covenants
at conservative oil prices.
Production and development 20% Various targets including progressing the major new field development
projects on time and on budget.
Exploration 20% Various targets including portfolio management and exploration success.
New business 20% The delivery of various strategic investment/divestment opportunities.
Health, safety, environment and security 10% Combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted work day
cases of or below 1.55 cases per million man-hours worked.

REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) //
Benefits
Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings each received the benefit of a car allowance and medical insurance.
Mr R A Allan also received a gym membership subsidy.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The company currently operates the AEP , two Executive Share Option Schemes and an all-employee Share Incentive Plan and Save
As You Earn Scheme. Details of the Executive Share Option Schemes and the all-employee share plans are set out in the Share option
schemes (Audited) section of this report.
The AEP is currently the company’s main long-term incentive arrangement, and details of the awards granted to executive directors
under this plan are set out in the Asset and Equity Plan (Audited) section of this report. The life of the AEP will expire in May 2009.
Accordingly, it is proposed that a replacement, the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) be introduced to replace it. Subject to
shareholder approval for the LTIP being received, going forward the LTIP will have two primary elements. The first will be an equity
bonus pool created by reference to the increase in the equity value per share of the company over a three-year period. The second
will involve the grant of performance shares (with an anticipated value on grant of 150 per cent of salary in the case of the Chief
Executive and 125 per cent of salary in the case of all other executive directors) subject to a total shareholder return (TSR)
performance condition, measured relative to other oil companies.
As to vesting criteria, an equity bonus pool will not be created where the compound growth per annum in share price is below 10 per
cent. At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth will become the pool. At 20 per cent compound growth
per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth will become the pool. The size of the pool will increase on a straight-line basis between these
two points. Individuals’ rights to the proceeds from the pool are based on a pre-determined allocation. In the event that the value of an
individual entitlement exceeds 100 per cent of salary, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been long-term improvement in
the underlying financial performance of the company. Performance shares will not vest if the company’ s TSR performance is below the
median of a comparator group comprising approximately 35 companies. At the median they will vest as to 25 per cent and at upper
quartile or above as to 100 per cent with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis between those two points.
Half of any executive director’ s vested award will be received in shares and the other half in the form of an award of deferred shares
which will vest three years later (i.e. six years after the initial grant). Any such deferred shares shall also attract the grant of a Matching
Award over further shares with such Matching Award being subject to a TSR performance condition on the same terms as currently apply
to Matching Awards granted under the AEP (as described in more detail in the Asset and Equity Plan (Audited) section of this report).
These two elements have been chosen to ensure that there will be continued alignment between the interests of shareholders and
executives via share price performance as well as providing an important incentive to management to outperform the company’s
most relevant competitors via the TSR performance condition.

Pension schemes (Audited)
Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (the Scheme), subject to the earnings cap.
The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-
thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60. Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in
payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has decided to continue to operate its own cap on pensionable earnings beyond April 2006, when the external cap
was removed. For the year to 31 December 2008 this was set at £112,800 increasing to £117,600 for the year to 31 December 2009.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings with a pension substantially as if
they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors,
not subject to the earnings cap. The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to staff,
is made available at the directors’ option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary
supplement. As at the year-end, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and N Hawkings had elected the former and Mr A R C Durrant had
elected the latter.
Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings are members of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during 2008, the company
contributed £57,917 and £52,912 respectively; these amounts include £34,637 and £29,632 respectively in regard to the enhanced
pension contributions referred to above. Mr S C Lockett is a member of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during
2008, the company contributed £50,040 in regards to the enhanced pension contributions referred to above.

Notes:
– The amounts of accrued pension under (a) and (c) represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
– The transfer value under (d) has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note ‘GN11: Retirement Benefit Schemes –
Transfer Values’ issued by the Board for Actuarial Standards under the Financial Reporting Council. This guidance note was replaced by the Occupational
Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1050) with effect from 1 October 2008.
– The transfer values under (b) and (e) have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008
(SI 2008/1050).
– The amounts under (e) represent the increase in value of the directors’ benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year,
of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits (as revalued by price inflation) less contributions by the directors.
– The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision; in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally
established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements. Thus, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, who has elected not to receive
enhanced pension contributions, the company’s pension obligation will be met entirely by the payment of salary supplements.
– In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the
company between September 1986 and November 1999.
– Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions; none of the directors have elected to do so.
The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities:

Asset and Equity Plan (Audited)
The AEP is designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a
three-year period. The plan therefore has two bonus pools – an asset bonus pool and an equity bonus pool. The asset bonus pool is
created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus
pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity value per share of the company over a three-year period. In both cases, no
bonus pool is created where the compound growth per annum in the relevant measure (asset value or share price) is below 10 per
cent. At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth becomes the pool. At 20 per cent compound growth
per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool. The size of the pool increases on a straight-line basis between these two
points. In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement
in the performance of the company.
Under this plan awards have been made annually and will mature on the third anniversary of grant. They are not pensionable. The
AEP is a broadly-based plan with participation points being awarded to eligible employees, including executive directors, throughout
the group. New employees who join the company part of the way through the duration of a three-year award are awarded
participation points in that award on a time-apportioned basis. In addition, employees who receive a significant promotion during
an award period are eligible to receive an increased participation, also on a time-apportioned basis. The maximum benefit that an
individual may receive will normally be limited to twice his or her base salary per annum, except where the compound growth rate
exceeds 20 per cent per annum in either the asset or equity bonus pool, in which case the Committee may increase the limit on such
a proportionate basis as it determines to be fair and reasonable.
At the time of vesting, 50 per cent of an award is payable in cash and 50 per cent is payable in the form of an award of deferred shares.
Awards granted in 2007 and 2008 will, however, be payable entirely in shares, with 50 per cent payable in the form of deferred shares.
The Matching Award scheme is an amendment to the plan approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM which gives participants the
option to increase the six-month deferral of the share element of the scheme to three years. This extended deferral is mandatory
for the executive directors and senior management but voluntary for other staff. The shares deferred for the extended period will
participate in a Matching Award. The release of this part of the award will therefore be six years following the initial grant of the award
under the plan.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 41
Asset and Equity Plan (Audited) (continued)
Matching Awards are subject to performance criteria related to comparative TSR over a three-year period. The comparator group
consists of about thirty five listed companies in the oil and gas sector. TSR will be measured as the percentage increase in a return
index of the comparator group between the beginning and end of the performance period, which begins on the first day of the
financial year in which the Matching Award is granted. The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average
of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period. In order to ascertain the
return index at the end of the performance period, the same averaging method will be used for the three months prior to the end of
the performance period. If the company’s TSR is at the median against the comparator group, then Matching Awards vest on a 0.5:1
basis and where comparative performance is at or above the upper decile, Matching Awards vest on a 2.5:1 basis (with proportionate
vesting on a straight-line basis between these two points). Independent external advice will be taken to assess whether the company
has met the TSR performance condition and to confirm that the companies which made up the index and the measurement of the
company’s performance are both in accordance with the rules of the AEP .

Outstanding Asset and Equity Plan awards
As at 31 December 2008, a total of 1,254.55 participation points have been allocated under the 2006 award. 1,171.25 participation
points were awarded in 2006 on the date of grant and 204.80 have been awarded since then, as time-apportioned compensatory
awards to employees (other than executive directors) who have joined the company during the three-year performance period.
121.50 participation points have been forfeited due to participants leaving the employment of the company. The directors have been
allocated the following points under the 2006 award:
Number of participation points
S C Lockett 62
R A Allan 45
A R C Durrant 45
N Hawkings 45
The equity bonus pool of the 2006 award was calculated by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share
price for the three months prior to the date of award (1 January 2006), with the market value similarly calculated to 31 December 2008.
The minimum vesting threshold for the equity bonus pool was not achieved, resulting in this part of the award lapsing.
An independent external valuation of the asset bonus pool of the 2006 award will take place following the publication of the year-end
results. If it is determined that the minimum vesting threshold has been achieved, 50 per cent of the awards will be released in cash
and 50 per cent will be in deferred shares.
As at 31 December 2008, a total of 6,015.70

participation points have been allocated under the 2007 award. 450.50 participation
points have been awarded since the date of grant, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees (other than executive
directors) who have joined the company during the three-year performance period and 343.0 participation points have been forfeited
due to participants leaving the employment of the company. The increase in aggregate participation points reflects the decision to
extend the award to all global employees. The directors have been allocated the following points under the 2007 award:

Share option schemes (Audited)
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995
Options granted under the 1995 scheme are normally exercisable, at the acquisition price, not less than three years after their date of
grant and will lapse (unless previously exercised) on their tenth anniversary. No payment is made for the grant of an option. Options
cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved. For options granted prior to 2000 the
performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive
three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the company’s earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per
annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
Mr S C Lockett held options under this scheme during the financial year. The options are listed in the table below:

Notes:
1. The mid-market closing price on the date of exercise (8 January 2008) was £13.74 resulting in a gain on exercise of £10.02 per share.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003
This scheme replaced the 1995 scheme on completion of the company’s Scheme of Arrangement in 2003. Options granted under the
scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse (unless previously exercised) on their
tenth anniversary. No payment is made for the grant of an option. Options cannot normally be exercised until pre-determined
performance conditions have been achieved. In the case of certain employees the performance condition is growth in earnings per
share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period. In other cases, including
grants made to Mr A R C Durrant under the scheme in 2005, the performance condition is based on the company’s TSR in
comparison with a group of eight companies as follows: Burren Energy, Cairn Energy, Dana Petroleum, Paladin Resources, Tullow Oil,
Venture Production, Soco International and JKX Oil & Gas, measured between 1 June 2005 and 31 May 2008. Options will vest as to
30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved, with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis up to 100 per cent
if upper quartile performance is achieved. TSR was selected as the performance measure for this plan as it aligns the interests of
directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR compared to competitor companies.
Directors’ interests under this scheme are shown below:

Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2003
Under this scheme, employees (including executive directors) with six months or more continuous service are invited, within a period
of 42 days of the announcement of the annual results, to join the scheme. Employees may save between £5 and £250 per month,
through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a market value set at the time
of invitation discounted by up to 20 per cent.
Directors’ interests under this scheme are shown below:

The mid-market closing price of the company’s shares at 31 December 2008 was £9.85 (31 December 2007: £13.10). The intra-day
trading price of the company’s shares during 2008 was between £5.69 and £18.50.
Share Incentive Plan (Audited)
Under this plan, employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the company (Partnership
Shares). If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought
with an award of shares (Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis. Should an employee leave the SIP scheme before the end of the
three-year holding period they will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he/she leaves due to injury, redundancy, TUPE
transfer, retirement, death or the sale of the company.
In the case of the award of Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the
plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company invites all company employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis. During 2008,
Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings contributed the maximum monthly amount of £125 to the plan.
Shares held beneficially in this plan by the directors during the financial year were as follows:

Sourcing of shares and dilution limits
The company uses the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the obligations of the Executive Share Option Schemes,
the AEP and the directors’ deferred bonus shares. The Employee Benefit Trust currently holds sufficient shares to meet short-term
requirements, and future obligations will be met using a combination of market purchases, financed by the company, and newly-
issued shares. The number of shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust as at 31 December 2008 was 863,339 (31 December 2007:
205,152).
The rules of each of the company’s share-based incentive schemes contain limitations on the total number of options and awards
over new shares that can be awarded, in accordance with the Association of British Insurers’ guidelines.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES //
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Group financial statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required by the
International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation to prepare the group financial statements under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The group financial statements are also required by law to be properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
IAS 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the group’s financial position, financial performance
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group’s financial position and financial performance.
Parent company financial statements
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company financial statements
are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these financial statements, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU for the
group and UK GAAP for the company give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
group and company, respectively, and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2. the business review, which is incorporated into the Report of the Directors, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the group and company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES //
General information
Premier Oil plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered
office is Premier Oil plc, 4th Floor, Saltire Court, 20 Castle T errace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EN. The principal activities of the company and its
subsidiaries (the group) are oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea, Middle East-Pakistan, West Africa and Asia.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars since that is the currency in which the majority of the group’s transactions are
denominated.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are effective
for the current period. These are: IFRIC 11: IFRS 2 – ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’ and IFRIC 14: IAS 19 – ‘The Limit on a
Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’. The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to
any changes in the group’s accounting policies and has had no impact on the financial statements of the group.
At the date of approval of these financial statements the group has not applied the following Standards and Interpretations which are
in issue but not yet effective:
• Amendments to IFRS 1/IAS 27 – ‘Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate’
• Amendments to IFRS 2 – ‘Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations’
• Amendments to IFRS 3 – ‘Business Combinations’
• IFRS 8 – ‘Operating Segments’
• Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
• Amendments to IAS 23 – ‘Borrowing Costs’
• Amendments to IAS 27 – ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’
• Amendments to IAS 32/IAS 1 – ‘Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation’
• IFRIC 12: ‘Service Concession Arrangements’
• IFRIC 15: ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’
• IFRIC 16: ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’
• IFRIC 17: ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
financial statements of the group except for additional segment disclosures when IFRS 8 – ‘Operating Segments’ comes into effect
for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as endorsed
by the Council of the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of financial instruments and
certain oil and gas properties at the transition date to IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern assumption
is provided in the Report of the Directors.
The principle accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess/deficiency of the cost of acquisition over/below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill/negative goodwill. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the assets
and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with
those used by other members of the group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 47
Interest in associates
An associate is an entity in which the group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has significant influence, but not control,
through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Interests in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Any excess/deficiency of the cost of acquisition
over/below the group’s share of the net fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate at the
date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill/negative goodwill.
Where a group entity transacts with an associate of the group, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s
interest in the relevant associate.
Interest in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject
to joint control.
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the group’s share of jointly controlled
assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant company and
classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Income from the sale or use of the group’s share of the output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses,
are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to/from the group and their
amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred
to as jointly controlled entities. The group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation – the
group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are combined with the equivalent items in the
consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where the group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s
interest in the joint venture.
Sales revenue and other income
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Oil and gas assets
The company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs, having regard to the
requirements of IFRS 6 – ’Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’.
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised
in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred during the various
exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination
process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement as they
are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, costs of technical services and
studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the company’s vehicles, drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant
and equipment used by the company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the
extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is
recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable overhead, including the
depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of other materials consumed
during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
GOVERNANCE 48
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) //
Oil and gas assets (continued)
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets (continued)
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward, until the existence (or otherwise)
of commercial reserves has been determined subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets,
is then reclassified as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves have not been found, the
capitalised costs are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
(b) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing
the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding
commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy (a) above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and
decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method
by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future
development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(c) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit
applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single
cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation. Where conditions giving rise to
impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement,
net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
(d) Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the purchase method where the transaction meets the definition
of a business combination.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not qualify as a business
combination, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involved the transfer of the field
interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the
consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets
disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Petroleum products and under
and overlifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively.
Tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable
profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’ s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 49
Tax (continued)
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill/negative
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable
right to set off corporation tax assets against corporation tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax
authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the functional
currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets held at historic cost are translated at the date of
purchase and are not retranslated. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the
transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences
are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Group retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the group’s obligations under
the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at
each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised income and
expense. Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this
calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future
contributions to the plan.
Royalties
Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised
as income.
Leasing
Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
GOVERNANCE 50
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) //
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income
statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not
settled in the year in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair
value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as
financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value hedges are hedges of particular risks
that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the
amount or timing of future cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the
carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of
occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not
qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were
no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income
or expense.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous
carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are
reported in financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that
is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income. If the hedging
relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value
of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the
time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that
have been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any
change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity.
Any remaining ineffective portion is recorded in financial income or expense where the hedging instrument is a derivative and
in equity in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have
been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time of the disposal.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with
unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded derivatives which are closely related to host contracts,
including in particular price caps and floors within the group’s oil sales contracts, are not separated and are not carried at fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing
parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs
that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and
estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 51
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Cash equivalents comprise funds held in term deposit accounts with a maturity not exceeding three months.
Share-based payments
The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 – ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions,
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 19.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance
sheet date for cash-settled, share-based payments.
Convertible bonds
The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component
at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar
non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the
liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity and
is not re-measured. The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying
amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue,
for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest
paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of the group’s significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial statements
and include:
• carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets (note 8);
• carrying value of property, plant and equipment (note 9);
• proved and probable reserves estimates (note 9);
• decommissioning costs (note 16); and
• derivative financial instruments (note 17).

statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and
whether the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent
with the group financial statements. The information given in the Report of the Directors includes that specific information presented
in the Chief Executive’s and Financial Reviews that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial
statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements and the part of the Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group financial statements and the part
of the Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation;
• the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the group financial statements.

2008 2007
$ million $ million
Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 277.6 147.0
Group profit on ordinary activities before tax at 61.0% weighted average rate (2007: 77.6%) 169.3 114.1

Utilisation and recognition of tax losses not previously recognised (1.5) (1.6)
Adjustments in respect of previous periods 1.6 0.7
Tax expense for the year 179.3 108.0
Effective tax rate for the year 64.6% 73.5%
The weighted average rate is calculated based on the tax rates weighted according to the profit or loss before tax earned by the
group in each jurisdiction. The change in the weighted average rate year on year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each
jurisdiction. The effective tax rate for UK ring fence profits is 50 per cent.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries, associates and
joint ventures. The amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet in the absence
of suitable forecast profits is US$6.8 million in the UK (2007: US$12.7 million). This gives rise to a potential deferred tax asset of
US$1.9 million (2007: US$3.8 million).

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary
Shares in issue during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:

Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share
2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007
$ million $ million million million cents cents

Outstanding share options – – 0.8 1.2 * *
Diluted 98.3 39.0 82.2 83.2 119.6 46.9
* The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2008 and 2007 calculations produces a diluted earnings per share. The outstanding share options
number includes any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments. At 31 December 2008 8,003,434 (2007: 8,003,434) potential
Ordinary Shares in the company that are underlying the company’s convertible bonds and that may dilute earnings per share in the future have not been
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year to 31 December 2008.

The amounts for intangible E&E assets represent costs incurred on active exploration projects. These amounts are written off to
the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not
completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying
value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania. The impairment charge was calculated by reference to an
assessment of the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves measured
against the carrying value of the asset. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate. Estimates involved in
impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves, future oil and gas prices, costs and timing which are
inherently uncertain.
Amortisation and depreciation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas
production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves at the end of the period plus production in
the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions
including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those
of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field
cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.

The group’s principal bank facilities are US$275 million and £53 million (2007: US$275 million and £53 million). The original facility
was taken out on 13 September 2005 and amended in April 2007 and will continue until 31 July 2010. The facilities are unsecured
and bear a floating interest rate based on LIBOR.
Convertible bonds
In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company
at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014. At the initial conversion price of £15.82
per share there are 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds. If the bonds have not been previously
purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 June 2014. Interest of 2.875 per
cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity
component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest
rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value
assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was
included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.

Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 65
14 Borrowings (continued)
The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent
(2007: 6.73 per cent) to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued. The non-cash accrual of interest
will increase the liability component (as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent) to US$250 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and their fair
value. This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.

The company currently operates an Asset and Equity Plan to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the
business and the market value of the company over a three-year period. Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 19.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa and
Pakistan oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2032. These provisions have been created based on
Premier’s internal estimates and, where available, operator’s estimates. Based on the current economic environment,
assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future
liability. These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual
decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required,
which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on
when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which
are inherently uncertain.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) //
For the year ended 31 December 2008
17 Financial instruments
Hedging instruments
The group’s activities expose it to financial risks of changes, primarily in oil and gas prices but also foreign currency exchange
and interest rates. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures. The use of financial
derivatives is governed by the group’s policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the
use of financial derivatives.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures. Premier undertakes oil and gas price hedging
periodically within Board limits to protect operating cash flow against weak prices.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options. Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options. Indonesian gas
is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
Oil production
a) Production from 2009 to 2012 is now 60 per cent hedged. For the years 2009 and 2012 production is now hedged with
an average floor of US$39.3/bbl and a cap of US$100.0/bbl.
b) At the end of 2007 an off-take agreement was agreed in which the parameters of the above hedges were embedded. This
agreement is for four and a half years effective from 1 July 2008 and replaces the financially-settled hedges for that period.
c) A further option agreement which has the effect of closing out the floor and cap in the original financially-settled hedges
previously in place.
d) The value at 31 December 2008 of the option agreement is US$33.6 million (2007: US$37.9 million). This represents deferred
income which will be amortised over the life of the off-take agreement. For the year ended 31 December 2008 a total of
US$4.3 million was released to the income statement (2007: US$nil) in respect of this deferred income.
Indonesian gas production
Production from 2009 to mid-year 2013 is now 34 per cent hedged with a floor of US$250.0/mt and a cap of US$500.0/mt.
During the year gas hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$7.8 million (2007: US$42,300) and oil hedges matured
generating a cash cost of US$8.1 million (2007: US$nil). While all hedges were assessed to be effective, all movements in the fair
values have been recognised in the income statement, as all such movements relate to the time-value portion of hedges under
IAS 39.

The fair values, which have been determined from counterparties with whom the trades have been concluded, have been

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction, other than in a forced
or liquidated sale. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. The estimated fair values have been
determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Values recorded are as at the balance sheet
date, and will not necessarily be realised. Non-interest bearing financial instruments, which include amounts receivable from
customers, and accounts payable are recorded materially at fair value reflecting their short-term maturity and are not shown in
the above table.
Credit risk
The group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits. The amounts of receivables presented in
the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables which were immaterial in 2008 and 2007. The group does not
require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties. The credit risk on liquid funds and
derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by
international credit rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.

Currency risk
T o cover sterling exposures an amount of £105.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year (2007: £57.1 million).
Premier’s activities are largely conducted in US dollars. All borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the
currency of the assets.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk
management framework for the management of the group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management
requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and
future capital and operating commitments.

Share-based payments
Shares issued relate to the company’s share option plans. There has been no new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and
Equity Plan.
Share option plans
The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the company’s shares have been granted to
certain executives and employees. Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will
lapse on their tenth anniversary. Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the
scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years,
after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares. If an employee agrees
to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares
(Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £2.15. The options
outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of £4.69 and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 2.6 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The group recognised a cost of US$20.1 million and US$7.8 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions
in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan
The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market
value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools – an equity bonus pool and an
asset bonus pool. The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company
over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share
of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 29.0% to 31.5%
Risk free rate of interest: 4.1% to 4.9%
Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0%

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 72
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) //
For the year ended 31 December 2008
19 Share capital (continued)
For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the
final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$25.6 million
(2007: US$15.7 million) with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$16.3 million (2007: US$18.3 million). A credit of
US$20.1 million has been recorded in equity (2007: US$7.8 million) for all equity-settled payments for the group. Like other
elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent
by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to
capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as exploration expense, operating costs, pre-licence exploration
costs or general and administration costs.
Ordinary Shares
The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows:
Dividend rights
The rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital
On a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares) the rights of
the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution shall rank
pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights
The holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company.

Funded benefit schemes
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan
(the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997
and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the payment
of contributions to separately administered trust funds. As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service
costs of the Scheme under the IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’ valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The most recent formal
valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the
principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases:
3.4 per cent pa. The market value of the Scheme’s assets was £14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions
adopted, the assets covered 91 per cent of the members’ accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries. Until
October 2008, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with an
additional £28,000 paid per month. In October a new Schedule of Contributions was put in place. At this point the employer
paid a one-off lump sum contribution of £1.3 million and started to contribute at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries
with no additional monthly amounts. The employer expects to contribute £95,000 to the Scheme in 2009.

24 Group pension schemes (continued)
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’ by an independent actuary on the
basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2008 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2009.
The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method and the pension expense
has been assessed on the basis that the group adopts the policy of fully recognising actuarial gains and losses during the period
in which they arise.

Unfunded benefit schemes
In Indonesia the group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour Agreement with
the local workforce. This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases
and a reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2008 of the
future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.8 million (2007: US$1.1 million).
A total gain of US$0.3 million (2007: loss of US$0.1 million) was recognised directly in equity during the year.

Acquisition
The group has reached a conditional agreement on 25 March 2009 with Oilexco Incorporated, Oilexco North Sea Ltd (ONSL)
and its Administrators to acquire either:
(i) ONSL’s entire issued share capital; or
(ii) the principal operating assets of ONSL and Oilexco North Sea Exploration Ltd for a maximum consideration of
approximately US$505 million.
The group proposes to fund the acquisition and associated costs by way of:
• a 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares at a price of 485 pence per share to raise gross proceeds of approximately
£171 million;
• new credit facilities comprising a US$175 million 18-month acquisition bridge facility, a US$225 million three-year revolving
credit facility and US$63 million and £60 million three-year letter of credit facilities; and
• the group’s existing cash resources.
ONSL is an oil and gas exploration and production company active in the UK, with its producing properties located in the UK
Central North Sea. ONSL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oilexco Inc and began operating in the North Sea in 2003. ONSL was
placed into administration by its lending banks on 7 January 2009. Since that date, ONSL’s Administrators, Ernst & Young, have
continued to operate the business, which has continued to generate positive current cash flow from ongoing operations. ONSL’s
total production in the year ended 31 December 2008 was approximately 15,500 boepd. As at 31 December 2008 ONSL had
total 2P reserves and contingent resources of approximately 60 mmboe, of which 40 mmboe were bookable as 2P reserves by
the group.

1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been prepared
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the
preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered
fund. The scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997. The
company accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and
losses on settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the
benefits have vested. If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits adjacent
to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair values and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the Projected Unit
Credit Method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent
currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The resulting defined
benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates
of exchange prevailing at the year-end. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of
the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement
No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 – ‘Cash Flow Statements’ as the cash flows of the company
have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions
The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 – ‘Related Party Disclosures’ with regard to the non-
disclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments
The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 – ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions,
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-
based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the binomial model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised as the current fair value determined at each
balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments. 81
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Sales revenue
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to
receive more tax, with the following exceptions:
• provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates
and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable; and
• deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fixed assets
Oil and gas assets
(a) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of
developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and
decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production
method by reference to the ratio of production in the period and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into
account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(b) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying amount is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the
present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash
generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may
be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
(c) Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full at the commencement of oil and gas production. The amount recognised
is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. A corresponding tangible fixed asset is also created at an amount
equal to the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities. Any change
in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the fixed asset.
Stock and underlift
Non-production related stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Under and overlifts of crude oil are
recorded at market value. 82

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) //

1 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The company accounts for derivative financial instruments in line with FRS 25 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation’ and FRS 26 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
The company uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to oil price fluctuations. All derivatives are
initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value. All changes in fair value
are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated
transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such
as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
2 Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account
for the year. Premier Oil plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 of US$87.0 million (2007: profit of
US$74.2 million).
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the company was US$10,000 (2007: US$10,000).

Amortisation and depreciation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and
gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves at the end of the period plus
production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying
assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently
uncertain. Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates
against those of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered
from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life. 83

The company currently operates an Asset and Equity Plan to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the
business and the market value of the company over a three-year period. Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 11.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK oil and gas interests,
which are expected to be incurred between 2009 and 2017. These provisions have been created based on Premier’s internal
estimates and, where available, operator’s estimates. Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been
made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These estimates are
reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs
will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market
conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to
produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan
(the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997
and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the payment
of contributions to separately administered trust funds. As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service
costs of the Scheme under the FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’ valuation will increase as the members approach retirement. 85
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
9 Pension liability (continued)
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The most recent formal
valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the
principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases: 3.4
per cent pa. The market value of the Scheme’s assets was £14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted,
the assets covered 91 per cent of the members’ accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries. Until October 2008,
the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with an additional £28,000
paid per month. In October a new Schedule of Contributions was put in place. At this point the employer paid a one-off lump
sum contribution of £1.3 million and started to contribute at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries with no additional
monthly amounts. The employer expects to contribute £95,000 to the Scheme in 2009.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’ (incorporating the amendment
announced in December 2006) by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2008 but
taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2009. The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured
using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were:
Rate of investment return: 5.9% pa
Rate of salary increases: 5.4% pa
Rate of pension increases: 3.4% pa

Unfunded pensions
In addition, the company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases
and a reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2008 of the
future payments projected to be made in respect of unfunded pensions is US$0.8 million (2007: US$1.1 million). A total gain
of US$0.3 million (2007: loss of US$0.1 million) was recognised directly in equity during the year.
10 Capital commitments and guarantees
At 31 December 2008 the company had commitments for performance guarantees totalling US$nil (2007: US$4.6 million), US$0.1
million as retainer fees for its alliance partners (2007: US$0.1 million), and customs guarantees of US$0.3 million (2007: US$0.4 million).
The company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, has jointly guaranteed the group’s borrowing facilities of
US$275 million and £53 million, maturing on 31 July 2010.

At the AGM of the company held on 6 June 2008, the company’s authorised share capital was increased by £0.525 by the
creation of three Non-Voting Convertible Shares of 17.5 pence each. Following the increase in share capital the 9,487,320
authorised but unissued Non-Voting Convertible Shares of 17.5 pence each were consolidated and redesignated as 3,320,562
Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each in the capital of the company, carrying the rights and being subject to the restrictions set
out in the Articles of Association of the company.
Share-based payments
Shares issued relate to the company’s share option plans. There has been no new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and
Equity Plan.
Share option plans
The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the company’s shares have been granted to
certain executives and employees. Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will
lapse on their tenth anniversary. Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the
scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years,
after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares. If an employee agrees
to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares
(Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis. 88

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £2.15. The options
outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of £4.69 and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 2.6 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The company recognised a cost of US$20.1 million and US$7.8 million related to equity-settled share-based payment
transactions in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan
The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market
value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools – an equity bonus pool and an
asset bonus pool. The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company
over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share
of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 29.0% to 31.5%
Risk free rate of interest: 4.1% to 4.9%
Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0%
For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the
final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$12.8 million (2007:
US$10.4 million) with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$9.5 million (2007: US$12.3 million). A credit of US$20.1 million has
been recorded in equity (2007: US$7.8 million) for all equity-settled payments for the company and its subsidiaries. Like other elements of
remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various
entities within the Premier Oil group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged
to the profit and loss account as exploration expense, operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Ordinary Shares
The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows:
Dividend rights
The rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital
On a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares) the rights of
the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution shall rank
pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights
The holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company. 89

15 Financial instruments
Hedging instruments
Oil production
a) Production from 2009 to 2012 is now 60 per cent hedged. For the years 2009 and 2012 production is now hedged with an
average floor of US$39.3/bbl and a cap of US$100.0/bbl.
b) At the end of 2007 an off-take agreement was agreed in which the parameters of the above hedges were embedded. This
agreement is for four and a half years effective from 1 July 2008 and replaces the financially-settled hedges for that period.
c) A further option agreement which has the effect of closing out the floor and cap in the original financially-settled hedges
previously in place.
d) The value at 31 December 2008 of the option agreement totalling US$33.6 million (2007: US$37.9 million) represents
deferred income which will be amortised over the life of the off-take agreement.
The company entered into an intra-group hedging arrangement with Premier Oil Holdings Ltd under which a proportion of the
overall benefit and obligation of these hedging arrangements were transferred to the company as a hedge against a proportion
of its future oil production. These instruments are accounted for as hedges.
The fair value of the above oil hedges is a liability of US$2.3 million which is recognised in the balance sheet in other creditors.
While the above hedges were assumed to be effective, all the movements, considered non-intrinsic, in the fair values have been
recognised in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of the above hedges has been determined from the bank counterparties with whom the hedges have been
concluded.
Financial assets and liabilities
The carrying value of the company’s financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value.
16 Subsequent events
Acquisition
The group has reached a conditional agreement on 25 March 2009 with Oilexco Incorporated, Oilexco North Sea Ltd (ONSL)
and its Administrators to acquire either:
(i) ONSL’s entire issued share capital; or
(ii) the principal operating assets of ONSL and Oilexco North Sea Exploration Ltd for a maximum consideration of
approximately US$505 million.
The group proposes to fund the acquisition and associated costs by way of:
• a 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares at a price of 485 pence per share to raise gross proceeds of approximately
£171 million;
• new credit facilities comprising a US$175 million 18-month acquisition bridge facility, a US$225 million three-year revolving
credit facility and US$63 million and £60 million three-year letter of credit facilities; and
• the group’s existing cash resources.
ONSL is an oil and gas exploration and production company active in the UK, with its producing properties located in the UK
Central North Sea. ONSL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oilexco Inc and began operating in the North Sea in 2003. ONSL was
placed into administration by its lending banks on 7 January 2009. Since that date, ONSL’s Administrators, Ernst & Young, have
continued to operate the business, which has continued to generate positive current cash flow from ongoing operations. ONSL’s
total production in the year ended 31 December 2008 was approximately 15,500 boepd. As at 31 December 2008 ONSL had
total 2P reserves and contingent resources of approximately 60 mmboe, of which 40 mmboe were bookable as 2P reserves by
the group.
